the large number of diverse cell types in the brain. To address this complexity issue, we used an annotation-free computational method to analyze and compare the AS profiles between small specific groups of <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian neurons. The method, the Junction Usage Model (JUM), allows the comprehensive profiling of both known and novel AS events from specific RNA-seq libraries. The results show that many diverse and novel pre-mRNA isoforms are preferentially expressed in one class of clock neuron and also absent from the more standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> head RNA preparation. These AS events are enriched in potassium channels important for neuronal firing, and there are also cycling isoforms with no detectable underlying transcriptional oscillations. The results suggest massive AS regulation in the brain that is also likely important for circadian regulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35618.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The life of nearly all creatures on Earth follows the rhythm of day and night. For example, in fruit flies, darkness and light dictate when the insects feed, rest, move or mate. This is possible thanks to the circadian clock, an internal program which is synchronized with the environment to tell cells in the body when to perform certain roles.</p><p>In fruit flies, the structure that keeps the body clock ticking is formed of about 150 ‘circadian neurons’, which are divided into several subgroups. In these cells, a complex genetic programis at work, with networks of genes being ‘switched on’ in a cyclical way. To understand how this program works, scientists need to know which genes are turned on and when, as well as which proteins are created based on the information contained in these genes.</p><p>This can be difficult because one gene does not necessarily code for only one protein. Indeed, when a gene is turned on, it gets copied into a pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA), which is formed of several modules. The pre-mRNA can then go through a process called alternative splicing that shuffles or removes the different modules. This means that one gene can give rise to different pre-mRNA molecules that will each serve as a template to build a distinct protein. Until now, there have been few studies that examine the different types of pre-mRNAs found in circadian neurons, and how these change with the time of day.</p><p>Here, Wang, Abruzzi et al. extract three subgroups of circadian neurons, and one subgroup of non-circadian neurons, from the brain of fruit flies. The pre-mRNAs are isolated, and then a new computational method, called JUM, identifies, counts and categorizes the pre-mRNA molecules in the different groups of neurons.</p><p>This analysis reveals hundreds of previously unknown pre-mRNA molecules, many of which differed extensively between the types of brain cells. When comparing circadian and non-circadian neurons, Wang, Abruzzi et al. show that the circadian cells had more pre-mRNAs that code for proteins that help the cell communicate with other neurons. Finally, many genes in the circadian neurons use alternative splicing to turn on different types of pre-mRNA molecules at different times of the day in a cyclical way; this suggests that these pre-mRNAs might be participating in the genetic circadian program.</p><p>Many human disorders, such as certain forms of insomnia, emerge when the circadian clock is thrown off balance. The results reported by Wang, Abruzzi et al. show that alternative splicing may be an overlooked mechanism that shapes this complex program.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>pre-mRNA alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>circadian neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000997</institution-id><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Qingqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosbash</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM097352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rio</surname><given-names>Donald C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rio</surname><given-names>Donald C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH P50102706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rio</surname><given-names>Donald C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Diverse and widespread novel alternative pre-mRNA splicing isoforms as well as cycling alternative splicing events that undergo time-of-day dependent changes are identified in isolated <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuron groups.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organisms ranging from cyanobacteria to mammals contain circadian clocks that synchronize physiology and behavior to time-of-day environmental cues, such as light and temperature. The fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila,</italic> is no exception and exhibits robust circadian clocks that control a diverse range of behaviors such as activity, sleep, mating and feeding. The core molecular machinery of the circadian clock is a set of transcription factors that act together to drive cycling or time-of-day dependent transcription of at least 20% of genes in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abruzzi et al., 2011</xref>). The heterodimeric transcription factor CLOCK/CYCLE (CLK/CYC) binds to the promoters of many direct target genes and activates their transcription late in the day. Two of these direct target genes, <italic>Timeless</italic> (<italic>Tim</italic>) and <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per</italic>), encode transcriptional repressors that re-enter the nucleus in the late night and act as part of a negative feedback loop to turn off CLK/CYC transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edery et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Naidoo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sehgal et al., 1994</xref>). In the early morning, the photoreceptor, Cryptochrome (CRY) and the kinase, Doubletime (Dbt) contribute to the degradation of Tim/Per (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kloss et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emery et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stanewsky et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ceriani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunter-Ensor et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Syed et al., 2011</xref>). Without these repressors, CLK/CYC-mediated transcription begins again restarting the daily cycle of transcription.</p><p>In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, this molecular clock resides in a neural network of ~150 neurons. These neurons are divided into seven subgroups including three groups of dorsal neurons (DNs; DN1, DN2, and DN3), three groups of lateral neurons (ventral and dorsal lateral neurons; large and small LNvs and LNds, respectively) and the lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) with discrete behavior functions; reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peschel and Helfrich-Förster, 2011</xref>). These neurons make up a small portion of the Drosophila brain (~0.1%) and head (~0.05%). As a result, it is difficult to profile these specialized neurons as part of studies that focus on Drosophila brain and head tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To learn more about the function of these neurons within the circadian neuronal circuit, three subgroups (DN1s, LNds, and LNvs) of these neurons as well as one non-circadian outgroup (Dopaminergic or tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) expressing neurons) were labeled with GFP using neuron-specific drivers and manually isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abruzzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abruzzi et al., 2017</xref>). Illumina RNA-seq datasets from these neurons were analyzed to examine the global mRNA landscape at the transcription level. This analysis revealed many cycling transcripts whose abundance changes with time of day that were not identified in previous studies of brain or head tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald and Rosbash, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claridge-Chang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wijnen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, many neuron-specific transcripts including novel circadian neuropeptides were revealed.</p><p>Besides transcriptional level gene regulation, post-transcriptional level regulation, such as alternative pre-mRNA splicing, is also known to be essential for the normal functioning of the nervous system. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) is a major gene regulatory mechanism that enables a single gene locus to produce populations of often functionally distinct mRNAs in a tissue- or cell-type-specific manner, greatly diversifying the metazoan transcriptome. The nervous system is well recognized to exhibit extraordinarily complex and diverse AS patterns in a variety of metazoan organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, these diversified AS patterns have been shown to play important roles in modulating numerous neuronal states and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vuong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Norris and Calarco, 2012</xref>). For example, many neuronal receptors such as the NMDA receptors undergo AS that results in functionally distinct proteins that are regulated in different ways to directly affect neuronal membrane depolarization and action-potential firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandrasekar, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Recent findings reported several cases where AS is involved in the modulation of the circadian clock in plants, mice and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanchez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petrillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGlincy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Preußner et al., 2014</xref>). However, a comprehensive understanding of AS profiles and their role in circadian clock regulation remains largely unexplored. As most studies profiling the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuronal transcriptome originate from head samples, it has been difficult to detect cycling of alternatively spliced transcripts because heterogeneous tissues can often mask cell-type specific transcript cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kula-Eversole et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nagoshi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abruzzi et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, currently most AS analysis software for short-read Illumina RNA-seq data depend on pre-annotated libraries of known spliced transcripts, making it difficult to detect and quantitate novel neuronal AS events that prevail in neuronal tissues.</p><p>Here, we have comprehensively analyzed the global AS profiles in the transcriptomes of manually dissected DN1, LNd, and LNv circadian neurons, as well as the non-circadian, TH control neurons described above, using a new computational tool called JUM (the Junction Usage Model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang and Rio, 2017a</xref>). JUM is able to identify, quantitate and categorize tissue-specific AS patterns from RNA-seq datasets without the need for or use of prior genome or transcriptome annotations. Using JUM, we identify hundreds of previously unannotated pre-mRNA isoforms. They differ extensively among the four neuronal subgroups and were totally missed when RNA-seq data from the heterogeneous fly head sample was analyzed using identical methods. Gene ontology analysis of differentially spliced mRNAs in circadian neurons versus non-circadian neurons revealed that they are enriched for transcripts encoding potassium channels, a hallmark of neuronal excitability. In addition, we discovered many new alternatively spliced variants and cycling AS patterns in transcripts encoding proteins of the molecular clock including the photoreceptor Cryptochrome and the kinase Shaggy. Importantly, we also identified a large set of transcripts that exhibit cycling patterns of alternative splicing throughout the day-night cycle, potentially contributing to the normal functioning of the circadian clock. This study highlights and reinforces the idea that post-transcriptional processes like AS impact cell type specification, diversity and function in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>There are many novel AS patterns in neuron subpopulations</title><p>To investigate how AS regulation differs with circadian neuron identity and function, we compared the pre-mRNA splicing profiles from three small groups of circadian neurons, the DN1s, LNds and LNvs, as well as from a non-circadian outgroup, the dopaminergic or tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing (TH) neurons. Total RNA and then mRNA from ~100 manually isolated neurons were purified from entrained flies every four hours across two days (12 samples for each group). A mixture of oligo-dT and random-primed cDNA was used to create RNA-seq libraries from each sample, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abruzzi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To profile the AS patterns from each neuron group, we first collapsed the time-series RNA-seq data for each neuron group into two pooled datasets, one for each day, and compared the profiles of alternatively spliced junctions using JUM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang and Rio, 2017a</xref>). We chose the JUM software because of its unique ability to identify, categorize and quantitate global splicing patterns without any <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of, or need for, a genome or transcriptome annotation. Since neurons often exhibit exceptionally diverse AS patterns that are not documented in current transcriptome annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015</xref>), JUM allows for the discovery of novel and unannotated splicing events and patterns. JUM exclusively utilizes RNA-seq reads that map to splice junctions for AS analysis and defines alternatively spliced junctions (AS junctions) as splice junctions that have alternative 5’ - or 3’- splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; left panel).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35618.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Many novel alternatively spliced junctions were identified in isolated <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons.</title><p>Alternatively spliced junctions (AS junctions) were identified in RNA-seq libraries generated from isolated <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons (DN1s, LNds, LNvs, and dopaminergic (TH)) as well as from a separately prepared heterogeneous <italic>Drosophila</italic> whole head sample. (<bold>A</bold>) Pictorial representation of the Junction Usage Model (JUM), using a cassette exon AS pattern as an example. AS junctions are identified in RNA-seq data from reads that have alternative 5’- or 3’- splice sites.

The usage of each sub-AS-junction, that is the relative abundance of that sub-AS-junction compared to the other AS junctions in the same AS structure is calculated and can be compared across different conditions for differential AS analysis. AS structures are then assembled into conventionally recognized AS patterns based on the unique topological feature of the splice graph representing each pattern.

To do this, JUM grouped all identified AS junctions into the basic AS quantitation unit called AS structures, which are a set of AS junctions that share the same 5’ splice site or 3’ splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; middle panel). Each AS junction within an AS structure is defined as a sub-AS-junction of the corresponding AS structure. JUM then quantifies the ‘usage’ of each sub-AS-junction in every AS structure, that is the relative abundance of each sub-AS-junction in the AS structure and identifies AS structures whose usage of sub-AS-junctions are significantly different between the circadian and non-circadian neuron groups. Finally, JUM faithfully assembles the AS structures into the conventionally recognized AS patterns (cassette exon - SE, alternative 5’ or 3’ splice site – A5SS/A3SS, mutually exclusive exons - MXE, and intron retention - IR) based on the unique topological features of each pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; right panel) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang and Rio, 2017a</xref>). While our first analysis identified ‘all or none’ neuronal group-specific splice junction usage, this approach allows for the identification of differential splice junction usage in which AS junctions are present in both neuronal subgroups but used at significantly different frequencies.</p><p>Using this method, we found 249, 194 and 70 AS events that are significantly differentially spliced in the DN1, LNv and LNd neurons compared to the TH neurons, respectively, which cover all five conventionally classified AS patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">3</xref>). To test whether the differentially spliced AS events identified are specific to a particular group of neurons, we examined the overlap of the differentially spliced AS events in each neuronal subgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, top right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Remarkably, the majority of the differentially spliced AS events in DN1, LNv or LNd neurons, compared to TH neurons, are unique to each of the circadian neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Only approximately 1.6–6.6% (9-36) of these differentially spliced AS events were found to overlap between 2 of the three circadian neuronal subgroups, which is significantly lower than expected (Hypergeometric Test; p value = 2.38e-07 for DN1/TH and LNd/TH; p value = 3.68e-39 for DN1/TH and LNv/TH; p value = 1.7e-04 for LNd/TH and LNv/TH).

Three of these eight genes are involved in regulating neuronal plasticity, remodeling and synaptic transmission (<italic>Pten</italic>, <italic>Sap47</italic>, <italic>Rim</italic>). This result suggests that each circadian neuronal subgroup possesses a unique pattern of AS isoforms that contribute to the identity of each distinct neuronal group (see Discussion).

Importantly, 85% of the transcripts that exhibit time-dependent changes in alternative splicing do not cycle at the total mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; RPKM based on ESAT quantification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Derr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abruzzi et al., 2017</xref>]). The non-circadian TH neurons serve as a negative control for this analysis (only 11 cycling AS structures) because they have very few cycling mRNAs and probably do not express the clock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abruzzi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35618.023</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Identification of cycling alternative splicing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> circadian neurons.</title><p>To identify cycling time-of-day changes in alternative splicing, the frequency at which each sub-AS-junction is utilized in every profiled AS structure was examined across six timepoints taken at four hour intervals throughout the day.

Some of this specificity is because certain AS structures are only found in one subgroup of circadian neurons (~40% in DN1, 14% in LNd and 25% in LNv). Moreover, only two transcripts show cycling alternative splicing in all three groups of circadian neurons: <italic>still life</italic> (<italic>sif</italic>) that regulates synaptic differentiation and the type II Camp-dependent protein kinase, <italic>pKa-R1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This striking specificity suggests that time-of-day changes in alternative pre-mRNA splicing acts as an additional and previously unappreciated level of circadian regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock neurons, as previously suggested in mammals based on microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGlincy et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>One striking example of a cycling AS structure is a transcript isoform encoding circadian kinase, Shaggy (from the fly gene <italic>sgg</italic>; known in mammals as GSK3). Alternative splicing of the <italic>sgg</italic> transcript is due to the use of two different 3’- splice sites generating distinct transcript and protein isoforms differing at the C terminus: a shorter isoform utilizing terminal Exon b and a longer isoform utilizing terminal Exon a that includes a specific additional 63 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; marked by ‘*’ and ‘**’, respectively). In LNv and DN1 neurons, the longer <italic>sgg</italic> isoform is almost exclusively used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, in LNd neurons, the longer isoform is utilized almost exclusively in the morning (ZT0-ZT11) and then by late night (ZT18-24) there is approximately equal usage of the long and short <italic>sgg</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; two replicates quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, red line and circle).</p><p>The potassium channel SLOWPOKE is encoded by the <italic>Slo</italic> gene and also undergoes neuron-specific AS cycling. There are two mutually exclusively used exons in the second alternatively spliced exonic regions in the <italic>Slo</italic> transcript: exon 2a and exon 2b that alter the cytosolic face of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, marked by ‘*’ and ‘**’, respectively). In DN1 neurons only, exon 2b is included in the mornings and then there is a shift toward exon 2a inclusion in the late nighttime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). SLOWPOKE has been shown to affect circadian behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ceriani et al., 2002</xref>), and its mammalian homolog, Kcnma1, shows similar phenotypes in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meredith et al., 2006</xref>). It is possible that the different protein isoforms created by time-of-day changes in alternative splicing mRNA isoforms are important for these functions (see Discussion).</p><p>To explore how cycling AS could impact neuronal functions, we performed gene ontology analysis on transcripts undergo cycling AS in the circadian neurons. Interestingly, modulation of locomotor behavior is enriched for cycling AS transcripts in all three circadian neuron groups, although a distinct group of transcripts is implicated in each circadian neuronal group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In LNvs and LNds neurons, the most significantly enriched GO term for cycling AS transcripts is male courtship behavior and olfactory learning, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In DN1 neurons, the top enriched GO term for cycling AS transcripts is mRNA binding proteins and 8 out of the 12 genes in this category encode alternative splicing regulators. The cycling AS of these splicing regulators could further facilitate downstream time of day-dependent changes in global splicing profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Previous analysis of mRNA expression cycling in the circadian neurons revealed that mRNAs cycle with distinct phases in each subgroup of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abruzzi et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the phases of the cycling AS structures also show neuron-group specific distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; blue). Most interesting were the DN1 neurons in which the majority of the time-of-day-dependent cycling AS structures peak in the late night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; blue). This peak is almost anti-phase to that of DN1 mRNA cycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, red). In contrast, mRNA cycling and AS cycling show similar phases in the LNv neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

None of the identified RBP mRNAs cycle in more than one circadian neuron subgroup. Although there was no clear global correlation between the phases of these RBP mRNAs and cycling AS in any neuronal group, we did identify a cycling splicing factor in LNds, Qkr54B, that has been shown to target Sgg transcripts (Stoiber et al., 2015). Interestingly, Qkr54B mRNA peaks 3–4 hr prior to the time of day dependent inclusion of the alternative spliced <italic>Sgg</italic> terminal Exon b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; green line and triangle), suggesting that cycling RBP expression might contribute to the cycling AS patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Tissues of the nervous and germline systems, such as brain, testes and ovaries, have more complex transcriptomes than other cell types due to extensive alternative pre-mRNA splicing or AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pan et al., 2008</xref>). The nervous system especially exhibits vast numbers of AS isoforms, many of which are novel and are only beginning to be comprehensively identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>). This increase in transcript isoform complexity likely contributes to the specification and functional diversity of cell types within the nervous system.</p><p>Here, we have applied a novel computational algorithm called JUM to characterize the transcript isoform diversity generated by alternative splicing in three circadian neuronal subtypes (LNv, LNd and DN1), as well as a non-circadian dopaminergic neuron population (TH neurons) of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system. JUM can comprehensively analyze, quantitate and compare tissue- or cell-type-specific AS patterns without requiring a priori annotations of known transcripts or transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang and Rio, 2017a</xref>). Our analysis revealed a previously unappreciated diversity and complexity of alternatively spliced transcript isoform patterns in these four neuronal subtypes, suggesting that they contribute to neuronal identity, connectivity, activity and circadian functions. This is because many of these novel, previously undetected and unannotated isoforms were unique to a given neuronal population and occurred in transcripts from genes implicated in neuronal activity or circadian rhythms.</p><p>For example, the kinase Shaggy and the blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome play central roles in circadian clock regulation and have novel AS patterns in discrete subsets of the circadian neurons. In addition, nine different transcripts involved in potassium transport undergo differential AS in circadian neurons compared to non-circadian neurons. These transcripts encode six different potassium channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Many of these genes have a complex organization known to encode populations of functionally distinct proteins isoforms, which change the activation kinetics as well as calcium sensitivity of the channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2011</xref>). Neuronal firing is known to play a key role in the circadian circuit with recent studies illustrating that different subgroups of circadian neurons have characteristic time-of-day neuronal firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flourakis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Although it is not yet fully understood which potassium channels play a critical role in each circadian neuron subgroup, several channel pre-mRNAs that undergo differential splicing in circadian neurons impact circadian behavior and sleep, such as slowpoke (Slo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaramillo et al., 2004</xref>]), Shaker (Sh; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cirelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pimentel et al., 2016</xref>]) and Hyperkinetic (Hk; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fogle et al., 2015</xref>]). It is therefore likely that AS adds diversity and distinct physiological properties to these protein isoforms, which then impacts neuron-specific firing patterns. From a more general perspective, AS augments transcriptional regulation in giving different circadian neurons individual identities and distinct functions.</p><p>Approximately 5% of the AS events identified in circadian neurons also undergo time-of-day dependent changes in alternative splicing (cycling splicing). It is important to note that all our experiments were conducted under 12 hr of light and 12 hr of dark conditions, making it impossible to distinguish between light and clock control. Nonetheless, these data indicate that splicing adds a dramatic layer of gene regulation to diurnal changes in gene expression. Moreover, many of the cycling AS transcripts show constant overall mRNA levels, which suggests the existence of neuron-specific splicing factors that are expressed or activated only at specific times of the day. Indeed, we have identified several candidate cycling neuron-enriched transcripts that encode RBPs that may help to drive cycling AS patterns.</p><p>A recent trend in biological research is to generate transcriptome profiles from single cells. For example, this strategy is part of the ‘human cell atlas’ project aimed at personalized genomic medicine or the ‘brain initiative’ project to generate profiles of all neurons in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgenson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Regev et al., 2017</xref>). One recent study was able to obtain about 20M sequence reads per isolated human iPS cell but only managed to analyze splicing patterns for the most highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2017</xref>). Our study in contrast used ~100 isolated <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons for each of the four neuron subtypes along with judicious use of both oligo-dT and random hexamer priming of the cDNA libraries. This strategy obtained about 10–30M sequence reads for each sample, including substantial information from the 5’ ends of transcripts, and JUM was able to detect and classify a large number of previously unannotated pre-mRNA isoforms. Many of them are missing from our fly head RNA-seq data assayed and analyzed in parallel, indicating that these new isoforms are cell-type specific. Not surprisingly, the novel isoforms from the three circadian neuron groups fall into many gene ontology (GO) categories associated with specific circadian clock activity and function.</p><p>Taken together, the work presented here indicates that the number of alternative splicing events that take place in neuronal tissues is grossly underestimated, even though publically-funded genome projects, such as the NIH modENCODE projects deeply sequenced transcriptomes from a variety of Drosophila tissues and developmental stages. This is despite the appreciation of how much AS occurs in the nervous system, for example recent comprehensive analysis of splicing patterns through deep sequencing of ~50 mouse and human tissues revealed about 2500 neuronally-regulated alternative splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Irimia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore suggest that these events will need to be comprehensively evaluated by much deeper sequencing than is currently afforded by most contemporary single cell RNA-seq studies and by AS analysis software like JUM that is not constrained by a priori knowledge of known splicing events.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">RNA-seq data</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abruzzi et al., 2017</xref>)</td><td valign="top">GSE77451</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">RNA-seq data</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2016</xref>)</td><td valign="top">GSE79916</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Morpheus</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">BoxPlotR</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spitzer et al., 2014</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/">http://shiny.chemgrid.org/boxplotr/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">STAR 2.5.3a</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR">https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Samtools 1.4.1</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li, 2011</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net/">http://samtools.sourceforge.net/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Bedtools 2.26.0</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">http://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">JUM 1.3.7</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Rio, 2017b</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/qqwang-berkeley/JUM">https://github.com/qqwang-berkeley/JUM</ext-link> <break/>(copy archived at <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/JUM">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/JUM</ext-link>)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">ImageJ 1.50i</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">David Bioinformatics <break/>Resources 6.8</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2009b</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">IGV 2.3.91</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>; <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thorvaldsdóttir et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/">http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Neuron dissection, RNA extraction and RNA-seq library preparation</title><p>Neuron dissection, RNA extraction and library preparation were performed as described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abruzzi et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RNA-seq data mapping for JUM</title><p>The sequencing data used in this study is publically-available at Gene Expression Omnibus (Accession numbers GSE77451 (neurons) and GSE79916 (heads)).

The usage of each sub-AS-junction in every AS structure was calculated and AS structures with significantly differentially ‘used’ sub-AS-junctions between each of the circadian neuron subtypes and the non-circadian neuron subtype were profiled as specified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang and Rio, 2017a</xref>). All AS structures were then assembled into the five conventionally recognized AS patterns – cassette exon (SE), alternative 5’/3’ splice sites (A5SS/A3SS), mutually exclusive exons (MXE), and intron retention (IR), as well as a Composite category, which represents inseparable combinations of the conventional AS patterns. Here we are only focusing on AS events in the conventional AS pattern categories. Only AS events that showed more than 10% of change in alternative splicing and had a differential splicing test statistical pvalue <underline>≤</underline> 0.05 were considered significantly differentially spliced AS events.

The relative usage of each sub-AS-junction in every AS structure is calculated, and subject to analysis using fourier analysis (F24; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wijnen et al., 2005</xref>]) and JTK-cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes et al., 2010</xref>). To be considered cycling using fourier transformation the following cutoffs were used: F24 score greater than 0.5, &gt;1.5 fold change in splice junction usage, and the average transcript reads greater than 10 for at least one timepoint in each independent dataset. JTK cycle identified transcripts as cycling that had &gt;1.5 fold change in splice junction usage, the average transcript reads greater than 10 for at least one timepoint in each independent dataset, and a p-value cutoff of less than 0.05. Phase determination was done using fourier transformation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Rosbash lab and the Rio lab for helpful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript from Wang et al., the authors re-analyzed previously published RNA-seq datasets for alternative splicing (AS) patterns comparing three neuronal populations in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> that are critical for circadian rhythms (DN1, LNd, and LNv) with a control group of TH neurons. They have also analyzed these same populations over the course of two days. Overall, this is a coherent paper, applying sophisticated analytical method to high throughput RNA-seq data to uncover the novel findings.</p><p>Using the comprehensive computational method JUM (Junction Usage model) to analyze splicing patterns revealed a striking number of AS junctions in the aforementioned neurons absent from the more standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> head RNA preparation. A significant portion (~15%) of these were exclusive to the individual neuron types and almost entirely were previously unannotated (~95%). Each neuron type was also shown to contain a broad range of unique AS junctions when compared to the TH group, and that these genes could impact neuronal function (ex. N-syb, Shab). GO analysis on the AS genes from the circadian neurons showed globally that these patterns are more prominent in potassium channels, ion exchange pumps (sodium-potassium ATPases), and, more importantly, functions such as vesicle exocytosis that are critical for circadian function. Finally, the authors conducted a 2-day time course dissection of these same neurons every 4 hours and analyzed AS splicing again using JUM. This experiment found unique AS junctions in all circadian neurons that cycled through the day/night; however, the overall level of mRNA from most of these genes did not change, demonstrating that the control of gene function is most likely due to AS rather than transcriptional control.</p><p>There are interesting insights from these experiments into the much greater role of alternative splicing in circadian rhythms, however, there is too much emphasis on JUM, which has already been described elsewhere, in Wang and Rio, 2017. Considering this, the extensive description of the tool, nomenclature, and usage is not necessary and detracts from the biological aspect of the manuscript. That is not to say that JUM is not worth a good amount of emphasis – it is impressive, but a revision is needed to achieve a better balance. Substantial portions of the Results section and relevant Figures (Figure 1A in particular) could be removed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors indicate that they have generated RNA-seq data from individual neuronal populations as described in Abruzzi et al., 2017 but it is not clear if the flies were maintained in 12:12 light:dark or constant darkness during the experiment. This distinction could impact the interpretation of circadian analyses since under 12:12 light:dark many gene expression changes and AS events may be driven by light sensing as opposed to an intrinsic clock.</p><p>2) The authors consistently refer only to the number of AS junction sites, without providing the number of affected genes. While the number of events is of interest because it gives a sense of how pervasive alternative splicing is, it how many genes are affected is necessary to get a sense of the scope and selectivity of this phenomenon. For example, in the Results section the authors explain the AS junctions in two genes, Cry and CG10483, but do not provide a perspective – how many of the genes with these AS structures have functions relevant to the different neurons in this study and of neuronal populations over other cell types?</p><p>3) There were only 10 AS events found in all three groups of neurons (Figure 3B). Was any further analysis done on these? These might be genes that are particularly important as well.</p><p>4) The authors could point out the use of other algorithms to identify AS changes – why rely only on JUM?</p><p>5) A critical point of this study is the identification of &quot;novel&quot; AS junctions. Therefore, it will be important to have some quality control metrics to show the identified junctions are real rather than technical artifacts or alignment errors. It will be helpful to clearly describe parameters related to accuracy of exon junction identification (e.g., size of overlap on each side of the junction), and if possible provide an estimate of accuracy (e.g. using simulated synthetic exon junction reads by swapping 5' and 3' parts).</p><p>6) Related to the point above, it is also important to clearly state the criteria used to define a &quot;novel&quot; AS junction in the main text. As of now, the authors stated in the method section that &quot;The novelty of each AS junction was compared against the library of annotated junctions in the UCSC genome browser transcriptome annotation (genome 422 version: FB2017_05).&quot; It is unclear what type of annotations was used here (e.g., which gene models, does that include EST sequences?)</p><p>7) In subsection “Circadian neurons present specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns”, the authors identified AS junctions differentially spliced in each type of circadian neurons compared to TH neurons. They then examined the overlap of the lists to claim most of these junctions are specifically spliced in one subtype. To be more rigorous, one should perform differential splicing analysis between different types of circadian neurons, as the limited overlap could also be due to limited statistical power.</p><p>Similar issue for comparison of cycling exons in Figure 6B.</p><p>8) While cell type- and time of day-dependent AS patterns are artfully presented here, a major weakness in this manuscript is that the underlying mechanisms driving AS or their consequences on protein expression are not studied. Regarding upstream mechanism, it would help to know if expression of any RNA binding proteins correlate with the observed AS events across cell types or times of day. Regarding the relative impact of AS on neuronal identity and function, a first pass analysis could be to compare the relative numbers and enriched ontologies between mRNA expression and AS differences between cell types and in the circadian data. A more compelling experiment would be to specifically inhibit an AS event within one of the neuronal populations to test its effect on cell function.</p><p>9) One potential concern is the technical/biological variation between replicates, which is expected from the small number of cells used to generate RNA-seq libraries and visible from the examples shown in the figures. It will be helpful to have some data to show the reliability/reproducibility of observed differential splicing (e.g., correlation of splicing pattern of replicates, or even independent RT-PCR validation if possible).</p><p>10) The observation of alternative exons that are differentially spliced in specific types of neurons or time-of-the-day during the circadian clock is very interesting. Is there any indication of corresponding changes in splicing factors that potentially regulate these AS events?</p><p>11) It will be helpful to provide additional functional analysis of identified AS events with differential splicing, in addition to GO. This reviewer understands that detailed functional dissection of specific events might be beyond the scope of this manuscript, but it should be feasible to perform statistical analysis of cross-species conservation, preservation of reading frame, exon size, etc., which is frequently distinct for exons with cell type specific splicing.</p><p>12) In Figure 4B, although the authors claim, &quot;in TH and LNd neurons the Shab transcripts preferentially utilize an alternative terminal exon, […] while in LNv and DN1 neurons, the long Shab isoform that encodes all transmembrane regions is dominant&quot;, it is not intuitively showing that by looking at the Sashimi plots. The authors should order the samples similarly to Figure 4A, and also may better prove their point by grouping the LNv and DN1 samples or highlighting the relevant differences in the figure read numbers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35618.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>[…] There are interesting insights from these experiments into the much greater role of alternative splicing in circadian rhythms, however, there is too much emphasis on JUM, which has already been described elsewhere, in Wang and Rio, 2017.

We have modified the manuscript accordingly and only kept a concise description of the nomenclature of the method for easy reference of the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors indicate that they have generated RNA-seq data from individual neuronal populations as described in Abruzzi et al., 2017 but it is not clear if the flies were maintained in 12:12 light:dark or constant darkness during the experiment. This distinction could impact the interpretation of circadian analyses since under 12:12 light:dark many gene expression changes and AS events may be driven by light sensing as opposed to an intrinsic clock.</p></disp-quote><p>We (Rosbash lab) have been focusing on LD (light-dark) behavior since beginning these experiments with microarrays a decade ago with the first publications in 2010. More relevant of course are the LD data (Abruzzi et al., 2017) on which this analysis is based. So, we are of course constrained without generating this massive amount of data de novo in constant darkness. We took this strategy at the outset, which we still endorse, because fly behavior is richer in LD than in DD, which allows for a more interesting comparison between transcripts, their presence in specific neurons as well as their cycling, and behavior. Because the reviewer is certainly correct, and light is probably germane (light alone or an interaction between light and the clock), we have also avoided the term &quot;circadian&quot; for these transcripts but refer to them as &quot;cycling&quot; or &quot;oscillating&quot; given their once/day or diurnal pattern. Nonetheless, we now clarify this point explicitly in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors consistently refer only to the number of AS junction sites, without providing the number of affected genes.

The number of genes affected has been added to Figure 1B,D and Figure 3A,B. Gene ontology analysis supporting Figure 1 and Figure 6 has been added as Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 3, as well as Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3. Descriptions of these new data have been added to subsection “There are many novel AS patterns in neuron subpopulations”; subsection “Identification of cycling alternatively spliced isoforms in circadian neurons”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There were only 10 AS events found in all three groups of neurons (Figure 3B). Was any further analysis done on these? These might be genes that are particularly important as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We did a detailed analysis of the significantly changed AS events comparing TH neurons to all three groups of circadian neurons. Interestingly, the specific AS changes occur in genes that are functionally enriched in regulating neuronal plasticity, remodeling and synaptic transmission (Pten, PRL-1, Pdp-1, Sap47, Rim, mmd, CG9945 and RpS3A). It is likely that AS serves as an independent layer of gene regulation to affect the diversity of synapses and synaptic plasticity in the circadian neurons. We added the results from this analysis per the reviewer’s request in subsection “Circadian neurons present specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns”. In addition, we made minor revisions to the numbers shown in Figure 3B. The total overlapping differentially spliced AS events from all three groups of circadian neurons versus THs should be 8 instead of 10. Previously some header lines in the gene list files were counted towards the number of genes. These have been corrected, but the conclusions stay the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors could point out the use of other algorithms to identify AS changes – why rely only on JUM?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose the JUM algorithm to analyze the neuronal subpopulation datasets because of JUM’s unique feature for analyzing differential AS patterns completely independent of <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the host transcriptome annotation. It is well known that tissues such as neurons and gonads possess exceptionally diverse and dynamic cellular AS profiles associated with various cellular states and functions, greatly exceeding our current knowledge of the transcriptome annotations, especially in non-human model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Almost all other currently available methods for AS analysis rely on pre-built annotated AS splice junction libraries or transcriptome annotations, which result in vast underestimates of the tissue-specific AS complexity (Wang and Rio, 2017). We have specified the rationale for choosing JUM for AS analysis in subsection “There are many novel AS patterns in neuron subpopulations” in the revised manuscript. We have also explained the rationale and showed the superior performance of JUM on this particular point that the reviewer raised in detail in the preprint of the JUM paper (Wang and Rio, 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A critical point of this study is the identification of &quot;novel&quot; AS junctions. Therefore, it will be important to have some quality control metrics to show the identified junctions are real rather than technical artifacts or alignment errors. It will be helpful to clearly describe parameters related to accuracy of exon junction identification (e.g., size of overlap on each side of the junction), and if possible provide an estimate of accuracy (e.g. using simulated synthetic exon junction reads by swapping 5' and 3' parts).</p></disp-quote><p>JUM accepts output files from the third-party RNA-seq alignment software tool STAR that performs read mapping and AS junction profiling with the following additional filter settings to control for the quality of AS junction detection and quantification: (1) JUM uses the two-pass alignment approach that has been shown to greatly improve novel splice junction quantification (Veeneman et al., 2016); (2) JUM only considers unambiguously mapped reads over splice junctions for junction profiling and quantification; and (3) JUM applies stringent quality filters for AS junctions. An AS junction will be taken for downstream analysis only if it receives more than 10 unambiguously mapped reads in every one of the biological replicates of the sample. These settings make sure that the AS junction analyzed by JUM has been observed consistently and reproducibly from the RNA-seq experiments. The accuracy of JUM-quantified novel AS junctions has also been tested by multiple rounds of qRT-PCR and RT-PCR validation experiments using experimental data from mouse embryonic cortical neurons and male fruit fly heads and the validation rates stay ~100% so far (Wang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2016, Wang and Rio, 2017). In addition, JUM uses STAR as the aligner because STAR is among the best short-read alignment software developed so far for both comprehensiveness and accuracy (Baruzzo et al., 2017, Engstrom et al., 2013) and has been tested in numerous both simulated and experimental datasets on multi aspects of alignment performance. Given the extensive testing of STAR referenced above, estimating the performance of STAR using synthetic RNA-seq reads is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>We have indicated the mapping metrics used in this analysis for the data presented in this manuscript in subsection “RNA-seq data mapping for JUM” in the revised version as follows: “the minimum overhang length for splice junctions on both sides are set to be a default of 30 bp for non-canonical motif junctions, and 12 for the canonical GT/AG (CT/AC), GC/AG (CT/GC), AT/AC (GT/AT) motif junctions, respectively. The minimum uniquely mapped read count per junction is set to be the default 3 for non-canonical motif junctions and 1 for the canonical motif junctions. The minimum allowed distance to other junctions’ donor/acceptor is set to be the default 10 for non-canonical motif junctions and 0, 5, 10 for the canonical GT/AG (CT/AC), GC/AG (CT/GC), AT/AC (GT/AT) motif junctions, respectively. Maximum gap allowed for junctions are set to be follows: junctions supported by 1 read can have gaps &lt;= 50000b; if supported by 2 reads then gaps &lt;= 100000b; if supported by 3 reads then gaps &lt;= 200000; if supported by more than 4 reads then gaps &lt;= alignIntronMax.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Related to the point above, it is also important to clearly state the criteria used to define a &quot;novel&quot; AS junction in the main text. As of now, the authors stated in the method section that &quot;The novelty of each AS junction was compared against the library of annotated junctions in the UCSC genome browser transcriptome annotation (genome 422 version: FB2017_05).&quot; It is unclear what type of annotations was used here (e.g., which gene models, does that include EST sequences?)</p></disp-quote><p>The AS junctions identified in this study were compared to the RefSeq gene transcriptome annotation database and it does not include ESTs. We have specified this in the manuscript, subsection “Profiling of AS junctions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In subsection “Circadian neurons present specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns”, the authors identified AS junctions differentially spliced in each type of circadian neurons compared to TH neurons. They then examined the overlap of the lists to claim most of these junctions are specifically spliced in one subtype. To be more rigorous, one should perform differential splicing analysis between different types of circadian neurons, as the limited overlap could also be due to limited statistical power.</p><p>Similar issue for comparison of cycling exons in Figure 6B.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed differential AS analysis between the circadian neurons DN1, LNd and LNv. We found vastly different AS patterns among each circadian neuron subpopulation – a total of 454, 778, and 325 AS events are significantly differentially spliced between DN1 versus LNd neurons, DN1 versus LNv neurons and LNd versus LNv neurons, respectively. This result supports our findings in Figure 3 and in the main text that each circadian neuron group possesses its own distinct AS profiles. We have added the results from this analysis in subsection “Circadian neurons present specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns” and in Figure 3—figure supplement 2. Furthermore, we have conducted more analyses to explore the potential regulatory mechanisms that contribute to the unique AS profiles in circadian neuron subpopulations (detailed more in our response to #8 below). The limited overlap in differentially spliced AS events compared to TH neurons in the circadian neuron groups could be due to the observation that each circadian neuron group expresses its own unique set of RNA-binding protein/splicing factors compared to TH neurons (results added in Figure 3B). For example, we found that two LNv-specific splicing regulators mub and Syp targets ~36% of the AS events that are specifically differentially spliced in LNv neurons versus TH neurons. We have now included all of these additional results in subsection “Circadian neurons present specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns”. It also needs to be noted that the reason for our approach to first perform differential AS analysis between each circadian neuron subgroup and the non-circadian TH neuron and then examining the overlap of each comparison was because we intended to profile for AS events that specifically affect circadian versus non-circadian functions. A direct comparison among the circadian subpopulations does not provide information that directly leads to our original intention and will also reveal AS events that are specialized in other functions in the circadian neurons.</p><p>Regarding Figure 6B, it is not trivial to compare two sets of 12 timepoint data (2 days 6 timepoints each) and ask whether the cycling tracks from two circadian neuron groups are statistically different from one another, as cycling determination involves multiple parameters including the shape of the curve, period length, amplitude requirements as well as minimum read requirements. However, there are several possible explanations for the neuron-specific cycling alternative splicing. Some of the alternative splicing events that cycle are neuron-specific (~40% in DN1, 14% in LNd and 25% in LNvs), so they not only cycle but are also only found in one subgroup of neurons. A smaller portion of alternative splicing events are present in all neuron groups yet cycle only in 1 (~20% in all neuron groups). In addition, we also found that each circadian neuron subpopulation possesses its own unique profile of cycling RNA-binding proteins/splicing factors that can potentially contribute to the neuron-specific cycling alternative splicing observed (Figure 7B). We have now included these additional results in subsection “Identification of cycling alternatively spliced isoforms in circadian neurons”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) While cell type- and time of day-dependent AS patterns are artfully presented here, a major weakness in this manuscript is that the underlying mechanisms driving AS or their consequences on protein expression are not studied. Regarding upstream mechanism, it would help to know if expression of any RNA binding proteins correlate with the observed AS events across cell types or times of day. Regarding the relative impact of AS on neuronal identity and function, a first pass analysis could be to compare the relative numbers and enriched ontologies between mRNA expression and AS differences between cell types and in the circadian data. A more compelling experiment would be to specifically inhibit an AS event within one of the neuronal populations to test its effect on cell function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that understanding the mechanisms behind neuron group-specific splicing is important and interesting. Inhibition of a particular AS event in one of the neuronal populations would be technically challenging. However, we have addressed this question as the reviewer suggests using a more extensive analysis of the RNA-seq data from the isolated neuronal populations, as well as publicly available databases of the targets of RNA-binding proteins (through CLIP and RIP experiments).</p><p>First, we profiled RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are differentially expressed in each of the circadian neurons compared to the non-circadian TH neurons, respectively (New Figure 3B, and subsection “Circadian neurons present specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns”). Interestingly, each circadian neuronal subpopulation expresses its own unique set of differentially-expressed RBPs compared to TH neurons, with very limited overlap, which is correlated with the observed unique differentially spliced AS patterns in each of the circadian neuronal populations compared to the AS patterns in TH neurons. We further profiled the targets of several of these RBPs using publicly-available data (Stoiber et al., 2015, Hansen et al., 2015) and found that these neuron-specific RBPs potentially target many AS events observed in each circadian neuronal subpopulation versus TH neurons (subsection “Circadian neurons present specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns”). For example, Syb and mub, two RBPs that are specifically differentially-expressed in LNv neurons compared to TH neurons, target 23 and 32 LNv-specific differentially spliced AS events compared to TH neurons, respectively, with 5 overlapped AS events (~36% of total LNv neuron specific differentially spliced AS events). Although not definitive, this analysis supports the possibility that circadian neuron-specific RBP expression could drive the observed circadian neuron-specific AS patterns compared to TH neurons.</p><p>Second, we have performed a similar analysis to identify RBPs involved in splicing that cycles in the circadian neuron subgroups (New Figure 7B and Discussion section). Interestingly, each of the circadian neuron groups have distinct sets of cycling splicing-related transcripts that could contribute to the highly specific cycling splicing patterns observed in each circadian neuron group (Figure 7B). For example, the RNA-binding protein Qkr54B cycles in LNd neurons and one of its reported targets is Sgg (Stoiber et al., 2015), which displays cycling AS also in LNd neurons (Figure 6D). Furthermore, we examined the phase of all cycling AS structures in the three circadian neuron groups. Interestingly, each circadian neuron group exhibits distinct cycling phase patterns (Discussion section). Cycling AS structures in LNd cells peak throughout the day, while both DN1 and LNv cells showed higher levels of cycling AS structures at certain times of the day. DN1 cycling AS structures peak maximal in the late night and LNv cycling AS structure peaks show a bimodal distribution in mid-day and mid-night (Figure 7A and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Moreover, some (but not all) of the cycling splicing factors found in each neuronal group showed a coordinated phase with their targeted cycling AS events. For example, the cycling RBP Qkr54B mRNA peaks 3-4 hours prior to the time of day dependent cycling inclusion of exon b in its targeted AS transcript Sgg (Figure 6D).</p><p>Third, we have compared the enriched gene ontologies between mRNAs and AS events that are differentially expressed or spliced, respectively, in each of the circadian neuron groups versus TH neurons. These comparisons suggest that neuron-specific differences in gene expression and splicing are impacting neuronal identity differently. For example, only one gene ontology category, integral membrane components, is found in common between the differentially spliced AS events and differentially expressed mRNA events in LNv neurons. However, neuropeptide receptors are distinctively enriched in differentially expressed mRNAs while potassium ion channels are distinctively enriched in differentially spliced AS splicing events in LNv neurons.</p><p>Lastly, we have used a similar approach to compare GO terms of neuron-specific cycling mRNAs and cycling AS structures. There is very little overlap between the types of genes that cycle in each of the circadian neuron groups at the mRNA level and at the level of splicing. The one exception is that the GO term chemical synaptic transmission is found in both cycling mRNAs and cycling AS structures in LNd neurons. One interesting observation is that the top enriched GO term for mRNAs that undergo cycling alternative splicing in DN1 neurons are mRNA binding proteins themselves (Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and Supplementary file 3). This list includes 8 known factors that impact splicing and the time-of-day dependent alternative splicing of these transcripts could influence AS profiles in DN1s.</p><p>These results above suggest that the neuronal-specific RBP expression and cycling patterns can be an important factor that drive the circadian neuron-specificAS profiles and cycling observed. That said, many other factors can contribute to the AS changes and patterns observed in each of the neuronal subpopulations. Possible mechanisms include, but not limited to, differential signaling pathway inductions, post-translational modifications and activation of splicing regulators and chromatin modifications. We believe these can be interesting and crucial topics for future studies that beyond the scope of this manuscript. The results above also suggest that AS and transcriptional regulation are two independent layers of gene regulation in specifying neuronal identify and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) One potential concern is the technical/biological variation between replicates, which is expected from the small number of cells used to generate RNA-seq libraries and visible from the examples shown in the figures. It will be helpful to have some data to show the reliability/reproducibility of observed differential splicing (e.g., correlation of splicing pattern of replicates, or even independent RT-PCR validation if possible).</p></disp-quote><p>For software tools like MISO and MATS that can only perform pair-wise comparisons and cannot handle biological replicates, a correlation analysis of splicing patterns from replicates is indeed necessary. However, JUM integrates biological variability from multiple replicates into its core statistical model to make sure that the reported significantly changed AS events are supported by all replicates consistently and reproducibly. JUM achieves this by modeling the reads that map to an AS junction as a negative binomial distribution and fitting a mean-variance function through an inferred dispersion parameter with an empirical Bayesian approach across the observed variability from all replicates. This approach has been described previously, optimized recently and been widely applied in software tools analyzing RNA-seq experiments with replicates, and has been proven to greatly improve the quality of analysis by taking biological replicates into account (Anders et al., 2012, Love et al., 2014, Lu et al., 2005, McCarthy et al., 2012, Robinson et al., 2010, Robinson and Smyth, 2007, Robinson and Smyth, 2008). As a result, the nature of the model design in JUM already takes into account the reliability/reproducibility issues raised here by the reviewer. We also want to point out that we have consistently validated all JUM-reported AS events using multiple rounds of qRT-PCR in mouse embryonic cortical neurons and male fruit fly heads (Wang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2016, Wang and Rio, 2017). This experimental validation further supports the accuracy of JUM’s predictions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The observation of alternative exons that are differentially spliced in specific types of neurons or time-of-the-day during the circadian clock is very interesting. Is there any indication of corresponding changes in splicing factors that potentially regulate these AS events?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this question in detail in our response to #8, above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) It will be helpful to provide additional functional analysis of identified AS events with differential splicing, in addition to GO. This reviewer understands that detailed functional dissection of specific events might be beyond the scope of this manuscript, but it should be feasible to perform statistical analysis of cross-species conservation, preservation of reading frame, exon size, etc., which is frequently distinct for exons with cell type specific splicing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed statistical analyses to compare cross-species conservation and preservation of reading frames in the cassette exons that are alternatively spliced versus the ones that are not alternatively spliced between DN1, LNd and LNv neurons versus the non-circadian TH neurons, respectively. For each comparison of a circadian neuron subpopulation versus TH, we compared the PhastCons conservation score of each identified cassette exon across 27 species of insects and also the size of the cassette exon to see if the alternative inclusion of the cassette exon changes the reading frame of the transcript. We found that neuron-subgroup-specific, alternatively spliced cassette exons are somewhat more conserved (although not statistically significant) and tend to preserve the reading frame of the transcript, indicating these alternatively spliced cassette exons are under more evolutionary selection to preserve their functions, which may be crucial to the identity and function of the neuronal subpopulations. These results are listed in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and subsection “Circadian neurons present specific alternative pre-mRNA splicing patterns” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) In Figure 4B, although the authors claim, &quot;in TH and LNd neurons the Shab transcripts preferentially utilize an alternative terminal exon, […] while in LNv and DN1 neurons, the long Shab isoform that encodes all transmembrane regions is dominant&quot;, it is not intuitively showing that by looking at the Sashimi plots. The authors should order the samples similarly to Figure 4A, and also may better prove their point by grouping the LNv and DN1 samples or highlighting the relevant differences in the figure read numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have highlighted the relevant differences in the figure read numbers in Figure 4B as the reviewer suggested.</p></body></sub-article></article>
