replacing damaged cells through proliferation, but need to rely on buffering mechanisms to prevent tissue disintegration. By constitutively activating the Ras/MAPK-pathway via <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-overexpression in the postmitotic salivary glands (SGs) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, we overrode the glands adaptability to growth signals and induced hypertrophy. The accompanied loss of tissue integrity, recognition by cellular immunity, and cell death are all buffered by blocking stress signaling through a genuine tissue-autonomous immune response. This novel, spatio-temporally tightly regulated mechanism relies on the inhibition of a feedback-loop in the JNK-pathway by the immune effector and antimicrobial peptide Drosomycin. While this interaction might allow growing SGs to cope with temporary stress, continuous Drosomycin expression in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands favors unrestricted hypertrophy. These findings indicate the necessity to refine therapeutic approaches that stimulate immune responses by acknowledging their possible, detrimental effects in damaged or stressed tissues.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tissues and organs work hard to maintain balance in everything from taking up nutrients to controlling their growth. Ageing, wounding, sickness, and changes in the genetic code can all alter this balance, and cause the tissue or organ to lose some of its cells. Many tissues restore this loss by dividing their remaining cells to fill in the gaps. But some – like the salivary glands of fruit fly larvae – have lost this ability.</p><p>Tissues like these rely on being able to sense and counteract problems as they arise so as to not lose their balance in the first place. The immune system and stress responses are crucial for this process. They trigger steps to correct the problem and interact with each other to find a common decision about the fate of the affected tissue. To better understand how the immune system and stress response work together, Krautz, Khalili and Theopold genetically manipulated cells in the salivary gland of fruit fly larvae. These modifications switched on signals that stimulate cells to keep growing, causing the salivary gland’s tissue to slowly lose its balance and trigger the stress and immune response.</p><p>The experiments showed that while the stress response instructed the cells in the gland to die, a peptide released by the immune system called Drosomycin blocked this response and prevented the tissue from collapsing. The cells in the part of the gland not producing this immune peptide were consequently killed by the stress response. When all the cells in the salivary gland were forced to produce Drosomycin, none of the cells died and the whole tissue survived. But it also allowed the cells in the gland to grow uncontrollably, like a tumor, threatening the health of the entire organism.</p><p>Mapping the interactions between immune and stress pathways could help to fine-tune treatments that can prevent tissue damage. Fruit flies share many genetic features and molecular pathways with humans. So, the next step towards these kinds of treatments would be to screen for similar mechanisms that block stress activation in damaged human tissues. But this research carries a warning: careless activation of the immune system to protect stressed tissues could lead to uncontrolled tissue growth, and might cause more harm than good.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>hypertrophy</kwd><kwd>salivary gland</kwd><kwd>Drosomycin</kwd><kwd>JNK</kwd><kwd>dorsal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VR-2010-5988</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theopold</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VR 2016-04077</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theopold</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012538</institution-id><institution>Swedish Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN 2010/553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theopold</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012538</institution-id><institution>Swedish Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN 2013/546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theopold</surname><given-names>Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The immune effector Drosomycin buffers stress signaling in hypertrophic salivary glands to inhibit their disintegration, detection by the cellular immune response, and promotes further overgrowth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Immune and stress responses have evolved to protect the organism from both exogenous and endogenous stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Eming, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rankin and Artis, 2018</xref>). By sensing deviations from homeostasis and inducing compensatory mechanisms, immune and stress responses keep physiological parameters within tolerable limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hoffmann and Parsons, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Vermeulen and Loeschcke, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Heat shock, radiation, starvation, toxic metabolites, hypoxia, or hyperoxia are all well-characterized stressors. They activate stress responses which can ultimately lead to the induction of programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lowe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Loboda et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Keap1-Nrf2-, JNK-, and p38-signaling pathways are crucial for mounting these anti-stress-responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Stronach and Perrimon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Fuse and Kobayashi, 2017</xref>). Immune responses on the other hand, like the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Toll and imd pathways, are typically activated by molecular structures exposed on the surfaces of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Medzhitov and Janeway, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kurata, 2004</xref>). These pathways coordinate the humoral and cellular immune system to eliminate intruding pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Buchon et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Humoral immune responses in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are characterized by the production and secretion of large sets of effector molecules, most notably antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) like Drosomycin (Drs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Imler and Bulet, 2005</xref>). AMPs not only target extrinsic threats in the form of intruding pathogens, but also react to intrinsic stimuli such as tumorigenic transformation with the possibility to induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Araki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Parvy et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains poorly understood whether AMPs also have functions beyond promoting apoptosis when sensing and reacting to accumulating stress such as during wound healing and tumor formation.</p><p>Apart from their described individual roles, immune and stress pathways are proposed to be either induced successively or concomitantly dependent on the level of deviation from homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Chovatiya and Medzhitov, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ammeux et al., 2016</xref>). However, detailed characterization of wound healing and tumor models in <italic>Drosophila</italic> revealed a more complex picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Buchon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, immune and stress responses often neither occur separately, nor do they follow a simple linear cascade, but rather regulate each other via context-dependent mutual crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fogarty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pérez et al., 2017</xref>). One recurring motif throughout most of these models is the central role of the stress-responsive JNK-pathway and its frequent interaction with the Toll and imd immune pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Park et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rämet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Galko and Krasnow, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Uhlirova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Igaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Enomoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andersen et al., 2015</xref>). However, while JNK-signaling can function either in a tumor-promoting, anti-apoptotic or in a tumor-suppressive, pro-apoptotic manner depending on the context, Toll- and imd-signaling have only been shown to display a tumor-suppressing, pro-apoptotic role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Uhlirova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Igaki et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Enomoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Uhlirova and Bohmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Cordero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Vidal, 2010</xref>).</p><p>These tumor-suppressive, pro-apoptotic functions of immune responses have been well characterized and attributed to the secretion of humoral factors or the recruitment of immune cells through the systemic immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Fogarty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Pérez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Babcock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Parisi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hauling et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, during clonal cell competition in imaginal discs, Toll- and imd-signaling were implicated in the elimination of less fit cell clones by inducing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the selective growth disadvantage of these less fit cells is thought to be a response to systemic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Germani et al., 2018</xref>) and it remains an open question whether genuine tissue-autonomous immune responses can contribute to adaptation of growth during wound healing and tumor formation.</p><p>The larval salivary gland (SG) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a powerful system to study adaptive growth control, because growth is not completely predetermined, but modulated by the nutritional status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Smith and Orr-Weaver, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Britton and Edgar, 1998</xref>). In contrast to mitotically active tissues, growth in post-mitotic tissues like the larval SG is based on endoreplication and hypertrophy rather than on cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Edgar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Orr-Weaver, 2015</xref>). Modifying the underlying, tight growth regulation, for instance by continuous growth signaling via constitutively activated Ras/MAPK-signaling can easily lead to the accumulation of oxidative stress and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mason et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bartkova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bartkova et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Di Micco et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shim, 2015</xref>). However, the parameters defining the natural limit of growth adaptation and the buffering mechanisms in place to cope with prolonged or continuous stress remain poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we uncover a genuine tissue-autonomous immune response which directly regulates hypertrophic growth and adaptation to accumulating stress in larval SGs. By overexpressing a dominant-active form of the small GTPase Ras, <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, we induced hypertrophic growth. This activates a tissue-autonomous immune response which allows the hypertrophic gland to cope with the resulting stress through spatio-temporally regulated inhibition of the JNK-mediated stress response. We present evidence that tissue-autonomous expression of the AMP Drosomycin (Drs) is at the core of this inhibition: Drs directly interferes with JNK-signaling and inhibits JNK-dependent programmed cell death. This prevents recognition of the stressed tissue by the cellular immune response and allows survival and unrestricted growth of hypertrophic SGs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Local immune reaction accompanies Ras<sup>V12</sup>-dependent hypertrophy</title><p>In order to identify buffering mechanisms that compensate for continuous stress, we made use of our previously published hypertrophy model in the SGs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hauling et al., 2014</xref>).

Both loss of cell integrity and nuclear disintegration coincided temporarily (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) and were exacerbated upon coexpression of <italic>l(2)gl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). These results confirm our previous findings and demonstrate that continuous growth signaling in larval SGs leads to increased organ size accompanied with additional endocycles at 96 hr AED, both hallmarks of compensatory hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tamori and Deng, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the additional, <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-induced endoreplications without obvious effect on tissue integrity imply an adaptability to excess growth signaling, whereas the subsequent collapse of nuclear integrity and cellular polarity at 120 hr AED delineate its limitations.</p><p>To characterize the mechanisms involved in the early phase of SG growth adaptation at 96 hr AED, we performed total RNA sequencing of complete <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expressing and <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>-control SGs dissected at 96 hr AED prior to cellular and nuclear disintegration. The most significantly upregulated gene in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands compared to their <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>-counterpart was Ras85D itself (q-value = 6.51⋅10<sup>−282</sup>), which validates the experimental set-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The most differentially expressed gene in turn was the AMP Drs, which indicates the activation of a local immune response in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands. To evaluate this further, we employed a GFP reporter for Drs and observed strong induction in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands, but not in any other larval tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,G,I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ferrandon et al., 1998</xref>). At 96 hr AED, the entire secretory epithelium of the SG expressed Drs with a strong tendency for increased induction in the proximal part (PP) closest to the duct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,G</xref>). At 120 hr AED Drs was almost exclusively expressed in the PP, an expression pattern that persisted until <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expressing larvae belatedly puparate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,G,I</xref>). To rule out artifacts derived from driver related unequal expression across the SG epithelium, we measured <italic>Bx<sup>MS1096</sup></italic>-driven RFP-expression across the longitudinal gland axis at 96 hr and 120 hr AED and normalized the acquired signal with driver-independent Phalloidin-fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). The average Drs-reporter signal already peaks at 96 hr AED in the middle of the gland epithelium, while <italic>Bx<sup>MS1096</sup></italic>-driven expression increases further until 120 hr AED. Hence, while <italic>Bx<sup>MS1096</sup></italic>-driven expression of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> is crucial for activating Drs-expression, both are not qualitatively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). In order to assess whether hemocytes were recruited as part of a parallel, cellular immune response, we stained glands with an antibody against the pan-hemocyte-marker Hemese. While <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands were completely devoid of hemocytes at 96 hr AED, at 120 hr AED they were recruited to the gland surface. However, hemocyte attachment was restricted to the distal, non-Drs expressing part (DP), rendering Drs expression and hemocyte attachment across the gland epithelium mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Coexpression of <italic>l(2)gl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> elevated the level of recruited hemocytes at 120 hr AED and pre-empted this recruitment to the DP already at 96 hr AED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated whether the change in nuclear volume as a marker for growth adaptation follows a similar proximal-distal-divide as Drs-expression and hemocyte attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Nuclei in the DP of the SG at 96 hr AED showed a moderate volume increase upon <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expression compared to distal <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>-control nuclei. However, after 120 hr AED distal nuclei had undergone a drastic increase in nuclear volume (6.28 fold compared to distal <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>-control nuclei) while nuclei in the PP of the SG displayed only a moderate increase in size compared to <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>-control nuclei, that did not increase over time. This indicates that nuclei in the DP of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands undergo more rounds of endoreplication than their proximal counterparts coinciding with the decline of Drs-expression and an increase in hemocyte attachment in this part. Moreover, this difference also explains the marginal reduction in <italic>Bx<sup>MS1096</sup></italic>-driven expression from DP to PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; PP shows 86% of DP-expression level).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dorsal-dependent Drs expression is part of a genuine tissue-autonomous immune response</title><p>As barrier epithelia, the lumen of the SG forms part of a continuum with the exterior, exposing them to extrinsic stimuli including nutritional cues and pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Andrew et al., 2000</xref>).

However, RNAi-lines directed against Caudal or its canonical interaction partner, Drifter (dfr / vvl), did not reduce Drs expression in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands indicating that the regulation of Drs expression as part of the tissue-autonomous immune response is clearly different from its counterpart in the adult SG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Junell et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In order to evaluate whether either Toll- or – as is the case for local infections – imd-signaling plays a role in Drs expression, we used the reproducible fluorescence pattern of the Drs-GFP reporter at 96 hr AED to assay RNAi-lines directed against canonical components of both pathways in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’ for scored phenotypes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ferrandon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tzou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Takehana et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wagner et al., 2009</xref>).

Moreover, at 96 hr AED dl was present in the entire secretory epithelium of both <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>-control glands.

Furthermore, both SG-specific knock-down or whole organism homozygous knock-out (<italic>dl<sup>15</sup></italic>) of dl abolished the majority of Drs-expression in the DP of the gland at 96 hr AED and reduced it in the PP at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>).

A reduction of Drs-expression to 6% in the DP of 96-hr-old <italic>dl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- compared to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands indicates not only a strong reliance for Drs on dl in this part at 96 hr, but also a high efficiency of the <italic>dl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-construct. However, a less pronounced decrease of Drs-expression in the PP at 96 hr and 120 hr AED to 27% and 52% upon <italic>dl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-coexpression implies the presence of additional Drs-regulating factors.

In order to distinguish whether the differences between <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–H</xref>) are of quantitative or qualitative nature and to characterize the PP with its persistent dl and Drs expression in depth, we also profiled transcriptomes of entire <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands and solely the PP of <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands at 96 hr AED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’).</p><p>The sets of significant and differentially upregulated genes (i.e. <italic>log2(beta) ≥1; q-value ≤0.05</italic>) for all three conditions (i.e. <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> / <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> / <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-PP each normalized to <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>-controls) were intersected to determine common and specific genesets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Notably, the two biggest genesets are differentially upregulated genes shared between all three conditions and genes specifically upregulated in the PP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, while all 6 <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-replicates are in close proximity along the first two principle components in the PCA, the sets of replicates for <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and especially the PP are distant from the rest along PC2 emphasizing the distinctiveness of the PP compared to the rest of the gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>By screening for enriched gene ontology (GO) terms amongst the significantly upregulated genes in the PP of <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands in comparison to the entire <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>-glands, we identified genes belonging to the GO-term ‘immune response’ (i.e. GO:0006955) as significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; p-value=1.45⋅10<sup>−4</sup>). Detailed examination of the fold-enrichment of these genes across all three experimental groups (i.e. <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup>-PP</italic>) showed a preferential expression in the PP, too (17 of 30 genes highest expressed in PP; blue arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, 5 of the top 20 upregulated genes in the PP belong to this GO-term as well. Thus, the Drs-expression we observed using reporter lines serves as a proxy for a more complex, tissue-autonomous immune response in hypertrophic glands, especially in the PP. Nonetheless, Drs itself remains one of the top significantly, differentially upregulated genes across all three conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; not shown for <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>). In fact, Drs-expression in the PP compared to the two conditions for entire glands is even further increased, confirming the strong tendency for proximal over distal Drs-GFP reporter activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, AttD and Drs are the only two AMPs that showed considerable expression in the two groups involving whole gland samples (i.e. <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>). Strong expression of particular genes in the PP might occur as expression throughout the whole gland samples. Therefore, we tested AttD expression separately in PP and DP, which showed almost exclusive AttD-expression in the PP at 96 hr and 120 hr AED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Similarly, CecA1 as the 4<sup>th</sup> highest expressed AMP in the PP-RNAseq was also confined exclusively to the PP as evaluated by ISH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,E</xref>). Thus, based on the RNAseq and additional evaluations, Drs appears to be the only AMP to be significantly expressed in the DP until 96 hr AED, while in parallel the PP shows a much broader immunocompetence.</p><p>A similar GO-term analysis amongst significantly, upregulated genes in entire <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- or <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands revealed the enrichment of genes associated with GO-terms related to ‘growth’, ‘salivary gland development’ and ‘EGFR signaling’ consistent with the studied tissue and the induced <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-overexpression. Amongst the genes enriched in both <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands were also sets significantly overlapping with GO-terms indicating activated JAK-STAT-signaling (data not shown). By using a construct reporting Stat92E-expression, we were able to confirm this geneset enrichment and show restriction of Stat92E-expression to the PP throughout development of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bach et al., 2007</xref>). This may implicate JAK-STAT-signaling in the maintenance of immune competence in the PP and underlines the separation into PP and DP along the gland epithelium further. Moreover, the lack of unique, significantly enriched GO terms and thus distinct gene expression signatures for either <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- or <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands at 96 hr AED excludes qualitative differences between these two genotypes as an explanation for their phenotypic differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we detected signatures of an activated JNK-cascade as well as cell death in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-transcriptomes indicating the presence of an activated stress response and confirming the stimulation of PCD as implied by nuclear disintegration at 120 hr AED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>; GO:0006955; GO:0008219). To validate these signatures further, we performed qPCR for canonical JNK-targets at 96 hr AED and found that the expression of all tested genes was significantly increased compared to <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>-control glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We used the TRE-GFP1b-reporter construct, which recapitulates JNK-activation by expressing GFP under the control of binding sites for JNK-specific AP-1 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chatterjee and Bohmann, 2012</xref>). This not only confirmed JNK-signaling in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands, but also uncovered its prevalence in the DP of these glands at 96 hr and 120 hr AED consistent with the transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Moreover, the elevated fluorescence signal in the DP at 120 hr AED compared to 96 hr AED implies an increase in activation over time correlating with the collapse of nuclear and cellular integrity during this period.</p><p>In summary, the transcriptome analysis confirms our findings that <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-overexpression induces a strong tissue-autonomous immune response in the PP of the SG, beyond sole Drs expression.

Given the basement membrane’s (BM) role in directly regulating organ morphology, the rescue of the gland shape upon coexpression of either Drs or jnk<sup>DN</sup> with Ras<sup>V12</sup> pointed towards changes in the integrity of the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ramos-Lewis and Page-McCaw, 2019</xref>). In addition, previous reports suggested that hemocytes are only recruited to tissue surfaces upon tissue disintegration and when the integrity of the BM is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kim and Choe, 2014</xref>).

In order to see whether hypertrophic glands express Mmps, we performed qPCRs for Mmp1 and Mmp2 at 96 hr and 120 hr AED on <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and control <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>-glands. At 96 hr AED, <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands already exhibit increased Mmp1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, Mmp2 only reaches a significant level of expression at 120 hr AED coinciding with the appearance of hemocyte attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). SG-wide, <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-independent overexpression of Mmp2, but not of Mmp1, caused opening of the BM and hemocyte attachment to the surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Jia et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, knock-out of Mmp2 reduces hemocyte recruitment significantly compared to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>; 33% in <italic>Mmp2<sup>-/+</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>; 34% in <italic>Mmp2<sup>-/-</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>). In turn, residual hemocytes still attached to the gland surface of <italic>Mmp2<sup>-/-</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands were not activated (i.e. no filo- or lamellipodia, no spreading; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This indicates the necessity for a JNK-dependent expression of Mmp2 in the hypertrophic <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands prior to the recruitment of hemocytes to the tissue surface. However, the presence of residual hemocytes indicates additional cues such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) as recently suggested for neoplastic tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Diwanji and Bergmann, 2019</xref>). In fact, while <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands show accumulation of ROS in the DP, this accumulation is reverted upon Drs-overexpression or JNK-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A parallel block of ROS-accumulation and Mmp2-dependent BM-degradation in <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> and <italic>jnk<sup>DN</sup>;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> could explain the absence of any attached hemocytes on the surface of these glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, overexpression of Drs alone is sufficient to mimic the inhibition of the JNK-pathway in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands: both lead to excess hypertrophic growth compared to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands, but simultaneously prevent tissue disintegration and PCD. Prohibiting the disruption of the basal membrane reduces hemocyte recruitment and activation, thus preventing the cellular immune response from sensing hypertrophic growth.

Remarkably, in this context, the local immune response inhibits the parallel stress response, an effect that to our knowledge has not been described before.

Dependent on the extent of JNK-inhibition by the local, Drs-dependent immune response and thus the integrated decision of both on the state of the tissue’s homeostasis, the gland epithelium attracts hemocytes as part of a wider, cellular immune response. By virtue of inhibiting JNK-signaling, tissue-autonomous and cellular immune responses antagonize each other, a balance that determines continuous hypertrophic growth or its restriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

However, raising larvae with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands under strictly sterile conditions corroborated the authenticity of the immune response as tissue-autonomous and with high likelihood independent of exogenous or systemically distributed pathogenic stimuli. This is further emphasized by the dependency of Drs expression on the tissue-specific overexpression on <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> and tissue-autonomous manipulations (i.e. <italic>Drs</italic> or <italic>jnk<sup>DN</sup></italic> overexpression) leading to the inhibition of JNK-activation and hemocyte recruitment.

Uninterrupted induction of endoreplications has its natural limits in every system, even in SGs that are already polyploid. Eventually, continuous induction of more endocycles is challenged by nutritional restrictions in synthesizing more DNA, replication stress, spatial limitations in the gland nuclei and continuously more unsynchronized metabolic turnover. Hence, in spite of the anti-apoptotic function <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> conveys in mitotic tissues, unrestricted stimulation of excess endoreplications ultimately leads to cell death. Since this characterizes the final collapse of tissue homeostasis, it also allows to study the extent of buffering capacity conveyed by immune and stress-responsive signaling. While JNK-signaling has been shown to be seminal during development (i.e. tissue morphogenesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agnès et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Zeitlinger and Bohmann, 1999</xref>), its activation in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands appears however rather likely to be due to its function in relaying stress signals, emphasizing the presence of stress as part of hypertrophic growth further.</p><p>Thus, hypertrophic <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands constitute an outstanding system to study the involvement of tissue-autonomous immune and stress-induced responses to buffer deviation from homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Immune surveillance theory</title><p>According to the immune surveillance theory, the immune system has evolved to reduce the risk of somatic cells accumulating cancerous mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Burnet, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Burnet, 1970</xref>). In order to reduce the danger of cell-transformation, cells express or expose molecules upon recognition of stress or damage during transformation. These markers are sensed by the immune system, which in turn eradicates the potentially harmful cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Vantourout et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Schmiedel and Mandelboim, 2018</xref>). Given the absence of exogenous or endogenous pathogenic agents, the activation of immune effectors (i.e. Drs) in the here presented system is most likely a consequence of sensing Danger or Damage Associated Molecular Patterns during hypertrophic gland overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Matzinger, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Seong and Matzinger, 2004</xref>). However, the immune surveillance theory remains controversial, since tumor-associated inflammation was also shown to promote rather than suppress tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Balkwill and Mantovani, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mantovani et al., 2008</xref>). Our model bridges the gap between these two opposing views, since the effects of the tissue-autonomous and cellular immune responses appear to be antagonistic regarding the regulation of JNK-activation and thus ultimately PCD. In fact, only the integration of the various stress and immune mechanisms in hypertrophic <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands allows a concerted decision to eradicate a putatively dangerous cell via inducing PCD or not. Given the evolutionary conservation from insects to mammals of signaling pathways that govern growth control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Edgar, 2006</xref>), it is likely that mechanisms to detect and counteract a loss in regulation of these pathways, such as stress and immune pathways, are similarly conserved between both phyla.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-dl<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>Bloomington</td><td>36650</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-l(2)gl<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>109604/KK</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Rives-Quinto et al., 2017</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-imd<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>101834/KK</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bosch et al., 2005</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Fadd<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>100333/KK</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-key<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>100257/KK</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Rel<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>108469/KK</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cammarata-Mouchtouris et al., 2020</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-spz<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>105017/KK</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Panettieri et al., 2020</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Tl<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>1000788/KK</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alpar et al., 2018</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-cad<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>49562/KK</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Stat92E<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>106980/KK</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Recasens-Alvarez et al., 2017</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Dronc<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>100424/KK</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kale et al., 2015</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Dronc<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>23035/GD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Florentin and Arama, 2012</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Myd88<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>25402/GD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Li et al., 2020</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-pll<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>2889/GD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wu et al., 2015</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Dif<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>30578/GD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wu et al., 2015</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Dif<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>30579/GD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wu et al., 2015</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-Drs<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>VDRC</td><td>2703/GD</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-dfr<sup>RNAi</sup></td><td>S.

Egg collections were incubated for 24 hr at 29°C or for hid experiments 48 hr at 18°C and replicates of 24 hatched 1st instar larvae were afterwards transferred to vials with 3 ml standard food supplemented with Neomycin (0.1 mg·ml<sup>−1</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich, N1876), Vancomycin (0.1 mg·ml<sup>−1</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich, V2002), Metronidazol (0.1 mg·ml<sup>−1</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich, M3761) and Carbenicillin (0.1 mg·ml<sup>−1</sup>, Sigma-Aldrich, C1389). After incubation at 29°C for another 72 hr (96 hr AED) or 96 hr (120 hr AED), 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae were prepared for dissection or pictures were taken of whole larvae with a Leica MZ FLIII Fluorescence Stereomicroscope. For hid experiments, transferred larvae were incubated for 197 hr at 18°C, shifted to 29°C for 12 hr and finally dissected. To exclude microbial contamination and maintain germ-free conditions, BxGal4;;DrsGFP/UAS-Ras<sup>V12</sup>-eggs were dechorionated with a 50% Sodium Hypochlorite solution (Fisher Scientific, 10401841) immediately after collection and transferred to vials with apple-agar supplemented with Nipagin, Propionic acid and the same antibiotics as above. Larvae were then analyzed at 24 hr and 48 hr AED.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Drs reporter assay</title><p>Replicates of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (n = 24 larvae·replicate<sup>−1</sup>; N &gt; 6 replicates) at 96 hr AED were screened for Drs-GFP reporter signals. Three phenotypes were distinguished: (1.) ‘Full’ SG pattern includes GFP signal across the entire PP and GFP<sup>+</sup>-cells with reduced intensity in the DP. (2.) ‘Partial’ SG is GFP<sup>+</sup> throughout the PP, but less pronounced in DP with reduced signal intensity and fewer GFP<sup>+</sup>-cells. (3.) ‘None’ phenotype lacks signal throughout the entire gland. Distribution of phenotypes were scored per replicate and significance calculated for the ‘None’-phenotype via Dunn’s test after performing the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>qPCR</title><p>Total RNA of dissected SGs was isolated with the RNAqueous-Micro Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, AM1931) and from whole larvae with the RNAqueous Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, AM1912) according to the instructors manual. Residual genomic DNA was digested with RNase-free DNaseI (ThermoFisher Scientific, EN0521) and cDNA reverse transcribed with SuperscriptIII (ThermoFisher Scientific, 18080–093) while using oligo(dT)<sub>16</sub>-primer (ThermoFisher Scientific, 8080128). Quality of all prepared totalRNA-extractions was evaluated on a 5 mM Guanidinium Thiocyanate-agarose gel, for optimization purposes on a BioRad Experion system (RNA StdSens Assay, 7007153, 7007154) and totalRNA for sequencing was run on a 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent Technologies, 5067–1511). qPCR reactions were set as technical triplicates with KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (KR0389, v9.13) including 200 nM final concentration of forward and reverse primers and run on a Rotor-Gene Q 2plex HRM machine (9001550).

For each genotype, three biological replicates were dissected with 30 pairs of SGs for the three groups including whole glands and 60 pairs of PPs for the corresponding group to acquire 5 µg of total RNA. No power or sample size calculations were performed. Replicate numbers were determined by the available resources and funds.</p><p>Poly(A)-containing mRNA molecules from totalRNA-samples were purified with oligo(dT)-magnetic beads, subsequently fragmented and cDNA synthesized with random primers using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2. Adapter ligation and PCR-amplification precede cluster formation with a cBot cluster generation system. All samples were sequenced on a HiSeq 2500 Illumina Genome Sequencer as PE50. Reads were pseudoaligned with kallisto (v0.44.0) to a transcriptome index derived from all <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcript sequences of the dmel release r6.19. Subsequent analysis of transcript abundances was performed in R with sleuth (v0.30.0) including principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction, statistical and differential expression analysis based on the beta statistic derived from the wald test. Enriched gene ontology terms were identified by calculating hypergeometric p-values via the GOstats (v2.48.0) R package. Gene IDs were converted via the AnnotationDbi (v1.44.0) package and the reference provided with the org.Dm.eg.db (v3.7.0) database and geneset intersections visualized as UpSetR plot (v1.3.3). Please, see the accompanied R markdown (i.e. ‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/robertkrautz/sg_analysis/blob/master/RNAseq_sg_analysis.Rmd">RNAseq_sg_analysis.Rmd</ext-link>’) deposited on GitHub for details (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/robertkrautz/sg_analysis">https://github.com/robertkrautz/sg_analysis</ext-link>).

The RcisTarget R package (v1.6.0) together with the accompanied file including all dm6 motif rankings (i.e. ‘dm6-5kb-upstream-full-tx-11species.mc8nr.feather’) were used for motif enrichment analysis in the various genesets and adding annotations. Enriched motifs were manually screened for functionally related motif groups (e.g. ‘NFkB’ with dl-, Dif-, Rel-relaetd motifs) and motifs plotted according to their affiliation to these groups.</p><p>The sequence of the ‘dm6’ genome assembly was acquired as fasta-file from the Ensembl database and nucleotide sequence frequencies across the genome calculated via customized functions including all major chromosomes. In parallel, promoter sequences for all ‘dm6’ genes were collected via the biomaRt package (v2.42.1) and converted into a DNAStringSet with the Biostrings package (v2.54.0). A curated list of all ‘dm6’ transcription factor motifs as position probability matrices was obtained from the Cis-BP database and converted to position weight matrices (PWMs) with the help of the PWMEnrich R package (v4.22.0) by using the above cacluated nucleotide sequence frequencies. Based on these PWMs and all promoter sequences, background scores for all ‘dm6’ transcription factor motifs across all promoters of the ‘dm6’ genome were quantified. Sequences for the wider Drs-locus and the shared Dif-/dl-loci environments were obtained via biomaRt and the enrichment of the Mef2-motif ‘M08214_2.00_Mef2’ compared to all background scores was calculated via PWMEnrich. Mef2 motif enrichment scores were plotted as a function of the location of the detected motif in the screened loci (i.e. Dif/dl; Drs) with the help of the novel, devised function geom_bar_rastr(), which servers as an extension to the ggrastr R package.

Subsequently, samples were washed three times for each 10 min in PBS or PBST (1% TritonX-100). Blocking was performed with 0.1% BSA in PBS (H2) or 5% BSA in PBST (anti-CC3, anti-pJNK and anti-dl). Samples were then incubated in primary antibodies dissolved in blocking buffer for 12 hr at 4°C or 1 hr at room temperature (RT). Primary antibodies comprised rabbit anti-cleaved caspase 3 (1:200, Cell Signalling Technology, 9661), mouse anti-pJNK (1:250, Cell Signalling Technology, 9255), mouse anti-dl (1:50, DSHB, 7A4), and mouse anti-Hemese (1:5; gift from István Andó). After washing as prior to blocking, secondary antibodies were applied together with DAPI (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich; D9542) and when necessary Alexa Fluor 546 Phalloidin (1:500, ThermoFisher Sceintific, A22283) in blocking buffer for 1 hr at RT. As secondary antibodies goat anti-Mouse-IgG-Alexa546 (H+L; 1:500; ThermoFisher Scientific; A-11030) and goat anti-Rabbit-IgG-Alexa568 (H+L; 1:500; ThermoFisher Scientific; A-11011) were employed. Final washing as prior to blocking preceded dissection of the samples in PBS and separation of SGs. Tissues were mounted in Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech) and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope. Images were extracted with Zen software (Blue edition) for further processing either in Adobe Photoshop CS5 Extended (v12.0.4 × 64) or Inkscape (v0.92).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ROS-staining</title><p>H2DCFDA (D399, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was reconstituted in DMSO just prior to the experiment. This stock solution was further diluted to 10 µM in PBS. Freshly dissected glands were incubated in the 10 µM- working solution for 30 min in the dark. Three 5-min wash steps in PBS ensured removal of excess H2DCFDA-dye. Glands were mounted with PBS and confocal pictures obtained with the Zeiss LSM780 microscope system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Hemocyte- / pJNK- / CC3- quantification and size measurement</title><p>Pictures of stained glands were taken with a Zeiss Axioplan two microscope equipped with an ACHROPLAN ×4 lens and a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (C4742-95). Images were extracted with AxioVision software (v40V 4.8.2.0) and analyzed with ImageJ. Cumulated area of hemocyte attachment, pJNK or CC3 fluorescence per SG or per SG part was filtered in the Red-channel and gland size determined by outlining glands, PPs or DPs with the 'Polygon selection'-tool. The distribution of hemocytes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be approximated by a natural logarithm, which required transformation of hemocyte attachment- and SG-areas before calculating ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sorrentino, 2010</xref>). Normality across all samples of a particular genotype and where necessary separated by gland part (i.e. proximal or distal) or time (i.e. 96 hr and 120 hr AED) was evaluated with the Shapiro-Wilk-test and by bootstrapping via the fitdistrplus R package (v1.0.11). Significant differences between experimental groups were determined for pairwise comparisons via the Student’s t-test after validating un-/equal variance via the Bartlett’s test. Data and statistical analysis was performed in R. No power or sample size calculations were performed. All experiments were performed at least twice, while preparing and acquiring meaurements for all specimens and replicates of the respective experimental set-up. The amount of replicates was determined as a trade-off between reproducibility (maximum number) and feasibility of the experimental procedure to ensure same treatment and timing for all specimens. No measurements were categorized as outliers or excluded. Effect sizes were calculated by normalizing the effect and the reference samples by the mean of the reference samples, which anchors the reference mean at ‘1’ and reports all deviations from it in procent.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Nuclei volume</title><p>Z-stacks of entire SGs were captured with a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope for DAPI signal. Obtained stacks were further processed in ImageJ via the '3D Objects Counter'-plugin (v2.0.1.). Proximal and distal compartments were defined with the 'Polygon selection'-tool. Transfer of the region of interest to all z-stack slices, signal thresholding, object identification and volume determination were integrated in a macro workflow. Data were plotted as average nucleus volume for all nuclei of individual glands or gland parts. Representative sections of individual z-stack slices showing the transition between proximal and distal compartments were cropped and added for illustration. Statistics were performed similar to the analysis of Hemocyte-, pJNK- and CC3- quantifications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Drs-dl-correlation</title><p>BxGal4;;DrsGFP&gt;Ras<sup>V12</sup>-glands were stained for dl (mouse anti-dl-Ab; 1:50, DSHB, 7A4) and genomic DNA (DAPI), whereafter z-stacks were obtained on a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope. Proximal and distal gland compartments were delineated as regions of interest (ROI) in ImageJ with the ‘Polygon selection’-tool and nuclei therein defined via their DAPI-signal and the ‘3D Objects counter’-ImageJ plugin. Transfer of the 3D-nulei outlines across the dl- and Drs-channels via the ImageJ ‘RoiManager 3D’ (v3.96) allowed quantifying an accumulated intensity of the corresponding signals per nucleus. Data analysis was conducted in R including calculation of linear regression and Pearson coefficients for correlations between nuclei-wide Drs- and dl-signal for individual gland compartments and visualization of all nuclei data points after log<sub>10</sub>-normalization for all five screened samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Driver expression strength</title><p>DrsGFP-reporter or Phalloidin-stained, GFP-glands were captured with the ‘Zeiss Axioplan two microscope / ACHROPLAN 4x lens / Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera (C4742-95) / AxioVision software (v40V 4.8.2.0)’-system. ROIs were added manually to the imaged glands to outline their position in ImageJ with the ‘Polygon selections’-tool. Feret diameter and angle were measured to delineate the longitudinal axis of each gland. For each position along the longitudinal axis, the corresponding rectangular line region intersecting with the glands ROI is determined and the encapsulated average fluorescence intensity measured. This workflow is implemented as ImageJ-macro (i.e. ‘scanner.ijm’) for screening of entire picture batches and available on GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/robertkrautz/sg_analysis">https://github.com/robertkrautz/sg_analysis</ext-link>). The resulting data was further analyzed in R to bin and align measurements along the longitudinal axis. Measurements were further averaged and normalized per bin across all screened glands. Given the statistically limited amount of observations (i.e. 200–350 bins), a loess function was used for smoothing the mean during visualization as implemented in geom_smooth() (i.e. span = 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Probe synthesis and in situ hybdridization</title><p>cDNAs for the Drs (LP03851) and CecA1 (IP21250) loci were obtained from DGRC and plasmids transformed into DH5α according to the supplier’s instructions.

Permeabilization was performed for 1 hr in Ethanol, followed by washing once in Methanol for 5 min and twice in PBSTw for each 5 min. The samples were treated with Proteinase K (30 µg/ml; ThermoFisher Scientific; EO0491) for 6 min, washed twice with glycine (2 mg/ml) for 1 min, fixed for 20 min in 4% PFA and washed four times in PBSTw for each 5 min.</p><p>Prior to hybridization, glands were pre-treated with hybridization buffer (HYB: 5 mg/ml Torula RNA, 50% deionized formamide, 5x SSC, 50 µg/ml heparin, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 hr before incubation with either CecA1- or Drs-probe overnight, both at 60°C (in HYB with 3% Dextran). To avoid unspecific binding, samples were stringently washed at 60°C once with HYB-wash solution (50% formamide, 2x SSC, and 0.1% Tween-20) for 30 min, twice with 2x SSCTw, and trice with 0.2 x SSCTw for 20 min. At RT, samples were washed once with PBSTw for 5 min, blocked with sheep serum (8% in PBSTw; Sigma-Aldrich; S2263) for 1 hr and incubated with alkaline phosphatase coupled to anti-digoxigenin-antibody (1:4000 in PBSTw with 8% sheep serum; Roche; 1093274) at 4°C. Washing proceeded four times with PBSTw for each 15 min, twice with TNTw buffer (Tris-NaCl-Tween – 0.1M:0.1M:0.1%; pH 8) for each 15 min and twice with alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mM Tris-HCL pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCL<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% Tween-20) for each 5 min. Staining was perfomed with BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate 4-toluidine salt: 0.175 mg/ml; Roche; 11383221001), NBT (4-nitro-blue-tetrazolium chloride: 0.3375 mg/ml; Roche; 11383213001) and levamisole (0.001 M) in alkaline phosphatase buffer. Stained samples were washed with alkaline phosphatase buffer for 5 min, TNTw for 15 min and PBSTw for 15 min. Washed samples were mounted in Fluoromount G (SouthernBiotech) and capturesd with Leica Firecam (v3.4.1) using a Leica DFC300x FX digital color camera coupled to a Leica MZ16 microscope. All experiments were performed at least twice including all specimens dissected from the entire set of replicates. The amount of replicates was determined as a trade-off between reproducibility and the amount of samples that could be processed with specific equipment of limited supply (i.e. sieves for sample transfer between buffers).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank S Höglund and the Imaging facility at Stockholm University for microscopy support, the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center and the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center for fly stocks, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Resource Center for the Drs and CecA1 cDNAs, the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank for the anti-dl antibody and D Bohmann, S Certel, Y Engström, W-J Lee, B Lemaitre as well as M Suzanne for providing us with flies.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Tissue-autonomous immune response regulates stress signalling during hypertrophy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that the decision was to reject the manuscript while allowing re-submission. In this way, you are more than two months to submit a revised version that address all the point of the reviews. Importantly, you submission will be considered as a new submission but is likely to reviewed by the same reviewers. At this stage, the reviewers that important control are lacking to ascertain the solidity of the claim. If you feel that you will not be able to address the reviewer's comments, you can decide to transfer the manuscript to another journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This work proposes that tissue-autonomous Drosomycin (Drs) negatively regulates <italic>JNK</italic> signalling in a hypertrophic salivary gland (SG) model. The flow of experiment ideas is thorough, but lacking critical control treatments. There appears to be a spatial bias in the BxGal4 expression model used. Additionally, there is no demonstration that this is Drs-specific, as the authors never test for the effect of Gal4 dilution by involving additional UAS constructs such as other AMPs or a control like UAS-GFP. As the paper relies entirely on a BxGal4&gt;UAS model, alternate Gal4 and UAS control treatments are essential to avoid spatial bias and the effect of multiple UAS diluting RasV12 production and consequent hypertrophy.</p><p>List of substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The authors use a BxGal4 model to drive SG expression throughout this manuscript. The assumption seems to be that BxGal4 is a pan-SG driver, and that differences in the proximal and distal parts of the SG arise due to differences in Drs expression in these regions. However it is revealed in Figure 2B that BxGal4 does not efficiently drive dorsal-RNAi in the proximal part (PP) of the SG, as this tissue retains abundant dorsal expression. In Figure 4A there is a weakening of Drs signal in situ in the BxGal4&gt;Drs at the PP, indicating BxGal4 is not efficiently driving Drs in the PP. Finally, the PCA analysis of RNAseq data shows totally independent clustering of the PP transcriptome from whole SGs; no BxGal4&gt;<italic>w1118</italic> PP control is given for comparison.</p><p>Thus, throughout the manuscript, the PP is very likely a region with significantly reduced RasV12 expression, readily explaining most differences between the sick and apoptotic DP and the (relatively) healthy PP. For instance, this would readily explain differences in hemocyte attachment between the DP and PP. This may also imply a Drs response is seen in the PP solely because this relatively healthy tissue remains immune competent for longer than the DP.</p><p>Finally, Drs expression in the SG increases between the L3 and prepupa stages of development (FlyAtlas). It is unclear how BxGal4&gt;RasV12 might affect SG developmental patterning, and indeed the model relies on rapid overgrowth of the tissue. Moreover there is an expected Drs response in immune-responsive tissues to sterile injury or stress. It is likely that SG remodelling during RasV12-induced stress leads to corresponding programmed cell death and similarly induction of NF-κB. This interpretation is congruous with the findings of Araki et al. (2018) and Parvy et al. (2019) that suggest NF-κB effectors cooperate in clearing tumorous tissue and responds to cell death signals.</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, the authors combine additional UAS constructs without controlling for the dilution of their Gal4 drive. This affects almost every figure in the latter half of the manuscript, and the effect of this dilution is apparent in Figure S5C, where Drs levels in BxGal4&gt;Drs alone are 1-2 fold higher than BxGal4&gt;Drs,RasV12 double drive. If RasV12 is diluted in combined UAS lines, this would promote a delayed phenotype, resulting in an apparent rescue effect if you simply compare equal time points. But it would be expected that continued monitoring to 144h would reveal the same apoptotic effects as the lone BxGal4&gt;RasV12 tissue at 120h, similar to how BxGal4&gt;RasV12 at 96h displays less apoptosis than 120h.</p><p>There is one argument that can be made in favour of the dilution not mattering: Drs-RNAi has a mild but opposite effect at 96h. However it should be noted that RNAi vs. protein overexpression leads to significantly different metabolic burdens on the cell, and thus RNAi is not a good control for this dilution effect. The authors should use a control overexpression construct such as UAS-GFP or UAS-RFP throughout.</p><p>3) There is no logic presented within the paper that this effect should be Drs-specific. Many other AMPs and immune effectors were similarly upregulated in their transcriptome (e.g. AttD, Def). If AttD and Def are similarly induced in this model, it is assumed their expression is similarly regulated, and that overexpression of AttD or Def could similarly rescue RasV12 SGs, and RNAi of AttD or Def could similarly exacerbate RasV12 SGs. I would recommend that, alongside a UAS-GFP control, the authors also test at least some subset of NF-κB effectors alongside their Drs model to elucidate if this is specific to Drs or a general effect. Given findings in other papers on AMP-tumor interactions where overexpressing Drs, Dpt, or Def all had similar effect (Araki et al., 2019), it seems likely that many AMPs should result in the same phenotype, implying there is no molecular pathway where specifically Drs inhibits <italic>JNK</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Krautz et al. presents an interesting finding on regulation of stress signaling during hypertrophy via tissue-autonomous immune signaling. Data shows that Drosomycin, downstream of the NFkB factor Dorsal, interferes with overgrowth of the salivary gland caused by RasV12 expression. The authors investigate the underlying mechanism of this finding using different approaches, presenting copious data which are generally supportive their model.</p><p>However, in some cases the findings lack direct demonstration of key aspects of their model. The conclusions, highlighted in the model shown in Figure 8, claim that Drs inhibits <italic>JNK</italic> signaling which is shown with some key experiments. Yet, this model also claims that <italic>JNK</italic> signaling drives tissue disintegration effects of RasV12 through induction of <italic>MMP2</italic>, yet <italic>MMP2</italic> is not upregulated until a very late time point and only to a modest degree. Moreover, they don't show that <italic>MMP2</italic> or Hid (another <italic>JNK</italic> target) are required for these events. Also, in some cases the data is not as robust as would be expected in the field; activation of <italic>JNK</italic> is shown with compelling reporter data and pBsk staining, but the gene expression for <italic>JNK</italic> targets is underwhelming, for example Puc. Perhaps the issue is more with the model figure over-extending beyond the actual data presented.</p><p>In addition, the authors claims have relied mostly on qualitative nature of the data, whereas quantification could have strengthened their claim. For example, authors conclude that endoreplication leads to increase in nuclear volume but have not shown any quantitative increase in nuclear DNA content. The DAPI data shows most of the nuclei as disintegrated which will amount to higher nuclear volume but is less informative about DNA content. Further, authors have not stated whether the disintegrated nuclei were excluded from the analysis or not. Similarly, RasV12 stimulated MMPs-dependent tissue disintegration and Hid-dependent nuclear disintegration are not directly demonstrated.</p><p>Apart from the above-stated experimental concerns, issue with data presentation also significantly dampens the enthusiasm for this study. The data-presentation is incredibly cumbersome; throughout, the text does not present clearly the rationale of their experimental design, some key figure panels are not even mentioned in the text, other key data is buried in the supplemental figures, while other data is replicated in separate figure panels without clear reasoning, and importantly most of the legends/labeling on the graphs are so small, they are illegible. This last issue makes this work nearly impossible to critically evaluate. Also, I would encourage the authors to use gene names and symbols on their figures that are understood by a wide readership. For example, Bsk might be alternatively <italic>JNK</italic> in S5.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This article is interesting because it shows that some immune genes, mostly antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, are induced in a highly artificial system in which the overgrowth of salivary glands is induced by ectopic expression of the Ras[V12] gain-of-function allele. The expression of immune genes would rely solely on Dorsal and not the Toll pathway (see below). The most important point is that the overexpression of Drosomycin is sufficient to reduce the induction of <italic>JNK</italic>-pathway regulated genes that occurs in the distal part of salivary glands, including pro-apoptotic genes, thus introducing the concept of a direct or indirect intracellular signaling function for an antimicrobial peptide.</p><p>In the longer term, it will be interesting to determine whether Dorsal plays a role in wild-type larval salivary glands and why it is differentially repressed in the DP.</p><p>Substantive concerns</p><p>1) The authors use RNAi lines to determine whether the Toll pathway is required for the induction of immune genes, which are not even validated. Since it is close to impossible to demonstrate the generation of a null phenotype by RNAi, the authors should imperatively use at least one null mutant of the Toll pathway, e.g., MyD88 and possibly spz.</p><p>2) The authors should look at and quantify Dorsal nuclear localization in the salivary glands and not solely at its expression. Upon looking at Figure 2B, one gets the impression it is nuclear only in the very proximal region of the organ.</p><p>3) Multiple AMPs are induced in the PP and it is surprising that the one AMP they have overexpressed is having such a biological function. A control is missing, ideally a Drosomycin mutant in which disulfide bridges cannot form; at least a nonrelevant gene should be used as a control to exclude nonspecific effects linked to overexpression in the Ras[V12] context. Also, the Drosomycin RNAi line does not abolish the expression of its target gene and does not have such a &quot;drastic&quot; effect: several genes are only mildly more strongly expressed. It would be interesting to use a Drosomycin null mutant. Perhaps less important for this work but of interest, it would have been informative to test mutants affecting AMP families that have recently been published.</p><p>4) It is not clear whether Drosomycin is secreted in the lumen or basally in the hemolymph. To really conclude that this is a tissue-autonomous response, inasmuch the authors do not state whether Drosomycin is expressed in other tissues, it would be useful to overexpress Drosomycin in the fat body and test its effects on the DP of the salivary glands.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64919.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

This allowed to quantify Gal4-driver expression (i.e., BxGal4&gt;UAS-mCD8::RFP), fluorescence signals from stainings (i.e., Phalloidin) or reporter lines (i.e., DrsGFP) along the salivary gland beyond a bipartite proximal-distal separation.

However, while the differing number of endoreplications would suggest a substantially differing expression, on average the BxGal4driven expression in the proximal part of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands still reaches 86% of the average expression in the distal part (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). In addition, the expression strength in the proximal part still increases upon co-expression of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> compared to control glands (<italic>Bx, RFP</italic> x <italic>w1118</italic>: 1.58; <italic>Bx, RFP</italic> x <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>: 2.30).</p><p>In parallel, quantifying DrsGFP-fluorescence across the length of the gland showed that Drs-expression and BxGal4-expression are neither correlated, nor anti-correlated over time (i.e., 96 and 120 h) and space (i.e., proximal and distal; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Thus, while <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expression is qualitatively necessary for Drs-expression, already the comparably low BxGal4-driven <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expression at 96 h across the gland epithelium is sufficient for Drs to become fully expressed (i.e., same level as at 120 h AED). This makes Drs-expression qualitatively, but not quantitatively dependent on BxGal4-driven <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expression. In this regard, strong Drs-expression also precedes the accumulation of programmed cell death (PCD) in the gland as indicated by CC3 and nuclear disintegration (Figure 6C-F), a prerequisite for the model we propose, in which Drs actively inhibits induction of PCD.</p><p>In contrast, the intrinsic expression pattern of Dorsal, that appears independent of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expression correlates not only qualitatively, but crucially quantitatively with the presence of Drs (Figure 2B-C). Under physiological conditions and thus independent of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, Dorsal expression is higher in the proximal part at 96 and 120 h AED than in the distal and eventually lost almost entirely in the distal part at 120 h (Figure 2B-C). This expression pattern persists upon <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-coexpression. However, upon dl-knock-down without <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expression, Dorsal is indeed greatly reduced in all gland parts across the two developmental time points. We included separating lines in Figure 2B. to emphasize this aspect further. At 96 h, when Bx driven expression is similar in proximal and distal, residual dl-expression in the proximal part upon <italic>dl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-expression indicates an insufficiency of the knock-down construct to abolish dl-expression (Figure 2B-C). This is in line with qPCR-data we acquired for Drs-expression in separated proximal and distal gland parts upon co-expression of the <italic>dl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-line with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A</xref>). However, in spite of a reduced Bx-driven expression in the proximal part of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands at 120 h and an insufficient <italic>dl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-construct, dl-knock-down not only decreases Dorsal expression, but crucially also Drs-expression in both gland parts, as well as both time points (Figure 2B) emphasizing the dependency of Drs on dl rather than changes in Bxdriver expression further.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Drs asserts specific function on JNK-signaling not mimicked by other detected AMPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SG size as measured by outlining images of the 120 h-old, experimental and control glands with the indicated genotypes.

In fact, Drs and dl show a strong linear correlation across the entire scale (i.e., log<sub>10</sub>-transformed) in both the proximal as well as the distal gland part (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4A there is a weakening of Drs signal in situ in the BxGal4&gt;Drs at the PP, indicating BxGal4 is not efficiently driving Drs in the PP.</p></disp-quote><p>While ISH can be performed in a controlled, quantitative manner by using fluorescence probes and confocal microscopy, the ISH results presented throughout the manuscript were done by chromogenic staining and results were captured by brightfield microscopy. Thus, all results can only be seen in a comparative, semi-quantitative manner with the aim to characterize qualitative expression patterns. In addition, increased curvature and lumen width, as well as reduced tissue thickness and cell size of the proximal gland part complicate using ISH-quantifications as proxy for expression strengths further.</p><p>While we therefore refer to the presented quantifications along the longitudinal axis (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), we certainly acknowledge the point raised by the reviewer of a reduced expression in the proximal part of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands at 120 h, but present evidence that this reduced expression is not causal for the differences seen between proximal and distal gland compartments such as Drs-expression. To credit the reviewer’s comments and for full transparency, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A was included in the manuscript and its consequences for the model discussed in the manuscript’s main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the PCA analysis of RNAseq data shows totally independent clustering of the PP transcriptome from whole SGs; no BxGal4&gt;w1118 PP control is given for comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>PC1 explains 94.26% of the variability in the data and all samples derived from overexpressing <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> (i.e., <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-PP) are falling almost completely in line with one another in PC1 (Figure 3A). Thus, while all 9 <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-samples separate in PC1 from the control gland samples with the majority of variability in the expression data being explained by PC1, the <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-PP samples separate mainly in PC2, which only explains 3.05% of the intrinsic variability of the data.</p><p>In addition, principal components analysis subsumes qualitative differences (i.e., genesets expressed) into quantitative differences (i.e., gene expression intensities), indicating that the separation in PC2 remains largely due to qualitative differences in significantly differentially expressed genes that do not occur in the DP. This is clearly underlined in the barplot (UpSetR-plot) in Figure 2A, which shows a set of 309 genes solely, significantly differentially expressed in the PP and further exemplified in Figure 2C. for “immune response” genes. Many of these genes show a strong qualitative difference (i.e., unilateral upregulation in the PP compared to whole-tissue samples). The whole-tissue samples include not only the distal, but also the proximal part, which dampens the detectable difference in gene expression strength between both parts. Thus, we performed additional qPCRs for AttD as the highest upregulated gene in the PP on dissected, separated gland parts (DP vs. PP), which revealed a complete absence of AttD-expression in the distal part at 96 and 120 h (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the qualitative differences between the PP and the DP as reflected in the expression of different sets of genes (Figure 2A-C) gives rise to the separation of the PPsamples along PC2 which in turn however only explains a minor fraction of the data’s inherent variability.</p><p>This spatial separation is further corroborated by the expression patterns shown for amongst others dl (Figure 2B), DrsGFP (Figure 1E; Figure 1—figure supplement 1E; Figure 5A) and TREGFP1b (Figure 3F; Figure 3—figure supplement 1F; Figure 5F; Figure 5—figure supplement 2E). However, a reporter indicating JAK-STAT-activation (related GOterms were found to be enriched in the RNAseq-datasets; <italic>data not shown</italic>), the 10xSTAT92EGFP-reporter, highlights this separation best (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1D</xref>). Upon <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expression, the construct reports JAK-STAT-activation solely in the PP between 96 h to 144 h (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1D</xref>). The presented evidence for an intrinsic spatial separation into a proximal and a distal gland compartment is in the following also central for the proposed model, in which a dl-dependent reduction solely in the DP reverts inhibition of <italic>JNK</italic>-signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, throughout the manuscript, the PP is very likely a region with significantly reduced RasV12 expression, readily explaining most differences between the sick and apoptotic DP and the (relatively) healthy PP. For instance, this would readily explain differences in hemocyte attachment between the DP and PP. This may also imply a Drs response is seen in the PP solely because this relatively healthy tissue remains immune competent for longer than the DP.</p></disp-quote><p>If PCD and tissue degradation is the cause for the reduced Drs expression or expression in general, the assumption would be a maintained Drs-expression upon inhibition of PCD in the distal part of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands at 120 h. Upon inhibition of the <italic>JNK</italic>-pathway by co-expression of a <italic>jnk<sup>DN</sup></italic>-construct (<italic>bsk<sup>DN</sup></italic>), <italic>JNK</italic>-activation (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) as well as hemocyte attachment (Figure 4D) are reversed almost to the level of control glands in line with the block of PCD. However, in spite of inhibited PCD, Drs-expression does not recover in the DP, ultimately rendering Drs-expression independent of the quantitative expression levels from the BxGal4-driver (Figure 4A; Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). Drs is only dependent on the driver in as much as it qualitatively expresses <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> in this model. In parallel, <italic>jnk<sup>DN</sup>;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands undergo the same increase in endoreplications, thus mimicking the changes in Bx-driven expression present in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (Figure 6C).</p><p>Moreover, Figure 5—figure supplement 2C. shows an upregulation of many <italic>JNK</italic> target genes upon co-expression of an RNAi-knock-down construct against Drs at 96 h, when the DP of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>glands still expresses Drs and is thus susceptible to a Drs-knock-down. Despite the use of two UAS-constructs, an increased expression of these <italic>JNK</italic> target genes indicates that a Drs-reduction has a specific, active effect on the expression of the <italic>JNK</italic> target genes.</p><p>In summary, the state of a gland part (i.e., healthy or not) is not determined by the strength of Bx-driven expression, but instead by the presence or absence of Drs, whose expression is in turn regulated by the distribution of dl.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, Drs expression in the SG increases between the L3 and prepupa stages of development (FlyAtlas). It is unclear how BxGal4&gt;RasV12 might affect SG developmental patterning, and indeed the model relies on rapid overgrowth of the tissue. Moreover there is an expected Drs response in immune-responsive tissues to sterile injury or stress. It is likely that SG remodelling during RasV12-induced stress leads to corresponding programmed cell death and similarly induction of NF-κB. This interpretation is congruous with the findings of Araki et al. (2018) and Parvy et al. (2019) that suggest NF-κB effectors cooperate in clearing tumorous tissue and responds to cell death signals.</p></disp-quote><p>The model presented in this manuscript and the reviewers alternative fundamentally differ in their interpretation of the causality between Drs-activation and the induction of PCD. (1) Either Drs reduced cell death by inhibiting <italic>JNK</italic>-signaling or (2) PCD leads to the erasure of Drs-expressing cells and thus eventually to Drs-expression itself. While we acknowledge the 14%reduction in the PP compared to the DP of <italic>BxGal4</italic>&gt;<italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands at 120 h, the alternative proposition can however not be sufficiently aligned to all the above presented evidence at once: (1) no correlation between strength of Bx-driven and Drs-expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), (2) Drs-expression precedes occurrence of PCD (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B; Author response image1A), (3) Drs-expression is determined by dl (i.e., dl-reduction leads to Drs-reduction; Figure 2B; Figure 2—figure supplement 2B; Figure 2—figure supplement 3A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A</xref>), (4) tissue-autonomous proximal-distal-separation of the gland epithelium (Figure 1E; Figure 1—figure supplement 1G,I; Figure 2B; Figure 3F; Figure 3—figure supplement 1F; Figure 5F; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1D</xref>) and (5) no recovery of Drs-expression by blocking PCD via <italic>JNK</italic>-inhibition (Figure 4A; Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).</p><p>Most importantly, Drs is not a mere bystander parallel to the tissue’s disintegration, but has functional relevance in preventing it as is shown by Drs-overexpression in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands. Not only are markers for PCD reduced (Figure 6D. – nuclear disintegration; Figure 6E-F. – CC3-activation; Figure 5E-F. – <italic>JNK</italic>-activation) and thus tissue-viability maintained, but the glands continue to overgrow (Figure 4C; Figure 4—figure supplement 1A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). In this regard, the here presented model of a tissue-autonomous immune response aiding hypertrophic growth is also opposed to the models published by Araki et al. and Parvy et al. (Araki M et al. Dis Model Mech. 2019 Jun18;12(6):dmm037721. doi:10.1242/dmm.037721; Parvy JP et al. <italic>eLife</italic>. 2019 Jul 30;8:e45061. doi:10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.45061). Clearance of the distal parts of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands at 120 h not only occurs in the absence of Drs, but in its presence such as by Drs-overexpression, no gland tissue needs to be cleared, since Drs prevents its disintegration in the first place.</p><p>Kenmoku et al. indeed showed the induction of Drosomycin upon sterile injury independent on the position of the actual injury in the larval epidermis (i.e., pinching; Kenmoku H et al. Dis Model Mech. 2017 Mar1;10(3):271-281. doi:10.1242/dmm.027102). However, this type of sterile injury leads exclusively to an upregulation of Drs in the fat body as part of a systemic immune response. While we use the same transgenic reporter construct as Kenmoku H et al. we exclusively identify expression of Drs in the larval salivary glands coinciding with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-overexpression, indicating the absence of artefacts due to mechanically induced stress (Ferrandon D et al. EMBO J. 1998 Aug10;17(5):1217-27. doi:10.1093/emboj/17.5.1217; Jung AC et al. Biotechniques. 2001 Mar;30(3):594-8, 600-1. doi: 10.2144/01303rr04). In parallel, neither are larval salivary glands established immune responsive epithelia, nor did other <italic>Drosophila</italic> overgrowth models show expression of immune effectors in a tissue-autonomous manner. Apart from the qualitative differences in tissue expression, we also identify strong quantitative differences in the Drosomycin expression levels with respect to the reported levels upon sterile injury. While Kenmoku report a fold change of maximal 10 in Drs expression upon injury over control levels (i.e., in fat bodies), Drs expression in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands over control glands is two orders of magnitude higher (i.e., log2(FC) &gt; = 10, FC &gt; = 1024).</p><p>Apart from our findings presented here, Pierce SB et al., 2004 showed a similar proximal, distal separation of dMyc and dMnt expression along the gland epithelium in larval salivary glands (Pierce SB et al. Development. 2004 May;131(10):2317-27. doi:10.1242/dev.01108). In addition, our findings on the differential expression and abundance of dl in the absence of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> (Figure 2B) and the differing nuclei volume in PP and DP consistent with previous reports indicate that the SG pattern identified in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> glands is not altered, but that the <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-related phenotypes are indeed based on an intrinsic separation between PP and DP that is pre-established in wandering stage larvae (Berendes HD, Ashburner M 1978, The Salivary Glands. The Genetics and Biology of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, vol. 2b, pp. 453-498. London: Academic Press; Hammond MP, Laird CD.

This affects almost every figure in the latter half of the manuscript, and the effect of this dilution is apparent in Figure S5C, where Drs levels in BxGal4&gt;Drs alone are 1-2 fold higher than BxGal4&gt;Drs,RasV12 double drive.</p></disp-quote><p>Previously, we co-expressed a cytoplasmic GFP alongside <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, which did not diminish any of the reported effects and phenotypes induced by <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> alone (Figure 2 and Figure 3 in Hauling T et al. Biol Open. 2014 Apr15;3(4):250-260. doi:10.1242/bio.20146494). However, to address this aspect more systematically, we used a mCD8-tagged RFP-line to balance the number of UAS constructs with UAS-Ras<sup>V12</sup> and UAS-Drs. Crucial experiments including the activation of <italic>JNK</italic> (Figure 5—figure supplement 3B-C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2C-D</xref>) and CC3 (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>,D), as well as the expression of <italic>JNK</italic>-target genes (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2E</xref>) were repeated, while accounting for the number of UAS-constructs. Consistent with our previous results, <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands exhibit significantly reduced CC3- and pJNK-signal compared to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-samples, while <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands do not differ significantly from <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (Figure 5—figure supplement 3B-C; Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B-D</xref>). Most importantly, while <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands show a drastic increase in gland size emphasizing the hypertrophic overgrowth, co-expression of <italic>RFP</italic> alongside <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> has no significant influence on the size of the glands (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). This indicates a physiological influence of Drs that is not replicated by simply co-expressing a second protein such as RFP.</p><p>Quantifications of <italic>JNK</italic>-target gene expressions corroborated the difference between Drs- and RFP-co-expression further. At 96 h, apart from <italic>Mmp2</italic> all monitored target genes show no significant differences in expression between <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands, while for the same genes <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands exhibit significantly reduced expression compared with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2E</xref>). At 120 h, Mmp1, <italic>Mmp2</italic> and upd1 show the same pattern with these genes being significantly downregulated in <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-, but not in <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands compared to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>. While the absolute reduction in gene expression is still stronger in <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands for <italic>puc</italic>, <italic>hid</italic> and <italic>rpr</italic>, their <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-counterparts show a significant decrease, too (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2E</xref>).</p><p>While we acknowledge the partial reduction of these genes in <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-compared to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands, several confounding factors complicate the comparability of results from co-expressed constructs used as controls: (1) insertion site of the UAS-constructs, that have an influence on their expressability, (2) metabolic burden due to the size and cellular location of the final protein, in line with the reviewers comment (see below), (3) activity and function of the protein and (3) whether the protein is secreted or not.</p><p>Since Drs is a secreted peptide, we opted for mCD8::RFP as control to mimic the entrance into the secretory pathway, too. However, while mCD8::RFP-constructs were shown to be inert in other cell systems, their influence on salivary gland physiology with e.g., its particular high secretory activity has not been documented.</p><p>Moreover, sole expression of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> and co-expression of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> with Drs show very similar Drs-expression levels, both at 96 h and 120 h AED. In addition, as indicated by the reviewer, the co-expression of <italic>Drs<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> results in a strong reduction of Drs expression (i.e., only 8% at 96 h and 4% at 120 h of Drs-expression remains after <italic>Drs<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-co-expression; Figure 5—figure supplement 2A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2G</xref>), and thus shows the opposite effect as in <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (Figure 5—figure supplement 2CD; Figure 6A). In this regard, the most parsimonious explanation for the differences in expression are the actual constructs driven by BxGal4 together with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> (i.e., alone or in combination) and their differing downstream effects. In fact, the RNAseq data for <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> (Figure 1D; Figure 3A-C) is consistent with this explanation highlighting the comprehensive reprogramming, the glands undergo. Moreover, the co-expression of another RNAi-construct targeting <italic>lgl</italic> increases the severity of the phenotypes (i.e., nuclear and tissue disintegration) further (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-H).</p><p>We also followed the reviewer’s suggestion to overexpress one of the other AMPs upregulated in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands, CecA1 (4<sup>th</sup> highest upregulated; Figure 3C). ISH with a CecA1specific probe revealed an expression of CecA1 exclusively in the PP of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands at 96 and 120 h AED in line with the RNAseq-results (Figure 3C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2F</xref>). By using the same probe, overexpression throughout the whole gland epithelium at both time points with the help of the CecA1-overexpression construct could also be confirmed. However, <italic>CecA1;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>glands do not exhibit the same abundant CecA1-expression as in <italic>CecA1</italic>-glands, but instead CecA1-expression is confined to the PP. While the implications of a <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-dependent inhibition of CecA1-transcript accumulation in the distal part are beyond the scope of this manuscript, it is obvious that CecA1-coexpression in methodological terms is not simply controlling for Drs-co-expression. In fact, this result suggests further layers of direct interactions between <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-driven hypertrophy and the tissue-autonomous immune response beyond immediate expectations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If RasV12 is diluted in combined UAS lines, this would promote a delayed phenotype, resulting in an apparent rescue effect if you simply compare equal time points. But it would be expected that continued monitoring to 144h would reveal the same apoptotic effects as the lone BxGal4&gt;RasV12 tissue at 120h, similar to how BxGal4&gt;RasV12 at 96h displays less apoptosis than 120h.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a prototypical example of a <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-gland at 144 h AED. At this time point, Drs is not only still expressed, but remains confined to the PP reminiscent of its expression at 120 h (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1E</xref>).</p><p>In addition, a model of gradual induction of PCD and its delay in <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands or other genotypes due to dilution effects implies the reduction of expression of all genes in the gland including Drs due to apoptotic induction. However, given the necessity for JNK signaling during the induction of PCD in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expressing glands, the inhibition of JNK signaling throughout the entire time of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-expression rescues the glands from undergoing PCD (Figure 6A,D,E-F). However, the glands continue to show a difference in Drs expression between proximal and distal part with a continuous loss of Drs expression in the latter at 120 h AED (Figure 4A; Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is one argument that can be made in favour of the dilution not mattering: Drs-RNAi has a mild but opposite effect at 96h. However it should be noted that RNAi vs. protein overexpression leads to significantly different metabolic burdens on the cell, and thus RNAi is not a good control for this dilution effect. The authors should use a control overexpression construct such as UAS-GFP or UAS-RFP throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the above outlined additional experiments based on the co-expression of especially mCD8::RFP as well as CecA1 combined with the accompanied clarifications emphasize the unique role Drs has in this hypertrophic model and that its significance is not merely explained by dilution effects. In this regard, we also like to emphasize the significant differences upon <italic>Drs<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>- and <italic>Drs</italic>-co-expression with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> and the <italic>log2</italic>-scale used to represent associated qPCR expression values, which can influence the impression of expression differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is no logic presented within the paper that this effect should be Drs-specific. Many other AMPs and immune effectors were similarly upregulated in their transcriptome (e.g. AttD, Def). If AttD and Def are similarly induced in this model, it is assumed their expression is similarly regulated, and that overexpression of AttD or Def could similarly rescue RasV12 SGs, and RNAi of AttD or Def could similarly exacerbate RasV12 SGs. I would recommend that, alongside a UAS-GFP control, the authors also test at least some subset of NF-κB effectors alongside their Drs model to elucidate if this is specific to Drs or a general effect. Given findings in other papers on AMP-tumor interactions where overexpressing Drs, Dpt, or Def all had similar effect (Araki et al., 2019), it seems likely that many AMPs should result in the same phenotype, implying there is no molecular pathway where specifically Drs inhibits JNK.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the acquired RNAseq-datasets, Drosomycin is the most highly upregulated gene in whole <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (Figure 1D). More importantly, Drosomycin is also the only AMP that is consistently highly upregulated in all three genotypes whose transcriptomes were sequenced (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1F</xref>). Whole tissue samples of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands showed high expression for only one more AMP, AttD (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1F</xref>). However, precise transcript quantifications via qPCR on separated PPs and DPs revealed that this expression results from the upregulation of AttD solely in the PP (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Crucially, this restricted upregulation not only occurs at 120 h AED as for Drs, but also at 96 h AED. Thus, Drs is the only AMP that is expressed at 96 h AED in the distal part of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands and whose downregulation coincides with an increase in <italic>JNK</italic>-activation and initiation of PCD from 96 h to 120 h AED. In this regard, Drs emerged as the only likely candidate to influence the shift in the DP, an aspect we definitely have missed to clarify in the manuscript before, but have added now.</p><p>However, our intention was to merely indicate that Drs expression is capable to interfere with <italic>JNK</italic>-signaling and sufficient to inhibit it in the presented hypertrophy model, but we did not comment on a unique function of Drs in <italic>JNK</italic>-inhibition. In this way, we certainly acknowledge the possibility of additional AMPs having similar or different effects on stress signaling in this or other models of overgrowth. However, the mechanism of Drs directly interfering with <italic>JNK</italic>-signaling rather than with the accumulation of initial stress is a novel concept shedding new light on the necessity of tissue-autonomous immune responses on tissue integrity.</p><p>As a proof-of-principle, we overexpressed CecA1 alone or in combination with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> leading to a block of CecA1-transcript accumulation in the DP of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2F</xref>). While the underlying mechanism resulting in this block awaits further investigations, it highlights the role of Drs as the only AMP expressed in the DP until 96 h AED further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Krautz et al. presents an interesting finding on regulation of stress signaling during hypertrophy via tissue-autonomous immune signaling.

The conclusions, highlighted in the model shown in Figure 8, claim that Drs inhibits JNK signaling which is shown with some key experiments. Yet, this model also claims that JNK signaling drives tissue disintegration effects of RasV12 through induction of MMP2, yet MMP2 is not upregulated until a very late time point and only to a modest degree.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the acquired qPCR-data <italic>Mmp2</italic> is for the first time significantly differentially expressed at 120 h AED (Figure 4D; p=0.0263; FC=2.60; log<sub>2</sub>(FC)=1.38). However, while the upregulation is not significantly changed compared to <italic>w1118</italic>-control glands, <italic>MMP2</italic> is on average already differentially expressed in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands at 96 h (Figure 4D; p=0.2928; FC=2.15; log2(FC)=1.10). Given the time necessary for <italic>JNK</italic>-dependent transcriptional activation around 96 h AED, generating and secreting the <italic>Mmp2</italic>-protein, as well as enzymatically disrupting the basement membrane and consequentially recruiting hemocytes, the presented data is consistent with the model proposed in the manuscript. While a non-significant, but differential Mmp2expression already at 96 h AED indicates an incline in expression over time, the detection of <italic>Mmp2</italic>-dependent disruption of the basement membrane at 120 h characterizes the functional consequences in a time-appropriate manner (Figure 4D).</p><p>Moreover, overexpression of Mmp1 or <italic>Mmp2</italic> independently of one another and of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> indicates that <italic>Mmp2</italic> is the only matrix metalloproteinase capable of opening the BM surrounding the glands irrespective of strong differences in the expression of Mmp1 and <italic>Mmp2</italic> in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (Figure 4E; Figure 4—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, they don't show that MMP2 or Hid (another JNK target) are required for these events.</p></disp-quote><p>While the results in the manuscript covered presence (i.e., expression, Figure 4D) and functional capability (i.e., sufficiency, Figure 4E; Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) of <italic>Mmp2</italic> to degrade the gland’s basement membrane, we indeed failed to show the necessity of <italic>Mmp2</italic> for the recruitment of hemocytes as a function of basal membrane degradation in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands in line with the reviewer’s comment.</p><p>For this purpose, we crossed a <italic>Mmp2</italic>-mutant allele (<italic>Mmp2<sup>k00604</sup></italic>) with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> and BxGal4 to obtain a hetero- or homozygous knock-out of the <italic>Mmp2</italic>-locus (Figure 4F-G; Figure 4—figure supplement 1C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4A-B</xref>,D).

Moreover, recent, systematic work from the Bergmann lab has not only emphasized the role of <italic>Mmp2</italic> in hemocyte recruitment to undead cells and a clonally induced, neoplastic tumor model, but also showed the importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this process (Diwanji N, Bergmann A.

In order to evaluate, whether ROS are also present in the here presented hypertrophic model and thus could aid in the process of basement membrane degradation, we stained live tissues with H2DCF-dye to detect a wide spectrum of ROS in salivary glands (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4E</xref>).

In parallel, phenotypes which the model relies upon were not only quantified, but validated by independent repetitions of the experiments (data not shown), including nuclear volume (Figure 1C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-E; Figure 6C), hemocyte attachment (Figure 1F; Figure 1—figure supplement 1H; Figure 4D), Drs-expression (semi-quantitatively as part of the regulator screen; Figure 2A; Figure2—figure supplement 2A), Drs- and <italic>JNK</italic>-target gene expression via RNAseq and qPCR (Figure 3C,E; Figure 3—figure supplement 2A; Figure 4E; Figure 5B; Figure 5—figure supplement 1B; Figure 5—figure supplement 2C-D; Figure 6A), SG-size (Figure 4C), phosphorylation/activation of <italic>JNK</italic> (Figure 5C; Figure 5—figure supplement 2F), <italic>JNK</italic>-reporter activation (Figure 5D; Figure 5—figure supplement 2E; Figure 7B,D) and Dronc-activation (Figure 6F; Figure 6—figure supplement 1A; Figure 7C; Figure 7—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>In the course of revising the manuscript, we included additional quantifications, i.e., BxGal4-driver strength (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), dl-Drs-correlation (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>), <italic>dl<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>- and <italic>Drs<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-effect sizes (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A</xref>; Figure 5—figure supplement 2A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2G</xref>), Drs-expression (semi-quantitatively as part of the regulator screen, Figure 2—figure supplement 3C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3C</xref>), AttD-expression (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>), SG-size (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>), <italic>JNK</italic> activation (Figure 5—figure supplement 3B; Author response image2C), activated Dronc (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>; Author response image4C), Drs- and <italic>JNK</italic>-target expression via RNAseq and qPCR (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1F</xref>; Figure 5—figure supplement 3A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2E</xref>) and hemocyte attachment (Figure 4F-G).</p><p>To characterize the impact of continuous Ras-MAPK-signaling, we assayed nuclear volume as an indicator of pre-/absence of additional rounds of endoreplication. In line with the reviewers comment, DAPI has been described as a less efficient fluorochrome for measuring DNA content in the past due to its heterogeneity in nuclear distribution (Santisteban MS et al. J Histochem Cytochem. 1992;40(11):1789-1797. doi:10.1177/40.11.1431064). However, adjustments in the mounting and staining protocol as well as during image capture allow for DAPI to be used in a quantitative manner (Hamada S, Fujita S. Histochemistry. 1983;79, 219–226. doi:10.1007/BF00489783). By using Fluoromount G and reduced laser intensity we followed these recommendations to avoid photobleaching and adapt DAPI staining to quantify nuclear volumes. Moreover, DAPI has been used previously to quantify the occurrence of additional endoreplications in regenerating <italic>Drosophila</italic> midguts (Xiang J et al. Nat Commun. 2017 May9;8:15125. doi:10.1038/ncomms15125). However, having been aware of possible inconsistencies, we used a threshold-based method rather than aggregating fluorescence intensities. The former is more robust towards variability in DAPI intercalation enabling us to precisely locate and outline nuclei in confocal z-stacks and to quantify nuclear volume as a proxy rather than DNA content itself (Figure 1C; Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E; Figure 6C).</p><p>In parallel, we observed the occurrence of nuclear disintegration in the DPs of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands, which poses a two-fold problem for quantifications: (1) separating enlarged, but disintegrating from enlarged, intact nuclei in an unbiased manner and (2) separating nuclei in general due to the propensity of the DAPI-signal of disintegrating nuclei to fuse across cells and nuclei. Attempts to employ machine learning (i.e., support vector machines, k-means, Gaussian Mixture Models) to cluster disintegrating from enlarged nuclei as a prerequisite to quantify their volumes separately were not satisfactory and need more in-depth development. However, we recognized a clear separation between genotypes regarding the occurrence of nuclear disintegration, whereby <italic>p35;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-, <italic>jnk<sup>DN</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and <italic>Drs;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands do not show any disintegrating nuclei, only <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (Figure 6D). Thus, we chose to show quantifications of nuclear volume as a proxy for the amount of endoreplications alongside images of DAPI stained nuclei to visualize the sole occurrence of nuclear disintegrations in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands (Figure 6C-D). We believe that the conclusion we drew from these two datasets is covered by the presented evidence, namely (1) by inhibiting PCD (i.e., <italic>p35;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>) or inhibiting JNK signaling (i.e., <italic>jnk<sup>DN</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, <italic>Drs;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>) nuclear disintegration is prevented, whereas (2) the same interventions do not block the induction of further endoreplications.</p><p>As indicated in our summary model, <italic>Mmp2</italic> is involved in tissue disintegration in as much as its secretion promotes disruption of the basement membrane, the attraction of hemocytes and thus the activation of a systemic immune response towards the hypertrophic glands (Figure 4E-G; Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-C; Author response image A-B,D; Figure 8). We agree with the reviewer that this however needed clarification throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Apart from the above-stated experimental concerns, issue with data presentation also significantly dampens the enthusiasm for this study. The data-presentation is incredibly cumbersome; throughout, the text does not present clearly the rationale of their experimental design, some key figure panels are not even mentioned in the text, other key data is buried in the supplemental figures, while other data is replicated in separate figure panels without clear reasoning, and importantly most of the legends/labeling on the graphs are so small, they are illegible. This last issue makes this work nearly impossible to critically evaluate. Also, I would encourage the authors to use gene names and symbols on their figures that are understood by a wide readership. For example, Bsk might be alternatively JNK in S5.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed formatting of the figures including increasing font sizes, checked the presence of all figure panel references in the text, replaced gene names where possible (e.g., “<italic>jnk</italic>” instead of “bsk” as suggested by the reviewer). Supplemental figures that include data presented in the main figures show this data alongside additional genotypes in an extended format. By presenting a complete picture of all genotypes in the supplemental figures, we hope to ensure comparability amongst all datapoints.</p><p>Most importantly, we revised the manuscript’s text in order to emphasize the reason for conducted experiments as well as for the experimental set-ups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This article is interesting because it shows that some immune genes, mostly antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes, are induced in a highly artificial system in which the overgrowth of salivary glands is induced by ectopic expression of the Ras[V12] gain-of-function allele. The expression of immune genes would rely solely on Dorsal and not the Toll pathway (see below). The most important point is that the overexpression of Drosomycin is sufficient to reduce the induction of JNK-pathway regulated genes that occurs in the distal part of salivary glands, including pro-apoptotic genes, thus introducing the concept of a direct or indirect intracellular signaling function for an antimicrobial peptide.</p><p>In the longer term, it will be interesting to determine whether Dorsal plays a role in wild-type larval salivary glands and why it is differentially repressed in the DP.</p><p>Substantive concerns</p><p>1) The authors use RNAi lines to determine whether the Toll pathway is required for the induction of immune genes, which are not even validated. Since it is close to impossible to demonstrate the generation of a null phenotype by RNAi, the authors should imperatively use at least one null mutant of the Toll pathway, e.g., MyD88 and possibly spz.</p></disp-quote><p>We have almost exclusively used RNAi-lines for the screen of Toll-/imd-signal pathway components that were previously published and found to impact the expression of the targeted gene, alter expression and have a phenotype. The corresponding references are now listed in the Supplementary file 3. However, we agree entirely with the reviewer’s comment on the necessity to validate the involvement of the Toll-pathway independently. Thus, we crossed a mutant <italic>Myd88</italic>-allele in a hetero- or homozygous state into the <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-background (Figure 2—figure supplement 2E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3E</xref>). However, Drs-expression is not diminished at 120 h AED in the PP of <italic>Myd88<sup>/+</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- or <italic>Myd88<sup>-/-</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- compared to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands, whereas a <italic>dl</italic>-knock-out reduced Drs-expression significantly, indicating a dependence on <italic>dl</italic>, but not upstream Toll-signaling modules (Figure 2C; Figure 2—figure supplement 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should look at and quantify Dorsal nuclear localization in the salivary glands and not solely at its expression. Upon looking at Figure 2B, one gets the impression it is nuclear only in the very proximal region of the organ.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment on the value of quantifications based on antibody staining parallel to evaluating the expression. For this purpose, we captured z-stacks of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>glands containing the DrsGFP-reporter and stained for the presence of dorsal-protein. We used DAPI to define location and dimensions of the glands nuclei and exploited the nuclear signal of DrsGFP (i.e., proxy for cellular Drs-expression) to correlate dl and Drs expression (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Across the entire scale of quantified intensities (i.e., <italic>log<sub>10</sub></italic>-transformed; range covers entirety from non-detectable to high intensities throughout the nucleus), dl- and Drs-signal correlate strongly with one another in both the PP and DP as shown for 5 captured glands (i.e., Pearson correlation coefficient included for all 5 samples). More importantly, dlstaining is present in both PP and DP and occurs to stimulate Drs-expression in the entire gland epithelium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Multiple AMPs are induced in the PP and it is surprising that the one AMP they have overexpressed is having such a biological function. A control is missing, ideally a Drosomycin mutant in which disulfide bridges cannot form; at least a nonrelevant gene should be used as a control to exclude nonspecific effects linked to overexpression in the Ras[V12] context.</p></disp-quote><p>Among the induced AMPs in the acquired transcriptomes, only Drs and AttD showed considerable expression in the two sample populations derived from whole glands (i.e., <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>; Figure 3C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1F</xref>). Given the strong AttD-induction in the PP, its expression in the whole gland might not reflect the actual distribution (Figure 3C). Thus, we performed qPCRs on separated gland parts with AttD-primers, which revealed that AttD is exclusively expressed in the PP at 96 and 120 h AED (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). According to our data, Drs is thus the only AMP that is expressed in the DP of 96 h-old <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands. While this doesn’t exclude the possibility of other AMPs to function in a fashion similar to Drs, the latter is the only one present in the DP to alter <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-induced phenotypes until 96 h AED.</p><p>In parallel, we also overexpressed CecA1, the 4<sup>th</sup> highest expressed AMP in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and <italic>lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands and monitored <italic>CecA1</italic>-mRNA occurrence via ISH (Figure 3C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1F</xref>). While CecA1 is solely expressed in the PP of 120 h-old <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands, the employed CecA1-overepression construct driven by <italic>Bx<sup>MS1096</sup></italic> validates the possibility for CecA1 to be expressed and detected throughout the entire salivary gland (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2F</xref>). However, <italic>CecA1;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands only exhibited CecA1-staining in the PP, indicating a <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>induced block of post-transcriptional mRNA-accumulation. While the precise mechanism for this block remains to be elucidated, this result is opposed to the <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-coexpression, where co-expressed Drs could be detected throughout the gland (Figure 4A). This highlights the unique presence and function of Drs in the hypertrophic <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-model even further.</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree strongly with the reviewer’s comment on the relevance of a control to rule out non-specific effects derived from the overexpression of the UAS-Drs construct. To mimic Drosomycin’s entry into the secretory pathway, we combined a mCD8::RFP-construct with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> and repeated crucial experiments (i.e., CC3- and pJNKstaining, qPCR for Drs and <italic>JNK</italic>-target genes, measurement of gland size; Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-C; Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A-D</xref>). Co-expression of Drs with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> significantly reduces the activation of Dronc and <italic>JNK</italic> compared with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> alone, while co-expression of mCD8::RFP does not (Figure 5—figure supplement 3B; Figure 6—figure supplement 1C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B-D</xref>).</p><p>The difference between <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- and <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands is further confirmed by the performed qPCRs. Except for the <italic>JNK</italic>-target <italic>Mmp2</italic>, none of the screened genes displays significant expression differences in <italic>RFP;; Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- compared to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands at 96 h AED (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2E</xref>). At the same time point, the same genes are indeed significantly downregulated in <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- in contrast to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands. At 120 h, co-expression of Drs with <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>, but not mCD8::RFP, still reduces expression of Mmp1, <italic>Mmp2</italic> and upd1 significantly (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2E</xref>). In addition, <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands show a stronger absolute reduction of <italic>puc</italic>-, <italic>hid-</italic> and <italic>rpr-</italic>expression than <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands compared to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands alone, in spite of a significant reduction of these genes in <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands.</p><p>Most importantly, while co-expression of mCD8::RFP has a moderate, but significant impact on the expression of few of the <italic>JNK</italic> target genes at 120 h AED, <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>glands do not differ significantly in size from their <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-counterparts (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). <italic>Drs,Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands in turn are strongly overgrown indicating prolonged hypertrophic growth in the absence of <italic>JNK</italic>-activation and PCD. Crucially, the set of <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-control experiments indicates that Drs has a specific role in altering the physiology of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands that is not mimicked by merely overexpressing a mCD8::RFP-construct.</p><p>While not significant, <italic>RFP;;Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands are indeed slightly smaller than <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands. Since mCD8::RFP-marker constructs were to our knowledge not rigorously tested in polyploid tissues like salivary glands, it remains open as to whether mCD8::RFP itself has specific effects separate of Drs that would explain the minor reduction in tissue size. In addition, we have previously described <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-induced phenotypes, while co-expressing a cytoplasmic GFP, which did not diminish the reported effects either (Figure 2 and Figure 3 in Hauling T et al. Biol Open. 2014 Apr15;3(4):250-260. doi:10.1242/bio.20146494).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the Drosomycin RNAi line does not abolish the expression of its target gene and does not have such a &quot;drastic&quot; effect: several genes are only mildly more strongly expressed. It would be interesting to use a Drosomycin null mutant. Perhaps less important for this work but of interest, it would have been informative to test mutants affecting AMP families that have recently been published.</p></disp-quote><p>While we absolutely agree with the reviewer’s suggestion to use a null mutant to completely abolish Drs expression in further investigations, the <italic>Drs<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-line used throughout the manuscript exhibits a comprehensive reduction of Drs-expression levels. On average only 8% of the Drs-expression in <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands remains upon <italic>Drs<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-co-expression at 96 h AED and only 4% at 120 h AED, in line with the virtual absence of detected <italic>Drs</italic>-mRNA in ISH (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2G</xref>). In addition, as exemplified for hid and puc, by knocking Drs-expression down, <italic>puc</italic>-expression increases by almost 50% at 96 h AED and hid-expression increases by almost 100% at the same time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5C</xref>). As expected this increase of expression is diminished at 120 h AED (i.e., compared to <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>), due to the absence of Drs-expression in the distal part of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-glands, making a knock-down of <italic>Drs</italic> obsolete. Given the effect size of the used <italic>Drs<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-construct and its impact on <italic>JNK</italic>-target genes at 96 h AED, we believe that even without additional Drs-mutant experiments, we were able to show an effect opposite of Drs-overexpression by <italic>Drs<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>-co-expression to strengthen the validity of our model (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C-D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5C</xref>).</p><p>The reviewer’s suggestion to use the here presented hypertrophic model to test the functionality of additional AMPs as done in 2 recently published landmark papers paves intriguing possibilities for follw-up studies (Araki et al., 2019; Parvy et al., 2019). Since Drs was the only AMP expressed in the distal part until 96 h AED, downregulated thereafter and thus anti-correlated with the activation of <italic>JNK</italic>-signaling, we reasoned that Drs remains the only possible candidate to mount a tissue-autonomous immune response capable of explaining the shift in phenotypes from 96 h to 120 h AED. While this does not rule out similar activities of other AMPs in this or alternative models, the focus of the presented manuscript rested upon Drs as the naturally occurring AMP in this model and its role in regulating hypertrophic growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not clear whether Drosomycin is secreted in the lumen or basally in the hemolymph. To really conclude that this is a tissue-autonomous response, inasmuch the authors do not state whether Drosomycin is expressed in other tissues, it would be useful to overexpress Drosomycin in the fat body and test its effects on the DP of the salivary glands.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to detect Drs-expression in an unambiguous manner, we employed the previously published Drs-reporter including 2450 bp of the regulatory sequence upstream of the translation start site (Ferrandon D et al. EMBO J. 1998 Aug10;17(5):121727. doi:10.1093/emboj/ 17.5.1217). Due to its systemic presence, any non-tissue autonomous induction of Drosomycin in <italic>BxGal4&gt;UAS-Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>- or <italic>BxGal4&gt;UAS-lgl<sup>RNAi</sup>;UAS-Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-larvae would thus become obvious when monitored over time, as shown in other infection and wounding paradigms (Kenmoku H et al. Dis Model Mech. 2017 Mar1;10(3):271-281. doi:10.1242/dmm.027102; Kounatidis I et al. G3 (Bethesda). 2018;8(5):1637-1647. doi:10.1534/g3.118.200182). However, throughout larval and pupal development, a DrsGFP-signal was solely detected in the salivary glands with lymph glands, fat body, hemocytes or hematopoietic pockets all Drsnegative (Figure 1E; Figure 1—figure supplement 1E).</p><p>While we cannot unequivocally rule out interference from other tissues, the most parsimonious explanation based on the presented evidence is a tissue-autonomous expression and activity of Drs in the hypertrophic glands: (1) Expression and presence of Drs in a spatiotemporal pattern that precisely anti-correlates with the induction of <italic>JNK</italic>-signaling. (2) Rescue of tissue degradation in the distal part by Drs-overexpression across the gland’s epithelium at 120 h AED. (3) Further increase of <italic>JNK</italic>-activation upon tissue-wide knock-down of Drs at 96 h AED. (4) Physiological expression of dl as a crucial upstream activator of Drs in a spatiotemporal pattern completely overlapping with Drs. (5) Absence of any non-tissue-autonomous expression of Drs, especially no other dedicated immune organ.</p><p>We very much appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to test further inter-organ communication between the hypertrophic glands and amongst others the fat body and agree that further evaluations would be of interest. However, in the light of substantial evidence for a tissue-autonomous activity of Drs, we deem establishing, optimizing and validating a dualexpression system (i.e., 2 two-component expression systems, QF-QUAS or LexA-lexAop alongside Gal4-UAS) for parallel expression of <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> in the salivary glands and Drs in the fat body exceptional for an evaluating experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
