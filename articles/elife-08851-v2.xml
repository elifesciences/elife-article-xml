the highly specialised sperm and oocyte genomes are remodelled to confer totipotency. The mechanisms of the dramatic reprogramming events that occur have remained unknown, and presumed roles of histone modifying enzymes are just starting to be elucidated. Here, we explore the function of the oocyte-inherited pool of a histone H3K4 and K9 demethylase, LSD1/KDM1A during early mouse development. KDM1A deficiency results in developmental arrest by the two-cell stage, accompanied by dramatic and stepwise alterations in H3K9 and H3K4 methylation patterns. At the transcriptional level, the switch of the maternal-to-zygotic transition fails to be induced properly and LINE-1 retrotransposons are not properly silenced. We propose that KDM1A plays critical roles in establishing the correct epigenetic landscape of the zygote upon fertilization, in preserving genome integrity and in initiating new patterns of genome expression that drive early mouse development.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08851.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08851.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08851.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During fertilization, an egg cell and a sperm cell combine to make a cell called a zygote that then divides many times to form an embryo. Many of the characteristics of the embryo are determined by the genes it inherits from its parents. However, not all of these genes should be “expressed” to produce their products all of the time. One way of controlling gene expression is to add a chemical group called a methyl tag to the DNA near the gene, or to one of the histone proteins that DNA wraps around.</p><p>Soon after fertilization, a process called reprogramming occurs that begins with the rearrangement of most of the methyl tags a zygote inherited from the egg and sperm cells. This dynamic process is thought to help to activate a new pattern of gene expression. Reprogramming is assisted by “maternal factors” that are inherited from the egg cell.</p><p>KDM1A is a histone demethylase enzyme that can remove specific methyl tags from certain histone proteins, but how this affects the zygote is not well understood. Now, Ancelin et al. (and independently Wasson et al.) have investigated the role that KDM1A plays in mouse development.</p><p>Ancelin et al. genetically engineered mouse eggs to lack KDM1A and used them to create zygotes, which die before or shortly after they have divided for the first time. The zygotes display severe reprogramming faults (because methyl tags accumulate at particular histones) and improper gene expression patterns, preventing a correct maternal-to-zygotic transition. Further experiments then showed that KDM1A also regulates the expression level of specific mobile elements, which indicates its importance in maintaining the integrity of the genome.</p><p>These findings provide important insights on the crucial role of KDM1A in establishing the proper expression patterns in zygotes that are required for early mouse development. These findings might help us to understand how KDM1A enzymes, and histone demethylases more generally, perform similar roles in human development and diseases such as cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08851.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08851.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epigenetic reprogramming</kwd><kwd>histone demethylation</kwd><kwd>preimplantation development</kwd><kwd>lysine methylation</kwd><kwd>transcription regulation</kwd><kwd>retrotransposons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EU FP7 MODHEP EU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>259743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heard</surname><given-names>Edith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Labex DEEP</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LBX-0044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heard</surname><given-names>Edith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>IDEX idx PSL</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-IDEX-001-02 PSL</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heard</surname><given-names>Edith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The maternally provided histone demethylase LSD1/KDM1A has an instrumental role at the beginning of life, shaping the histone methylation landscape and the transcriptional repertoire of the early mouse embryo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gametes are highly differentiated cell types and fertilization of the oocyte by sperm requires major epigenetic remodelling to reconcile the two parental genomes and the formation of a totipotent zygote. In particular, the paternal genome arrives densely packed with protamines rather than histones, and the maternal epigenome is highly specialised. Maternal factors must unravel these specialised chromatin states to enable zygotic gene activation and development to proceed. Histone tail post-translational modifications (PTMs), and more specifically lysine methylation, appear to be dynamically regulated during this first step of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2010</xref>). Histone lysine methylation appears to have different biological read-outs, depending on the modified residue as well as the state of methylation (mono-, di- or tri-). For example, methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (referred to as H3K4 methylation hereafter) is mainly associated with transcriptionally active chromatin while methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (referred to as H3K9 methylation hereafter) is usually linked to repressive chromatin. The incorrect setting of some of these histone marks in cloned animals have been correlated with their poor development potential, pointing to their importance during early stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matoba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santos et al., 2003</xref>). However, the actors underlying these dynamic changes in histone modifications after fertilization and their impact on the appropriate regulation of zygotic genome function remain open questions.</p><p>Lysine methylation is tightly regulated by distinct families of conserved enzymes, histone lysine methyltransferases (KMTs), which add methyl groups and histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) which remove them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, KMTs and KDMs show different specificities for their target lysine substrates, as well as for the number of methyl group they can add or remove (from unmethylated -me0-, to dimethylated –me2, and trimethylated -me3; and vice versa).</p><p>Several KMTs and KDMs have been disrupted genetically in model organisms, including mouse, and their loss often leads to lethality or to severe defects in embryogenesis, or else in tissue-specific phenotypes in adults. This has been linked to their important roles in cell fate maintenance and differentiation, as well as in genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greer and Shi, 2012</xref>). However, investigating their potential roles during the first steps of development, after fertilization is frequently hampered by their maternal mRNA and/or protein pool, which can persist during early embryogenesis and mask the potential impact that the absence of such factors might have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In mice, conditional knock-outs in the female germline that suppress the maternal store of mRNA and protein at the time of fertilization, can be used to examine protein function during the earliest steps of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Vries et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewandoski et al., 1997</xref>). In this way, the roles of KMTs and KDMs during early embryogenesis are just starting to be explored. For example, it has been shown that depletion of maternal EZH2 affects the levels of H3K27 methylation in zygotes, although this did not lead to any growth defects during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Puschendorf et al., 2008</xref>). Another study investigated maternal loss of <italic>Mll2</italic> (Mixed lineage leukemia 2), encoding one of the main KMTs targeting H3K4 and revealed its essential role during oocyte maturation and for the embryos to develop beyond the two-cell stage, through gene expression regulation, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreu-Vieyra et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, in the presence of maternal EZH2 or MLL2 protein (when wt/- breeders are used), both <italic>Ezh2</italic> and <italic>Mll2</italic> null embryos die much later <italic>in utero</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Carroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glaser et al., 2006</xref>). The roles of these regulators of lysine methylation can thus be highly stage-specific, with very different effects at the zygote, early cleavage or later developmental stages.</p><p>The LSD1/KDM1A protein (encoded by the gene previously known as <italic>Lsd1</italic> but subsequently renamed <italic>Kdm1a,</italic> which will be the used in this manuscript hereafter) was the first histone KDM to be characterized to catalyse H3K4me1 and 2 demethylation and transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi et al., 2004</xref>). KDM1A was later shown to demethylate H3K9me2 and to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Metzger et al., 2005</xref>). Genetic deletion of murine <italic>Kdm1a</italic> during embryogenesis obtained by mating of heterozygous animals showed early lethality prior to gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foster et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macfarlan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">2009</xref>). In light of the above considerations, we set out to study the impact of eliminating or inhibiting the maternal pool of KDM1A during preimplantation development. We report for the first time the crucial role of <italic>Kdm1a</italic> following fertilization. The absence of KDM1A protein in zygotes derived from <italic>Kdm1a</italic> null oocytes led to a developmental arrest at the two-cell stage, with a severe and stepwise accumulation of H3K9me3 from the zygote stage, and of H3K4me1/2/3 at the two-cell stage. These chromatin alterations coincide with increased perturbations in the gene expression repertoire, based on single embryo transcriptomes, leading to an incomplete switch from the maternal to zygotic developmental programs. Furthermore, absence of KDM1A resulted in deficient suppression of LINE-1 retrotransposon expression, and increased genome damage, possibly as a result of increased LINE-1 activity. Altogether, our results point to an essential role for maternally-inherited KDM1A in maintaining appropriate temporal and spatial patterns of histone methylation while preserving genome expression and integrity to ensure embryonic development beyond the two-cell stage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Depletion of maternal KDM1A protein results in developmental arrest at two-cell stage</title><p>To investigate whether <italic>Kdm1a</italic> might have a role during early mouse development we first assessed whether the protein was present in pre-implantation embryos using immunofluorescence (IF) and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

We found that the proportion of △m/wt two-cell stage embryos recovered (19%, n = 39/206) was far lower than that obtained with f/wt embryos (75% n = 170/226) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Using <italic>Kdm1a</italic><sup>f/f</sup>::<italic>Zp3<sup>cre</sup></italic> females, we also noted a high percentage of fertilized and unfertilized oocytes blocked at meiosis II (MII) (n = 95; 46%) compared to those recovered from control females (n = 34; 15%). Inspection of control (n = 75) and mutant (n = 55) MII oocytes revealed a high proportion of misaligned chromosomes on the metaphase spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>) in mutants (41%) compared to controls (17%), suggesting that a lack of maternal KDM1A can lead to chromosome segregation defects. Furthermore, upon fertilization, transmission of inherited chromosomal abnormalities was clearly evident, with the frequent presence of micronuclei in KDM1A maternally depleted two-cell embryos (n = 40; 63%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Lastly, 19% (n = 39) of mutant embryos were still at the zygote stage compared to 0% in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results indicate that many MII oocytes lacking germline KDM1A are not competent at ovulation and that when fertilized their first cell cycle is delayed. Similar results were obtained when using females not subjected to superovulation for mating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We next assessed the progress of surviving △m/wt two-cell embryos by culturing them in vitro.

The mutant embryos blocked at the two-cell stage did not progress further in development upon prolonged in vitro culture, and eventually fragmented, while the control embryos progressed towards the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the sterility of <italic>Kdm1a</italic> germline mutant females is in part caused by a severely compromised spindle organization in some oocytes in the second round of meiosis,as well as for the second round of cleavage after fertilization.

Our results show that KDM1B in the female germline is not sufficient to rescue the phenotype of KDM1A maternal depletion after fertilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Inhibition of the enzymatic activity of KDM1A from early zygote stage mimics the maternal deletion phenotype</title><p>The developmental arrest observed at the two-cell stage of △m/wt embryos could be due to defects carried over by the mutant oocytes, particularly given the chromosome defects observed in a significant proportion of arrested oocytes, and/or to a requirement for KDM1A function after fertilization. To assess a requirement for KDM1A enzymatic activity in early embryos, we tested the impact of KDM1A catalytic inhibition specifically after fertilization. To this end, we treated wild-type zygotes with pargyline, a well-characterized potent chemical inhibitor of KDM1A enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fierz and Muir, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Metzger et al., 2005</xref>) and followed their development <italic>in vitro</italic> over 48 hr. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, 76% embryos cultured with pargyline were found to be significantly blocked at the two-cell stage and 17% never progressed beyond the 3/4-cell stage. On the contrary, the majority (94%) of mock treated embryos developed to the eight-cell stage within 48 hr, as expected. These data parallel the phenotype of genetic ablation of the KDM1A maternal pool, where 96% of △m/wt embryos are developmentally arrested at the two-cell stage and 4% at the 3/4-cell stage. Taken together, the genetic depletion and pargyline inhibition data strongly support a requirement for KDM1A enzymatic activity during the zygote and two-cell stage, for embryos to proceed beyond the two-cell stage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Abnormal increase of H3K9me3 levels in KDM1A maternally deficient zygotes</title><p>The above observations suggested that the histone demethylase KDM1A plays an important role in early development.

Even more surprisingly, in △m/wt zygotes, H3K9me3 could be detected at the periphery of paternal NLBs (yellow arrowhead), when compared to controls. Taken together, these observations show that the absence of maternal KDM1A protein results in specifically elevated levels of H3K9me3 in both parental genomes at the zygote stage, and suggest that KDM1A might be engaged with other chromatin modifiers to regulate H3K9me3 immediately after fertilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Abnormal H3K4 and H3K9 methylation patterns after the first cleavage division in KDM1A maternally depleted embryos</title><p>In order to investigate whether KDM1A activity was important for the regulation of H3K4 and K9 methylation after the first cell cleavage, we examined two-cell stage f/wt and △m/wt embryos by IF to measure the relative fluorescence intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

For a direct comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome upon lack of KDM1A, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for single oocytes and single embryos at the two-cell stage on a cohort of control and mutant samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The method used is based on that of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tang et al., 2010</xref>) which captures poly(A) tail mRNA and allows examination up to 3kb from the 3’ end. The quality of our single oocyte or embryo cDNAs was first checked by qPCR for three housekeeping genes (<italic>Hprt, Gapdh, Ppia</italic>) known to be stably expressed from oocytes to blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mamo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vandesompele et al., 2002</xref>). Control and mutant samples displayed similar relative expression for these three genes attesting to the quality of our samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We next prepared cDNA libraries from single control and mutant oocytes (n = 5 each), as well as individual f/wt and △m/wt embryos (n = 8 each) and performed Illumina-based deep RNA sequencing on these samples (see experimental procedures and analysis for more details; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We used DEseq as a normalization method across our samples to assess the relative gene expression between controls and mutants.</p><p>At the two-cell stage, our analysis revealed two sets of genes that become either upregulated (21%; n = 2449; FDR = 5%) or downregulated (24%; n = 2749) in the mutant when compared to control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Hierarchal clustering based on the transcription profiles showed that all <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant embryos clustered distinctly from the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, the analysis of oocyte transcriptomes also revealed that there were fewer genes misregulated in <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant oocytes, than in <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Moreover, Principal Component Analysis demonstrated that the gene expression patterns showed greater differences between controls and mutants at the two-cell stage, than in oocytes, and that the two different stages cluster away from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The stage comparison also showed that only a subset of genes were misregulated in common, in both oocytes and two-cell stage embryos, upon loss of maternal KDM1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). GO analysis of up or down regulated genes at the two-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) or oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>) revealed very little overlap in the specific biological functions affected by loss of function of KDM1A before and after fertilization, with the notable exception of cell cycle associated genes. This connects well with the observed phenotype for poor oocyte competence at fertilization and the total developmental arrest at the two-cell stage. These results reveal that absence of maternal KDM1A most likely leads to transcriptome changes during oocyte maturation, but to even more serious defects after zygotic gene activation, at the two-cell stage. The latter may be due in part to an aberrant maternal supply of transcripts/proteins, or else to aberrant transcriptional regulation of the zygotic genome in absence of maternal KDM1A.</p><p>We assessed our two-cell stage RNA-seq data according to the recent Database of Transcriptome in Mouse Early Embryos (DBTMEE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2013</xref>). DBTMEE was built from an ultra-large-scale whole transcriptome profile analysis of preimplantation embryos, in which genes are classified depending on which transcription waves (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) they are expressed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> (see also Table 1), we assessed the percentage of genes of each of our classes (up; down and not significantly changed) that overlapped with the different DBTMEE categories of transcription switches, from oocyte to two-cell stage. Strikingly, the upregulated genes in △m/wt embryos fall essentially into the earliest stages and belong to genes annotated as maternal (37% of this category), as minor ZGA genes (39%) and as zygotic-transient (38%). We checked whether the misregulation of these three categories of genes might originate from the oocyte stage changes. We found that only 56 out of 360 of maternal genes, 94 out of 540 of minor ZGA genes and 6 out of 34 of 1C transient (Table 1 and data not shown) were already upregulated in mutant oocytes. These results reinforce the conclusion that the maternal and zygotic pools of transcripts become more compromised as development proceeds toward the two-cell stage in mutant embryos, rather than being aberrant right from the <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant germline. In clear contrast, the majority of downregulated genes in the △m/wt were found to belong to the three categories of genes that are normally activated at the two-cell stage, with 50% in the major ZGA class, 37% in the two-cell transient and 50% in the MGA (Mid zygotic gene activation). This suggests that absence of KDM1A compromises the activation of gene expression by the two-cell stage.</p><p>In order to validate our RNA seq data and the analysis done, we selected four genes with characteristic expression profiles, <italic>Atrx</italic> (maternal), <italic>H2Az</italic> (major ZGA), <italic>Suv39h1</italic> (2C-transient)<italic>, Klf4</italic> (MGA), which all encode chromatin associated factors crucial for early mouse development. Validation was performed by RT-qPCR in control and mutant oocytes and two-cell embryos. As predicted from our RNA seq results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), <italic>H2AZ, Suv39h1 and Klf4</italic> failed to be expressed at two-cell stage in <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast <italic>Atrx</italic> which is a known maternal factor, but which is zygotically expressed by the two cell stage, was correctly activated. No difference in expression of <italic>Suv39h1, Klf4</italic> and <italic>Atrx</italic> could be seen between controls and mutants at the oocyte stage, implying that the maternal pool of these mRNAs was not affected by the maternal KDM1A depletion.</p><p>This single embryo transcriptome profiling data reveals an aberrant gene expression profile in <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant embryos, which is likely due to an absence or delay in the transcription switch from maternal-zygote to the two-cell stage pattern for a substantial set of genes (47%; 1818 out of 3811 considered; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together with the changes in chromatin profiles that we observed at the two-cell stage, we conclude that part of the deficiency in developmental progression could be due to the inappropriate setting of a successful zygotic gene expression program upon KDM1A loss.</p><p>A gene ontology (GO) analysis of the up-regulated genes classified as maternal to zygote-transient in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, revealed a clear over-representation of genes involved in protein transport and localisation as well as contribution to cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). GO analysis of the downregulated genes from major-to-mid-zygotic activation are implicated in ribosome biogenesis and translation processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that KDM1A is necessary for the transcriptional regulation of specific genetic pathways implicated in fundamental biological functions such as protein production and localisation, and cell cycle regulation. These combined defects could be consistent with the inability of the mutant embryos to develop further than the two-cell stage</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Impact of KDM1A absence on repeat elements, genome integrity and DNA replication</title><p>Many transposable elements are known to be expressed in early mouse embryos, as early as zygotic stage, and some of these repeat elements might even be competent for new events of retrotransposition between fertilization and implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fadloun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peaston et al., 2004</xref>). The repression of some of these transposable elements during preimplantation has been correlated with loss of active chromatin marks such as H3K4me3, rather than acquisition of heterochromatic marks such as H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fadloun et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, a previous study using <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant mESCs and late preimplantation embryos found a significant impact on MERVL:LTR repeat expression (for Murine endogenous retrovirus-like LTR), as well as a good correlation for the presence of remnant ERVs within 2kb of the transcription start site of KDM1A-repressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macfarlan et al., 2011</xref>). The increased levels of H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 that we found in △m/wt two-cell stage embryos and the reported role of KDM1A in late preimplantation embryos prompted us to analyze the effects of maternal KDM1A depletion on repetitive element expression after fertilization. To this end, we investigated our RNA-seq data from control and <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant two-cell embryos for the relative expression of repetitive elements. As our single embryo RNA seq approach was based on oligo-dT priming this restricted our analysis to reads at the 3’ ends of transcripts, which somewhat limited our capacity to detect repeat variation. In particular we could not determine which specific LINE-1 families were expressed in the mutants, nor whether the LINE-1 reads we detected corresponded to full-length,and/or intact elements. Nevertheless, our results shows that by far the most abundant categories of expressed repeats at this stage of development were LTRs (long terminal repeat) and non-LTR retrotransposons in f/wt and △m/wt (95% and 92%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, no significant impact on expression could be detected in the mutants, with the exception within the non-LTR elements, of quite a significant overrepresentation of LINEs, but not SINEs (for Long/Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements element) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). We validated this result by RT-qPCR using individually prepared cDNAs of two-cell stage embryos for three transposable element classes. LINE-1, SINE B1 and MuERV-L transcripts are all abundantly expressed in control and mutant embryos, but LINE-1 levels show a two-fold increase in the △m/wt embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). No significant up-regulation was seen in ERV-promoter driven genes, that had previously reported to be affected by loss of KDM1A in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macfarlan et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08851.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Increased LINE-1 protein levels and γH2AX foci in two-cell embryos depleted for KDM1A.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pie chart representing the percent of each category of repeats analyzed in our 16 RNA-seq data of individual embryos.

We first assessed the quality of our assay by checking the <italic>Atrx</italic> gene, known to be transcribed at the two-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Patrat et al., 2009</xref>) and expressed at similar levels in mutant and control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). A comparable proportion of f/wt embryos and △m/wt two-cell embryos displayed detectable ongoing transcription, as registered by a pinpoint at this locus. Using a probe spanning the full-length LINE-1 element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chow et al., 2010</xref>), we detected LINE-1 RNA in control two-cell stage embryos as displayed by the punctate pattern in nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fadloun et al., 2013</xref>), while RNase-A treated embryos showed no signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In the maternally depleted embryos, the arrangement of fluorescent foci appeared extensively modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This was confirmed upon analysis of the fluorescence intensity distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> left) as well as the image composition for the foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> right), which in both cases significantly separated the two types of samples. Our analysis revealed that the active LINE-1 transcription profiles were extensively modified upon the loss of maternal KDM1A.</p><p>To investigate whether the increase in nascent LINE-1 transcription observed might correspond to full length LINE-1 elements, we assessed by IF for the presence of ORF1, one of the two LINE-1 encoded proteins. At the two-cell stage, we found an approximately four-fold increase in the proportion of △m/wt embryos displaying a stronger IF signal, notably in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results suggest that the LINE-1 deregulation observed at the RNA level might indeed lead to the production and nuclear import of increased levels of LINE-1 ORF1 proteins. We next investigated whether expression of such proteins from transposable elements would have any consequences. We thus performed γH2AX IF staining to assess whether increased DNA damage signalling could be seen in △m/wt compared to f/wt embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Half of the mutant embryos displayed a stronger staining for γH2AX, with a significant increase compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We also assessed whether this accumulation of γH2AX signals could also be related to replication delays, as reported previously in the case of maternal loss of two components of the polycomb complex PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Posfai et al., 2012</xref>). We performed EdU pulse treatment (a nucleoside analog of thymidine incorporated into DNA) in two-cell embryos, at a stage when they have normally completed S phase (40–41 hr post hCG injection). This revealed that S phase is delayed in the △m/wt embryos given the incorporation of EdU in the mutants, while none of the control embryos used in parallel were stained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). All the mutant embryos delayed in their replication displayed concomitantly intense γH2AX signals. However, 38% of the mutant embryos did not show any EdU incorporation, indicating that they exit S phase, yet, they still show high levels of γH2AX signals. Finally, although, no significant enrichment was directly found for DNA damage pathways when running our GO analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), many genes related to DNA damage repair were upregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Taken all together, these results suggest that the elevated DNA damage signalling observed could be independent from replication defaults in KDM1A maternally depleted embryos, but might be related either to changes in transcript levels for DNA damage genes or else to the observed increase in LINE-1 activity in <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant embryos at this stage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The oocyte stores maternal factors that besides ensuring the first steps of development prior to zygotic genome activation, also enable the epigenetic reprogramming of the parental genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burton and Torres-Padilla, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Messerschmidt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lorthongpanich et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Seisenberger et al., 2013</xref>). Although the dynamics of histone modifications have been assessed, the biological relevance of such changes and the identification of the histone modifying enzymes involved in this process are only starting to be identified. In this study, we have focused on the critical function of KDM1A, a histone demethylase for H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/me2, that we find acts as a maternal chromatin factor at the time egg fertilization. We show that maternal KO results in abnormal oocytes at the time of ovulation (at meiosis II stage) and prevents development of fertilized eggs beyond the two-cell stage. Similar oocyte defects and developmental block were also observed in the accompanying paper by Wasson et al, where two other independent conditional alleles were used to induce deletion of KDM1A in oocytes, using Zp3-Cre or Gdf9 Cre. In a recent study maternal depletion of KDM1A was found to affect the first division of meiosis and leads to early apoptosis during oocyte growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these studies show that KDM1A is required during the formation of the female gametes for the two steps of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; this study; Wasson et al. ). Our study also reveals that KDM1A is required as a key factor during early post-zygotic embryo development, as the enzymatic inhibition of KDM1A in wild-type embryos resulted in developmental arrest at the two-cell stage, comparable to maternal deletion. We further show that KDM1A is a major regulator of histone H3K4 and H3K9 methylation patterns at the one-two cell stages and that it controls early switches in transcription patterns during development. KDM1A may also have a potential role in the appropriate repression of some LINE-1 retroviral elements.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>KDM1A and the modulation of histone methylation after fertilization</title><p>H3K4me1/2/3 levels have been shown to increase from the zygote to the two-cell stage, before decreasing again by the four-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shao et al., 2014</xref>). To date, only one H3K4 KMT, MLL2, has been shown to be necessary at the two-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreu-Vieyra et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we report that the maternal pool of the KDM, KDM1A, is also necessary at this stage, with its loss leading to global elevation of H3K4me1/2/3. Noticeably, no changes in transcription levels of genes encoding the main H3K4me2/3 KMTs were recorded (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This suggests that KDM1A is a key regulator of H3K4 methylation post-fertilization.</p><p>Moreover, in absence of KDM1A, the transcripts encoding for two main KMTs (SUV39H2/KMT1B and SETDB1/KMT1E) targeting H3K9me1/2 during preimplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Puschendorf et al., 2008</xref>) are well detected in two-cell stage mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These KMTs could be able to generate H3K9me3 from the excess of H3K9me1/2, produced because of the absence of KDM1A.</p><p>In conclusion, KDM1A most likely acts in combination with other chromatin regulators in order to keep a tight balance of the global H3K4/K9 methylation levels during early embryonic development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>KDM1A is involved in the transcriptional switch at the two-cell stage</title><p>One of the most striking consequences of lack of maternal KDM1A that we observed was the disruption of the wave-like gene expression patterns previously described at the onset of mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamatani et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). At the two-cell stage, we saw a significant increase in mRNA levels of genes normally expressed maternally or at the zygote stage, and this increase relates more to post-fertilization disruption rather than inherited defects from <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant germline. The accompanying manuscript by Wasson et al reports similar findings concerning transcriptional regulation by maternal KDM1A in early stage post fertilization. Maternal and zygotic mRNA excess could reflect a reduced rate of mRNA degradation, maybe related to the developmental arrest, or else the severe impairment of the mutant embryos in the ribosome biogenesis pathways could preclude the translation machinery of their usage and clearance or else a change in the cytoplasmic polyadenylation of the maternal pool of mRNA could also be disturbing their utilization. Lastly, their abundance could also be due, maybe partly, to an increased transcription rate for these genes (and more specifically the one corresponding to the minor ZGA). Given the accumulation of H3K4 methylation that we show in our study for the mutants at this stage and the proven link of this mark with enhanced transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black et al., 2012</xref>), we hypothesise that KDM1A might normally be involved in the transcriptional down-regulation of these genes via H3K4 demethylation. Chromatin-based repression is thought to be superimposed on zygotic genome activation and is necessary for the transition from the two-cell to the four-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma and Schultz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nothias et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wiekowski et al., 1997</xref>). We propose that KDM1A might be part of such a mechanism, and required for a transition towards two-cell stage specific gene expression patterns (ie in the major ZGA and MGA waves), and therefore for proper development beyond the two-cell stage. The significant absence of the major ZGA and MGA waves in the transcriptome of <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutants supports this hypothesis. Whether misplaced or increased H3K9 methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) could be involved in failure of transcription activation is not known, but one can speculate that such repressive chromatin and/or absence of KDM1A itself might impair correct recruitment of transcription regulators. So far, a small subset of such factors (TFs and co-regulators) acting at ZGA-gene promoters has recently been suggested to orchestrate the appropriate gene expression patterns following fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). Although, KDM1A was not reported in this study, our results suggest that maternal KDM1A is nonetheless crucial for shaping the transcriptome in early life. Its role in oocyte and embryogenesis may have long lasting effects, as reported in the accompanying paper by Wasson et al where a hypomorphic maternal KDM1A, associated with perinatal lethality, showed alterations in imprinted gene expression much later in life. The importance of the maternal pool of KDM1A opens up exciting prospects for the roles of this remarkable histone demethylase in early development.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>KDM1A is instrumental in preserving the genome integrity</title><p>The control of repeat elements by epigenetic mechanisms, including histone KMTs and KDMs, may be critical in early development. Previous work has suggested that KDM1A may contribute to MERVL element repression in late pre-implantation embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Macfarlan et al., 2011</xref>). We did not detect any impact on these elements in the <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutants immediately post fertilization. However, we did see a small but significant increase in LINE-1 expression and LINE-1 ORF1 protein levels in the <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant embryos. This observation, together with the striking elevation in H3K4me3 levels, is of particular interest in the context of a recent study which proposed that loss of H3K4m3 at LINE-1 elements (rather than a gain in H3K9 methylation) might be critical for their repression during early pre-implantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fadloun et al., 2013</xref>). Whether this increase in LINE-1 expression actually leads to an increase in LINE-1 element retrotransposition (ie new insertions) remains to be seen, but the increase in LINE-1 proteins observed in <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant embryos is potentially consistent with such a possibility. In this context, we speculate that misregulation of LINE-1 elements in the absence of KDM1A might participate in the early developmental arrest that is observed, via an increased potential of genome instability and activation of some specific DNA damage checkpoints. The increase in γH2AX foci we detected in <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutants, independently from replication stalling problems, could also be consistent with this hypothesis. Our results thus support the hypothesis that histone-based defence mechanisms act to safeguard the genome from LINE-1 retrotransposition during preimplantation development, when global DNA hypomethylation might compromises their usual silencing route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leung &amp; Lorincz, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Finally, chromatin status and regulated expression of another family of repeats, located within pericentric heterochromatin, has been proposed to be involved in developmental progression after fertilization, ensuring correct chromosome segregation and heterochromatin propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Probst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Santenard et al., 2010</xref>). In the absence of KDM1A, we detected aberrant accumulation of H3K9me3 at presumptive pericentric heterochromatin (NLBs) post-fertilization, as well as lagging chromosomes in oocytes, and micronuclei accumulation following fertilisation. Collectively, this data points to maternal KDM1A protein having a potential role at pericentromere/centromere regions that merits future exploration.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the instrumental role of KDM1A as a maternally provided protein at the beginning of life in shaping the histone methylation landscape and the transcriptional repertoire of the early embryo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental methods</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Collection of mouse embryos and in vitro culture</title><p>All mice used were handled with care and according to the guidelines from French legislation and institutional policies.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers, one of whom, Gavin Kelsey, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The reviewers all agree that the work represents a significant advance but have suggested several revisions. The Reviewing editor has drafted a set of comments from the reviews to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This report demonstrates a requirement for the H3K4/H3K9 demethylase KDM1A/LSD1 as a maternally provided product in zygotic genome activation in the mouse. It provides evidence that genetically depriving oocytes of LSD1 leads to embryonic arrest by the two-cell stage. Importantly, the authors show that they can phenocopy the effect by culturing embryos in the presence of an LSD1 inhibitor, demonstrating that the effect depends upon lack of catalytic activity of LSD1 in the embryo itself, rather than a compromise in the oocyte. Furthermore, they show altered levels of H3K4 and H3K9 methylation in zygotes and/or 2-cell embryos and, by RNA-seq, that there is a failure properly to activate a substantial proportion of genes that are induced at zygotic genome activation. In addition, they show up-regulation specifically of LINE1 repeats and, importantly, demonstrate this to be at the transcriptional level by RNA-FISH of nascent transcripts. Overall, this is an important finding that reveals that <italic>Lsd1</italic> is a maternal effect gene, and that correct regulation of H3K4 and/or H3K9 methylation is essential for correct expression of embryonic genes.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The mechanistic connections between oocyte LSD1 deficiency and the gene expression effects in the embryo can only be speculated upon; e.g., the possible effects of H3K4 demethylation at enhancers for orderly silencing, or failure to remove repressive H3K9 methylation. And this gap is understandable, given the limitations of ChIP-seq on low numbers of cells, compounded by the reduced number of zygotes and 2-cell embryos from <italic>Lsd/Zp3-Cre</italic> deficient females. Specifically regarding the observed elevated LINE1 expression, the proposed link with H3K4 demethylation seems plausible (as in Fadloun et al. 2013) and potentially easier to test. Given recent advances in ChIP methods for low numbers of cells and highly abundant features such as LINEs as the target of assessment (Fadloun et al. 2013, Brind'Amour et al. 2015), a ChIP-qPCR assay at LINE1s could be done.</p><p>2) Ancelin et al. suggest that activation of Line1 elements is contributing to the increased DNA damage and developmental arrest seen in <italic>Lsd1 Δm/wt</italic> embryos. Only a subset of Line1 elements are active and able to retrotranspose in the genome, and different mechanisms for H3K9me3 deposition appear to be action different Line1 families. It would be informative for Ancelin et al. to extract information about which families of Line1 element are activated in <italic>Lsd1</italic> Δm/wt from their RNA sequencing data or through RT-qPCR. Increased Line1 jumping in the genome would require active Line1 families (A, Tf, Gf) to be upregulated.</p><p>3) The authors propose that Line1 elements might cause the DNA damage seen in <italic>Lsd1</italic> Δm/wt embryos. The gH2AX image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> shows a lot of DNA damage in the <italic>Lsd1</italic> Δm/wt embryos. There would need to be a lot of active jumping of Line1 to generate this amount of DNA damage, yet Line1 transcript levels are only elevated around 2-fold. It's possible that the elevated DNA damage in <italic>Lsd1</italic> Δm/wt could be caused by some of the thousands of gene transcripts that are mis-regulated in these embryos rather than Line1. The authors could make this clearer. In particular, gH2AX signals normally arise during DNA replication. Maternal depletion of polycomb proteins causes defects in zygotic gene activation and impaired DNA replication in 2 cell embryos, and a similar increase in embryos with strong gH2AX staining as is reported by Ancelin et al. (see Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in Posfai et al., 2012, Genes Dev Vol 26 p920-932). In the 2 cell embryos that Ancelin et al. show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, does the difference in gH2AX staining between the <italic>Lsd1</italic> Δm/wt and control embryos primarily reflect the mutant embryos arresting or delaying progression through the mid 2 cell stage/DNA replication rather than Line1-induced DNA damage?</p><p>4) It is somewhat disappointing that one major finding namely significant effect on the second meiosis was essentially ignored (beside brief description). One would expect that the authors invest some time in trying to provide mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon and not just say that it &quot;merits further exploration&quot;. It would be of interest to see what is happening during meiosis I and this should be included in the revised manuscript. In addition, the only significant molecular information is the transcriptome comparison between the maternally deleted and wt 2-cell stage embryos i.e. period of zygotic genome activation (ZGA). However, the ZGA is entirely regulated by the maternally inherited molecules; proteins and RNAs. Proteome comparison would be technically quite difficult but transcriptome comparison between maternally deleted and wt oocyte is possible, necessary and should be included and interpreted in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is one of the most important mechanisms controlling the utilization of many maternal mRNAs and it would be very important to determine how it functions during maturation of mutant oocytes and after fertilization in zygotes.</p><p>5) The authors describe a significant proportion of Δm/wt embryo arrested at zygote stage. They used superovulation and that could potentiate this effect and possibly other observed differences. It would have been much better if superovulation was not used in all experiments, however it would not be fair to ask the authors to repeat everything. Nevertheless, they could and should determine if the effect on zygote to 2-cell stage transition in Δm/wt is ameliorated when using normal matings without superovulation.</p><p>6) The authors report elevated levels of H3K9me3 in both paternal and maternal pronuclei in zygotes, elevated H3K9me1/2/3 in 2-cell embryos and elevated H3K4me1/2/3 in two cell embryos, based on immunofluorescence staining. Quantifying IF intensity is an inexact science. Although I think the conclusions are probably valid, the quantification is based on comparing IF intensity between embryos and there does not seem to be any obvious internal control. Granted, the embryos are processed in parallel and equivalent image settings are used, etc., but ideally fluorescence intensity of the modification of interest would be compared to an internal reference. For example, the authors report that levels of H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 do not differ between controls and mutant (as expected), so one or other of these modifications could be used as an internal control in dual staining for greater confidence of the changes seen (or total H3).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;LSD1 is an essential regulator of the chromatin and transcriptional landscapes during the maternal-to-zygotic transition&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers recognise that there are additional mechanistic insights into the phenotypes that would be interesting to pursue and the editors agree that these are outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors addressed (or attempted to address) most of the comments. They also provided some additional experiments and discussed why some of the requested experiments could not be performed. The arguments (shortage of time, being out of the scope of the investigation, limit imposed by the available number of embryos) seem overall reasonable and justified. The manuscript is of sufficient quality and interest to justify publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors have responded appropriately and constructively to my comments and those of the other reviewers. They have added some important new data that directly address issues raised, and these new data include assessment of timing of DNA replication, and single-cell RNA-seq on <italic>Lsd</italic>-null oocytes, which reveals distinct transcriptional defects in oocytes and in two-cell embryos. As before, I believe that the LSD1 inhibitor experiment is an important component of the study to show that impairments in embryo progression depend upon absence of LSD1 activity in embryos, in addition to any consequence of developmental defects in oocytes themselves. There is clearly more to extract on the mechanistic side of the phenotypes described, but this will require investigations beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This revised manuscript shows quite convincingly that a conditional deletion of LSD1, a histone lysine demethylase, in growing oocytes results in post-fertilization defects in pre-implantation development with the resulting embryos arresting primarily at the 2 cell stage. The authors show by immunofluorescence that histone H3K9 methylation is altered in the mutant zygotes, and that histone H3K4 and H3K9 methylation levels are altered in 2 cell embryos. The authors perform RNA seq transcriptomic analysis on mutant oocytes and 2 cell embryos that transcription profiles are also changed with the 2 cell embryos seemingly unable to activate zygotic gene activation. The authors also show that L1 retrotransposon transcripts and protein are elevated in mutant 2 cell embryos, and that these embryos also have increased amounts of the DNA damage marker gH2AX.</p><p>In response to the reviewers’ comments the authors have tried show which subtype of L1 retrotransposon is upregulated, and tested if the increased abundance of gH2AX represents a delay in cell cycle or S phase progression rather than L1 integrating into the genome as suggested in the original submission.</p><p>The authors included in their response to reviewers’ comments data showing that they could not detect upregulation of RNA for any of the three active subclasses of L1 in the LSD1 mutant embryos. The authors conclude in their response that &quot;Nevertheless the higher levels of L1 ORF protein that we observed in mutant embryos suggest that certain L1 elements must be up-regulated in the absence of <italic>Lsd1</italic>, but that the LINEs at the origin of this are not systematically from one family/type&quot;. How can the authors exclude the possibility that the upregulated L1 RNA and protein represents full length but catalytically inactive L1 subfamilies such as L1_MdF? Data from ES cells shows that different L1 subfamilies are repressed epigenetic mechanisms (Castro-Diaz et al., Genes Dev. 2014 Jul 1;28(13):1397-409), so it's certainly possible that only inactive subfamilies of L1 are being upregulated in LSD1 mutant embryos. If the upregulated L1's do not originate from an active subfamily, and rather represent full length but catalytically inactive copies of L1 such as those found in the L1_MdF subfamilies, how can the increase in gH2AX be caused by L1?

And this gap is understandable, given the limitations of ChIP-seq on low numbers of cells, compounded by the reduced number of zygotes and 2-cell embryos from Lsd/Zp3-Cre deficient females. Specifically regarding the observed elevated LINE1 expression, the proposed link with H3K4 demethylation seems plausible (as in Fadloun</italic> et al. <italic>2013) and potentially easier to test. Given recent advances in ChIP methods for low numbers of cells and highly abundant features such as LINEs as the target of assessment (Fadloun</italic> et al. <italic>2013, Brind'Amour</italic> et al.</p><p> <italic>2015), a ChIP-qPCR assay at LINE1s could be done.</italic> </p><p>Although we appreciate that this is a valuable point and a fair request, unfortunately, the limited numbers of embryos that we can obtain from <italic>Kdm1a/Lsd1</italic> mutant female mice preclude the use of ChIP-qPCR to address defects in H3 methylationin <italic>Lsd1</italic>-depleted embryos. As discussed in the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), <italic>Kdm1a/Lsd1</italic> deletion leads to severely reduced embryo numbers, even when using superovulation. Consequently, only very limited number of two-cell embryos could be isolated for a given experiment from each female. On average we only obtain 3 to 4 two-cell embryo per female carrying <italic>Lsd1</italic> conditional KO in her germline: i.e. for 206 oocytes or embryos collected from 12 females, we only obtain 20% (two-cell stage mutant embryos = 3-4 two-cell embryos per female. Thus, in order to collect even 1000 cells (the lowest numbers for which ChIP has been performed adequately – for example in germ cells – Brind'Amour, Nature Communication 2015), we would need 500 embryos which means at least 100 mutant females. Unfortunately, this is just not feasible in our animal facility and would also not be acceptable according to current animal welfare legislation. This was the primary reason why most of our analyses were carried out using immunofluorescence staining and single two-cell stage embryo RNA seq.</p><p><italic>2) Ancelin et al. suggest that activation of Line1 elements is contributing to the increased DNA damage and developmental arrest seen in Lsd1 Δm/wt embryos. Only a subset of Line1 elements are active and able to retrotranspose in the genome, and different mechanisms for H3K9me3 deposition appear to be action different Line1 families. It would be informative for Ancelin</italic> et al.</p><p><italic>to extract information about which families of Line1 element are activated in Lsd1 Δm/wt from their RNA sequencing data or through RT-qPCR. Increased Line1 jumping in the genome would require active Line1 families (A, Tf, Gf) to be upregulated.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, the single embryo RNA seq approach we have used is based on polydT priming (as originally described in Tang et al. 2010) and therefore only enables the 3’ ends of L1 transcripts to be interrogated. As the polymorphisms (unique monomer repeats), enabling different LINE-1 families to be distinguished from each other lie in their 5’UTRs, and given the length of LINEs (&gt;6kb), this means that based on our RNA seq data we cannot determine which particular LINE-1 families were expressed in the mutants, nor whether the LINE-1 reads we detected corresponded to full length elements.</p><p>We nevertheless tried to address this important but challenging question raised by the reviewers, by adapting our single embryo RTqPCR approach using sets of LINE-1 family-specific primers for the RT step. The results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>. The aim was to produce cDNAs with internal priming rather than from the 3’UTR, in order to obtain the family-specific information from the 5’ end. We therefore designed RT primers within the LINE-1 ORF1 region, common to all families (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1C</xref>). We also designed RT primers specific for two house-keeping genes that we used for normalization (<italic>Ppia; Hprt</italic>), and for two genes (<italic>Btg4</italic> and <italic>H2AZ</italic>) that show differential expression in our RNA seq, that we used as controls. We were thus able to evaluate expression of the 5’ ends of potentially full-length LINE-1 elements of the three families in individual control and mutant embryos. We found that only the Gf family (but not the A and Tf families), showed enhanced expression in some mutant embryos, compared to control (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1D and E</xref>). However, the differences in Gf expression between mutant and control embryos overall were not statistically significant. We also attempted nascent RNA FISH using specific probes for each of these three LINE-1 families, but the quality of the FISH signals obtained was not adequate in embryos (when compared to ESCs), thus preventing us from making a comparison.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08851.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Ct value of qPCR with cDNA obtained using specific primers against hprt and ppia for reverse transcription.</title><p>Each row corresponds to one embryo (two-cell stage).

In fact, it could be the case that different LINE-1 elements become spuriously over-expressed in different embryos, hence no single family shows a dramatic increase in transcription based on RT-PCR. Nevertheless, we hope the reviewers agree that the significant increase in LINE-1 ORF protein levels (both nuclear and cytoplasmic) that we detected in most <italic>Lsd1</italic> mutant embryos, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, is convincing evidence that full-length LINE-1 elements are indeed more frequently up-regulated in the absence of <italic>Lsd1</italic>.</p><p> <italic>3) The authors propose that Line1 elements might cause the DNA damage seen in Lsd1 Δm/wt embryos. The gH2AX image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> shows a lot of DNA damage in the Lsd1 Δm/wt embryos. There would need to be a lot of active jumping of Line1 to generate this amount of DNA damage, yet Line1 transcript levels are only elevated around 2-fold. It's possible that the elevated DNA damage in Lsd1 Δm/wt could be caused by some of the thousands of gene transcripts that are mis-regulated in these embryos rather than Line1. The authors could make this clearer. In particular, gH2AX signals normally arise during DNA replication. Maternal depletion of polycomb proteins causes defects in zygotic gene activation and impaired DNA replication in 2 cell embryos, and a similar increase in embryos with strong gH2AX staining as is reported by Ancelin et al.(see Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in Posfai et al., 2012, Genes Dev Vol 26 p920-932). In the 2 cell embryos that Ancelin et al. show in Figure</italic></p><p><italic>5G, does the difference in gH2AX staining between the Lsd1 Δm/wt and control embryos primarily reflect the mutant embryos arresting or delaying progression through the mid 2 cell stage/DNA replication rather than Line1-induced DNA damage?</italic> </p><p>We appreciate this important suggestion. As shown in our Gene Ontology pathways (GO) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, none of the top enriched terms relate to DNA damage/ repair pathways. However, it is also plausible that enriched γH2AX staining in mutant two-cell stage embryos might be related to the many transcripts misregulated as part of the changes of the transcriptome in <italic>Lsd1</italic> mutants. We have now included this interpretation in the revised manuscript (at the end of the subsection “Impact of LSD1 absence on repeat elements, genome integrity and DNA replication”).</p><p>Additionally, we analysed DNA replication in mutant and control two-cell embryos (40-41h post hCG injection) using Edu pulse incorporation followed by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In WT embryos, S-phase is normally complete by this time at the two-cell stage. The replication assay was coupled with parallel detection of DNA damage by γH2AX immunostaining, to address the reviewers’ suggestion that replication delay / stalling in <italic>Lsd1</italic> mutants might be an alternative explanation for the DNA damage observed. These new results reveal that DNA replication is indeed delayed, as replication foci are detected in a high proportion of mutant two cell stage embryos (62% blastomeres show EdU foci) compared to WT (no foci detectable). Furthermore, high levels of γH2AX foci are also observed in the mutant embryos showing EdU foci. However, we noted that in the 38% of mutant blastomeres that are not in S phase (ie Edu negative), γH2AX foci are still strongly present (compared to WT), although there may be slightly fewer foci than for the embryos in S phase. Importantly, control embryos processed in parallel are systematically negative or only faintly positive for γH2AX foci. It should be noted that γH2AX staining in this double EdU/γH2AX experiment is fainter <italic>that</italic>shown for γH2AX alone in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, because of differences in the IF procedure when performing the EdU assay simultaneously. Our interpretation of this new set of data is that the increase in γH2AX signalling in <italic>Lsd1</italic> maternally depleted embryos could indeed be linked to replication delays, as raised by the reviewers. The fact that mutant embryos not undergoing DNA replication nevertheless showed strong γH2AX foci, supports a possible correlation between DNA damage and LINE-1 overexpression. We have now modified our conclusions to evoke the different possible sources of increased DNA damage in <italic>Lsd1</italic> mutants, as suggested by the reviewers, in the revised manuscript (in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection) together with the description of new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) It is somewhat disappointing that one major finding namely significant effect on the second meiosis was essentially ignored (beside brief description). One would expect that the authors invest some time in trying to provide mechanistic explanation for this phenomenon and not just say that it &quot;merits further exploration&quot;. It would be of interest to see what is happening during meiosis I and this should be included in the revised manuscript. In addition, the only significant molecular information is the transcriptome comparison between the maternally deleted and wt 2-cell stage embryos i.e. period of zygotic genome activation (ZGA). However, the ZGA is entirely regulated by the maternally inherited molecules; proteins and RNAs. Proteome comparison would be technically quite difficult but transcriptome comparison between maternally deleted and wt oocyte is possible, necessary and should be included and interpreted in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is one of the most important mechanisms controlling the utilization of many maternal mRNAs and it would be very important to determine how it functions during maturation of mutant oocytes and after fertilization in zygotes.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the impact of loss of function of <italic>Kdm1a /Lsd1</italic> during oogenesis and in particular on the completion of meiosisis a very interesting question. However, our present study has focused on the early events after fertilization and already represents several years of work. We would not be able to generate new data to address the role of <italic>Lsd1</italic> during meiosis within a reasonable time frame for the current manuscript. In fact, this question would be part of a follow up project that we have set up in collaboration with another group who have the relevant expertise.</p><p>In the context of our manuscript, we do agree with the reviewers that the role of the maternal pools of RNA and proteins is indeed critical at the beginning of development, at the time of ZGA, and that loss of Lsd1 from the oocyte stage could impact on this maternal pool, and thus impair early development. As requested, we have now produced and analyzed transcriptomes from <italic>Lsd1</italic> maternally depleted and WT oocytes, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>. We compared these transcriptomes to determine whether the loss of <italic>Lsd1</italic> function has any impact on the production of the maternal pool of transcripts in the oocyte and whether this could be at the origin of the aberrant changes detected in two-cell stage embryos.</p><p>As shown in panel A of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, fewer genes are affected (up or down regulated) in the transcriptomes of mutant oocytes (Venn diagram on the left), when compared to those of mutant two-cell embryos (Venn diagram on the right; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By performing principal component analysis (PCA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> panel B), the first dimension reveals that there is a greater difference between mutant and control two-cell stage embryos, than between mutant and control oocytes, or between maternally depleted two-cells stage embryos. However, the second dimension of the PCA shows that the mutant two-cell stage embryos segregate from oocytes, including those without a maternal <italic>Lsd1</italic> supply. Finally, the number of identically misregulated genes (up or down) between oocytes and two-cell stage embryos (panel C) is far lower than the number of misregulated genes that are specific to each stage. Furthermore, they do not match extensively with annotated maternal genes (based on www.dbtmee.hgc.jp; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, according to this new data, loss of <italic>Kdm1a/Lsd1</italic> leads to more genes being misregulated <italic>after</italic> fertilization, than in oocytes. In other words, <italic>Lsd1</italic> depletion seems to affect the transcriptome of the developing embryo more than it does that of the maturating oocyte. Our new oocyte transcriptome data thus strengthen our original conclusion that <italic>Lsd1</italic> is indeed required to shape the two waves of ZGA after fertilization, from zygote to two-cell stage. However, we cannot exclude that an <italic>Lsd1</italic>-depleted maternal pool would be deficient for some maternal RNAs or proteins (e.g. transcription factors), that could impact transcription at the two-cell stage and have included a comment to this effect in our revised manuscript (subsection “Absence of LSD1 abrogates the normal changes in transcriptome by the two-cell stage”, fourth paragraph).</p><p>Finally, we appreciate the reviewers’ comment that regulation of cytoplasmic polyadenylation might also be affected in the <italic>Kdm1a/Lsd1</italic> mutant, as this plays an important role in the use of the maternal RNA supply. However, a study of poly-A length in <italic>Lsd1</italic> mutants was hindered due to the use of polydT primers for production of our RNA seq data. We do however now mention the possibility that this might also play a role (subsection “LSD1 is involved in the transcriptional switch at the two-cell stage”).</p><p> <italic>5) The authors describe a significant proportion of Δm/wt embryo arrested at zygote stage. They used superovulation and that could potentiate this effect and possibly other observed differences. It would have been much better if superovulation was not used in all experiments, however it would not be fair to ask the authors to repeat everything. Nevertheless, they could and should determine if the effect on zygote to 2-cell stage transition in Δm/wt is ameliorated when using normal matings without superovulation.</italic> </p><p>Superovulation was used in our study because of the very limited number of mutant embryos we could obtain (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We nevertheless agree with the reviewers that we should rule out any possible effect that superovulation might have on the developmental delay seen at the two-cell stage for the <italic>Kdm1a/Lsd1</italic> mutant embryos. We addressed this issue by assessing the development of mutant and control embryos obtained by natural breeding, without superovulation. The data are provided as a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) in the revised manuscript. The number of embryos recovered for each female was low (as expected without superovulation), but the proportion of one-cell and two-cell embryos was not markedly different from what we had obtained using superovulation. In conclusion, superovulation did not change our conclusions concerning <italic>Lsd1</italic> mutant embryo phenotypes.</p><p> <italic>6) The authors report elevated levels of H3K9me3 in both paternal and maternal pronuclei in zygotes, elevated H3K9me1/2/3 in 2-cell embryos and elevated H3K4me1/2/3 in two cell embryos, based on immunofluorescence staining. Quantifying IF intensity is an inexact science. Although I think the conclusions are probably valid, the quantification is based on comparing IF intensity between embryos and there does not seem to be any obvious internal control. Granted, the embryos are processed in parallel and equivalent image settings are used, etc., but ideally fluorescence intensity of the modification of interest would be compared to an internal reference. For example, the authors report that levels of H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 do not differ between controls and mutant (as expected), so one or other of these modifications could be used as an internal control in dual staining for greater confidence of the changes seen (or total H3).</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment that IF quantifications can be subject to signal intensity variation, between samples, or between experiments. However, we have done our utmost to control for such variability in this work. As mentioned in our Materials and methods section (subsections “Immunofluorescence staining” and “Confocal acquisition and image analysis”), for each antibody used, immunofluorescence was always performed and processed on embryos from control and mutant genotypes in parallel, and under identical conditions. Images were always acquired using the same confocal microscope settings, even between experiments.</p><p>In terms of quantification, and the use of an internal control, we believe that performing dual IF with a “control” antibody is not necessarily ideal, as this is also subject to variation between fluorochromes from one colour to another. Instead, we believe that our approach allows us to deduce whether there are significant differences in overall staining intensities but we realise we may not have adequately described this in our manuscript. In summary, we select the nuclear area of the stack image, and then extract the integrated Intensity (intensity divided by the number of voxels represented within the nuclear area) using the 3D object counter plugin in Image J (Bolte and Cordelière, 2006). This is now added in our Materials and methods section (subsection “Confocal acquisition and image analysis”).</p><p>In order to show the raw data of fluorescence measurements, we provide a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref>) in which are presented the distributions of the integrated intensities measured per nucleus for each of the embryos (control or mutant) stained with anti-H3K4me3, anti-H3K9me3 or anti-H3K27me3. These raw data were used to produce the ratio of changes between control and mutant embryos plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, under each image panel.</p><p>The three graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 2</xref> show that, although there is some variability for each antibody used between nuclei, and between experiments (we performed at least two replicates), for both the control and the mutant categories, the distribution of the intensities are significantly different between control and mutant embryos for H3K4me3 and for H3K9me3, but not for H3K27me3, (based on use of a t-test, as presented in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08851.019</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08851.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08851.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-08851-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: This revised manuscript shows quite convincingly that a conditional deletion of LSD1, a histone lysine demethylase, in growing oocytes results in post-fertilization defects in pre-implantation development with the resulting embryos arresting primarily at the 2 cell stage. The authors show by immunofluorescence that histone H3K9 methylation is altered in the mutant zygotes, and that histone H3K4 and H3K9 methylation levels are altered in 2 cell embryos. The authors perform RNA seq transcriptomic analysis on mutant oocytes and 2 cell embryos that transcription profiles are also changed with the 2 cell embryos seemingly unable to activate zygotic gene activation. The authors also show that L1 retrotransposon transcripts and protein are elevated in mutant 2 cell embryos, and that these embryos also have increased amounts of the DNA damage marker gH2AX. In response to the reviewers comments the authors have tried show which subtype of L1 retrotransposon is upregulated, and tested if the increased abundance of gH2AX represents a delay in cell cycle or S phase progression rather than L1 integrating into the genome as suggested in the original submission. The authors included in their response to reviewers’ comments data showing that they could not detect upregulation of RNA for any of the three active subclasses of L1 in the LSD1 mutant embryos. The authors conclude in their response that &quot;Nevertheless the higher levels of L1 ORF protein that we observed in mutant embryos suggest that certain L1 elements must be up-regulated in the absence of Lsd1, but that the LINEs at the origin of this are not systematically from one family/type&quot;. How can the authors exclude the possibility that the upregulated L1 RNA and protein represents full length but catalytically inactive L1 subfamilies such as L1_MdF? Data from ES cells shows that different L1 subfamilies are repressed epigenetic mechanisms (Castro-Diaz et al., Genes Dev. 2014 Jul 1;28(13):1397-409), so it's certainly possible that only inactive subfamilies of L1 are being upregulated in LSD1 mutant embryos.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a possibility that we cannot formally rule out – although it seems rather unlikely as we do not see any specific L1 subfamily expressed (L1_MdF or other). We have now included a new sentence in the Results section: “in particular we could not determine which specific LINE-1 families were expressed in the mutants, nor whether the LINE-1 reads we detected corresponded to full-length, and/or intact elements.”</p><p><italic>If the upregulated L1's do not originate from an active subfamily, and rather represent full length but catalytically inactive copies of L1 such as those found in the L1_MdF subfamilies, how can the increase in gH2AX be caused by L1?</italic> </p><p>In our Discussion we have tried to be very cautious concerning any causality between LINE-1 and gH2AX signalling: “although, no significant enrichment was directly found for DNA damage pathways when running our GO analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), many genes related to DNA damage repair were upregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Taken all together, these results suggest that the elevated DNA damage signalling observed could be independent from replication defaults in KDM1A maternally depleted embryos, but might be related either to changes in transcript levels for DNA damage genes or else to the observed increase in LINE-1 activityin <italic>Kdm1a</italic> mutant embryos at this stage”.</p><p><italic>If the upregulated L1 copies are not catalytically active, how are they causing or contributing to the LSD1 mutant phenotype?</italic> </p><p>Our work suggests that KDM1A may participate in repressing LINE-1 expression and that in its absence we find increased protein levels, likely due to partial up-regulation of different types of L1 elements. Although some of these may produce catalytically inactive protein, we have no reason to exclude that a subset of them are active and might indeed result in genome instability. However this has not been formally demonstrated and we fully acknowledge that the DNA damage observed in the mutant embryos may be due to other defects, including DNA replication defects. We have therefore included the following statement which we hope satisfies the reviewer “In this context, we speculate that misregulation of LINE-1 elements in the absence of KDM1A <italic>might participate</italic> in the early developmental arrest that is observed, via an increased potential of genome instability and activation of some specific DNA damage checkpoints”.</p><p> <italic>The authors include data showing that cell cycle or S phase is delayed in the LSD1 mutant embryos, which could cause the large increase in gH2AX seen in the mutant embryos. The authors also argue that the large amount of gH2AX in the Edu-negative mutant embryos could represent increased L1 activity. How can the authors exclude that the gH2AX in the EdU-negative embryos doesn't represent persistent DNA damage caused during S-phase? Or any other mechanism?</italic> </p><p>We do not exclude that the DNA damage observed is caused in part by replication, we simply evoke the possibility that it could also be linked to LINE-1 activation, as mentioned in the statement in answer to the previous point.</p><p><italic>Although the authors have convincingly shown that maternal LSD1 is genetically required for pre-implantation development and maternal-zygotic transition, the revised manuscript does not convincingly establish mechanism for any of the developmental defects they describe in these mutants.</italic></p><p>Although we have not established detailed mechanism, we do hope that the reviewer agrees that we have definitively shown the importance of the maternal KDM1A protein for early life, including its role in ensuring appropriate H3K4 and H3K9methylation patterns and in early transitions in gene expression. We believe that this work opens up the way for the further exploration of the detailed mechanisms by which this important epigenetic regulator works at multiple levels.</p></body></sub-article></article>
