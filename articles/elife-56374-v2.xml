A prevailing model of sensory-motor circuit assembly is that peripheral, target-derived, cues instruct pSN identities and patterns of intraspinal connectivity. To date no known intrinsic determinants of muscle-specific pSN fates have been described in vertebrates. We show that expression of Hox transcription factors defines pSN subtypes, and these profiles are established independently of limb muscle. The <italic>Hoxc8</italic> gene is expressed by pSNs and motor neurons (MNs) targeting distal forelimb muscles, and sensory-specific depletion of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in mice disrupts sensory-motor synaptic matching, without affecting pSN survival or muscle targeting. These results indicate that the diversity and central specificity of pSNs and MNs are regulated by a common set of determinants, thus linking early rostrocaudal patterning to the assembly of limb control circuits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spinal cord</kwd><kwd>motor neuron</kwd><kwd>proprioception</kwd><kwd>sensory neuron</kwd><kwd>hox gene</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 NS116858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dasen</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS097550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dasen</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 NS086750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Maggie M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS062822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dasen</surname><given-names>Jeremy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and anatomical analyses of Hox gene function uncover a limb-independent program of sensory neuron fate specification and connectivity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory-motor circuits within the spinal cord are essential for the coordinated control of limb muscle. In mammals, proprioceptive sensory neurons (pSN) process a continuous stream of data from approximately 50 forelimb or hindlimb muscles, and relay this information to the appropriate circuits tasked to orchestrate motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Imai and Yoshida, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tuthill and Azim, 2018</xref>). The orderly arrangement of connections formed between pSNs and spinal circuits enable animals to seamlessly perform a vast repertoire of limb movements. A single pool of motor neurons (MNs) innervates an individual muscle and receives instructive feedback, not only from sensory neurons, but also descending inputs from supraspinal centers and local spinal interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plant et al., 2018</xref>). These inputs collectively modify the pattern of MN activity thereby choreographing appropriate muscle activation sequences during behavior.</p><p>The simplest input pathway to MNs is the monosynaptic reflex arc, composed of a limb muscle innervated by a pool of alpha MNs and type Ia pSNs with stretch-sensing mechanoreceptor endings embedded within muscle spindles. Type Ia pSNs are uniquely poised to provide direct and immediate muscle status information through the monosynaptic connections they establish with MNs. During development, pSN axons navigate through the spinal cord, preferentially contacting MN pools innervating the same peripheral target, while avoiding MNs of functionally antagonist muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eccles et al., 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mears and Frank, 1997</xref>). These connections are remarkably selective, as a single pSN establishes monosynaptic connections with each of the ~50–300 MNs that supply the same muscle target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mendell and Henneman, 1968</xref>). While the mechanisms of pSN central specificity are largely unknown, they appear to be established independent of patterned neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mendelsohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mendelson and Frank, 1991</xref>), suggesting pSN-MN matching relies on genetic programs acting during neural development.</p><p>After sensory neurons are born, nascent neurons advance through a hierarchical process of diversification in which expression of specific genes coincides with the acquisition of specialized neuronal characteristics, including peripheral target specificity and central projection pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dasen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lallemend and Ernfors, 2012</xref>). Sensory neurons generated at spinal levels derive from neural crest cells which coalesce outside the CNS to form dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Butler and Bronner, 2015</xref>). As DRG develop, most sensory neurons co-express the homeodomain transcription factors Isl1 and Brn3a, which are necessary for deployment of pan-sensory neuron genetic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dykes et al., 2011</xref>). At these early stages, pSNs can be discriminated from other sensory classes by expression of the transcription factors Runx3 and Etv1, the neurotrophin receptor <italic>Nrtk3</italic>, and the calcium binding protein Parvalbumin (PV). Genetic studies in mice indicate that <italic>Runx3</italic> and <italic>Etv1</italic> are essential for establishing and maintaining core features of pSN identity, including their survival and ability to extend central axons into the ventral spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Inoue et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>While the transcriptional programs governing features common to all pSNs have been characterized, understanding later developmental facets of sensory neuron specification, such as muscle target specificity and central connectivity, has been particularly challenging. In contrast to the topographic arrangement of spinal MN subtypes, sensory neurons of different modalities and attributes are intermixed within a DRG, with no clear organizational pattern, aside from restricted expression of early determinants involved in establishing a broader sensory neuron class identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Honig et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jessell et al., 2011</xref>). A dearth of molecular markers for more nuanced neuronal features has made it challenging to characterize how pSNs and other sensory modalities further diversify into specific subtypes. One particular gap in our understanding is how the specificity of central connections between pSNs and MNs of the same muscle is achieved, since pSN axons must distinguish between vast numbers of potential postsynaptic targets within the ventral spinal cord.</p><p>A significant contributing factor to the specificity of connections in sensory-motor circuits is the recognition of specific MN subtypes by pSN central afferents. As the limb develops, a network of ~20 Hox transcription factors determines the molecular identities and peripheral target specificities of lateral motor column (LMC) neurons dedicated to limb control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Philippidou and Dasen, 2013</xref>). Mutation in genes acting downstream of Hox function in MNs, including the transcription factor <italic>Pea3</italic> and synaptic-specificity determinant <italic>Sema3e</italic>, leads to a disruption in the normal pattern of central connections between pSN and MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukuhara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vrieseling and Arber, 2006</xref>). In addition, genetic transformation of thoracic MNs to a limb-level LMC fate, through mutation in the <italic>Hoxc9</italic> gene, results in the formation of ectopic synaptic connections between limb pSNs and axial muscle-innervating MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baek et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, after MN-specific deletion of the <italic>Foxp1</italic> gene, which encodes a factor required for all Hox activity in limb MNs, pSN axons maintain appropriate termination patterns within the ventral spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sürmeli et al., 2011</xref>). However, because MN topographic organization is scrambled in <italic>Foxp1</italic> mutants, limb pSNs form connections with inappropriate MN subtypes. The preservation of pSN central projection pattern in <italic>Foxp1</italic> mutants suggests pSNs acquire specific features that enable them to target specific dorsoventral domains within the spinal cord.</p><p>While studies provide evidence for an essential role for MN subtype identity in establishing sensory-motor synaptic specificity, the mechanisms that determine the central pattern of pSN postsynaptic connections are poorly understood. In contrast to MN specification, where key developmental features emerge largely independent of peripheral cues, sensory neuron development relies on extrinsic signals provided by limb mesenchyme and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arber, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Expression of the <italic>Nrtk3</italic> receptor renders pSNs sensitive to peripheral neurotrophin-3 (<italic>Ntf3</italic>) signaling, and both <italic>Nrtk3</italic> and <italic>Ntf3</italic> are essential for the differentiation and survival of pSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>Ntf3</italic>/<italic>Nrtk3</italic> signaling regulates expression of <italic>Etv1</italic> and <italic>Runx3</italic>, and muscle-by-muscle differences in the level of <italic>Ntf3</italic> expression appear to contribute to pSN subtype diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Nooij et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that signals originating from the limb mesenchyme can trigger expression of genes that mark muscle-specific pSN subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poliak et al., 2016</xref>). While certain molecular features common to all pSNs have been shown to be limb-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), whether pSN diversity and synaptic specificity rely on neuronal-intrinsic specification programs remain to be determined. As such there are currently no known fate determinants of muscle-specific pSNs.</p><p>We considered the possibility that the same Hox-dependent regulatory networks employed to specify spinal MN subtypes also contribute to the diversification of pSNs during sensory-motor circuit assembly. We show that selective expression of Hox proteins defines pSN populations generated at specific rostrocaudal levels, paralleling Hox expression in spinal MNs. Expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes is maintained in both pSNs and MNs after removal of the developing limb bud, indicating that neuronal <italic>Hox</italic> pattern is initially established independent of target-derived cues. We found that distal forelimb flexor muscles, and the MNs that innervate them, are targeted by pSNs expressing the <italic>Hoxc8</italic> gene. In the absence of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> function, forelimb pSNs establish ectopic monosynaptic contacts on MNs innervating functionally antagonist forelimb muscles. These studies provide evidence for a neuronal-intrinsic program in which the selective activities of Hox proteins encodes key features of pSN diversification and target selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Hox</italic> expression delineates subpopulations of pSNs along the rostrocaudal axis</title><p>To explore a potential role for <italic>Hox</italic> genes in pSN diversification, we analyzed the expression of individual Hox proteins in spinal DRG during the early phases of sensory neuron development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We examined Hox protein expression in relation to Runx3, Etv1, and PV, three markers predominately restricted to pSN subtypes. Because the patterns of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression within the spinal cord are most thoroughly characterized in cervical (C) segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lacombe et al., 2013</xref>), we focused on the pattern of <italic>Hox</italic> expression in DRG generated between C2-C8. We began by analyzing the DRG expression of a subset of <italic>Hox4-Hox8</italic> paralog genes between E12.5-E14.5, stages in which pSN axons have reached their muscle targets and central afferents have begun to invade the dorsal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hippenmeyer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kramer et al., 2006</xref>). We found that subpopulations of cervical DRG neurons selectively coexpressed Hox proteins and molecular markers of pSN identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hox proteins expressed by pSNs included Hoxc4, Hoxa5, Hoxc6, Hoxa7, and Hoxc8, which also collectively define forelimb LMC neuron diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–e</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dasen et al., 2005</xref>). Each of these Hox proteins were detected at cervical levels and/or rostral thoracic segments, but were not present in caudal thoracic or lumbar DRG (data not shown). Within individual cervical DRG, Hox proteins were expressed by a subset of pSNs, and the fraction of pSNs expressing a given <italic>Hox</italic> gene within a single DRG varied along the rostrocaudal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Interestingly, members of the <italic>Hoxb</italic> gene cluster, including <italic>Hoxb4</italic>, were also restricted to cervical segments, but appeared to be more broadly expressed by DRG classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>, data not shown). These observations indicate that members of the <italic>Hoxa</italic> and <italic>Hoxc</italic> gene clusters are expressed by subsets of cervical pSNs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Restricted <italic>Hox</italic> expression defines pSN subtype identity.</title><p>(<bold>a–e</bold>) Expression of indicated Hox proteins in cervical DRG.

For example, within individual cervical DRG, a subset of Hoxc8<sup>+</sup> cells coexpressed Hoxa7, a subset of Hoxa5<sup>+</sup> pSNs co-expressed Hoxc4, and a subset of Hoxc6<sup>+</sup> pSNs expressed Hoxc8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f,g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Furthermore, DNA-binding cofactors known to be essential for Hox activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Merabet and Mann, 2016</xref>), including Meis2 and Pbx3, were detected in pSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Both Meis2 and Pbx3 were expressed by pSNs but also observed in non-proprioceptive sensory neuron subtypes, and lacked rostrocaudal specificity. These observations suggest that the combinatorial actions of Hox proteins and their co-factors could account for subtype diversity of cervical pSNs.</p><p>We next compared the expression of individual <italic>Hox</italic> genes in sensory neurons along the rostrocaudal axis of the spinal cord. While certain <italic>Hox</italic> genes are coexpressed within the same sensory neuron, others demonstrate clear boundaries from one another and do not co-localize, despite being expressed in the same sensory class. For example, Hoxa5 expression was confined to pSNs in rostral cervical segments (C2-C5) while Hoxc8 expression was restricted to caudal cervical and rostral thoracic DRG (C6 to T2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i,j</xref>). Thus, Hoxa5 and Hoxc8 expression by pSNs is mutually exclusive and mirrors the restricted expression pattern of Hoxa5/Hoxc8 in forelimb-innervating MNs.

In vertebrates, pSNs establish selective central connections with MNs innervating the same peripheral muscle, while avoiding MNs targeting functionally antagonistic muscles. Whether pSNs are intrinsically programmed to acquire muscle-specific identities that enable them to target appropriate central postsynaptic targets is largely unknown. A major roadblock in resolving the mechanisms of spinal sensory-motor circuit assembly has been a lack of molecular tools to study muscle-specific pSN subtype differentiation. We found that pSNs innervating distal forelimb muscles can be defined by selective expression of Hox transcription factors, and these profiles are initiated independent of limb-derived cues. Additionally, <italic>Hox</italic> genes are critical in generating appropriate patterns of central connections between pSNs and MNs.

In the spinal cord, ventral motor-related postmitotic neurons are born prior to dorsal types, and DRG neurons appear to exhibit a similar proprioceptive to cutaneous temporal progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fariñas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lawson and Biscoe, 1979</xref>).</p><p>The dorsoventral restriction of genes within <italic>Hox</italic> clusters could provide a mechanism to diversify subtype identity across multiple sensory modalities. As cutaneous neurons are known to terminate in the dorsal spinal cord, the coordinate activities of <italic>Hoxb</italic> genes could similarly function in the development of cutaneous sensory-relay circuits. Consistent with this idea <italic>Hoxb8</italic> has been shown to be essential for normal development and organization of dorsal spinal interneurons, and loss of <italic>Hoxb8</italic> leads to excess grooming and reduced thermal and nociceptive response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holstege et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Extrinsic and intrinsic control of sensory-motor circuit development</title><p>Studies of sensory neuron development provide compelling evidence that a major determinant of subtype diversity and connectivity are instructive cues provided by peripheral limb muscle and mesenchyme. Expression of <italic>Ntf3</italic> within the developing limb regulates expression of <italic>Etv1</italic> and <italic>Runx3</italic> in pSNs, and differences in the levels of NT3 signaling contribute to muscle specific identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Nooij et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). The limb mesenchyme has also been implicated as a source of extrinsic cues which differentiate hindlimb extensor and flexor pSN subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poliak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wenner and Frank, 1995</xref>). A confounding aspect in the study of limb-derived signaling in pSN development is that peripheral <italic>Ntf3</italic> signaling, as well as the intrinsic determinants <italic>Etv1</italic> and <italic>Runx3</italic>, are also required for sensory neuron survival, often precluding genetic analysis of later aspects of sensory-motor circuit development.</p><p>We found that <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is dispensable for pSN survival, and loss of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> does not prohibit the ability of pSNs to target their appropriate forelimb muscle targets. Moreover, expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in both forelimb-innervating pSNs and MNs is maintained in the absence of limb mesenchyme and muscle. While these results indicate a limb-independent mechanism of early neuronal differentiation, target-derived cues are likely required to establish the full molecular profiles of pSNs and functional characteristics. In spinal MNs, a major function of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is to regulate expression of <italic>Ret</italic> and <italic>Gfrα</italic> genes, rendering a subset of MNs sensitive to activities of peripheral Gdnf to induce <italic>Pea3</italic> expression within motor pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Catela et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, in MNs Hox proteins regulate expression of cell surface receptors that retrogradely influence subtype specification. <italic>Hox</italic> genes may similarly act in pSNs to modify or constrain the responses to peripheral cues as sensory axons navigate through the developing limb bud.</p><p>Expression of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in pSNs is largely confined to distal forelimb flexor subtypes, while distal forelimb extensor pSNs lack <italic>Hoxc8</italic> pSN innervation. Interestingly, a recent study showed that <italic>Runx3</italic> is essential for the development of forelimb extensor pSNs, and suggests that this pattern is regulated by limb-derived cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). The differential expression of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> and <italic>Runx3</italic> in distal flexors and extensors could reflect refinement in the pattern of these factors by limb-derived cues. For example, Hoxc8 may antagonize Runx3 function within flexor pSN subtypes. Alternatively, limb-derived cues may maintain Runx3 in extensor pSNs and restrict <italic>Hoxc8</italic> expression to forelimb flexor pSNs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>Hox</italic> genes and synaptic specificity in sensory-motor circuits</title><p>We found that <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is required in distal forelimb flexor pSNs to establish appropriate connections with their MN counterparts. How do <italic>Hox</italic> genes contribute to the specificity of central connections between pSNs and MNs? In spinal MNs, <italic>Hox</italic> genes and their downstream targets including <italic>Pea3</italic> and <italic>Sema3e</italic> have been shown to be essential for the specificity of their central connections with pSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pecho-Vrieseling et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vrieseling and Arber, 2006</xref>), in part, by regulating MN topographical organization and dendritic architecture. In mice lacking the Hox accessory factor <italic>Foxp1</italic> the normal positioning of forelimb-innervating MNs is disrupted, leading to a sensory-motor mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sürmeli et al., 2011</xref>). The specificity of pSN-MN connections has been recently shown to correlate with the relative approach angles between pSN axons and MN dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balaskas et al., 2019</xref>), and loss of this alignment may account for the sensory-motor mismatch observed in both <italic>Foxp1</italic> and pSN <italic>Hoxc8</italic> mutants. Further studies will be necessary to definitively assess whether the coordinate regulation of MN and pSN connectivity by the same <italic>Hox</italic> gene contributes to sensory-motor specificity. Consistent with this model, in preliminary studies we found that after selective deletion of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> from MNs, MN pools are disorganized and distal forelimb flexor pSNs target extensor MNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>). Although a Hox-specific molecular matching model for pSN-to-MN connectivity is provocative, <italic>Hoxc8</italic> could be required in pSNs, independent of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in MN, for the segregation of axonal subtypes within the sensory nerve, or for their axon guidance within the spinal cord.</p><p>Centrally, pSNs establish connections with a variety of postsynaptic targets, including local spinal and projection interneurons that relay proprioceptive information to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bermingham et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bikoff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tripodi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yuengert et al., 2015</xref>). The same <italic>Hox</italic> genes expressed by pSNs and MNs are also expressed by multiple classes of spinal interneurons, suggesting a broader role in shaping synaptic specificity within the spinal cord. Consistent with this idea, both long ascending spinocerebellar and local-circuit spinal interneurons have been shown to require <italic>Hox</italic> function to acquire limb-specific molecular identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baek et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sweeney et al., 2018</xref>). Results from this work indicate that in addition to contributing to sensory neuron diversity, <italic>Hox</italic> genes are also required in pSNs to shape synaptic specificity in developing sensory-motor circuits. These observations are consistent with studies indicating that coordinate <italic>Hox</italic> activities are required in multiple neuronal and non-neuronal lineages during circuit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barsh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briscoe and Wilkinson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings suggest the same <italic>Hox</italic> gene could act in multiple neuronal classes during development, implying a coherent molecular strategy for wiring the circuits essential for limb control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Hoxc8 flox</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19621436">19621436</ext-link></td><td>MGI: 4365797</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>PLAT::Cre</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12812797">12812797</ext-link></td><td>MGI: 3052515</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Olig2::Cre</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046410">18046410</ext-link></td><td>MGI: 3774124</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor::CAG-loxp-STOP-loxp-rabies-G-IRES-TVA</italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23352170">23352170</ext-link></td><td>MGI: J:206510</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (rabies virus)</td><td><italic>EnvA-RabV-mCherry</italic> (pseudotyped G-deleted rabies virus)</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21867879">21867879</ext-link> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17329205">17329205</ext-link> <break/>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26844832">26844832</ext-link></td><td/><td>~10<sup>8</sup> IU/mL</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (chicken eggs)</td><td>SPF Eggs</td><td>Charles River</td><td>10100332</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Hoxc4 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16269338">16269338</ext-link></td><td/><td>(1:16000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Hoxa5 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16269338">16269338</ext-link></td><td/><td>(1:16000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Hoxc6 (Guinea pig polyclonal)</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11754833">11754833</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2665443">AB_2665443</ext-link></td><td>(1:16000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Hoxc6 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Aviva Systems Biology</td><td>Cat# ARP38484;

Images were acquired using an LSM 700 Zeiss confocal microscope and cell counts were calculated using the Fiji/ImageJ cell counter feature. For chick limb ablation assays, neuronal cell counts were compared between DRG of the ablated and non-ablated sides of an individual chick embryo. Neuronal cell counts in which forelimb muscles were injected with 1% CTB were performed on 16 um cryosections from caudal cervical DRG and processed/analyzed as described above. Quantifications were done based on comparable labeling efficiency between all injected animals for each muscle type and was required to have a minimum of 10 PV<sup>+</sup> CTB-labeled sensory neurons. Tissue sections of 16 um thick muscle tissue were imaged to analyze muscle spindle projections. Sensory endings within muscle spindles were identified based on the presence of vGluT1<sup>+</sup> terminals with characteristic annulospiral morphology. While each unique spindle of an entire muscle was not counted, a series of sections of the whole muscle was profiled to obtain a representative sample of muscle spindles for each muscle. For both cell counts and spindle analysis, serial sections throughout the entire tissue sample were collected into 8 and 5 parallel series of sections respectively and at least one full series of sections was compared between controls and mutants or limb ablated chick embryos. Analyses were performed on N ≥ 3 mice/genotype or per muscle type and N = 3 limb ablated chick embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Quantification of pSN collateral density (PV fiber density)</title><p>Quantitative analysis of pSN fiber density in the ventrolateral region of the spinal cord was performed on collapsed confocal Z-stacks using Fiji/ImageJ analysis software. The total PV+ collateral area (calculated as the mean pixel intensity) was measured within a confined lateral region of the ventral spinal cord at the segmental level of DRG C8 set by the borders of the midline and the ventral and lateral gray matter and white matter boundaries. An ROI was set to cover the ventrolateral region to be quantified and measured 45,832 pixels. The threshold was designated based on PV labeling only in the ventrolateral area and the same threshold value was used across all animals. For each genotype, N = 3 animals were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Quantitative analysis of motor neuron position</title><p>Plotting of labeled motor populations was performed on 30 um cryosections. Tiled images were acquired with a Zeiss confocal microscope (LSM 700) at 10X. X-Y coordinates for motor neuron soma measured in um units were determined with respect to the central canal using IMARIS software. Contour plots were generated from the X-Y scatter plots and six isolines were automatically assigned in Matlab.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Quantitative analysis of ectopic motor neuron soma</title><p>RV∆G-mCherry-EnvA/CTB/ChAT labeled motor neurons were analyzed from 16 um serial cryosections of the cervical spinal cord. Coincident labeling of soma was quantified using the cell counter feature in ImageJ. For each genotype/forelimb flexor muscle type, at least N = 3 animals were analyzed. Only animals with comparably efficient labeling were used for analysis. Efficient labeling was designated as a minimum of 20 CTB/ChAT<sup>+</sup> MNs and 10 RabV/ChAT<sup>+</sup> MNs. Serial sections throughout the entire tissue sample were collected into 10 parallel series of sections and three full series of sections were compared for each animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-5"><title>Analysis of sensory synaptic contacts with motor neurons</title><p>Analysis of vGluT1<sup>+</sup> sensory bouton contacts with P7–P9 motor neuron soma and ∼100 μm proximal dendritic arbor was performed using 0.4 μm confocal z stacks of 30 μm thick sections using a 63X oil objective lens. Gamma-motor neurons were excluded from analysis. Distance of boutons on dendritic arbor from soma was assessed using the scale bar set by Zen software. Images were analyzed using Fiji/ImageJ.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Samples sizes were determined based on previous experience and the number of animals and definitions of N are indicated in the main text and figure legends. In figures where a single representative image is shown, results are representative of at least two independent experiments, unless otherwise noted. No power analysis was employed, but sample sizes are comparable to those typically used in the field. Data collection and analysis were not blind. Graphs of quantitative data are plotted as means with standard error of mean (SEM) as error bars, using Prism 8 (Graphpad) software. Significance was determined using unpaired (Student’s) t-test and was calculated using Prism eight software. Exact p values are indicated in the main text and figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Kristen D’Elia, Joriene de Nooij, and David Schoppik for comments on the manuscript, and Niels Ringstad, Jim Salzer, and Jessica Treisman for valuable feedback.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The role of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in sensory-motor circuit assembly is largely unknown. The role for pSN <italic>Hox</italic> codes in synaptic specificity has been poorly explored because 1) <italic>Hox</italic> deletion needs to be conditional to prevent MN defects or lethality, and 2) pSNs innervating different muscles are intermingled inside a dorsal root ganglion (DRG), making it difficult to individually study synaptic targeting of each pSN subtype. This is a careful study addressing intrinsic mechanisms of neuronal specificity and the role of <italic>Hox</italic> transcription factors circuit generation-in this case matching proprioceptive sensory neurons to their targets both in muscle and spinal cord neurons. The authors have overcome these challenges by utilizing a Cre line specific to spinal sensory neurons, and also by introducing a new anterograde labeling technique. This virus-mediated labeling approach is particularly remarkable because this enables selective visualization of entire MNs that a given sensory subtype synapses on, despite their sparse distribution inside a DRG. With this strategy, the authors successfully demonstrated that <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is required for caudal pSNs to form specific monosynaptic connections with their appropriate MN targets. This study demonstrates that <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in subsets of dorsal root ganglia neurons is not required for survival of the neurons, matching to muscles, or extending to the appropriate region within the spinal cord. But <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is required in the sensory neurons for precisely targeting the motor neurons innervating limb flexor muscles, and in its absence, the sensory neuron forms inappropriate synapses on motor neurons for limb extensor muscles. These findings are convincingly shown and carefully reported. Although this is shown for one <italic>Hox</italic> factor, this may have broader impact as a mechanism for sensory-motor matching. Results from this study suggest that the coordinated regulation of the same <italic>Hox</italic> gene in pSN and MNs is essential for the specificity of connections in proprioceptive circuits. This paper suggests a novel molecular code that defines muscle- specific proprioceptive sensory neurons subtypes, shows that proprioceptive sensory neurons subtype identities are intrinsically programmed in early development, and that <italic>Hox</italic> genes are required for proprioceptive sensory neurons central afferents to target the appropriate postsynaptic targets within the spinal cord. In terms of significance the work is appropriate for publication in <italic>ELife</italic>.</p><p>Both reviewers had misgivings about the work. For example, in its current form, reviewers point out many places where there is insufficient data to support the conclusions that are being made. Also, where the data is sufficient to make a conclusion, other interpretations that could be equally valid and are not ruled out.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the most challenging experiments in the paper (Figures 4, 6 and 7) are quantified, many of the foundational experiments in the earlier figures are represented by a single image, with no n's and consequently no statistical analysis. In some cases, these are key negative findings, such as in the limb bud extirpation experiment in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1 (see below) or the very important finding that conditional knockout of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in sensory neurons doesn't alter pSN identity (Figure 5E – see below).</p><p>2) The important positive result of the altered localization of pSN synapses on motor neurons after conditional KO of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in SNs or MNs in Figure 7—figure supplement 2 is presented anecdotally. In some cases where quantitative data has been obtained, such as in Figure 6, it is not determined whether differences are statistically significant. Although the intrinsic <italic>Hox</italic> code model for sensorimotor circuit formation is an appealing one and the experiments are perfectly designed to test it, the lack of quantitation of much of the data presented in the paper make it difficult to assess whether the model is supported.</p><p>3) The first few figures describe the expression of the <italic>Hox</italic> family factors in the dorsal root ganglia. This is important for setting up ideas on how they make function. However, as presented, it is not clear which <italic>Hox</italic> factors were actually assessed (it says Hox4-8-is this all clusters? Were some not looked at?) and what the characteristics are for each? The Materials and methods section doesn't help either because it just states the antibodies for the <italic>Hox</italic> factors have been described. This information needs to be more precise. We suggest a table summarizing all the Hox factors tested and a description of the characteristics would be valuable (supplement is fine). These should include the points made in the first few figures like is it expressed in DRG and does it overlap with markers of proprioceptive identity, what is the rostral caudal restriction if any, which <italic>Hox</italic> factors are co-expressed.</p><p>4) Limb bud removal experiments: In arguing for an autonomous <italic>Hox</italic> program in pSNs, this paper contradicts previous reports showing that muscle-derived cues specify pSN identity and connectivity with MNs. The key finding in the current paper supporting an intrinsic mechanism is the chick limb bud extirpation experiments in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1. However, the conclusions need to be better supported. While Figure 2I gives the sense that <italic>Hoxc8</italic> expression is unaffected after limb bud removal, Figure 2—figure supplement 1C reveals that only a small fraction of <italic>Hoxc8</italic>-expressing neurons is in fact pSNs (this is different from mouse). If most of the <italic>Hoxc8</italic>-expressing sensory neurons are cutaneous, it is expected that they would be unaffected by removal of limb bud muscles. Figure 2—figure supplement 1C is thus the more important finding if it shows that the number of <italic>Hoxc8</italic>-expressing pSNs is unaffected after limb bud ablation. However, the number of <italic>Hoxc8<sup>+</sup>Runx3<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons is small (2-3) in both images. More n's and quantification of <italic>Hox<sup>+</sup>Runx3<sup>+</sup></italic> neurons are needed to support the conclusion that pSN <italic>Hox</italic> expression is unaffected by removal of the limb bud.</p><p>5) Figure 1—figure supplement 1A: schematizes <italic>Hox</italic> expression in DRGs along the rostro-caudal axis but the data only shows where the various <italic>Hox</italic> genes are expressed, not where they are not expressed, so we have to trust that the schematic accurately represents data that is not shown. All the rostro-caudal levels that are included in the schematic should be shown for all four <italic>Hox</italic> genes, as these authors did very beautifully in Catela et al., 2016 Figure 1.</p><p>6) Figure 5E is an important figure showing that pSN identity is unaffected by conditional KO of <italic>Hoxc8</italic>. Rather than being presented as a single figure with three or four co-expressing neurons, this experiment should be done in <italic>Hoxc8</italic> SN∆ mutants as quantitatively as the wildtype data presented in Figure 4.</p><p>7) Based on the finding in Figure 7 showing that <italic>Hoxc8</italic> mutant pSNs inappropriately target extensor-innervating motor neurons, the authors conclude that a <italic>Hox</italic> matching mechanism required for synapse formation between pSNs and their appropriate MN targets has been disrupted. While this is an appealing possibility, other interpretations are equally possible. For instance, <italic>Hoxc8</italic> may be important for the segregation of pSN axon subtypes in the sensory nerve, or for their axon guidance within the spinal cord. A prediction of the <italic>Hox</italic> matching mechanism is that flexor-innervating pSNs will fail to synapse on flexor-innervating MNs in <italic>Hoxc8</italic> MN∆ animals and may inappropriately innervate extensor-innervating MNs. A single example of the latter result is shown (Figure 7—figure supplement 2D, E) – more examples of this outcome would strengthen the <italic>Hox</italic> matching model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56374.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the most challenging experiments in the paper (Figures 4, 6 and 7) are quantified, many of the foundational experiments in the earlier figures are represented by a single image, with no n's and consequently no statistical analysis.

If most of the Hoxc8-expressing sensory neurons are cutaneous, it is expected that they would be unaffected by removal of limb bud muscles. Figure 2—figure supplement 1C is thus the more important finding if it shows that the number of Hoxc8-expressing pSNs is unaffected after limb bud ablation. However, the number of Hoxc8<sup>+</sup> Runx3<sup>+</sup> neurons is small (2-3) in both images. More n's and quantification of Hox<sup>+</sup>Runx3<sup>+</sup> neurons are needed to support the conclusion that pSN Hox expression is unaffected by removal of the limb bud.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision we have quantified the fraction of all Isl1<sup>+</sup> sensory neurons that express each of the three <italic>Hox</italic> proteins we analyzed in these experiments, both in controls and after forelimb ablation. We find that the fraction of SNs expressing <italic>Hox</italic> proteins is unchanged after limb bud ablation. However, consistent with recent studies (Wang et al., 2019), the number of SNs expressing the proprioceptive marker <italic>Runx3</italic> is reduced by ~50% (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1D)- making it difficult to assess the fraction of pSNs that maintain <italic>Hox</italic> expression. It has also been previously demonstrated that the pSN-class specific marker Er81 is markedly reduced after limb bud ablation (Lin et al., 1998). Nevertheless, while the fraction of SNs that express <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is relatively small in chick relative to mouse, we find that this percentage is unchanged after limb ablation (new Figure 2J-L). We added these results to main text as follows:</p><p>“The fraction of Isl1<sup>+</sup> SNs expressing <italic>Hoxa5</italic> (44.3 ± 4.7% in controls, 50.7 ± 3.2% ablated, p=0.27, Student’s t-test), <italic>Hoxc6</italic> (26.8 ± 2.0% controls, 26.3 ± 3.0% ablated, p=0.90), and <italic>Hoxc8</italic> (6.4 ± 0.9% controls, 7.6 ± 0.8% ablated, p=0.32) was not significantly changed (Figure 2J, K, L).”</p><p>We would also like to note that these ablation experiments not only remove limb muscle, but all limb-derived tissues (e.g. limb mesenchyme) that might provide instructive signals to both muscle and cutaneous SN subtypes. As the reviewers are likely aware, recently studies from the Ginty lab (Sharma et al., 2020) provide evidence that target-derived cues play important roles in specifying the transcriptional identity of both cutaneous and proprioceptive SNs. Thus, while <italic>Hoxc8</italic> is expressed by both cutaneous and proprioceptive SNs in chick, this pattern also appears to be target-independent.</p><p>We would also like to clarify that our study in no way contradicts the important role that target-derived cues play in pSN differentiation and connectivity. Our results provide evidence for a crucial limb-independent and <italic>Hox</italic>-dependent program that operates in conjunction with limb-dependent signaling programs. We have modified our Discussion to highlight this:</p><p>“While these results indicate a limb-independent mechanism of early neuronal differentiation, target-derived cues are <italic>undoubtedly</italic> required to establish the full molecular profile of pSNs and their functional characteristics.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 1—figure supplement 1A: schematizes Hox expression in DRGs along the rostro-caudal axis but the data only shows where the various Hox genes are expressed, not where they are not expressed, so we have to trust that the schematic accurately represents data that is not shown. All the rostro-caudal levels that are included in the schematic should be shown for all four Hox genes, as these authors did very beautifully in Catela et al., 2016 Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>The results in Figure 1I show a top-down view of <italic>Hoxa5</italic> and <italic>Hoxc8</italic> expression in DRG and spinal cord, which includes DRG that lack expression of these proteins. In the revision we have added top-down expression analyses for <italic>Hoxc4</italic>, <italic>Hoxc6</italic>, and <italic>Hoxa7</italic> in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A that similarly show the DRG lacking these proteins.</p><p>Unfortunately, we did not collect the negative <italic>Hox</italic> expression data for the serial sections shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A. Nevertheless, the data shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A were taken from a single embryo in which the relative rostrocaudal position for each section was recorded for each <italic>Hox</italic> antibody stain. Thus, the relative positioning of the rostrocaudal domains for <italic>Hoxc4</italic> and <italic>Hoxc6</italic> are accurate with respect to <italic>Hoxa5</italic> and <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in these panels, but only approximate relative to segmental level (i.e. C1-T1). We have clarified this in the figure legend, and indicate that similar results were obtained from a total of N=3 embryos analyzed at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5E is an important figure showing that pSN identity is unaffected by conditional KO of Hoxc8. Rather than being presented as a single figure with three or four co-expressing neurons, this experiment should be done in Hoxc8 SN∆ mutants as quantitatively as the wildtype data presented in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In the revision we have quantified the results from the retrograde tracing experiments and now present them in Figure 5F and the main text, as follows:</p><p>“We injected CTB into the FCU of <italic>Hoxc8<sup>SN∆</sup></italic> mice at P4 and collected spinal cords with attached DRG at P7. We found that the fraction of pSNs that were βGal<sup>+</sup> CTB<sup>+</sup> was similar between controls and <italic>Hoxc8<sup>SN∆</sup> </italic>mice (65.19 ± 0.05% for N=4 control animals; 62.27 ± 0.08% for N=3 <italic>Hoxc8<sup>SN∆</sup> </italic>mice, p=0.75, Student’s t-test) (Figure 5E, F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Based on the finding in Figure 7 showing that Hoxc8 mutant pSNs inappropriately target extensor-innervating motor neurons, the authors conclude that a Hox matching mechanism required for synapse formation between pSNs and their appropriate MN targets has been disrupted. While this is an appealing possibility, other interpretations are equally possible. For instance, Hoxc8 may be important for the segregation of pSN axon subtypes in the sensory nerve, or for their axon guidance within the spinal cord. A prediction of the Hox matching mechanism is that flexor-innervating pSNs will fail to synapse on flexor-innervating MNs in Hoxc8 MN∆ animals and may inappropriately innervate extensor-innervating MNs. A single example of the latter result is shown (Figure 7—figure supplement 2D, E) – more examples of this outcome would strengthen the Hox matching model.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision, we have reworded our interpretation of these results, and only suggest a “matching model” as one possibility in the Discussion. We have also included other interpretations of the results as the reviewers have thoughtfully suggested. Unfortunately, due to technical constraints, we cannot perform the rabies-mediated transynaptic assays on the <italic>Hoxc8</italic> MN mutant, which would enable a more rigorous quantitative and definitive assessment of synaptic specificity deficits, as we were able to do with the SN-restricted knockout. We are also currently unable to repeat the synaptic tracing assay, due to the effects of the Covid19 shutdown on our mouse colony. We have therefore moved the <italic>Hoxc8</italic> MN mutant analysis from the main results to the Discussion, and explicitly state that analysis of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> MN mutants are preliminary and require additional supporting data. This section now reads as follows:</p><p>“Further studies will be necessary to definitively assess whether the coordinate regulation of MN and pSN connectivity by the same <italic>Hox</italic> gene contributes to sensory-motor specificity. […] Although a <italic>Hox</italic>-specific molecular matching model for pSN-to-MN connectivity is provocative, <italic>Hoxc8</italic> could be required in pSNs, independent of <italic>Hoxc8</italic> in MN, for the segregation of axonal subtypes within the sensory nerve, or for their axon guidance within the spinal cord.”</p><p>We believe the idea that <italic>Hox</italic> genes are needed in MNs during sensory-motor connectivity is additionally supported by the analyses of the <italic>Hox</italic> accessory factor <italic>Foxp1</italic> (Surmeli et al., 2011) and MN-<italic>Hoxc9</italic> mutants (Baek et al., 2017). We agree it remains to be determined whether there is an exact matching between muscle-specific pSNs and MN pools subtypes, but feel it is not an overstatement to say <italic>Hox</italic> genes are needed in both neuronal classes during sensory-motor circuit development.</p></body></sub-article></article>
