However, the incorporation of lipid antigens into subunit vaccine strategies and formulations has been underexplored, and the characteristics of vaccine-induced Mtb lipid-specific memory T cells have remained elusive. Mycolic acid (MA), a major lipid component of the Mtb cell wall, is presented by human CD1b molecules to unconventional T cell subsets. These MA-specific CD1b-restricted T cells have been detected in the blood and disease sites of Mtb-infected individuals, suggesting that MA is a promising lipid antigen for incorporation into multicomponent subunit vaccines. In this study, we utilized the enhanced stability of bicontinuous nanospheres (BCN) to efficiently encapsulate MA for in vivo delivery to MA-specific T cells, both alone and in combination with an immunodominant Mtb protein antigen (Ag85B). Pulmonary administration of MA-loaded BCN (MA-BCN) elicited MA-specific T cell responses in humanized CD1 transgenic mice. Simultaneous delivery of MA and Ag85B within BCN activated both MA- and Ag85B-specific T cells. Notably, pulmonary vaccination with MA-Ag85B-BCN resulted in the persistence of MA, but not Ag85B, within alveolar macrophages in the lung. Vaccination of MA-BCN through intravenous or subcutaneous route, or with attenuated Mtb likewise reproduced MA persistence. Moreover, MA-specific T cells in MA-BCN-vaccinated mice differentiated into a T follicular helper-like phenotype. Overall, the BCN platform allows for the dual encapsulation and in vivo activation of lipid and protein antigen-specific T cells and leads to persistent lipid depots that could offer long-lasting immune responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nanoparticle</kwd><kwd>antigen persistence</kwd><kwd>CD1</kwd><kwd>mycolic acid</kwd><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>T cell</kwd><kwd>antigen archiving</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI057460</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chyung-Ru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI145345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Evan A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chyung-Ru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30AI157314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgun</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI146072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seshadri</surname><given-names>Chetan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morgun</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The bicontinuous nanospheres platform enables dual encapsulation and in vivo activation of lipid and protein antigen-specific T cells, resulting in enduring lipid depots for sustained immune responses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vaccination is currently the most effective method for the prevention and eradication of infectious diseases. In particular, the development of subunit vaccine formulations that include only immunodominant antigens from pathogens paired with select adjuvants have contributed to these efforts. In contrast to attenuated and inactivated vaccines that contain diverse molecular components of pathogens, subunit vaccines are often preferred due to their simplicity, safety, stability, and scalability of production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karch and Burkhard, 2016</xref>). Yet the development of effective vaccines for several key endemic parasitic and bacterial pathogens has remained elusive. Antigen selection for subunit vaccines has thus far focused on protein molecules, overlooking a vast family of non-protein antigens such as lipids, glycolipids, metabolites, and phosphoantigens, which can be found on and within pathogens and can be recognized by various subsets of unconventional T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Legoux et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Persistent antigen exposure is known to occur naturally after infection through antigen archiving by follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), which periodically present antigens to cognate B cells and aid in affinity maturation and somatic hypermutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heesters et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirosue and Dubrot, 2015</xref>). Antigen persistence can also support the maintenance of T cell response through the periodic priming of circulating T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takamura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Demento et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zammit et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Woodland and Kohlmeier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vokali et al., 2020</xref>). Subcutaneous vaccination has also been shown to lead to the archiving of protein antigens within lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), which induce the development of protective T cell immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tamburini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walsh et al., 2021</xref>). However, little is known about how other vaccination routes and vaccine formulations may affect antigen archiving and persistence.</p><p>Lipid and glycolipid antigens can be presented by group 1 (CD1a, b, and c) and group 2 (CD1d) CD1 molecules to CD1-restricted T cells. Unlike MHC molecules, CD1 molecules exhibit limited polymorphism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reinink and Van Rhijn, 2016</xref>). Therefore, CD1-restricted microbial lipid antigens are likely to be recognized by most individuals, making them attractive targets for vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joosten et al., 2019</xref>). Group 1 CD1-restricted T cells have diverse T cell receptors and can recognize a variety of lipid and glycolipid antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morgun et al., 2021</xref>). Microbial lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells have been identified from several pathogens, including Mtb and other mycobacterial species, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (SA), <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and <italic>Brucella melitensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morgun et al., 2021</xref>). CD1b-restricted T cells specific to Mtb lipids including mycolic acid (MA), an immunodominant lipid antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch et al., 2016</xref>) and the component of the mycobacterial cell wall, have been identified in patients with tuberculosis (TB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lopez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montamat-Sicotte et al., 2011</xref>). As group 1 CD1 molecules are not expressed in mice, we have previously developed a human CD1 transgenic mouse model (hCD1Tg). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Felio et al., 2009</xref>) Using hCD1Tg mice, we have shown that transgenic CD1b-restricted DN1 T cells specific for MA could protect against Mtb infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), making these potential antigens of interest in a subunit vaccine against TB.</p><p>The primary goal of a vaccine is to induce the differentiation of the adaptive immune system such that upon re-exposure to the antigen, a faster and larger response occurs, halting pathogen spread. While conventional T cells and B cells are known to undergo this differentiation, unconventional T cells such as NKT cells do not possess a comparable memory phenotype. The presence of Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted memory T cells has been described in both human and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lopez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montamat-Sicotte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Felio et al., 2009</xref>). However, the properties of memory group 1 CD1-restricted T cells, which share a similar developmental pathway as NKT cells, are not known.</p><p>Lipid antigens are difficult to formulate and administer due to their hydrophobic nature. To assess the utility of MA as a component of a subunit vaccine, we previously encapsulated MA in poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene sulfide) (PEG-<italic>b</italic>-PPS) micellar nanocarriers (MA-MC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shang et al., 2018</xref>). Nanocarriers composed of PEG-<italic>b</italic>-PPS possess several unique benefits compared to other delivery platforms, including high stability in aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bobbala et al., 2020</xref>), minimal background immunostimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burke et al., 2022</xref>), and triggered release of cargo when exposed to physiological levels of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Scott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Napoli et al., 2004</xref>). We showed that MA-MC could effectively activate adoptively transferred DN1 T cells and elicit polyclonal group 1 CD1-restricted T cell response in hCD1Tg mice after intranasal delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shang et al., 2018</xref>). While effective for stable loading of lipophilic and amphiphilic payloads, micellar nanocarriers, do not allow for facile encapsulation of hydrophilic payloads like protein antigens.</p><p>Here, we build upon our prior lipid antigen vaccine formulation by employing a nanocarrier platform engineered for the dual loading of both lipid and protein antigens. BCN are polymeric analogs to lipid cubosomes and thus possess a highly organized internal cubic organization containing both intertwined hydrophobic bilayers for lipid loading as well as hydrophilic aqueous channels for protein loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2019</xref>). Using the flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saad and Prud’homme, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bobbala et al., 2018</xref>), we fabricated MA-loaded BCN (MA-BCN) and found them to have the superior stimulatory capacity in vivo compared to MA-loaded poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanocarriers (MA-PLGA), which is a widely used nanocarrier platform for Mtb vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khademi et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, we found that after MA-BCN vaccination, MA could persist for 6 weeks post-vaccination within alveolar macrophages, a phenomenon which was dependent on the presence of an encapsulating vector, nanocarrier, or bacterial, but not the route of vaccination. Due to the enhanced stability of the BCN architecture that can support the loading of diverse and multiple payloads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bobbala et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Modak et al., 2020</xref>), we were able to efficiently co-encapsulate within BCN both MA and Ag85B, an immunodominant protein antigen of Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huygen, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, while both antigens activated their corresponding antigen-specific T cells, only MA resulted in antigen persistence, suggesting a potentially unique characteristic of subunit vaccines containing lipid antigens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BCN morphology preserved after MA loading</title><p>We scalably assembled spherical BCN with and without loaded MA using FNP as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bobbala et al., 2018</xref>). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that both MA-BCN and BCN were consistent in size (364±19 nm and 354±14 nm, respectively), and were monodisperse based on their polydispersity indices (PDIs) of 0.24±0.04 and 0.21±0.05, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We next verified that the BCN formulation maintained its characteristic interconnected aqueous channels using cryogenic transmission electronic microscopy (cryo-TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies, we confirmed the internal cubic organization of BCN. Bragg peaks at the √2, √4, and √6 ratios show that the primitive type of cubic internal organization was preserved between MA-BCNs and BCNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, MA encapsulation did not disturb the BCN architecture. We also manufactured a PLGA nanocarrier formulation (PLGA-NP) with and without MA encapsulation. PLGA-NP morphology was confirmed using cryo-TEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and SAXS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and the size of blank PLGA-NP and MA-loaded PLGA-NP (MA-PLGA) were found to be 169±4 and 163±5 nm, respectively, with PDIs of 0.18±0.04 and 0.19±0.12, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Using the coumarin derivatization method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shang et al., 2018</xref>), we found that BCNs could more efficiently encapsulate MA than PLGA-NPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We previously noted that the highly stable cubic architecture of BCN can lead to the retention of cargo within the endolysosomal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bobbala et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, Texas Red-Dextran loaded BCN were mostly found in lysosomes while Texas Red-Dextran loaded PLGA-NP could be found both within the lysosome and cytosol of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Physicochemical characterization of bicontinuous nanospheres (BCN) and PLGA nanocarrier formulation (PLGA-NP).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis of blank BCN and MA-loaded BCN (MA-BCN).

This is in part due to a lack of research into appropriate lipid vaccine formulations and their associated properties. Some early evidence suggests that lipid vaccines could contribute to protection in the Mtb challenge in the guinea pig model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dascher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Larrouy-Maumus et al., 2017</xref>), which naturally express group 1 CD1 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eckhardt and Bastian, 2021</xref>). Vaccination with a formulation composed of total Mtb lipid encapsulated within liposomes with either dimethyl-dioctadecyl-ammonium (DDA) and/or QS-21 adjuvants showed lower bacterial burden and pathology in lung and spleen compared to unvaccinated controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dascher et al., 2003</xref>). In another study, two Mtb lipids (diacylated sulfoglycolipids and phosphatidylinositol dimannosides) encapsulated into liposomes formulated with DDA and trehalose 6,6’-dibehenateled (TDM) led to a decreased bacterial burden in the spleen and overall improved pathology in the lung and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Larrouy-Maumus et al., 2017</xref>). This work motivated our current study, where we used hCD1Tg mice that express human group 1 CD1 molecules, including CD1b and MA-specific (DN1), as well as p25-specific T cells to investigate the use of nanocarriers coloaded with both Mtb lipid and protein antigens during vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary schematic illustrates MA antigen persistence and memory differentiation of antigen-specific T cells induced by vaccination with MA-loaded nanoparticle vaccine.</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) derived mycolic acid (MA) lipid and Ag85B protein are encapsulated into bicontinuous nanosphere (BCNs) composed of PEG-<italic>b-</italic>PPS polymer.

Following vaccination, dendritic cells (DCs) present the antigens, leading to the activation of CD1b-restricted MA-specific or MHCII-restricted Ag85B-specific T cells (DN1 or p25-specific T cells, respectively). Notably, MA can persist within alveolar macrophages and continue to activate MA-specific T cells even at 6 weeks post-vaccination. These MA-specific T cells have the capacity to differentiate into memory T cells with a T follicular-like phenotype.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87431-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We found that PEG-<italic>b</italic>-PPS BCN could effectively encapsulate MA as well as the protein antigen Ag85B to elicit activation of antigen-specific T cells in vaccinated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first time a dual protein and lipid loaded nanocarrier has been shown to effectively stimulate both lipid and peptide antigen-specific T cells simultaneously in vivo. PEG-<italic>b</italic>-PPS BCN can encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules, making it an excellent platform for subunit vaccine delivery as both antigens and adjuvants can be co-loaded and delivered to the same cellular targets. Prior work on TB vaccines has shown that the inclusion of several protein antigens spanning the Mtb life cycle along with adjuvants with multiple boosts is paramount in the development of a vaccine that can provide effective protection against Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schrager et al., 2020</xref>). As we have established that PEG-<italic>b</italic>-PPS BCN can easily incorporate a variety of payloads, future work will involve determining the optimal antigen and adjuvant combination for providing protection in a Mtb challenge experiment.</p><p>As several formulations of PLGA-NP have been approved for clinical uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), we compared MA encapsulated by either BCN or PLGA-NP and found that while PLGA appeared to offer greater, yet less controllable stimulation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), BCN exhibited significantly greater efficacy in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The result is not completely unexpected as a more fragile PLGA-NP could allow for fast intracellular release and antigen presentation in vitro while also leading to significant antigen loss prior to APC interaction in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding and Zhu, 2018</xref>). Previous studies have documented PLGA’s innate pro-inflammatory effects, while other studies have highlighted the absence and suppression of inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barillet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nicolete et al., 2011</xref>). As PLGA has not been previously used for lipid antigen delivery via IT vaccination, our findings suggest that PLGA may have limited effectiveness in such a vaccine system, although alternative formulations or polymer compositions could potentially yield improved results. In contrast and as previously observed for PEG-<italic>b</italic>-PPS nanocarriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burke et al., 2022</xref>), we showed that unloaded BCN have little inflammatory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), allowing their immunomodulation to be dictated by the properties of the loaded antigen and adjuvant. Thus, PEG-<italic>b</italic>-PPS is a promising polymer for the formulation of subunit vaccines.</p><p>We proceeded with a pulmonary (IN or IT) vaccination approach in this study based on emerging evidence that mucosal vaccination can induce a stronger immune response in the lung against Mtb in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stylianou et al., 2019</xref>) and improve protection following vaccination with nanocarriers in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballester et al., 2011</xref>). We found that in the pulmonary route of vaccination, BCN primarily was taken up and remained within alveolar macrophages in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In fact, the ability of nanocarriers to target alveolar macrophages or other APCs may contribute to their distinct capacity for inducing antigen persistence, which was not seen with cellular carriers such as MA-pulsed BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Alveolar macrophages are the first line of defense of the lungs, responsible for keeping alveoli sterile by taking up inhaled particles and pathogens through phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fels and Cohn, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bowden, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geiser, 2010</xref>). Targeting these cells may be particularly beneficial in a TB vaccine design since they may also be the main site of Mtb latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pai et al., 2016</xref>). While MA remained within alveolar macrophages in the lung, T cell activation appeared to occur prominently within the draining lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that either MA was transported from the lungs to lymph nodes where the presentation took place or T cells activated in the lung migrated to the lymph nodes. The first option seems most likely, as CD1b-expressing DCs are more prevalent in the lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dougan et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, in Mtb infection models, it has been previously shown that apoptotic macrophages and vesicles could deliver mycobacterial antigens to DCs that then activate cognate T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Espinosa-Cueto et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schaible et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, we showed that alveolar macrophages from MA-BCN vaccinated mice could only lead to T cell activation in the presence of BMDCs from hCD1Tg mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated MA persistence in the lung 6 weeks post-vaccination using an in vivo antigen presentation assay with adoptive transfer of naïve MA-specific T cells. Sustained release of antigen through vaccination is thought to be key in the development of a robust adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Silva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Correia-Pinto et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, spike protein was found within the draining lymph nodes of vaccinated human subjects 60 days after COVID-19 vaccination with mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Röltgen et al., 2022</xref>). In mice, pulmonary vaccination with adenovirus expressing influenza nucleoprotein supported long-term maintenance of CD8 T<sub>RM</sub> (resident memory) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uddbäck et al., 2021</xref>). Unlike in this work, antigen persistence did not occur after subcutaneous vaccination, suggesting a distinct mechanism of antigen archiving. In a different vaccine model, subcutaneous administration of ovalbumin paired with adjuvants polyl:C and anti-CD40 led to antigen archiving by LECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tamburini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walsh et al., 2021</xref>). Similar to our findings, antigen-specific T cell activation required cross-presentation by DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tamburini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kedl et al., 2017</xref>). Both LECs and FDCs retain antigens within a non-degradative compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tamburini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heesters et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that residual antigens in our model may similarly remain in the endosome within undigested BCN. We have previously demonstrated the enhanced stability of BCN within cell endosomes in vitro for extensive periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bobbala et al., 2020</xref>). This possibility is corroborated by the finding that DiD, which is easily quenched in aqueous solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Invitrogen, 2023</xref>), remained fluorescent 6 weeks post-vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The lack of persistence for Ag85B could be due to its leakage out from the aqueous pores of BCN, which we have observed for other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bobbala et al., 2018</xref>). Peptide antigens may be modified to include a hydrophobic tail for stable retention within BCN and, therefore, allow for peptide antigen persistence as well. MA’s extreme hydrophobic surface, which correlates with its low permeability as a part of the Mtb cell wall, may also contribute to its prolonged persistence in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daffé et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>After infection and vaccination, peptide antigen persistence has been shown to occur through archiving by binding to CD21 receptors on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heesters et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hirosue and Dubrot, 2015</xref>). MA antigen persistence may likewise be a natural phenomenon that can occur after infections, although its detection may be difficult given the lack of available assays to detect very small amounts of lipid antigen. T cells may, in fact, be more sensitive than any commercially available tool. While we determined that MA persists within AMs following pulmonary vaccination, this localization is likely dependent on the vaccination route. In the case of SC and IV routes, significant exposure of AMs to MA-BCN is unlikely to occur. Consequently, the exact localization of MA after vaccination via SC, IV, or attenuated Mtb remains to be determined, and it is plausible that other types of macrophages may be involved in this process. Additionally, we found that different forms of encapsulation (such as BCN, MC, and attenuate Mtb) can induce antigen persistence, DC internalization alone was not sufficient to replicate this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, the question still remains regarding the necessary properties of the delivery vector for the persistence of antigens to occur. Overall, MA antigen persistence is a robust phenomenon which occurs independently of the vector and vaccine route of administration, and thus may play a role in the efficacy of a variety of vaccine strategies. Additional work will focus on whether lipid antigen persistence is found across the lipid family or specific to lipids with certain properties.</p><p>Antigen persistence can also occur in chronic infections in which it is known to induce T cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber et al., 2006</xref>). Despite differentiating in an environment of persistent antigen exposure, memory DN1 T cells exhibited a gene expression profile more similar to that of Tfh cells rather than exhausted T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In particular, memory DN1 T cells upregulated the expression of TCF7 and BCL6 which are known to sustain a non-exhausted phenotype in CD8 T cells during chronic viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies on antigen archiving have suggested that the mere persistence of antigen is insufficient for exhaustion to develop, and the inflammatory context likely plays a role in T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tamburini et al., 2014</xref>). In many subunit vaccines, virulence factors are used as antigens to target and suppress the pathogen’s capacity to infect the host. The persistence of lipid virulence factors could raise concerns regarding the safety of lipid vaccines. However, it is worth noting that otherwise toxic compounds such as the lipid TDM have been successfully incorporated into numerous vaccines without any known safety concerns to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kwon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lima et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sarkar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Welsh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xin et al., 2013</xref>). The absence of reported safety issues may be attributed to limited research or the administration of low doses of TDM. It is important to highlight that while MA plays a role in immune evasion, MA without additional functional groups has not been shown to elicit similar toxic effects as TDM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daffé et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The use of memory T cells in the setting of antigen persistence may be debatable, given that memory response has historically referred to the adaptive immune response in the setting of antigen clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martin and Badovinac, 2018</xref>). However, given that the persistence of MA occurs even in the setting of attenuated Mtb vaccination, Mtb lipid-specific long-term adaptive immunity will likely naturally exist in an antigen-persistent environment. We found that DN1 T cells in this setting expressed key markers of Tfh cells such as CXCR5, PD-1, BCL6, and TCF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). T cells differentiate into Tfh cells through the expression of master transcription factor regulator BCL6, which directs the upregulation of chemokine receptors CXCR5 and CXCR4 and thus migration into the germinal center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nurieva et al., 2009</xref>). In the germinal center, Tfh cells provide help to B cells for affinity maturation and class switching. Other unconventional T cells are known to behave similarly such as CD1d-restricted NKT cells, which can acquire a Tfh phenotype and provide B cell help through both cognate and non-cognate interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clerici et al., 2015</xref>). Additional work will look at whether DN1 or other group 1 CD1-restricted T cells can functionally act as Tfh cells to provide B cell help, as may be suggested by the existence of IgG antibodies against MA and glycolipid lipoarabinomannan in TB patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Correia-Neves et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schleicher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pan et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>While the persistence of protein antigen has been shown to improve the quality of protective immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Demento et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tamburini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bioley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Silva et al., 2013</xref>), it is not yet known how lipid antigen persistence may affect the protective efficacy of lipid-specific T cells. At the very least, antigen persistence increases the probability of T cell/DC encounters by increasing the time that the antigen is available. Additional work will need to address the function of lipid-specific T cells differentiated in antigen-persistent environments. As the ultimate goal of this work is to improve the efficacy of existing subunit vaccines, future work will assess the protective capacity of lipid antigen vaccines paired with additional protein antigens and adjuvants.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

However, the only vaccine licensed against tuberculosis is Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG), has been around for nearly a century, and has limited efficacy in adults. Herein, the authors sought to investigate the effectiveness of a nanoparticle-based formulation of a subunit vaccine composed of Mtb lipid and protein antigens. The authors found that they were able to load the lipid, mycolic acid, into their nanoparticles without disrupting the architecture and that the loaded particles activated T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, when they vaccinated with particles loaded with both lipid and protein antigens, they found that the lipid antigen persisted, and mycolic acid-specific T cells were able to be activated 6 weeks post-vaccination, in contrast to peptide-specific T cells. The authors investigated further and found that persistence required the nanoparticle encapsulation, rather than free lipid, and that it was independent of route (intratracheal, intravenous, or subcutaneous) of administration. To address the mechanisms underlying antigen persistence, the authors loaded the nanoparticles with a dye and demonstrated that the nanoparticle encapsulated lipid antigen was primarily stored in lung alveolar macrophages and that CD1b+ dendritic cells presented the antigen to mycolic acid specific T cells. Finally, the authors conducted mixed bone marrow chimera studies to examine the phenotype of the mycolic acid specific T cells and found that the memory T cell population phenotypically resembled T follicular helper, regulatory T cells, and exhausted T cells. Interestingly, while a large percentage of these lipid antigen specific T cells in the lymph nodes, lung and spleen were CXCR5+PD1+, the cells were still proliferating (Ki67+). Overall, this is a comprehensive study that has the potential to significantly enhance the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87431.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The work presented here by Morgun et al is performed in the context of vaccine development, a field especially active in the context of tuberculosis (TB).

We did not measure the number or size of germinal centers in this study, but future investigations could explore this aspect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2</bold></p><p>1. Authors elaborate the introduction solely highlighting the relevance of antigen persistence in the context of vaccination. However, it is well known that several mycobacterial antigens (Lipids and proteins) can cause detrimental responses when overexposed to the immune system. In this regard, it would be appropriate to introduce the possibility of the occurrence of exhaustion when prolonged exposure to antigens is happening, which is the main theme of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing these points to our attention. We have added a paragraph in the discussion section (page 15-16, line 372-386), addressing the implications of our findings in relation to exhaustion in the context of antigen persistence during chronic viral infections. We have also provided an example involving the lipid trehalose 6,6’-dibehenateled (TDM), a known virulence factor for Mtb, which has been utilized in several subunit vaccines without demonstrating significant toxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Authors need to provide more information about the source of MA. It is briefly mentioned in the materials and methods section that it was obtained from Sigma. If that is the case, it would be ideal to show the integrity of the polysaccharide in term of balance and abundance between different MA species.</p></disp-quote><p>We obtained M. tuberculosis MA from Sigma, which comprises α-, keto-, and methoxy MA forms with an average combined lipid tail length of 80 carbons. MA-specific T cells preferentially recognize these three forms of MA have been identified in humans. We have provided more detailed information regarding the MA in the Materials and Methods section (page 17, line 429-431).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Building up on the previous comment, MA is a complex mixture of polysaccharides including multiple lengths of fatty acids and modifications. Could the authors comments on the potential variability of MA structure and potential impact on immune responses?</p></disp-quote><p>The binding capacities of Group 1 CD1-restricted T cells can be influenced by various factors, including specific head groups, lipid tail length, and structure of the lipid tail. Notably, DN1 T cells have been shown to have higher binding affinities towards keto and methoxy MA, while displaying weaker binding to α-MA (Van Rhijn et al., 2017, Eur. J. Immunol. 47:1525). In our study, we successfully utilized a mixture of MA to activate DN1 T cells, indicating that the required subtypes of MA were present in sufficient quantities to elicit this activation. In future investigations focusing on the polyclonal immune response, incorporating a mixture of MA and possibly other Mtb lipid antigens will enable a broader spectrum of T cell activation. This, in turn, is expected to enhance the overall effectiveness and robustness of protection in challenge experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. How do the authors explain the lack of stimulation of cell proliferation induced by MA-PLGA formulation? Does this result contradict previous findings?</p></disp-quote><p>This study represents the first instance of utilizing PLGA as a delivery system for a lipid antigen via a pulmonary vaccine route, despite its previous applications in numerous other vaccine formulations. Therefore, we do not think our findings contradicts any existing research in the field. It is worth noting that the immunogenicity of PLGA can be influenced by the specific polymer chemistry and formulation, which may account for potential variations in the observed effects. We have added additional text to the discussion (page 13, line 310 – 313) to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Fig 3. Authors switch to IT administration simply arguing against the limitation of IN delivery regarding its low volume. However, administration via IN could be done in an iterative manner. According to this change, this reviewer asks whether the performance of MA-PLGA could now be comparable to BCN-MA using IT instead.</p></disp-quote><p>PLGA possesses an inherent background adjuvant effect, which may not be ideal for precisely stimulating group 1 CD1-restricted T cells, as a considerable proportion of these T cells exhibit some level of autoreactivity (Li, et al, 2011, Blood 118:3870, De Lalla et al., 2011, Eur. J. Immunol. 41:602; de Jong et al, 2010, Nat. Immunol. 11:1102). Notably, our observations revealed that blank PLGA-NP exerted a significant stimulatory effect on both mouse (DN1) and human (M11) MA-specific T cells (Fig. 2A-D). This underscores the advantage of the BCN system, which lacks detectable adjuvant effects and enables a more controlled, dose-dependent augmentation of T cell responses with increasing concentrations of loaded MA. Therefore, we did not further evaluate the impact of PLGA-MA using the IT route of vaccination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. What would be the reasons of the no role of encapsulating NP in the persistence of MA?</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we have provided evidence to support the notion that encapsulation plays a role in antigen persistence, as demonstrated in Fig. 5A-C. Specifically, we directly compared the persistence of MA when delivered encapsulated in BCNs versus without encapsulation in BCNs, using DC pulsing and IT vaccination as the delivery methods. Our results indicate that at 6 weeks post-vaccination, MA encapsulated in BCNs can activate DN1 T cells, while free MA does not. These findings may initially appear to be contradictory to those depicted in Fig. 5D-F, where antigen persistence is observed following vaccination with attenuated Mtb. However, we propose that the attenuated Mtb bacteria may function similarly to nanoparticles by encapsulating and containing MA, thereby facilitating its persistence within the host. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify these points (page 15, line 364-367). Encapsulation within PEG-PPS NP may also contribute to two additional mechanisms. First, we have demonstrated that PEG-PPS NPs target myeloid cell populations (Burke et al., 2022, Nat. Nano. 17:319), such as alveolar macrophages, that can serve as antigen persistence depots as well as present CD1b/MA complexes on their surfaces. NPs allow more efficient delivery to these cells, whereas otherwise the lipid would bind to albumin, HDL, LDL, and other lipid carriers in blood for a broader, non-specific biodistribution, which would include cells less efficient at antigen persistence or presentation. Second, we previously demonstrated that the BCN nanostructure is highly stable within cells, supporting a slow intracellular release (Bobbala et al., 2020, Nanoscale 12:5332). This could assist with a more sustained presentation of lipid antigen by targeted cells in contrast to free form lipid or NPs (like PLGA) that rapidly degrade within cells. Indeed, low levels of fluorescently tagged BCNs were still detectable 6 weeks post-vaccination (Fig. 6B). Our future studies will further investigate this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Authors need to discuss to what extent the MA location into AM is route dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>The localization of MA within alveolar macrophages (AMs) in the lung is likely specific to intratracheal (IT) vaccination. Therefore, mice vaccinated subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) may possess distinct antigen persistence depots. We have made modifications to the discussion section to further emphasize this point (page 15, line 359-364).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Also, AM are programmed to sustain low immune responses because of their unique location in the lung. In fact, Mtb uses this to replicate while immune response is mounted. In this regard, accumulation of MA into this compartment may not be relevant for the overall immune response. In other words, what would be the contribution of this population to the T cell activation?</p></disp-quote><p>It is likely that AMs primarily function as antigen depots and do not directly contribute to the activation of DN1 T cells. This assertion is supported by our findings, as co-culturing AMs with DN1 T cells alone did not result in T cell activation (Fig. 6E). However, we observed that the presence of hCD1Tg-expressing bone marrow-derived dendritic cells was necessary for DN1 T cell activation in vitro, which likely reflects a similar phenomenon occurring in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Could the T cells responses measured be due to the reduced fraction of DC loaded with BCN-MA at initial time points?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the T cell response observed in Fig. 5A-C, where we used DCs to deliver either free MA or MA-BCN, we took steps to address potential differences in loading capacity between the two at initial time points. Specifically, DCs were pulsed with a concentration of 10 μg/mL for free MA and 5 μg/mL of MA-BCN (the figure legend has been modified to clarify this point, page 37, line 962 - 963). To ensure approximate equivalence in loading, we examined the immune response one week after vaccination and found no statistically significant difference between the two methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
