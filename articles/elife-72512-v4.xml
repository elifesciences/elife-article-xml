therapeutic activities. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) extend estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) cellular lifetime/accumulation. They are antagonists in the breast but agonists in the uterine epithelium and/or in bone. Selective estrogen receptor degraders/downregulators (SERDs) reduce ERα cellular lifetime/accumulation and are pure antagonists. Activating somatic <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations Y537S and D538G enable resistance to first-line endocrine therapies. SERDs have shown significant activities in <italic>ESR1</italic> mutant setting while few SERMs have been studied. To understand whether chemical manipulation of ERα cellular lifetime and accumulation influences antagonistic activity, we studied a series of methylpyrollidine lasofoxifene (Laso) derivatives that maintained the drug’s antagonistic activities while uniquely tuning ERα cellular accumulation. These molecules were examined alongside a panel of antiestrogens in live cell assays of ERα cellular accumulation, lifetime, SUMOylation, and transcriptional antagonism. High-resolution x-ray crystal structures of WT and Y537S ERα ligand binding domain in complex with the methylated Laso derivatives or representative SERMs and SERDs show that molecules that favor a highly buried helix 12 antagonist conformation achieve the greatest transcriptional suppression activities in breast cancer cells harboring WT/Y537S <italic>ESR1</italic>. Together these results show that chemical reduction of ERα cellular lifetime is not necessarily the most crucial parameter for transcriptional antagonism in <italic>ESR1</italic> mutated breast cancer cells. Importantly, our studies show how small chemical differences within a scaffold series can provide compounds with similar antagonistic activities, but with greatly different effects of the cellular lifetime of the ERα, which is crucial for achieving desired SERM or SERD profiles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>Y537S ESR1 Mutation</kwd><kwd>antiestrogen</kwd><kwd>hormone resistance</kwd><kwd>drug resistance</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor degradation</kwd><kwd>D538G ESR1 Mutation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009634</institution-id><institution>Susan G.

ERα is overexpressed in approximately 70% of breast cancers and targeted endocrine therapies are given to prevent primary disease metastasis. Post-menopausal patients primarily receive aromatase inhibitors, which indirectly inhibits ERα by ablating endogenous estrogens, and may be given in combination with a CDK 4/6 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burstein et al., 2019</xref>). Pre-menopausal patients receive tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), which directly binds to the receptor and reprograms transcription to induce cellular quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maximov et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these therapeutic paradigms significantly reduce the 5 years risk of recurrence and continually show improved disease outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mouridsen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Acquired resistance to endocrine therapies remains a major source of breast cancer mortality. Approximately 50% of patients present acquired or de novo resistance to endocrine therapies after an average of 5-years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anurag et al., 2018</xref>). Deep genomic sequencing of endocrine-resistant, ER+, and metastatic breast cancers revealed the presence of <italic>ESR1</italic> ligand binding domain mutations (<italic>ESR1</italic><sub>muts</sub>) at a rate of approximately 25% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Toy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeselsohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Robinson et al., 2013</xref>). Y537S (14%) and D538G (36%) are the two most prevalent mutations and account for nearly 50% of those identified. Both mutations, especially Y537S, enable hormone-free transcriptional activity, resistance to inhibition by 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT, the active metabolite of tamoxifen), and are associated with a more aggressive disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chandarlapaty et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>ESR1</italic><sub>muts</sub> have also been identified in cultured breast cancer cells and become enriched as they become resistant to endocrine therapies, suggesting a latent and selectable mechanism of acquired drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to mimicking the genomic actions of E2 stimulation, <italic>ESR1</italic><sub>muts</sub> bind to unique cistromes and promote allele-specific transcriptional programs compared to E2-stimulated WT receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeselsohn et al., 2018</xref>). Mutation-induced molecular alterations enable resistance to clinically approved antiestrogens and a more aggressive metastatic progressive disease.</p><p>Biochemical studies and x-ray crystal structures have shown that both mutations favor an E2-like agonist conformation in the absence of hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fanning et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nettles et al., 2008</xref>). This favored agonist conformation reduces the binding affinity of ERα ligands and alters the therapeutically important antagonist receptor conformation of the SERM 4OHT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fanning et al., 2016</xref>). Competitive antiestrogens with selective estrogen receptor degrader/downregulator (SERD) activities with improved potencies show superior therapeutic antagonistic activities compared to 4OHT in breast cancer cells harboring Y537S or D538G <italic>ESR1 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fanning et al., 2018b</xref>). The SERD fulvestrant, contrary to 4OHT, completely ablated Y537S ERα transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Toy et al., 2013</xref>). Fulvestrant’s antiestrogenicity stems from its ability to antagonize ERα transcription and reduce its cellular lifetime (degrade/downregulate receptor) by inducing post-translational modifications including SUMOylation and ubiquitination by increasing proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wijayaratne and McDonnell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Traboulsi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilmi et al., 2012</xref>). Tamoxifen and other SERMs also antagonize transcription but induce a stable antagonist conformation that enhances ERα nuclear lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fanning et al., 2018b</xref>). SERMs show partial agonist activities in the uterine endometrium and/or in bone while SERDs are pure antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fanning and Greene, 2019</xref>). Due to unfavorable pharmacological properties of fulvestrant, large-scale efforts brought about the development and clinical evaluation of improved SERDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wardell et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamilton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tria et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wardell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Metcalfe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanning et al., 2018a</xref>). These molecules possess functional groups including carboxylic acids, azeditines, and pyrrolidines that favor the H12 antagonist conformation and induce proteasomal degradation by increasing its conformational mobility, although their impact on receptor post-translational modifications remains uncharacterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fanning and Greene, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanning et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Savi et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, recent studies suggest that ERα degrading activities may not be required for therapeutic efficacy in breast cancer cells with recurring hotspot <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fanning et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lainé et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wardell et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreano et al., 2020</xref>). In light of this recent work, the role of ERα modification by ubiquitin and SUMO, cellular lifetime, and accumulation in anti-cancer therapeutic activities, especially with the <italic>ESR1<sub>muts</sub></italic>, remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we developed a series of novel lasofoxifene (Laso) derivatives that affect ERα cellular accumulation similar to either SERMs or SERDs, providing a comparable chemical scaffold to study the role of receptor stability on transcriptional antagonistic and antiproliferative activities. We evaluated these molecules against a panel of SERMs and SERDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) representing a comprehensive spectrum of clinical and preclinical antiestrogenic small molecules. As part of these studies, we developed a novel high-throughput live-cell approach to quantify and observe the kinetics of ERα cellular accumulation within living breast cancer cells upon treatment with SERMs or SERDs. Because fulvestrant-induced SUMOylation of WT ERα correlates with shortened kinetics of interaction with DNA, lowered accessibility of estrogen response elements, and more efficient repression of ERα target genes in the presence of fulvestrant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Traboulsi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hilmi et al., 2012</xref>), bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) was used to examine differences between SERM and SERD-induced SUMOylation for WT, Y537S, and D538G ERα. Reporter gene assays quantifying the impact of SERM or SERD treatment on WT transcriptional antagonism in WT or heterozygous Y537S/WT and D538G/WT MCF7 breast cancer cells revealed that antiestrogen efficacy at suppressing transcription did not necessarily correlate with reduced receptor accumulation. Further, cellular proliferation studies in MCF7 with heterozygous WT/Y537S <italic>ESR1</italic>, which possesses the greatest degree of antiestrogen-resistance, show that manipulating ERα stability did not enhance anti-proliferative activities in cultured cells. Comparison of Y537S ERα LBD x-ray crystal structures in complex with SERMs and SERDs reveal a ligand-dependent H12 conformational pose that corresponds to increased transcriptional antagonistic efficacies.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Estrogen receptor alpha ligands evaluated in this study including estradiol, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and selective estrogen receptor degraders/downregulators (SERDs).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-72512-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ligand influence on ERα expression in live breast cancer cells</title><p>We developed a live cell-based assay to quantify differences in ERα expression and cellular lifetime based on ligand or mutation. T47D breast cancer cells were engineered to express a doxycycline (dox) inducible halo-tagged (HT) ERα, allowing the cells to be treated with a permeable HT-specific fluorophore (halo-618) and levels of ERα expression quantified following the addition of dox. To determine ERα accumulation, cells were distributed into 96-well plates in estrogen depleted medium. Using a range of dox concentrations, we found that 1 μg/mL was the lowest dose needed to achieve maximal signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To uncover whether ligands and activating somatic mutations influenced the cellular lifetime of ERα, we simultaneously induced halo-ERα expression, treated with 1 μM ligand, and measured fluorescence normalized to cell count every 4 hr for 100 hr. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows representative curves plotting the mean fluorescence counts of two biological replicates (± SD) after normalization to cell count by phase contrast. For WT cells, ERα reached a maximum at approximately 24 hr then fell to baseline by 80 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Treatment with E2 lead to a reduced expression but the signal converged with vehicle by around 30 hr and had fully returned to baseline around 80 hr. Treatment with SERDs further reduced the signal and led to a rapid return to baseline, at around 45 hr for fulvestrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Treatment with SERMs greatly enhanced ERα levels over vehicle and extended the time to baseline to past 80 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, veh-treated WT and Y537S cells showed similar profiles, but the Y537S mutant took slightly longer to reach baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Unlike the E2-treated WT cells, E2-treated Y537S cells showed an identical pattern to veh-treated Y537S cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Surprisingly, the Y537S mutant extended the ERα lifetime in the presence of fulvestrant, past 60 hr compared to 45 hr for WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Unexpectedly, the D538G mutant not only reduced the magnitude of ERα expression, but also the kinetics of its cellular turnover with a greater time to baseline for each SERD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For SERMs, each molecule showed similar profiles of enhancing ERα lifetime in the WT T47D cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the 537 S cells, they further enhanced stability compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Surprisingly, RU39411 was the only SERM to elicit any kind of difference on D538G by showing a slight increase in stability; however, it was still approximately 2.5-fold less than in the Y537S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These data suggest that, in addition to hormone independent transcriptional activities, both Y537S and D538G mutations uniquely affect ERα cellular lifetime within T47D cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Impact of ligand and mutation on Halo-estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) lifetime in T47D breast cancer cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Halo-618 fluorescence measured every 4 hr in T47D cells expressing WT halo-ERα (<bold>A</bold>), Y537S (<bold>B</bold>), and D538G (<bold>C</bold>) treated over 100 hr with vehicle (Veh), 1 μM estradiol (E2), fulvestrant (ICI), or GDC0927 following induction of expression.

GDC0927 was less affected in its capacity to induce SUMOylation by D538G, albeit its potency was reduced, consistent with our lifetime/accumulation experiments.

Interestingly, 4OHT also induced low levels of SUMOylation in the D538G mutant that were not observed for WT and Y537S. These gains in SUMOylation for LA-Stab and 4OHT correlate with their loss of stabilization activity observed in T47D cells.

SERMs extend ERα lifetime, increase receptor accumulation, and are antagonists in the breast and agonists in the bone and uterine epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fanning and Greene, 2019</xref>). Tissue-specific partial agonist activities stem from SERM inhibition of Activating Function-2 (AF-2) but not AF-1 genomic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shang and Brown, 2002</xref>).

Initial studies suggested that SERD activity was necessary for therapeutic potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Toy et al., 2013</xref>); however, Lainé et al. showed that the SERM Laso induced marked anti-cancer activities in xenografts of Y537S <italic>ESR1</italic> breast cancer cells without fulvestrant-level ERα degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lainé et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wardell et al., 2020</xref> concluded that antagonism rather than ERα degradation/downregulation drives most of fulvestrant efficacy in suppressing primary tumor growth in xenograft assays, based on observations that a dose of fulvestrant affording a non-significant reduction in ER levels led to significant growth suppression of a long-term estrogen-deprived breast cancer cell model over 4 weeks (). This is supported by observation in cell lines that fulvestrant retains transcriptional inhibition properties upon increases in ERα concentrations that lead to saturation of degradation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lupien et al., 2007</xref>) Based on this work, we examined the contribution of SERD activity to the potency and efficacy of transcriptional suppression by antiestrogens in breast cancer cells harboring Y537S or D538G <italic>ESR1</italic>. To understand whether chemical manipulation of ERα cellular lifetime correlates with improved antagonistic activities, we synthesized methylated derivatives of Laso that uniquely influence receptor cellular lifetime and accumulation. We compared these molecules to a comprehensive panel of SERMs, SERM/SERDs and SERDs for their effects on WT and mutant ERα cellular stability and transcriptional activity in breast cancer cells.</p><p>To quantify the influence of antiestrogens on ERα cellular lifetime, we developed a high-throughput system to observe WT, Y537S, or D538G ERα expression in living T47D breast cancer cells. Because induction of ERα modifications may take place even when degradation is absent, we also quantified differences in ERα SUMOylation, a post-translational modification that is induced by fulvestrant together with ubiquitination and that influences interaction with DNA and transcriptional activity in ER +MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Traboulsi et al., 2019</xref>). We discovered that addition of a 3R-methyl group on Laso’s pyrrolidine induced both ERα SUMOylation and degrading activities, while addition of a 2S-methyl on the pyrrolidine leads to an accumulation of ERα in the breast cancer cells.</p><p>This approach also revealed an unexpected effect of each mutant on ERα expression and cellular lifetime. Most SERD molecules exhibited diminished capacities to affect Y537S ERα levels compared to WT. Two carboxylic acid-containing SERD molecules AZD9496 and LSZ102 unexpectedly switched to stabilizing Y537S, similar to 4OHT. Of note, AZD9496 did not induce SUMOylation with WT ERα, in keeping with a different conformation of the receptor observed in carboxylic acid-containing antiestrogens. Apart from this discrepancy, the general good degree of correlation between the impact of antiestrogens on SUMOylation of WT or mutant ER and their impact on receptor lifetime suggests either a cross-talk between SUMOylation and ubiquitination, possibly mediated by SUMO targeted ubiquitin ligases (STUbLs) such as RNF4, or similar structural determinants for addition of either marks by their respective enzymatic complexes. It will therefore be of interest in the future to explore whether carboxylic acid-containing antiestrogens selectively induce increased receptor ubiquitination, or lead to degradation by other mechanisms.</p><p>We were surprised that the Y537S mutant showed nearly identical unliganded/apo and E2-treated profiles, with enhanced cellular expression in the presence hormone to similar levels as WT in the absence of hormone. In addition to constitutive transcriptional activities and resistance to inhibition by tamoxifen, the Y537S also likely contributes to breast cancer pathology through increasing the quantity of active receptor in the cell. The D538G mutant was also surprising because it dampened the influence of SERDs on ERα SUMOylation, accumulation, and lifetime. It suppressed the stabilizing effects of SERMs on WT ERα, correlating with induction of weak SUMOylation of the D538G mutant but not WT receptor. The D538G <italic>ESR1</italic> mutant occurs with the greatest frequency in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chandarlapaty et al., 2016</xref>) but its selective advantage has remained unclear. Our studies suggest that the diminished ability of cells to degrade D538G ERα coupled with its low-level constitutive transcriptional activities contributes a pathological advantage within the tumor in the presence of first-line endocrine therapies. Further studies will reveal whether these alterations to ERα lifetime influence breast cancer pathological endpoints and therapeutic response.</p><p>Transcriptional reporter gene assays in MCF7 cells harboring WT, WT/Y537S, or WT/D538G <italic>ESR1</italic> were used to understand whether the degrees of ERα degradation and/or SUMOylation correlated with transcriptional inhibitory activities. We identified antiestrogens across the SERM-SERD spectrum that demonstrated significantly improved transcriptional repressive activity over 4OHT in these cells. Interestingly, RU39411, which significantly enriched ERα levels (SERM-like), showed enhanced transcriptional inhibition compared to most molecules. Despite their unique influences on WT ERα cellular stability, the methylated Laso derivatives showed identical transcriptional antagonistic efficacies in the WT and mutant cell lines compared to unmodified Laso in our assay.</p><p>Alkaline phosphatase activities in Ishikawa uterine cell lines were used to understand whether observed SERM or SERD influences on ERα degradation correlated with receptor-dependent uterotrophic activities. Here, the SERM-like LA-Stab showed a robust induction of AP activity, but not to the extent of 4OHT or Z-endoxifen. Laso showed a modest induction and LA-Deg showed no induction of AP activity. Surprisingly, 4OHT was more uterotrophic than Z-endoxifen, another tamoxifen metabolite. These results suggest that Z-endoxifen is less SERM-like that 4OHT and may explain its improved efficacy in letrazole-resistant models of ER +breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jayaraman et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Cellular proliferation assays in MCF7 cells with WT/Y537S <italic>ESR1</italic> were used to reveal the role of ERα degradation in anti-proliferative activities. We showed that 4OHT, fulvestrant, Laso, LA-Deg, and LA-Stab can reduce E2-stimulated proliferation. Fulvestrant and Laso show improved efficacies at lower concentrations, while LA-Stab and LA-Deg did not show improved anti-proliferative activities. However, no molecule completely repressed the proliferation of these cells. Our BRET, transcription, and proliferation data are consistent with our observations that SERMs have similar efficacies at suppressing cofactor recruitment in WT and <italic>ESR1<sub>mut</sub></italic> cells. Together, these data suggest that SERM or SERD influences on ERα cellular lifetime may not directly correlate with transcriptional antagonistic and anti-proliferative activities of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutant breast cancer cells. Rather, engineered chemical reduction of ERα cellular accumulation is critical for tuning tissue- and gene-specific agonistic/partial agonistic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fanning and Greene, 2019</xref>) and preventing AF-1 dependent mechanisms of endocrine resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Massarweh et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>X-ray crystal structures of WT and Y537S ERα LBD in complex with SERMs, SERM/SERDs, and a SERD showed that the most efficacious molecules enforced H12 burial within the AF-2 cleft.

Of the structures, RU39411 (SERM), RAL (SERM/SERD), and BZA (SERM/SERD) demonstrated the greatest transcriptional inhibitory efficacies in WT/Y537S <italic>ESR1</italic> MCF7 cells. These molecules engaged a new S537-E380 hydrogen bond that enforced a well-ordered antagonistic H12 conformation that corresponded to significant surface area burial within the AF-2 cleft. Conversely, molecules with diminished Y537S transcriptional potencies poorly enforced this conformation as H12 showed variable conformations and reduced surface area burial in the AF-2 cleft.</p><p>Overall, our studies show how minor chemical modifications lead to switches in ERα stabilizing or degrading activities onto an antiestrogen scaffold, likely via modulation of ERα post-translational modification. While these activities may not confer an antagonistic benefit in breast cancer cells, they are important drivers of AF-1 mediated tissue-specific activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shang and Brown, 2002</xref>). ERα proteolysis is critical to normal activity and E2 binding induces phosphorylation at position Y537, which recruits E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, further understanding of the role played by Y537 phosphorylation in ERα SERM or SERD antagonism in breast cancer cells requires further study. Importantly, we showed that SERMs and SERDs differentially affect Y537S H12 binding in the AF-2 cleft. SERDs, like fulvestrant, increase H12 conformational mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fanning et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pike et al., 2001</xref>) and enhance binding of corepressor proteins such as NCOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Webb et al., 2003</xref>) that are important contributors to anti-cancer activities. Therefore, it is likely that SERMs and SERDs differentially affect the repertoire of coregulator proteins that associate with Y537S ERα and contribute to anti-cancer activities. Revealing these changes will be critical for developing new competitive antiestrogens that maintain activities in the presence of Y537S and D538G <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>MCF-7 and T47D cells were purchased directly from ATCC.

An identical construct with but with an intact 536 L and Y537S was generated using Q5 site-directed mutagenesis (Promega) and was used for all Y537S x-ray crystal structure determinations. <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3) were used for all recombinant protein expression. An overnight culture at 37 °C was inoculated with a single colony in 50 mL LB broth containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. 5 mL of the overnight culture was used to inoculated each of 10 L of LB-ampicillin, which were allowed to grow at 37 °C with shaking until an OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.6 was reached, indicating log-phase growth. Protein expression commenced upon the addition of 0.3 mM IPTG and continued overnight at 16 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min. Cells were resuspended in 5 mL/g cell paste in 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 0.5 mM TCEP, and 5% glycerol with the addition of 1 EDTA-free cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet per 50 mL lysate (Roche). Cells were lysed by sonication on ice with stirring and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C. The clarified lysate was loaded onto 2.5 mL of pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA resin and washed with 5 column volumes of 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 0.5 mM TCEP, and 5% glycerol. Protein was eluted with 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 400 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 0.5 mM TCEP, and 5% glycerol. A 1:200 mol:mol ratio of hexa-His-TEV protease was added to the eluent and the solution was dialyzed in 4 L of 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole pH 8.0, 0.5 mM TCEP, and 5% glycerol overnight at 4° with stirring. ERα was separated from the hexa-His tag and His-TEV protease by passing it over pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA resin and collecting the flow-through. The protein was concentrated to 5 mL, but no higher than 15 mg/mL and placed over a Superdex 200 HiLoad 200 16/600 size exclusion column that was equilibrated with 25 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, and 5% glycerol. A small precipitate peak was observed at the leading edge of the column followed by a well-resolved single peak corresponding to the correct molecular weight of approximately 30,000 Da for ERα LBD. Fractions corresponding to these proteins were concentrated to <underline>&gt; </underline>10 mg/mL, flash frozen, and stored at –80 °C for later use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-11"><title>X-ray crystal structure determination</title><p>Purified LBD was incubated with 2 mM of each compound between 4 and 16 hr at 4 °C prior to crystal screens. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated ligand/protein. Hanging drop vapor diffusion was used to generate all crystals. 2 μL protein at 5–15 mg/mL was mixed with 2 μL mother liquor using Hampton VDX plates (Hampton Research, HR3-140). All crystals were grown in 5%–20% PEG 3350 or PEG 8000, pH 6–8.0, 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. For each complex, clear crystals grew at room temperature. Crystals emerged between 16 hr and 2 weeks. For BZA, RAL, 4-OHT, Laso, 48–2, and LSZ102 complexes these crystals appeared as hexagonal pucks. For RU39411 and 49–2 complexes crystals were rhombohedral. Crystals were either directly frozen in mother liquor or incubated in mother liquor with the addition of 25% glycerol as cryo-protectants. All x-ray data sets were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratories, Argonne, Illinois on the SBC 19-BM beamline (0.97 Å). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref> shows representative 2mFo-DFc difference maps for ligands in the ligand binding pocket. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig8sdata1">Figure 8—source data 1</xref> contains data collection and refinement statistics.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>In the interest of transparency, Dr. Fanning's laboratory receives sponsored research funds from Olema Oncology Inc.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kendall W Nettles (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an impressive structural and molecular mechanistic study in the modes of action of a series of Estrogen Receptor inhibitor molecules. The study is also of high relevance in the context of the resistance acquiring ER537/538 mutations. Molecular understanding of the underlying mechanisms is lacking here and the authors make a valuable contribution.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use a halo-tagged ERα construct to quantify differences in ERα expression and cellular lifetime. Appending large protein domains to ERα potentially influences the properties of the protein. What are the data that show that this is not the case? Is the singular experiment of T47D cells with increasing doses of fulvestrant enough? This would constitute more a qualitative comparison and actually 2-3 additionally SERMs would ideally be compared in this manner as well. (Especially because this halo-tagged ER is also central to studies with the ER mutants).</p><p>2) Figure4A-C. The dose response curves look more like step-functions (Hill slope is extremely steep), than a -to be expected- curvature over at least two log decades (as is the case for example in Figure 4D-F). What is going on there?</p><p>3) The description/discussion of the crystallography data (for example movement of Helix 12) is very qualitative. Especially with such rather small movements (and not all structures at very high resolution), it would be extremely valuable (I personally would say necessary), to provide a more quantitative and statistical analysis of the data (by adding elements such as the maximum-likelihood coordinate error). Many movements in the Helix 12 position appear to be in the 0.1-0.4 Å scale and with only the refined structure shown (and not the actual electron density), there is a potential danger of overinterpretation of the data.</p><p>4) I very much appreciate that the authors selected the protein with the fewest crystal contacts in the crystal structure, to limit the effect of those contacts on the H12 as much as possible. However, it remains somewhat unclear to the reader now, for which of the structures these crystal contacts might still have influence the positioning of H12 in the final structures.</p><p>5) An interesting aspect (for future studies, potentially to be shortly discussed in the outlook of the manuscript) would be the effect/interplay of these ER modulators with the Y537 phosphorylation, which is -in the opinion of this reviewer- a highly relevant but understudied mechanism regarding responsiveness to SERM therapy. Also, because the molecular effects described for this phosphorylation are quite similar to the effects of the point mutations e.g. (a more E2 like conformation without ligand).</p><p>6) It would be helpful to know if the new compounds show SERM agonist activity, such as seen with tamoxifen in luciferase assays in the HepG2, and to a lesser extent, Ishikawa cell lines.</p><p>7) Reference 5: 50% de novo or acquired resistance at 5 years. This reference doesn't show that. See instead PMID: 30555626</p><p>8) Figure 2 is confusing. It appears that they completed time course studies (Figure 2 D-I), and then picked a time for the dose response (A-C), which are then summarized in Figure 2J. This should be reordered. The legend doesn't describe what is being done (fluorescence of halo tagged ER was assayed after addition of halo dye, dox, and ER ligand). Please reexamine the figure legends to make sure the reader can assess what was done.</p><p>9) Figure 2 presents the laso derivatives before they are explained in the text. The reader doesn't know what LA-stab and LA-Deg are at this point. These data could be removed from Figure 2A-I and Figure 2J moved to Figure 3.</p><p>10) Please renumber the chains so the A chain is the relevant chain to look at in each structure to make it easier for the viewer to look at them and superpose them. Please add a supplemental table listing all the pdb codes that were analyzed and their respective ligands.</p><p>11) Figure 7. And the associated text need significant revision.</p><p>12) Structures of the ER LBD have typically shown helix 12 in the agonist conformation, or with helix 12 flipped into the coactivator binding site to block recruitment of coactivators, which has been called the antagonist conformation. However, there is a significant body of data that antagonism involves recruitment of transcriptional corepressor proteins, which require helix 12 to be in a third position, which is unstructured. This was seen with the structure of a compound that is similar to fulvestrant, ICI 164,384, and some more recent full antagonist structures such as pdb 7rs3, 6b0f, 5T92 and 5t97. Importantly, mutations or phosphorylation of Ser305 that stabilize helix 12 in the &quot;antagonist&quot; conformer block corepressor recruitment and enable SERM agonist activity. The current model is that the degree of helix 12 destabilization drives efficacy, and that the so called &quot;antagonist conformation&quot; is actually the SERM agonist conformer by blocking corepressors, and allowing the amino terminal coactivator binding domain to have some constitutive activity see PMID: 34452998, 17283072, 1250199, 12482846. See also Dr. Fanning's previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper showing that the efficacy of bazedoxifene is through pushing on the helix 11-12 loop to destabilize helix 12.</p><p>Given this background, the conclusion of the structural studies was suggested to support the opposite conclusion, that stabilizing helix 12 leads to greater efficacy. After examining the structures in detail there does not appear to be a clear SAR between luciferase activity and helix 12 position, and it was not clear that the luciferase data correlated with anti-proliferative maximal efficacy.</p><p>13) The authors should reexamine the structures to identify how Ser537 and Tyr537 elicit different effects on the helix 11-12 loop interaction with the ligand to drive different pharmacology.</p><p>14) in the Baz 537S structure, the loop position is due to crystal packing, which could pull helix 12 and this should be noted or these structures not discussed.</p><p>15) The positions of amino acids 537, 373, and 351 should be reexamined in the structures. There are obvious errors in 7bk5 that if real space refined show the H-bond between Tyr537 and His373</p><p>16) The discussion and introduction have some redundancy. It might be better to move the extensive analysis on why degradation is not important for efficacy to the discussion and just briefly mention in the intro that there is increasing evidence and give the references. Sentences on line 439 and 440 are not needed in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72512.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors use a halo-tagged ERα construct to quantify differences in ERα expression and cellular lifetime.

Because they were relatively minor, we have removed the discussion of ligand-specific changes and have instead focused the section on the clear structural features that are observed in the most potent molecules. In terms of qualitative discussion, we originally calculated buried surface area for each helix 12 in the Y537S structures and observed a trend where the molecules that favored the most burial in the AF2 cleft also showed the greatest anti-transcriptional efficacies. In the revised manuscript, we have now also included B-factor analysis and show that the H12 in the Y537S structures that has the lowest B-factor (normalized to the average B-factor across the structure) are those that show the greatest anti-transcriptional potencies.</p><p>We made a new Figure 7. Instead of showing every structure, we now highlight the structural features of the most versus least effective molecules in the MCF7 WT/Y537S <italic>ESR1</italic> cells. Specifically, we observe that the most effective molecules show little difference versus their WT counterpart, form a hydrogen bond between S537 and E380, and the 2mFo-DFc difference maps of H12 are rigid and well packed in the AF-2 cleft. The least effective molecules lack this hydrogen bond and are poorly packed.</p><p>Further descriptions of the crystal contact are included in the results. A supplemental figure has been included that highlights the crystal contact formed between D538 and a symmetry mate arginine affects H12 and disqualified those monomers from the analysis.

We were able to obtain these data in Ishikawa cells purchased from Σ Aldrich as well as ECC1 cells that were donated by Olema Oncology. We also purchased Ishikawa cells from ATCC but had difficulty culturing them. We used an established alkaline phosphatase activity assay to measure ERα agonism in these cells.<sup>3</sup> These results show that the SERM-like LA-Stab does show SERM-agonistic activities in these assays. Laso showed a slight induction, while LA-Deg (the SERD) did not induce activity. These experiments were performed alongside 4OHT, ICI, and Z-endoxifen. Interestingly, E2 showed different degrees of stimulation between the two cells lines.

Helix 12 in the AF-2 cleft occludes co-activator (i.e. SRC3) binding, while recruitment of corepressor enzymes like NCOR or SMRT to ERα also contribute epigenetic silencing activities<sup>4</sup>. 4-hydroxtamoxifen (4OHT) can induce ERα-NCOR binding but fulvestrant and raloxifene do so more efficiently<sup>4</sup>. These studies suggest H12 instability enhances co-repressor recruitment, which improves anti-transcriptional activities. It is also established that H12 instability correlates with ERα-degrading activities. Therefore, SERD-induced ERα-degradation should predict co-repressor recruitment and enhanced anti-transcriptional therapeutic activities. However, studies from the McDonnell lab suggests that the fulvestrant therapeutic activities stem from ERα transcriptional antagonism to a greater degree than degradation<sup>5</sup>. Further, lasofoxifene, a relatively poor ERα degrader, demonstrates improved activities over fulvestrant in MCF7 cells with WT or Y537S ERα<sup>6</sup>. Together, these studies suggest that, in breast cancer cells, ERα transcriptional antagonism may not correlate strongly with the degree of receptor degradation. In our study, we synthesized the lasofoxifene derivatives in order to test this hypothesis. These molecules, along with a panel of SERMs, SERM/SERDs, and SERDs suggest that degradation does not predict transcriptional antagonistic potency in breast cancer cell lines harboring WT or WT/mutant <italic>ESR1</italic> under our assay conditions. As discussed, it may play a role in partial agonist activity of antiestrogens in a tissue- or possibly gene-specific specific manner.</p><p>Another major area of this study is revealing the structural basis for differential SERM or SERD activities for Y537S ERα. Structural studies were performed in parallel with the biological studies and we sought to solve as many structures as possible to identify structural features that correlate with efficacy. Our previous bazedoxifene (BZA) study did suggest that mobilizing H12 improved activity for Y537S ERα compared to 4OHT. However, we were unable to solve a structure of the molecule in complex with the Y537S mutant. Rather, we used solution-phase protein dynamics studies using HDX-MS of BZA in complex with WT or Y537S ERα LBD. We also performed detailed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the BZA bound to Y537S ERα LBD. Both studies from that paper agree with our current structural analysis. The HDX-MS data showed that H12 is less dynamic in the Y537S-BZA structure versus WT. The MD-sim predicted the formation of the S537-E380 hydrogen bond.</p><p>In terms of the structures of ICI 164,380 and other pure antagonist SERDs. In the PDB, the ICI 164,380 structure is with rat ERβ and lacks an ordered H12. We recently solved a structure of the same ligand and derivatives thereof in complex with ERα LBD carrying the mutation L536S in collaboration with our co-author Dr. Sylvie Mader for a forthcoming paper. Here, ERα H12 is observed in the antagonistic conformation in the AF-2 cleft but it is less helical than what would be observed in a SERM structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Modeling of fulvestrant binding with S536 or L536 LBDs also maintained H12 in antagonist conformations. As for the other ligands, we have evaluated the models and the maps and at least some difference density is observed in the AF-2 cleft in the monomers that lack a modeled H12. While it is not significant in all of the structures, it is readily apparent in the 5T92 and 5T97 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). In our experience, additional rounds of refinement likely would have led to a better-observed H12 and would have enabled the modeling of at least the main-chain. These structures suggest that H12 is not completely in a new disordered conformation but may still pack into the AF-2 cleft.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-72512-sa2-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig><p>We lack a complete understanding of how SERMs or SERDs induce ERα corepressor binding and the role these protein play in antagonistic activities across multiple hormone-responsive tissues. The NCOR-ERα binding study from the Kushner lab<sup>4</sup> suggests that H12 must be absent from the AF2 cleft for full binding. They also show that the hinge region, in between the DNA-binding domain and LBD, is important for NCOR binding. Likewise, a decreased co-repressor recruitment is observed with phospho S305, which lies near the ERα hinge-region far from the AF-2 cleft<sup>7</sup>. Together, these studies suggest that co-repressors likely bind along multiple surfaces on ERα beyond just the AF-2 cleft. Recent, cryo-EM structures of ERα and AR from the O’Malley lab also show significant contacts between AF-2 co-activators and the respective LBDs<sup>8,9</sup>. Additionally, a recent study from the Nettles and Katzenellenbogen laboratories shows that ERα antagonists that affect helix 8, in addition to helix 12, alters the repertoire of associated coregulators and enhances anti-cancer activities<sup>10</sup>. Together, these studies show that coregulator binding occurs across multiple surfaces of ERα and more studies are needed to improve our understanding of these relationships.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) in the Baz 537S structure, the loop position is due to crystal packing, which could pull helix 12 and this should be noted or these structures not discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is true for Chain B, which shows a potential crystal contact at L536 as well a hydrogen bond formed between D538 and R436 of a symmetry mate. We chose to analyze Chain A in this structure because there are no crystal contacts observed until the c-terminus of the protein. There is a symmetry mate that approaches the H11-12 loop around residues 530 to 532. However, there is no clear contact formed here and the closest it reaches is 3.8 Å, outside hydrogen bonding distance. Crystal contacts are frequent confounding factors in crystal structures that, in our opinion, are not discussed as often enough. We have included additional descriptions of the crystal contacts in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The positions of amino acids 537, 373, and 351 should be reexamined in the structures.

Each of these structures have been extensively refined but we have reanalyzed the positioning of 537, 373, and 351. We have redeposited the coordinates as needed. As is the case with many ERα LBD structures, Y537 is not fully ordered in each chain, but is structured enough for us to have some confidence in its positioning. For 7KBS, we solved this structure because we wanted to improve upon the 2.6 Å of PDB: 1ERR. Indeed, we were able to solve the structure of RAL in complex with ERα LBD to 1.83 Å and in the same C2 spacegroup as 1ERR. In the 1ERR structure, Y537 is ordered in Chain A but not in Chain B and is poised for a hydrogen bond with H373. However, the density around H373 is poorly resolved in both monomers of 1ERR. In 7KBS, Y537 and H373 are better resolved in both chains. While Y537 is not fully resolved in Chain A, the curvature of the density suggests that we have modeled it in the most representative side-chain conformation. Neither monomer suggests the presence of an ideal hydrogen bond, given the roughly 90<sup>o</sup> angle between the phenol and imidazole. In sum, there is a potential hydrogen bond between Y537 and H373 in 1ERR but the sidechains are poorly resolved, while the sidechains better resolved in 7KBS and do not show the formation of a hydrogen bond.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-72512-sa2-fig2-v4.tif"/></fig><p>References1.
