In the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the SMC complex MukBEF is necessary for rapid growth and the accurate segregation and positioning of the chromosome, although the specific molecular mechanisms involved are still unknown. Here, we used a number of in vivo assays to reveal how MukBEF controls chromosome conformation and how the MatP/<italic>matS</italic> system prevents MukBEF activity. Our results indicate that the loading of MukBEF occurs preferentially on newly replicated DNA, at multiple loci on the chromosome where it can promote long-range contacts in cis even though MukBEF can promote long-range contacts in the absence of replication. Using Hi-C and ChIP-seq analyses in strains with rearranged chromosomes, the prevention of MukBEF activity increases with the number of <italic>matS</italic> sites and this effect likely results from the unloading of MukBEF by MatP. Altogether, our results reveal how MukBEF operates to control chromosome folding and segregation in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromosome</kwd><kwd>MukBEF</kwd><kwd>MatP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-CE12-0013-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boccard</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJA 20181208006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seba</surname><given-names>Mohammed</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MukBEF selectively loads onto newly replicated DNA, and MatP prevents MukBEF activity, correlating with matS sites, likely due to MatP-mediated unloading.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) complexes play key roles in many processes involved in chromosome management, from genome maintenance, interphase chromatin organization, sister chromatids alignment, chromosome folding and condensing, to DNA recombination at specific stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>). A general model for SMC complex activity relies on their properties to bridge DNA elements and by doing so build DNA loops in cis and hold together the sister chromatids in trans; to do that, they bind DNA and processively extrude a DNA loop in an ATPase-driven loop extrusion, thereby compacting and organizing DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kong et al., 2020</xref>). Yet many molecular features that determine the activity of the various SMC complexes are still unclear and it is not known whether they work using the same basal mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pradhan et al., 2022</xref>). For example, it is not yet clear whether (i) the activity of SMC complexes is mediated by a single complex or if it involves cooperation between several complexes that organize into dimers or even oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hassler et al., 2018</xref>), (ii) the DNA extrusion involves a topological or nontopological mechanism, i.e., does the DNA pass through the SMC ring topologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pradhan et al., 2022</xref>), (iii) the activity of SMC complexes relies on the folding capacities of the SMC coiled-coil arms facilitating large-scale conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bürmann et al., 2019</xref>), and (iv) multiple complexes that encounter one another on the same DNA in living cells bypass each other or collide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anchimiuk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandão et al., 2021</xref>). Cohesin and condensin are the most characterized SMC complexes found in many eukaryotes. In bacteria, three different forms of SMC-like complexes defined as bacterial condensins have been identified, Smc-ScpAB, MukBEF, MksBEF; they are considered functionally related to condensins as they are thought to compact chromosomes and facilitate the segregation of sister chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lioy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marbouty et al., 2015</xref>). In bacteria, Smc-ScpAB represents the most highly conserved complex, while MukBEF and MksBEF represent diverged SMC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cobbe and Heck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yoshinaga and Inagaki, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Eukaryotic and prokaryotic SMC complexes are composed of at least five subunits: two Smc subunits, a kleisin subunit, and two additional subunits (referred to as kite and hawk subunits, depending on the type of SMC complex). Smc proteins associate with the kleisin protein to form a ring-shaped ATPase assembly. Additional subunits associate with this tripartite complex: the ‘Kite’ family associates with bacterial and archaeal SMC complexes and also with the eukaryotic SMC5/6 complex while the ‘Hawk’ family interacts with condensin and cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>). These additional subunits are thought to be required for the activity and to differentiate functions; for example, while condensin I and II share the same pair of Smc proteins, the difference in the subunit composition specifies their spatiotemporal dynamics and functional contributions to mitotic chromosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hirota et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kong et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>SMC function and dynamics on DNA requires additional auxiliary proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter et al., 2019</xref>). More specifically, its loading on DNA and unloading of the DNA may depend on specific factors, at specific sites. For example, in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, the segregation ParB protein bound to <italic>parS</italic> site directly binds the Smc subunit; the ParB clamp presumably presents DNA to the SMC complex to initiate DNA loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Upon translocation, the site-specific recombinase XerD bound to its binding site unloads SMC complexes in the terminus region of the chromosome and this process is thought to involve specific interactions between the different components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karaboja et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>MukBEF was the first SMC complex identified. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, MukBEF is thought to be required for chromosome segregation as <italic>muk</italic> mutants present many anucleate cells or mis-segregated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niki et al., 1991</xref>). How MukBEF may promote chromosome segregation and organization has remained elusive for a long time and is still not clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nolivos and Sherratt, 2014</xref>). The effect of the MukBEF complex in <italic>E. coli</italic> appears to be radically different from that of SMC in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> or other bacteria. Instead of aligning the chromosome arms from a centromere-like locus, MukBEF promotes DNA contacts in the megabase range within each replication arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lioy et al., 2020</xref>). MukBEF promotes long-range interactions along the chromosome except in the 800-kb-long terminal domain (Ter) where MatP prevents its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Under conditions of increased chromosome occupancy of MukBEF, the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome appears to be organized as a series of loops around a thin (&lt;130 nm) MukBEF axial core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mäkelä and Sherratt, 2020</xref>). Whether MukBEF is loaded at a particular locus is still an open question. The complete atomic structure of MukBEF in complex with MatP and DNA has been determined by electron cryomicroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>); it also contains the MukBEF binding partner AcpP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prince et al., 2021</xref>). It revealed that the complex binds two distinct DNA double helices reminiscent of the arms of an extruded loop, MatP-bound DNA threads through the MukBEF ring, while the second DNA is clamped by MukF, MukE, and the MukB ATPase heads. The presence of MatP in the complex together with its ability to prevent MukBEF activity prompted authors to propose that MatP might be an unloader of MukBEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have performed a number of experiments using different in vivo approaches to further characterize how MukBEF contributes to chromosome management in <italic>E. coli</italic>. We have used ChIP-seq and Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C-seq and Hi-C) experiments to study how MukBEF is loaded on the chromosome and promotes long-range DNA contacts. By using strains with various chromosome configurations obtained by programmed genetic rearrangements, we have explored how MukBEF activity proceeds along the chromosome and how MatP bound to <italic>matS</italic> sites prevents its activity. Our results together with comparative genomics analyses allow us to address the biological significance of multiple <italic>matS</italic> sites in the Ter region of chromosomes in enterobacteria and of the absence of MukBEF activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MukBEF activity does not initiate at a single locus</title><p>In order to characterize how MukBEF interacts with the chromosome and initiate its activity of long-range contacts, it was necessary to set up a system to reveal using Hi-C the appearance and spread of long-range contacts along the chromosome upon MukBEF synthesis. The rationale was based on previous findings showing that long-range DNA contacts within replication arms, outside Ter, result from MukBEF activity. If MukBEF loads at a specific locus as observed for Smc-ScpAB at <italic>parS</italic> sites, we would expect to detect the appearance and spreading of long-range contacts from this site upon MukBEF synthesis. By contrast, if MukBEF loads stochastically or at multiple loci on the chromosome, long-range contacts should occur at multiple sites.</p><p>The analysis of MukBEF activity required an efficient system to control its activity. To conditionally synthesize MukBEF, the <italic>mukBEF</italic> operon was cloned onto a medium-copy number plasmid under control of a p<italic>Lac</italic> promoter and introduced in a <italic>mukF</italic> mutant.

After 20 min, a large zone of over 1.4 Mb was replicated, and after 40 min, the chromosome was fully replicated and the replication profile was similar to that of non-synchronized cells because of multiple new replication cycles initiated. Normalized ChIP-seq experiments were performed by normalizing the quantity of immunoprecipitated fragments to the input of MukB-Flag.

These results suggest that MukBEF does not bind or persist in segments carrying <italic>matS</italic> sites, and that the MatP/<italic>matS</italic> system prevent residence of MukBEF in that region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MukBEF promotes long-range contacts in the absence of replication</title><p>Since MukBEF was shown to bind preferentially in newly replicated regions, we wanted to test if a preferential activity of MukBEF was detectable in those regions. To do this, we performed Hi-C on non-replicating cells lacking MukF, and induced <italic>mukBEF</italic> expression with or without restarting replication. In the absence of replication and of MukBEF, long-range contacts were constrained by barriers that delimit domains, called chromosome-interacting domains (CIDs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), previously detected in WT cells in growing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>).

Different models involving their loading, translocation, or extrusion of DNA loops as well as their unloading have been proposed, based on results obtained with different complexes and in different models. Among the SMC complexes, MukBEF has specific features: MukBEF is only found in enterobacteria and some related bacterial genera where it is involved in chromosome segregation; the mukBEF genes belong to a group of genes co-occurring with the <italic>Dam</italic> methylase gene including also <italic>matP</italic> and other genes involved in DNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brézellec et al., 2006</xref>); MukBEF exists as dimers of dimers connected by the kleisin subunit MukF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zawadzka et al., 2018</xref>); by its activity, MukBEF does not align the two arms of the chromosome like the canonical bacterial Smc-ScpAB complex but instead promotes long-distance contacts in cis like a eukaryotic condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkably, MukBEF activity is not detected within the specific chromosomal Ter domain, one-fifth of the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome, due to the presence of MatP associated with this region. Although details about MukBEF and its activity have been revealed in recent years, key steps in its function remain to be characterized, including loading onto the DNA molecule, its actual loop extrusion activity, and its unloading by MatP.</p><p>Altogether, our data provide an integrated view of MukBEF activity to organize the <italic>E. coli</italic> chromosome. By different ChIP-seq and Hi-C approaches performed in different strains, some of which have undergone programmed genetic rearrangements, we showed that MukBEF loading does not only involve the Ori region but also different regions of the chromosome. Our results also indicated that although MukBEF binds preferentially in newly replicated regions, its activity is detected even in the absence of replication and long-range contacts appear similarly throughout the genome, except in the Ter region. These results support a model in which MukBEF molecules are bound to the chromosome, molecules are removed or displaced by replication, MukBEF molecules readily reassociate in newly replicated regions except in Ter region in which the unloading of MukBEF is enhanced by MatP bound to <italic>matS</italic> sites. Our results are in agreement with the previous proposal that MukBEF may organize a series of loops around a thin MukBEF axial core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mäkelä and Sherratt, 2020</xref>). Altogether, our results reveal a striking contrast with the way Smc-ScpAB loads on DNA by interacting with the ParB at <italic>parS</italic> sites and then translocates toward the ter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, long-distance contacts promoted by MukBEF did not occur as a wave from a specific region but rather initiate at different positions, in different regions of the genome. Thus, the activity of MukBEF appears to be more similar to that of eukaryotic condensins than to that of the Smc-ScpAB complex.</p><p>The fact that MukBEF is found associated with newly replicated DNA could also suggest preferential loading at the replication fork or behind. However, in the absence of replication, MukBEF is still able to load and form long-range DNA contacts, as well as segregated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012a</xref>). Interestingly, this situation is reminiscent to that of SMC-ScpAB. Smc-ScpAB is loaded onto the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> chromosome at the <italic>parS</italic> site in association with parB/SpoJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). Remarkably, in the absence of <italic>parB,</italic> Smc-ScpAB is still able to perform chromosome segregation almost perfectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ireton et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). This demonstrates that, even with a strong preferential loading mechanism, the SMC complex can load on chromosomal DNA. A similar situation may occur in <italic>E. coli</italic>, where MukBEF is preferentially loaded depending on the progression of replication but can still bind to and act on the chromosome in the absence of replication.</p><p>Our results showed that MukBEF was not detected in regions containing <italic>matS</italic> sites and that these regions were devoid of contacts extending over 600 kb. By varying the number of <italic>matS</italic> sites at an ectopic position, we showed that MukBEF inhibition is graded with the number of <italic>matS</italic>; while an effect is already visible with three <italic>matS</italic> scattered over a 78 kb region, the maximal effect seems to be reached with nine <italic>matS</italic> sites distributed over a 253 kb region. As proposed for Smc-ScpAB and its unloading XDS site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karaboja et al., 2021</xref>), if the movement of DNA in the loop extrusion process involves large steps, it is conceivable that several <italic>matS</italic> sites are required for a complex to be trapped and discharged by MatP bound to a <italic>matS</italic> site. Accordingly, the density of <italic>matS</italic> sites seems to affect the inhibition efficiency supporting this assumption. Further experiments will be needed to analyze in detail the optimal spacing of <italic>matS</italic> sites to inhibit MukBEF activity.</p><p>The structure of the MukBEF-AcpP-MatP/<italic>matS</italic> complex obtained by cryoEM revealed the entrapment of two topologically separated DNA segments in two distinct compartments called ‘ring’ and ‘clamp’, with the <italic>matS</italic> site present in the ring compartment. The proposed model for MukBEF unloading stipulates that the unloading of the segment carrying <italic>matS</italic> site in the ring compartment is coupled to the unloading of the other segment in the clamp. One of the MatP monomers forms a contact with one of the MukE monomers while the joint binds and positions MatP between the MukB arms. The joint interface is much larger than the MukE-MatP bridge and likely provides the major binding energy for association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, a change to alanine of the five residues between H38 and D42 in contact with MukE did not affect MatP’s ability to inhibit MukBEF activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Refined experiments will be required to assess the outcome of mutating MatP residues involved in the interaction with the joint as mutations of those residues also affect <italic>matS</italic> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dupaigne et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>MukBEF activity is detected by the appearance of contacts over a distance of approximately 1 Mb, spanning around 4 Mb of the chromosome (excluding the Ter domain). Even if the molecular details of this activity remain to be characterized, it is tempting to speculate that MukBEF molecules can be discharged from DNA in the absence of MatP, i.e., outside Ter. Furthermore, it can be noted that MukBEF activity does not appear to be significantly disrupted in a <italic>matP</italic> mutant, suggesting that MukBEF can be discharged from DNA in the absence of MatP. As proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bürmann et al., 2021</xref>, MatP would act as a structural element that ensures ideal positioning of DNA close to the exit gate in the MukBEF complex that might ensure an efficient unloading of MukBEF from the DNA. Altogether, the results would indicate that MatP is not the MukBEF unloader per se, but rather that its ability to prevent MukBEF activity has been selected to protect the Ter region from a condensin activity.</p><p>The distribution of <italic>matS</italic> sites over a large region of the chromosome in enterobacteria results in the inhibition of MukBEF in Ter. MatP has already been shown to confer another property to Ter, through an interaction of its C-terminus with the septum-associated protein ZapB and localizing Ter at midcell. Remarkably, these two properties are independent as inhibiting MukBEF does not require its anchoring of Ter at the septum of division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Given that the number of <italic>matS</italic> sites far exceeds the number required to prevent MukBEF activity and that the density of <italic>matS</italic> sites increases as we approach <italic>dif</italic>, we may speculate that MukBEF presence is mostly banished from the <italic>dif</italic> region. At least two activities of DNA metabolism occur in this region: resolution of chromosome dimers by XerC-XerD recombinases and the post-replicative decatenation of circular chromosomes. We may speculate, based on in vitro observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kumar et al., 2022</xref>), that MukBEF could interfere with TopIV activity and delay potential chromosome decatenation. Another possibility is that chromosome dimers resolved at the <italic>dif</italic> site may become trapped in loops formed by MukBEF, thus delaying segregation. However, none of these possible scenarios are supported by data yet, and a major challenge for the future will be to determine whether and how MukBEF may interfere with one or both of these processes.</p><p>In the absence of replication and of MukBEF activity, the contact map displayed a single strong diagonal composed of very well-defined CIDs, ranging in size from 20 to 400 kb. The CIDs, clearly visible in populations of cells growing exponentially, were prominent in these conditions revealing the impact of transcription on the structuring of the genome. Upon replication, the CID organization is less apparent because of the new contacts that occur between loci belonging to different CIDs. The induction of MukBEF in the presence of replication further attenuates the patterning of CIDs. Altogether, these results highlight the respective contribution of these three processes, transcription, replication, and condensin activity, on the organization of bacterial genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>All <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this study are derived from <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655.

The resulting digested DNA (4 ml in total) was divided into four aliquots and diluted in 8 ml of ligation buffer (1× ligation buffer NEB without ATP, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 125 units of T4 DNA ligase, 5 U/μl). Ligation was performed at 16°C for 4 hr, followed by overnight incubation at 65°C with 100 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) and 100 μl EDTA 500 mM. DNA was then precipitated with an equal volume of 3 M Na-acetate (pH 5.2) and two volumes of iso-propanol. After 1 hr at –80°C, the DNA was pelleted and suspended in 500 μl of 1× TE buffer. The tubes were incubated directly with 50 μl of proteinase K (20 mg/ml) for an overnight period at 65°C. Subsequently, all tubes were transferred to 2 ml centrifuge tubes and extracted with 400 μl of phenol-chloroform pH 8.0. The DNA was then precipitated, washed with 1 ml of 70% cold ethanol, and resuspend in 30 μl of 1× TE buffer in the presence of RNase A (1 μg/ml). The tubes containing ligated DNA (3C libraries), digested DNA, and non-digested DNA were pooled into three separate tubes. The efficiency of the 3C preparation was evaluated by running a 1% agarose gel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Hi-C protocol</title><p>Hi-C libraries were generated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Thierry and Cockram, 2022</xref>).</p><p>10<sup>8</sup> cells growing in the exponential growth phase of <italic>E. coli</italic> were chemically crosslinked by the addition of formaldehyde directly to the cultures (3% final concentration) for 30 min at room temperature with gentle agitation.

We used Bowtie2 software to perform mapping in local mode, and the mpileup software from Samtools to calculate coverage for each position in the genome. Normalized ChIP was then calculated by normalizing the number of reads at each position by the total number of reads, and dividing this number by the normalized input. A sliding window of 50 kb was applied to smooth the variations. Peaks for MatP ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) were identified by extracting positions where the number of reads was 10 times higher than the background for at least 30 consecutive base pairs. The center of these distributions was considered the center of the peak. The sequences were then extracted and used on the MEME suite to identify a common motif.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Generation of contact maps</title><p>Contact maps were constructed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, each read was assigned to a restriction fragment. Non-informative events such as self-circularized restriction fragments, or uncut co-linear restriction fragments were discarded, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cournac et al., 2012</xref>. The genome was then divided into 5 kb units, and the corresponding contact map was generated and normalized through the sequential component normalization procedure of <italic>SCN</italic> (based on the sequential component normalization; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/koszullab/E_coli_analysis">https://github.com/koszullab/E_coli_analysis</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koszul, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>). Contact maps were visualized as logarithmic matrices to aid in visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Ratio of contact maps</title><p>The comparison of contact maps was facilitated by displaying their ratio. The ratio was calculated for each point on the map by dividing the number of contacts in one condition by the number of contacts in the other condition. The Log2 of the ratio was then plotted using a Gaussian filter. The color code represented a decrease or increase in contacts in one condition relative to the other (a blue or red signal, respectively); a white signal indicated no change.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification of the range of <italic>cis</italic> contacts along the chromosome</title><p>We used a three-step process adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lioy et al., 2020</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2017</xref>, to determine the width of the diagonal in contact maps. To improve the resolution of the Ter limit, we measured the width perpendicular to the main diagonal.</p><p>First, we calculated the median of the contact map and estimated the standard deviation (σ) using a robust statistic, where σ=1.4826 * mad (mad = median absolute deviation). Next, we used a point connecting algorithm to differentiate significant interactions from background noise. The size of each connected element identified by the ‘bwlabel’ function of MATLAB was determined. We considered a connected element with a size ≥30 points to be significant and used the ‘imclose()’ function of MATLAB to fill in the empty points within the connected elements using a diamond shape with a size of 5.</p><p>Subsequently, we calculated the width of the primary diagonal for each 5 kb bin of the genome. The range of cis contact was estimated from the width of the primary diagonal by multiplying the number of measured bins by the bin size (5 kb) and dividing by two (since the range is symmetric on both sides of the chromosomal locus being considered). Finally, a boxplot was used to visualize the entire range of <italic>cis</italic> contacts for all the analyzed chromosome regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Directional index analysis</title><p>Directional index was calculated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>. The directional index is a statistical metric that quantifies the level of upstream or downstream contact bias for a given genomic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). This metric is based on a t-test comparison of contact vectors to the left and right of each bin, up to a certain scale. The boundaries between topological domains often generate fluctuating signals that result in a transition in the directional preference. Specifically, for each 5 kb bin, we extracted the contact vector from the correlation matrix between that bin and neighboring bins at regular 5 kb intervals, up to 100 kb, in both left and right directions. At each step, the paired t-test was used to determine whether the strength of interactions was significantly stronger in one direction relative to the other. A threshold of 0.05 was used to assess statistical significance. The directional preferences for each bin along the chromosome were visualized as a bar plot, with positive and negative t-values shown as red and green bars, respectively. To improve the clarity of presentation, bars for bins with t-values below –2 or above 2 (corresponding to a p-value of 0.05) were truncated. Between two identified domains in the contact matrices, the directional preference of bins changed, which was indicated by alternating red and green colors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Table of strains.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-91185-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-91185-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The DNA sequencing raw data was deposited on the NCBI website under the bioproject numbers: PRJNA1019269 (HiC induction of MukBEF), PRJNA1021387 (HiC on transposed strains), PRJNA1024671 (HiC on non-replicating strains), and PRJNA1024669 (ChIP-seq of MukB on synchronized strains).</p><p>The following datasets were generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seba</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Boccard</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Duigou</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>HiC Ecoli MukBEF induction</data-title><source>NCBI BioProject</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1019269/">PRJNA1019269</pub-id></element-citation></p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seba</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Boccard</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Duigou</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>HiC transposed Ter strain</data-title><source>NCBI BioProject</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA1021387">PRJNA1021387</pub-id></element-citation></p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seba</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Boccard</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Duigou</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>HiC +/- repliction</data-title><source>NCBI BioProject</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA1024671">PRJNA1024671</pub-id></element-citation></p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seba</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Boccard</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Duigou</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>MukB ChIP-seq on synchronized cells</data-title><source>NCBI BioProject</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/?term=PRJNA1024669">PRJNA1024669</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank members of the FB laboratory for help and fruitful discussions.

They use a combination of Hi-C and ChIP analysis to understand the steps of MukBEF regulation: its unloading from DNA (how MukBEF activity is prevented in the terminus regions of the chromosome by MatP), and its loading onto DNA (how DNA replication influences MukBEF association with the chromosome). Seba et al., induce chromosomal rearrangements to flip the sections of the ter region, thus perturbing matS site numbers and position. They find that MukBEF activity is prevented around matS sites and that higher matS density has greater effect on MukBEF. Separately, using replication mutants and inducible MukBEF expression, they find that MukBEF can associate with the chromosome even in the absence of replication (as seen by the emergence of long-range contacts). However, ChIP data suggests that MukBEF binding to DNA is enriched on newly replicated DNA.</p><p>Altogether, this work provides a valuable and comprehensive view of MukBEF-mediated chromosome organization, with insights on the mechanism of the exclusion of MukBEF from the terminus region of the chromosome. The use of the programmed genetic rearrangements is powerful and allows the authors to provide clear and convincing evidence for MukBEF exclusion from ter by matS sites. It is particularly striking to see that MukBEF can promote long-range contacts even in chromosomal regions between two matS, but the complex is excluded from the matS 'zones'. Experiments using cells blocked for replication show that MukBEF can influence chromosome organization in the absence of replication as well. While previous studies have reported some evidences in support of both of the above conclusions, the experiments described here offer a clear and direct demonstration of the same.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91185.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Chromosome organization in <italic>E. coli</italic> and related species ('transversal') deviates starkly from the pattern more commonly found in bacteria ('longitudinal'). The underlying mechanisms and the physiological roles, however, are not well understood. This manuscript by Seba et al. investigates the activity and regulation of MukBEF in chromosome folding in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Using a construct for inducible expression of MukBEF, the authors first demonstrate that the initiation of long-range chromosome contacts (likely by loop extrusion) is not restricted to few positions on the chromosome and rather widely distributed but excluding the replication terminus region. Using ChIP-Seq, the authors show that the distribution of MukBEF over the chromosome is consistent with widely distributed loading and moreover indicate a connection of chromosome folding and DNA replication with newly replicated DNA shower an increased tendency for MukBEF binding. To dissect this further, they then redistribute matS sites on the chromosome by a clever strategy based on large-scale transpositions. The results reveal that matS-free DNA segments undergo MukBEF dependent folding regardless of their position relative to the origin of replication, being consistent with a broad distributed loading of MukBEF. By fine-mapping with smaller transposition events, they show that few matS sites are sufficient to impede MukBEF activity. Surprisingly, however, <italic>E. coli</italic> and most related genomes harbor many matS sites, which are particularly highly concentrated near the chromosome dimer resolution dif site (Fig. 5).</p><p>This is a well-executed and well-presented study. The findings show that the MatP/matS system acts locally and independent of DNA replication to restrict MukBEF in the replication terminus region. Few of the many matS sites are sufficient for MukBEF restriction. The main conclusions of the work are clear and well supported by the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91185.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Seba et al. investigate whether chromosomal recruitment of the <italic>E. coli</italic> SMC complex MukBEF is initiated at a single site, how MukBEF activity is excluded from the replication terminus region, and whether its recruitment and activity depend on DNA replication. Upon induction of MukBEF, the authors find that chromosomal long-range contacts increase globally rather than from a single site. Using large-scale chromosome rearrangements, they show that matS sites can insulate separate areas of high MukBEF activity from each other. This suggests that MukBEF loads at multiple sites in the genome. Finally, the authors propose that MukBEF associates preferentially with newly replicated DNA, based on ChIP-seq experiments after DNA replication arrest.</p><p>The conclusions of the paper are well supported by the data. The ratiometric contact analyses and range-of-contact analyses are compelling and nicely show the interplay between MukBEF and its proposed unloader MatP/matS. I particularly enjoyed the chromosome re-arrangement experiments, which lend strong support to the idea that MukBEF activity is independent of a centralized loading site.</p><p>The enrichment of MukBEF in newly replicated regions is convincing, despite somewhat small effect sizes. The suggestion that matS density controls MukBEF activity is appealing, but will need additional support from more systematic studies. It is based on a comparison of only two strains (looking at different combinations of three matS sites), and the effect size is small. As it is, differences in matS sequence composition and genomic context cannot be factored out.</p><p>Overall, the work is an important advance in our understanding of bacterial chromosome organization. It will be of broad interest to chromosome biologists and bacterial cell biologists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91185.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Seba</surname><given-names>Mohammed</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Université Paris-Saclay, CEA, CNRS, Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gif-sur-Yvette</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Boccard</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Université Paris-Saclay, CEA, CNRS, Institute for Integrative Biology of the Cell</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gif-sur-Yvette</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Duigou</surname><given-names>Stéphane</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Integrative Biology of the Cell</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gif-sur-Yvette</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1.

The results shown in Fig. 2C have been obtained using a 3C approach, which generated slightly more variability than Hi-C. Furthermore, we measured the range of contacts for the segment corresponding to Ter1 in RiTer (matS12-matS28), in different genetic contexts and different configurations. The results show that this level of variation is not significant (see graph below reporting two independent experiments).</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Range of interactions measured on the interval matS12-matS18 in different genetic contexts and different configurations (MG1655 WT(1 and 2), ∆mukB, RiTer, RiTer ∆mukB).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91185-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Experiments with various matS organizations: These experiments are interesting and an important part of the paper. However, it is rather hard to visualize the chromosome conformations in the strains after transposition. To aid the reader (particularly with panel E), authors can provide schematics of the chromosome conformations and anticipated/ observed chromosomal interactions. Circular interaction plots would be useful here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting remark; we have tried in the past to represent these interactions using a circular representation (see for example the web site of Ivan Junier; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://treetimc.github.io/circhic/index.html">https://treetimc.github.io/circhic/index.html</ext-link>). However, this representation is not trivial to apprehend for nonspecialists, especially in strains with a rearranged chromosome configuration. Nonetheless, we have added graphical circular representations of the chromosome configurations to help the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. ChIP experiments:</p></disp-quote><p>The basal value of the ChIP on the non-replicated sequences (between 0-3.5 Mb for 10 minutes and 0-3 Mb for 20 minutes) is 0.8 and 0.7, respectively, whereas the mean value of the replicated sequence is 1.6 and 1.45. So the enrichment observed for these two points is about 2-fold, not 1.1 and it is 4 fold for t40min.These values were obtained by dividing the number of normalized reads in the ChIP (the number of reads at each position divided by the total number of reads) by the normalized reads of the input. Therefore, the increase in copy number is considered in the calculation. Furthermore, we added a supplementary figure (Figure Sup9) in which we performed a ChIP without tags on synchronized cells, and in this case, we did not observe any enrichment triggered by replication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Authors make a conclusion that MukB loads behind the replication fork. However, the time resolution of the presented experiments is not sufficient to be certain of this. Authors would need to perform more time-resolved experiments for the same.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 is correct; we attempted to discriminate whether the observed enrichment is (i) associated with the replication fork since we observed a decrease in the center of the enrichment at oriC as the maximum enrichment moves away with the replication fork after 20 and 40 minutes, or (ii) associated with the newly replicated sequence. To investigate this, we attempted to induce a single round of replication by shifting the cells back to 40°C after 10 minutes at 30°C. Unfortunately, replication initiation is not immediately halted by shifting the cells to 40°C, and we were unable to induce a single round of replication. To clarify our conclusions, we modified our manuscript to</p><p>“Altogether, these findings indicate that MukBEF is loaded into regions newly replicated either at the replication fork or even further behind it, except in the Ter region from which it would be excluded.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Authors conclude that in the LiTer7 strain, MukB signal is absent from Ter2. However, when compared with the ChIP profiles by eye across panels in A and B, this does not seem to be significant. In the same results sections, authors state that there is a 3-fold increase in MukB signal in other regions. The corresponding graph does not show the same.</p></disp-quote><p>Rather than relying solely on the enrichment levels, which can be challenging to compare across different strains due to slight variations in replication levels, we believe there is a clear disruption in this profile that corresponds to the Ter2 sequence. Furthermore, this discontinuity in enrichment relative to the replication profile is also observable in the WT configuration. At T40min, MukB ChIPseq signals halt at the Ter boundary, even though Ter is actively undergoing replication, as evidenced by observations in the input data.</p><p>Regarding the fold increase of MukB, Reviewer 1 is correct; we overestimated this enrichment in the text and have now corrected it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d.

At this stage it would be helpful to present possible scenarios even if not yet supported by data. The authors should for example consider the following scenario: loop extrusion of a dif site in a chromosome dimer followed by dimer resolution by dif recombination leads to two chromosomes that are linked together by MukBEF (equivalent to cohesin holding sister chromatids together in eukaryotes but without a separase). This configuration (while rare) will hamper chromosome segregation. Is MatP particularly important under conditions of elevated levels of chromosome dimers? Could this even be experimentally tested? Other scenarios might also be entertained.</p></disp-quote><p>Even though we prefer to avoid speculations, we agree that we may attempt to propose some hypotheses to the reader. To do so, we have added a few sentences at the end of our discussion. “We may speculate, based on in vitro observations (Kumar et al., 2022), that MukBEF could interfere with TopIV activity and delay potential chromosome decatenation. Another possibility is that chromosome dimers resolved at the dif site may become trapped in loops formed by MukBEF, thus delaying segregation. But none of these possible scenarios are supported by data yet, and a major challenge for the future is to determine whether and how MukBEF may interfere with one or both of these processes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript text is well written. However, the labeling of strains in figures and text is sometimes inconsistent which can be confusing (LiTer Liter liter; e.g Riter Fig 2C). For consistency, always denote the number of matS sites in LiTer strains and also in the RiTer strain. The scheme denoting LiTer and RiTer strains should indicate the orientation of DNA segments so it is clear that the engineering does not involve inversion (correct?). Similarly: Use uniform labelling for time points: see T40mn vs 40mn vs T2H vs 2H</p></disp-quote><p>We have reviewed the manuscript to standardize our labeling. Additionally, we have included a schema in Figure 2, indicating the matS numbers at the Ter border to emphasize that the transposition events do not involve inversion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>matS sites do not have identical sequences and bind different levels of MatP (suppl fig 3).

Fig 1C: Have these plots been contrast adjusted? If so, this should be indicated. The background looks very white and the transitions from diagonal to background look quite sharp.</p></disp-quote><p>No, these matrices haven't been contrast-adjusted. They were created in MATLAB, then exported as TIFF files and directly incorporated into the figure. Nevertheless, we noticed that the color code of the matrix in Figure 3 was different and subsequently adjusted it to achieve uniformity across all matrices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7, Fig 1C: What is the region around 3 Mb and 4 Mb? It looks like the contacts there are somewhat MukBEF-independent.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right. In the presence of the plasmid pPSV38 (carrying the MukBEF operon or not), we repeatedly observed an increase of long range contacts around 3 Mb. The origin of these contacts is unknown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig 1D: Have the log ratios been clipped at -1 and 1 or was some smoothing filter applied? I would expect the division of small and noisy numbers in the background region to produce many extreme values. This does not appear to be the case.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right, dividing two matrices generates a ratio with extreme values. To avoid this, the Log2 of the ratio is plotted with a Gaussian filter, as described before (Lioy et al., 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Fig. 3C: The LiTer4 ratio plot has two blue bands in the 3-4.5 Mb region. I was wondering what they might be. These long-range contacts seem to be transposition-dependent and suppressed by MatP, is that correct?</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right. This indicates that in the absence of MatP, one part of the Ter was able to interact with a distal region of the chromosome, albeit with a low frequency. The origin is not yet known.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 3E: It is hard to understand what is a strain label and what is the analyzed region of interest.The plot heading and figure legend say Ter2 (but then, there are different Ter2 variants), some labels say Ter, others say Ter2, sometimes it doesn't say anything, some labels say ΔmatS or ΔmatP, others say matS or matP, and so on.</p></disp-quote><p>We have unified our notation and add more description on the legend to clarify this figure :</p><p>“Ter” corresponds to the range of contacts over the entire Ter region, in the WT strain (WT Ter) or in the ΔmatP strain (ΔmatP Ter). The column WT matSX-Y corresponds to the range of contacts between the designated matS sites in the WT configuration. This portion of the Ter can be compared with the same Ter segment in the transposed strain (Ter2). Additionally, the matS20-28 segment corresponds to Ter2 in LiTer9, just as matS22-28 corresponds to Ter2 in LiTer7, and matS25-28 to Ter2 in LiTer4. The range of contacts of this segment was also measured in a ΔmatP or ΔmatS background.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 4 and p.9: &quot;Normalized ChIP-seq experiments were performed by normalizing the quantity of immuno-precipitated fragments to the input of MukB-Flag and then divide by the normalized ChIP signals at t0 to measure the enrichment trigger by replication.&quot;</p><p>This statement and the ChIP plots in Fig. 4A are somewhat puzzling. If the data were divided by the ChIP signal at t0, as stated in the text, then I would expect the first plot (t0) to be a flat line at value 1. This is not the case. I assume that normalized ChIP is shown without the division by t0, as stated in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right. This sentence has been corrected, and as described in the Methods section, Figure 4 shows the ChIP normalized by the input.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If that's true and the numbers were obtained by dividing read-count adjusted immunoprecipitate by read-count adjusted input, then I would expect an average value of 1. This is also not the case. Why are the numbers so low? I think this needs some more details on how the data was prepared.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right; we thank him for this remark. Our data are processed using the following method: the value of each read is divided by the total number of reads. A sliding window of 50 kb is applied to these normalized values to smooth the data. Then, the resulting signal from the ChIP is divided by the resulting signal from the input. This is what is shown in Figure 4. Unfortunately, for some of our results, the sliding window was not correctly applied to the input data. This did not alter the ChIP profile but did affect the absolute values. We have resolved this issue and corrected the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another potential issue is that it's not clear what the background signal is and whether it is evenly distributed. The effect size is rather small. Negative controls (untagged MukB for each timepoint) would help to estimate the background distribution, and calibrator DNA could be used to estimate the signal-to-background ratio. There is the danger that the apparent enrichment of replicated DNA is due to increased &quot;stickiness&quot; rather than increased MukBEF binding. If any controls are available, I would strongly suggest to show them.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this remark, a ChIP experiment with a non-tagged strain under comparable synchronization conditions has been performed. The results are presented as Supplementary Figure 9; they reveal that the enrichment shown in Figure 4 is not attributed to nonspecific antibody binding or 'stickiness’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 4A, B: The y-axes on the right are unlabeled and the figure legends mention immunoblot analysis, which is not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We labeled the y-axes as 'anti-Flag ChIP/input' and made corrections to the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fig. 4B: This figure shows a dip in enrichment at the Ter2 region of LiTer7, which supports the authors' case. Having a side-by-side comparison with WT at 60 min would be good, as this time point is not shown in Fig. 4A.</p></disp-quote><p>Cell synchronization can be somewhat challenging, and we have observed that the timing of replication restart can vary depending on the genetic background of the cells. This delay is evident in the case of LiTer7. To address this, we compared LiTer7 after 60 minutes to the wild type strain (WT) after 40 minutes of replication. Even though the duration of replication is 20 minutes longer in LiTer7, the replication profiles of these two strains under these two different conditions (40 minutes and 60 minutes) are comparable and provide a better representation of similar replication progression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

I would recommend providing an annotated plasmid sequence in supplemental material to make things clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified it and replaced “ lacI promoter” with the correct annotation, pLac.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. p. 5 heading &quot;MukBEF activity does not initiate at a single locus&quot; and p. 6 &quot;Altogether, the results indicate that the increase in contact does not originate from a specific position on the chromosome but rather appears from numerous sites&quot;. Although this conclusion is supported by the follow-up experiments, I felt it is perhaps a bit too strong at this point in the text. Perhaps MukBEF loads slowly at a single site, but then moves away quickly? Would that not also lead to a flat increase in the contact plots? One could consider softening these statements (at least in the section header), and then be more confident later on.</p></disp-quote><p>We used 'indicate' and 'suggesting' at the end of this results section, and we feel that we have not overreached in our conclusions at this point. While it's true that we can consider other hypotheses, we believe that, at this stage, our suggestion that MukBEF is loaded over the entire chromosome is the simplest and more likely explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. p.7: &quot;[these results] also reveal that MukBEF does not translocate from the Ori region to the terminus of the chromosome as observed with Smc-ScpAB in different bacteria.&quot;</p><p>This isn't strictly true for single molecules, is it? Some molecules might translocate from Ori to Ter. Perhaps clarify that this is about the bulk flux of MukBEF?</p></disp-quote><p>At this point, our conclusion that MukBEF does not travel from the ori to Ter is global and refers to the results described in this section. However, the referee is correct in pointing out that we cannot exclude the possibility that in a WT configuration (without a Ter in the middle of the right replicore), a specific MukBEF complex can be loaded near Ori and travel all along the chromosome until the Ter. To clarify our statement, we have revised it to 'reveal that MukBEF does not globally translocate from the Ori region to the terminus of the chromosome.' This change is intended to highlight the fact that we are drawing a general conclusion about the behavior of MukBEF and to facilitate its comparison with Smc-ScpAB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. p. 10: The section title &quot;Long-range contacts correlate with MukBEF binding&quot; and the concluding sentence &quot;Altogether, these results indicate that MukBEF promotes long-range DNA contacts independently of the replication process even though it binds preferentially in newly replicated regions&quot; seem to contradict each other.
