How ubiquitinated membrane proteins engage the internalization apparatus remains unclear. The internalization apparatus contains proteins such as Epsin and Eps15, which bind Ub, potentially acting as adaptors for Ub-based internalization signals. Here, we show that additional components of the endocytic machinery including CALM, HIP1R, and Sla2 bind Ub via their N-terminal ANTH domain, a domain belonging to the superfamily of ENTH and VHS domains. Structural studies revealed that Ub binds with µM affinity to a unique C-terminal region within the ANTH domain not found in ENTH domains. Functional studies showed that combined loss of Ub-binding by ANTH-domain proteins and other Ub-binding domains within the yeast internalization apparatus caused defects in the Ub-dependent internalization of the GPCR Ste2 that was engineered to rely exclusively on Ub as an internalization signal. In contrast, these mutations had no effect on the internalization of Ste2 engineered to use an alternate Ub-independent internalization signal. These studies define new components of the internalization machinery that work collectively with Epsin and Eps15 to specify recognition of Ub as an internalization signal.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>degradation</kwd><kwd>down regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM058202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piper</surname><given-names>Robert C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000041</institution-id><institution>American Diabetes Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Minard</surname><given-names>Annabel Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The family of ANTH domain proteins serve as adaptors to endocytose ubiquitinated proteins from the cell surface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ubiquitination of membrane proteins dictates a variety of trafficking fates, usually ending in their degradation. Early in the biosynthetic pathway, ubiquitin (Ub) serves as a signal to mark mis-folded proteins for processing by ER-associated degradation and delivery to the Proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lemberg and Strisovsky, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wu and Rapoport, 2018</xref>). Post-ER membrane proteins undergo a variety of Ub-dependent sorting steps including transport to endosomes from the Golgi by GGAs, and MVB sorting by ESCRTs to incorporate ubiquitinated proteins into endosomal intralumenal vesicles that are delivered to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Piper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weeratunga et al., 2020</xref>). Each of these sorting steps is mediated by an array of machinery that harbors multiple Ub-binding domains that recognize ubiquitinated proteins and, in some cases, help organize the processes they execute. At the plasma membrane, ubiquitination of membrane proteins is a signal for internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a process largely conserved across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Traub and Lukacs, 2007</xref>). Ub is a versatile signal for internalization since it can be added or removed from virtually all membrane proteins by a myriad of regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Traub, 2009</xref>). Studying this process in detail and evaluating the overall contribution of Ub as an internalization signal has been difficult because many proteins, including well-studied vanguard proteins that serve as model endocytic cargo, use multiple internalization signals. Furthermore, while ubiquitination of a wide variety of membrane proteins mediates their endocytosis and degradation in lysosomes/vacuoles, for many it is less clear whether Ub serves as the key internalization signal vs a sorting signal that works deeper in the endocytic pathway to convey proteins into intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Piper et al., 2014</xref>). The fact that Ub can serve as an internalization signal has been clearly demonstrated with reporter membrane proteins translationally fused to Ub, which accelerates the rate of their internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Traub and Lukacs, 2007</xref>). The first instance of Ub as an internalization signal was recognized in yeast where it controls the internalization of the GPCR Ste2 that can be followed by the uptake of its ligand α-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hicke and Riezman, 1996</xref>). Yet, Ste2 has other internalization signals that operate in tandem with Ub, likely reflecting the ability of this GPCR to be regulated at the level of internalization by multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Howard et al., 2002</xref>). In mammalian cells, the receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR undergoes ubiquitination concomitant with its internalization. Yet EGFR also uses multiple internalization signals besides Ub to access CME and also uses different internalization routes from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caldieri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fortian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pascolutti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sigismund et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A key step toward understanding the broader roles of Ub-dependent trafficking is identifying the CME machinery that recognizes Ub as an internalization signal. CME involves sequential steps of assembly and disassembly of several protein complexes including clathrin, other coat proteins, as well as adaptors that connect cargo to the internalization apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). In the early phase, pioneering proteins localize to membrane subdomains enriched in PtdIns(4,5)P2. These in turn recruit a variety of adaptors and coat proteins concomitant with localization of cargo into the growing internalization site. The later stages of internalization are marked by the recruitment and polymerization of actin, leading to invagination and scission of the nascent endosome from the plasma membrane. Coordination between these two phases is mediated in part by proteins such as Ent1/2 and Sla2 (Epsin and HIP1R in humans) that bridge PtdIns(4,5)P2 with the actin machinery. These series of events are coordinated by multiple protein interactions that add redundancy to the system, making it more robust, while also allowing the cell to use alternate assemblies of the internalization apparatus to accommodate different cargos or respond to different regulatory pathways. Proteins that assemble in the early phase, such as AP2, have low-affinity binding sites for cargo that become operational when polymerized into coat assemblies. Within this cohort are cargo receptors for Ub. Among the best characterized candidates are Ede1/Eps15 and Ent1, Ent2/Epsin, yeast, and human orthologs, respectively, which harbor Ub-binding domains, associate with Ub-cargo, and help concentrate Ub-cargo in forming CME sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Traub, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Traub and Lukacs, 2007</xref>). Loss of these components clearly has an impact on the internalization of proteins that undergo ubiquitination as part of their internalization process. Because these proteins have multiple interactions that are collectively important for full function of the CME apparatus, their complete loss is likely to impede cargo internalization by mechanisms beyond mere loss of Ub-recognition. The strongest data for these proteins as adaptors for Ub comes from defects specifically associated with ablation of their Ub-binding domains, especially when these defects are cargo specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dores et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shih et al., 2002</xref>). Yet, the model that these components function as the sole adaptors for Ub-cargo does not represent the whole story since combined inactivation of Ub-binding domains within these proteins (eg. Ent1/2 and Ede1) in yeast does not affect Ub-dependent internalization of the Ste2 GPCR, suggesting other components help recognize Ub-internalization signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dores et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, roles for Ub-binding domains are readily revealed when they are assessed in mutants with an endocytic apparatus weakened by the deletion of other CME components, suggesting an alternate idea whereby Ub-binding by the endocytic machinery serves a more general function that helps organize and regulate the internalization apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Piper et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we find that additional components of the CME apparatus bind Ub. Ub is bound by N-terminal ANTH (AP180 N-Terminal Homology) domains from both ANTH subfamilies, which includes the CALM and AP180 subfamily as well as the subfamily including HIP1, HIP1R, and Sla2. We obtained a crystal structure of the CALM ANTH domain in a complex with Ub that we verified with NMR and mutagenesis experiments. Using this structure, we installed mutations that specifically blocked Ub-binding within the 3 ANTH-domain-containing proteins in yeast: the HIP1R homolog Sla2 and the CALM/AP180 homologs, Yap1801 and Yap1802. We followed internalization of two engineered Ste2 α-factor receptor mutants, one restricted to use only Ub as an internalization signal and another restricted to use a Ub-independent NPFxD-like motif as an internalization signal. We found that when Ub-binding was ablated within the ANTH domains in combination with other Ub-binding components of the internalization apparatus, Ub-dependent internalization was inhibited. In contrast, internalization of Ste2 that used the NPFxD internalization signal was unaffected by the loss of multiple Ub-binding sites, implying these Ub-binding sites work collectively to recognize Ub as an internalization signal of cargo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ANTH domains bind ubiquitin</title><p>In a previous study that used a large-scale Y2H screening method referred to as 'DEEPN', we found that the N-terminal portion of HIP1 bound to Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pashkova et al., 2016</xref>). This Y2H interaction was observed between a Gal4-DNA-binding domain fused to two tandem copies of Ub linked via a three residue spacer and a the Gal4-transcriptional activation domain fused to residues 1–363 of mouse HIP1 (XP_036020882). This interaction was further validated by pulldown of GST-fused to residues 1–363 of mouse HIP1, which bound K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pashkova et al., 2016</xref>).

ANTH domains are structurally similar to ENTH domains but are larger, with an additional 3 C-terminal α-helices. By sequence homology, there are two broad subgroups of ANTH domains, those found in proteins such as CALM and AP180 and those found in HIP1, HIP1R, and Sla2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Craene et al., 2012</xref>). We purified multiple recombinant ANTH domains that fell into these two subcategories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and tested their ability to bind Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Binding in solution was monitored by HSQC NMR of <sup>15</sup>N-Ub in increasing concentrations of ANTH domains. This produced both chemical shift perturbations as well as overall peak broadening, indicating binding was in fast-exchange. Binding of Ub to <sup>15</sup>N-labeled HIP1-ANTH was also observed in HSQC experiments, which produced selective chemical shift perturbations in backbone amides of <sup>15</sup>N-HIP1 ANTH as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These concentration dependent changes allowed us to derive equilibrium binding constants for each ANTH domain, ranging from 2.9 ± 0.4 µM for the mouse HIP1 ANTH domain to 33 ± 6 µM for <italic>Drosophila</italic> LAP, a homolog of human AP180.

These data showed that Ub bound near a loop within the C-terminal three-helical portion of the ANTH domain connecting the last two α-helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The structure of CALM when bound to Ub had extensive overlap with a previously determined crystal structure of CALM alone (PDB:1HFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ford et al., 2001</xref>), indicating that the CALM-ANTH does not undergo large conformational rearrangements upon binding Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This result is also consistent with NMR experiments with <sup>15</sup>N-labeled HIP1 ANTH domain showing that the HSQC spectra is largely unaltered upon Ub-binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Mapping the chemical shift perturbations from HSQC experiments with <sup>15</sup>N-Ub bound to the CALM ANTH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) onto the ANTH:Ub crystal structure showed that the residues undergoing the largest changes were located at the interface captured in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The CALM-ANTH:Ub interface showed hydrophobic interactions between Ub (L8, I44, V70) and CALM ANTH (F223, L274); and electrostatic interactions between Ub (R42, K48) and CALM (D224, D276) -To confirm this structure, we performed a series of Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>) that are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. PRE effects are observed in HSQC spectra when <sup>15</sup>N-labeled Ub residues are in close proximity to a spin-label in the CALM ANTH domain, which accelerates the relaxation of nearby <sup>15</sup>N<sup>1</sup>H spin systems and causes peak-specific broadening. We made a series of CALM ANTH domains containing single cysteine residues. Native cysteine residues were altered (C27S, C48A, and C230A) resulting in a cysteine-free ANTH domain that retained its ability to bind Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Single cysteine substitutions were then introduced at positions 204, 209, 268, and 284, which allowed conjugation of a nitrosyl spin label, MTSL. PRE effects were measured by relative peak heights in the absence and presence of ascorbate, which reduces the nitrosyl group and inactivates the spin label. The largest PRE effects from the HSQC of <sup>15</sup>N-Ub resulting from binding to CALM spin-labeled at residues 209, 268, and 284 were mapped onto the CALM:Ub structure and confirmed that in solution, Ub bound the same region and orientation as observed in the crystal structure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structure of CALM ANTH domain bound to Ub.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon cartoon of the crystal structure of CALM ANTH domain (light blue) in a complex with Ub (colored from N to C terminus as blue to red (PDB:7JXV)).

To determine how these v-SNAREs bound CALM, previous studies solved a crystal structure of the CALM-ANTH domain in which the last C-terminal helix of the ANTH domain was replaced with residues 16–38 of VAMP8 (PDB:3ZYM). In this structure, the v-SNARE helix sits in the same region as the C-terminal helix of CALM (residues 261–276). This proposed binding mode for v-SNAREs substantially overlaps with that for Ub. Moreover, the binding site for Ub relies on the position of the last helical region of the ANTH domain, whereas this region would have to be dramatically repositioned to allow v-SNARE binding at the site it occupies in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, CALM should not be able to bind simultaneously to v-SNAREs and Ub. In view of this structure, we sought to determine whether the mutations in the CALM-ANTH that ablated Ub-binding did not adversely affect binding of v-SNAREs. This would ensure that functional analysis of the role of Ub-binding using these mutations not complicated by loss of other interactions. Therefore, we performed binding experiments using GST-VAMP7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Wildtype ANTH domain as well as ANTH domain containing the F223A mutation or the F223S, D224R double mutation all bound GST-VAMP7. Additionally, inclusion of excess free linear Ub (5 x) chains diminished binding of wildtype ANTH domain on GST-VAMP7 indicating that Ub and VAMP7 binding are mutually exclusive. In contrast, inclusion of 5 x linear Ub chains had no effect on the ability VAMP7 to bind to the mutant ANTH domains that lacked their Ub-binding sites. These results show that the F223A/S, D224R mutations specifically ablate Ub-binding but not v-SNARE binding. Previous studies also identified mutations (L219S and M244K) that ablated binding of CALM to v-SNAREs. However, these mutations also abolished all detectable Ub-binding in NMR HSQC experiments with <sup>15</sup>N-Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, phenotypes observed from these mutations may not solely be due to loss of v-SNARE binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ubiquitin binding to HIP1, HIP1R and Sla2 ANTH domains</title><p>We next sought mutations that disrupt Ub-binding in HIP1, HIP1R, and Sla2 ANTH domains, that belong to a different subfamily of ANTH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Craene et al., 2012</xref>). This subfamily has limited homology with the Ub-binding region of the CALM-AP180 subfamily and residues that might coordinate Ub-binding in this ANTH subfamily were not obvious by sequence alignment alone. Secondary structure predictions and a solved crystal structure of the Sla2 ortholog from <italic>Chaetomium thermophilum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Alai et al., 2018</xref>), provided a template to model the ANTH domains from HIP1, HIP1R, and Sla2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). These models indicated that the hydrophobic and acidic residues that reside in the loop region of the CALM ANTH domain that connect the penultimate and last α-helices where Ub binds are analogous to L212, D218 in Sla2; L250, D253 in HIP1; and L241, D244 in HIP1R. This loop region of the <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> Sla2 ANTH crystal structure was not resolved, likely due to flexibility, and also had the lowest level of conservation in comparison to HIP1/Sla2 family members across other species. For instance, there is no bulky hydrophobic residue at a position analogous to F223 in CALM ANTH as there is in the HIP1, HIP1R, and yeast Sla2, nor is the position of an acidic residue at the edge of the loop. We found that recombinant <italic>C. thermophilum</italic> Sla2 ANTH domain had negligible binding to Ub, preventing a structural analysis of Ub-binding by this ANTH domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We performed a series of PRE experiments to assess whether the site of Ub-binding was within the C-terminal distal portion of the yeast Sla2 ANTH domain as it is in the CALM ANTH domain. A set of Sla2 ANTH proteins each containing a single cysteine residue at different positions were spin-labeled with MTSL and used in HSQC experiments with <sup>15</sup>N-Ub in the absence (active spin-labeled) or presence of (reduced and inactive) ascorbate to assess PRE effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

In contrast, spin labels in the C-terminal portion of the Sla2 ANTH domain that were near the presumptive Ub-binding site predicated by structure and sequence homology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>) gave strong PRE effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>These data confirmed the model that Ub bound to a similar place in the Sla2 ANTH domain as it does in the CALM ANTH domain. However, without a bonafide structure of ANTH domains from human HIP1, HIP1R, or <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Sla2 we could not accurately deduce an orientation of bound Ub or a high-resolution interface. Therefore, to test our low-resolution model, we assessed the impact of mutating the bulky hydrophobic residue and acidic residues predicted in the same modeled loop region in which the Ub-binding F223 and D224 reside in the CALM ANTH domain. GST-pulldown assays showed that these residues were indeed required for efficient binding of Ub. GST fused to the HIP1 or Sla2 ANTH domain bound K63 linked polyubiquitin chains well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Altering L250 or D253 to arginines in mouse HIP1 or L212 and D218 to alanines in Sla2 ablated detectable binding. Similarly, the human HIP1 L250S, D253R double mutant or the hHIP1R L241S, D244R double mutant failed to bind di-Ub via a yeast two-hybrid assay, in contrast to the robust interaction observed with wildtype human HIP1 and human HIP1R ANTH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>).

Previous studies have shown that Ste2 can use Ub as an internalization signal and/or NPFxD-like sequence, the latter of which binds to an Sla1-homology domain in Sla1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Howard et al., 2002</xref>). Ste2 lacking its NPFxD motif, made by truncation at residue 365, relies on ubiquitination for an internalization signal. Whereas Ste2 lacking ubiqitinatable lysines in its C-terminal tail relies on Ub-independent/NPFxD-mediated internalization via Sla1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We reasoned that if Ub-binding ANTH domains served as specific adaptors to internalize ubiqutinated cell surface proteins, loss of Ub-binding would cause defects in Ub-dependent internalization of Ste2 without affecting NPFxD-dependent internalization of Ste2. If instead, Ub-binding served a general regulatory role for the internalization apparatus, loss of Ub-binding would impose defects on both Ub-dependent and Ub-independent routes of Ste2 internalization.</p><p>To measure internalization, we followed the subcellular distribution of a synthetic α-factor peptide that was conjugated to rhodamine (α-factor<sup>RhD</sup>). Previous experiments indicated that the central lysine (K7) of α-factor likely points away from the ligand binding site in Ste2, allowing it to carry a fluorescent dye without loss of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Naider and Becker, 2020</xref>). In addition, norleucine was substituted for Met12 in α-factor, making it resistant to inactivation by oxidation. Cells kept at 0 °C were labeled with α-factor<sup>RhD</sup>, washed in cold buffer and warmed while imaged by epifluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Deconvolved images were measured for the amount of fluorescence remaining at the cell surface and data were fit to a single exponential decay. As expected, internalization of wildtype Ste2 was rapid and complete within 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). In contrast, truncated Ste2 lacking its NPFxD-like motif yet still possessing ubiquitinatable lysines (Ste2-∆C), had an intermediate rate of internalization. Likewise, Ste2 containing an intact NPFxD motif but carrying K &gt; R mutations (Ste2-8K &gt; R) within its cytosolic domain also internalized at an intermediate rate, though somewhat slower than the truncated Ste2. In contrast, a truncated mutant Ste2 lacking its NPFxD motif and its C-terminal ubiquitinatable lysines (Ste2-∆C,8K &gt; R) showed almost no internalization. Expression of Ste2 variants was done from the <italic>STE2</italic> loci rather than low-copy plasmids, which produced high variability in the level of surface labeling with α-factor<sup>RhD</sup>.</p><p>We assessed strains which carried mutations in their endogenous loci that inactivated Ub-binding in Sla2 (Sla2<sup>∆Ub</sup>: L212A, D218A), Yap1801 (Yap1801<sup>∆Ub</sup>: F213A, E214S) and Yap1802 (Yap1802<sup>∆Ub</sup>: F207A, E208A). When all these mutations were combined (3xANTH<sup>∆Ub</sup>), internalization assays showed that α-factor<sup>RhD</sup> uptake by Ste2 via its Ub-dependent (Ste2-∆C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>) or Ub-independent routes (Ste2-8K &gt; R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>) was unaffected. We then combined these mutations with ones in other Ub-binding proteins that participate in internalization. Previous studies showed that Ent1 and Ent2 each possess 2 UIM (Ub-Interaction Motifs) whereas Ede1 contains a C-terminal UBA (UB-Associated) domain. Combined loss of Ub-binding activity of Ent1/2 and Ede1 had no effect on α-factor<sup>RhD</sup> internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dores et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, loss of Ub-binding by Ede1 or loss of Ub-binding in both Ent1 and Ent2 had no affect on internalization when each was combined with loss of Ub-binding in all ANTH domains. In contrast, marked reduction in α-factor<sup>RhD</sup> internalization by Ste2∆C was observed in strains carrying all of these mutations in which Ub-binding mutations in Ent1/2 and Ede1 were combined with Ub-binding mutations in all of the ANTH domain proteins, Sla2, Yap1801, and Yap1802 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, all the Ub-binding domains we evaluated appear to contribute redundantly to internalization of Ste2∆C, which uses ubiquitination as its internalization signal. We also assessed the effect of these mutant combinations on the internalization of Ste2-8K &gt; R, which has an NPFxD interanalization motif. Here, combined loss of Ub-binding by the three ANTH domains in addition to Ent1/2 and Ede1 had no effect on α-factor<sup>RhD</sup> internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Thus, the combination of mutations that inactivated Ub-binding by a whole cohort of Ub-binding proteins was selective for a cargo that uses Ub as an internalization signal, demonstrating that the general ability of cells to execute and regulate internalization was largely intact.</p><p>We did note that while internalization of Ste2-∆C in the combined 3xANTH<sup>∆Ub</sup>, Ent1/2<sup>∆Ub</sup>, Ede1<sup>∆Ub</sup> mutant was greatly slowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), it was not reduced to the level of Ste2-∆C,K &gt; R lacking Ub and NPFxD internalization signals altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). One possibility is that the mutations we used to inactivate Ub-binding by Sla2 ANTH (Sla2<sup>∆Ub</sup>: L212A,D218A), which diminished the Kd of Ub-binding by 10 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), were not severe enough to ablate all functional Ub-binding. Thus, we also analyzed an alternative mutant of Sla2 ANTH (Sla2<sup>*∆Ub</sup>: L212S,D218R) with even weaker binding to Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, in the context of combined mutations in the Ub-binding domains of Yap1801, Yap1802, Ent1/2 and Ede1, the Sla2<sup>*∆Ub</sup> mutant (L212S, D218R) did not reduce internalization beyond what was observed for the Sla2<sup>∆Ub</sup> (L212A,D218A) mutant in the same context (e.g. 3xANTH<sup>∆Ub</sup>, Ent1/2<sup>∆Ub</sup>, Ede1<sup>∆Ub</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data show that ANTH domains bind Ub and that this plays a role in endocytosis. Our functional data show that a set of Ub-binding domains found within several components of the endocytic apparatus can work together to recognize and internalize ubiquitinated cell surface proteins.</p><p>The three ANTH domain-containing proteins in yeast are Sla2 (the ortholog of human HIP1 and HIP1R) and Yap1801 and Yap1802 (orthologs of human AP180 and CALM). Sla2 plays a major role in internalization in yeast and its loss causes severe defects in the internalization of proteins and lipid dyes and disrupts the ordered assembly of the endocytic apparatus and transition to actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaksonen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Newpher et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Skruzny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wesp et al., 1997</xref>). Sla2 forms a complex with Ent1/2 (yeast Epsins) that can bridge PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing membranes with the actin cytoskeleton via its PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding ANTH domain and C-terminal THATCH domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Skruzny et al., 2015</xref>). Sla2 arrives early in the assembly process and remains during actin polymerization making it a plausible candidate cargo receptor. Yap1801 and Yap1802 play a more nuanced role in internalization. Both localize with clathrin at the cell surface and arrive in the early phase of CME assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carroll et al., 2012</xref>). Loss of both has no effect on GPCR internalization but does cause accumulation of the v-SNARE Snc1 at the cell surface implying they work as dedicated cargo-specific adaptors for a subset of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maldonado-Báez et al., 2008</xref>). More severe phenotypes are revealed when <italic>yap1801/2∆</italic> double deletion mutations are combined with other mutations in the endocytic apparatus suggesting that these proteins may provide additional functions made redundant in the context in wild type cells with a full complement of endocytic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dores et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maldonado-Báez et al., 2008</xref>). Nonetheless, these earlier results suggested that YAP1801/2 play some role in supporting the ability of the CME apparatus to mediate Ub-dependent internalization.</p><p>Our studies, that combined precise mutations within genes at their endogenous loci while also following internalization of a cargo protein constrained to rely on Ub as an internalization signal, reveal a role of ANTH-domain proteins receptors/adaptors for ubiquitinated proteins. An alternative idea for the role of Ub-binding within the internalization apparatus is that it is used to control the assembly and activity of the CME machinery. This idea is supported by experiments that show general defects in endocytosis resulting from deleting Ub-domains in combination with loss of other genes and by the observation that the endocytic machinery also can undergo ubiquitination itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dores et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maldonado-Báez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Polo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Savio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sugiyama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tanner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Weinberg and Drubin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Woelk et al., 2006</xref>). In some ways, these ideas may be a false dichotomy in view of studies that show cargo itself can influence the assembly process, providing a way that recognition of Ub as an internalization signal is the mode through which Ub-binding domains control assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carroll et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loerke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maib et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pedersen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Puthenveedu and von Zastrow, 2006</xref>). The presence of Ub-cargo might help form endocytic vesicles of different constituents that can determine different fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sigismund et al., 2021</xref>), or drive more processive assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles by satisfying cargo checkpoints that Ub-binding components control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Schmid, 2020</xref>). Our data help distinguish a clear role for Ub-binding as a way to recognize Ub as a discrete internalization signal. This conclusion rests on the observation that eliminating Ub-binding sites in ANTH domains in addition to other CME components specifically inhibits internalization of Ub-cargo while leaving endocytosis of proteins that rely on other internalization motifs unperturbed. The functional effect we tested was at the level of cargo internalization. Yet, there may well be many alterations in the assembly kinetics of the endocytic apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>) that result from altering multiple Ub-interactions which are not apparent when singly eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu and Drubin, 2017</xref>). Such alterations might not dramatically affect the overall internalization of cell surface proteins since yeast cells lacking multiple components of the endocytic apparatus display measurable changes in the assembly of the actin-based internalization machinery yet internalize proteins and lipophilic dyes (e.g. FM4-64) relatively well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Prosser et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, a deeper analysis of how the assembly process could be altered in these combinatorial mutants will be important to assess other roles for Ub-binding. The identification of additional Ub-binding sites within the CME apparatus coupled with a variety of new tools for locally perturbing ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stringer and Piper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) as well as a wealth of high-resolution approaches that examine the assembly and architecture of CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>) can enable those investigations. In addition, the ability to better perturb endocytosis of proteins that use Ub as an internalization signal provides a way to determine how prevalent and biologically important the use of Ub as internalization signal actually is. For instance, one aspect of CALM function is that it is correlated with Alzheimer’s Disease in GWAS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harold et al., 2009</xref>). Perturbing CALM experimentally alters the trafficking of proteins associated with driving Alzheimer’s Disease pathogenesis and it will be of interest to determine whether some of those effects are due to the function of CALM as an adaptor for ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kanatsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kanatsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moreau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In mammalian cells, the Ub-binding Eps15 and especially Epsin1 proteins appear to contribute to recognition of Ub as an internalization signal, with the most compelling experiments involving specific defects in the internalization process that can be correlated with specifically altering Ub-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barriere et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertelsen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fortian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gucwa and Brown, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hawryluk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kazazic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Szymanska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Vuong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The ability to follow cargo internalization vs post-internalization processes such as delivery to the vacuole or decreased recycling is more challenging in yeast. However, endocytosis of one Ub-cargo in yeast is particularly reliant on Ub-binding by Epsin (Ent1/2), further supporting the idea it might work as a Ub-dependent adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sen et al., 2020</xref>). For other yeast cargo such as Ste2, removing Ub-binding from Ede1 and Ent1/2 together has no effect on internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dores et al., 2010</xref>), unless also combined with eliminating other Ub-binding sites in ANTH domains as shown here. Future work is required to find how mammalian ANTH-domain containing proteins cooperate with Eps15 or Epsin to internalize Ub-cargo and whether that balance is universal or tissue and cargo specific. A possibility emerges that the combination of ENTH and ANTH domain proteins converge to form the core Ub-recognition machinery for CME. Indeed, Ent1/2 and Sla2 collaborate to form a coated structure complex catalyzed around PtdIns(4,5)P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Alai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lizarrondo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Skruzny et al., 2015</xref>). Although there are differences between the respective yeast and human orthologs, Epsin and Hip1R form oligomers as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Alai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Messa et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, although the other subfamily of ANTH domains in proteins such as AP180 and CALM do not readily form oligomers in vitro with Epsin/Ent1,2, they have similar assembly kinetics and occupy the same region within forming clathrin-coated vesicles as Epsin/Hip1R determined by CLEM and FRET studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Skruzny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sochacki et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite our ability to specifically slow Ub-mediated internalization of a cargo that exclusively relies on Ub as an internalization signal, the residual rate was still higher than that of cargo stripped of its ubiquitinatable lysine residues. This implies there are additional Ub-receptors. We found no evidence that the Ub-binding component Lsb5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa et al., 2005</xref>) fulfilled that role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>) leaving the most likely candidate to be Sla1, which harbors an SH3 domain that binds Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Stamenova et al., 2007</xref>). Sla1 interacts with Sla2 and serves as the receptor for NPFxD internalization motifs, which operates in full-length Ste2, so it is positioned effectively in the CME assembly cascade to also work as a <italic>bonafide</italic> Ub-adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gourlay et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Howard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). One of the issues that arises from this study is why there are many Ub-binding domains. Other cellular machines that process ubiquitinated proteins also possess multiple Ub-binding sites, including the proteasome, which degrades ubiquitinated cytosolic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sahu and Glickman, 2021</xref>), and the ESCRT machinery, that sorts ubiquitinated proteins into endosomal intralumenal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Piper et al., 2014</xref>). Many of the same hypotheses to explain multiple Ub-binding interfaces in these complexes are also plausible for the internalization apparatus. One possibility is that different types of Ub-cargo are optimally captured by different Ub-binding components. These differences could be due to where the Ub moiety is in proximity to the membrane or be due to the type of Ub linkage on the cargo. Although mono-Ub as well as different poly-Ub topologies can serve as internalization signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boname et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lauwers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Okiyoneda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Traub and Lukacs, 2007</xref>), each might require specific Ub-binding components to sort cargo efficiently into forming CCVs (Clathrin-coated vesicles). Where Ub is attached onto cargo might also play a role. ANTH domains orient with their N-termini near the membrane, by binding PtdIns(4,5)P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ford et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sun et al., 2005</xref>) as well as binding either similarly tethered Ent1 or Epsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Alai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Itoh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lizarrondo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Messa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Skruzny et al., 2015</xref>) or inserting an N-terminal helix into the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Miller et al., 2015</xref>). This would serve as a mechanism to space the Ub-binding domains at a set distance from the membrane and be contained within the clathrin lattice where they would be constrained to interact with Ub near the membrane. In contrast, other Ub-binding domains in Ent1/2 and Epsin or Ub-binding sites in Ede1 and Eps15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) lie within long flexible regions that could sample Ub attached at a number of positions on the cytosolic regions of cargo. Another possibility is that the ability of these proteins to work as adaptors to bring Ub-cargo into an internalization site may actually reflect a secondary function revealed experimentally when other mechanisms for Ub-cargo sorting are eliminated. That is, these Ub-binding proteins might serve as cargo sensors, recruited or stabilized by Ub-cargo to allow CCVs to be programed with a different cohort of adaptors that determine different internalization routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fortian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mundell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pascolutti et al., 2019</xref>), recruit additional proteins that work downstream and direct different endocytic fates of their cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gucwa and Brown, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Manna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mayers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Roxrud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sigismund et al., 2008</xref>), or to alter assembly dynamics to hasten CCV completion and extinguish signaling which might otherwise be enhanced by extended clathrin-coated pit lifetimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flores-Otero et al., 2014</xref>).

Protein samples were prepared in 50 mM NaCl, 40 mM NaPO4, pH 6.95 (NMR buffer). Data were analyzed with SPARKY (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3, UCSF, CA) and NMRView (One Moon Scientific, Westfield, NJ). Chemical shift perturbations were measured by comparing peak positions to <sup>15</sup>N-Ub alone using ((0.2∆N<sup>2</sup> + ∆H<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>) to map residues in and near the interface Ub uses to bind ANTH domains. binding affinities were obtained by using the peak intensities of Ile30 of <sup>15</sup>N-Ub in <sup>15</sup>N/<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectra collected in the presence of various concentrations of the Ub-binding protein ANTH domain (WT or mutant). The bound fraction was calculated by measuring the difference in the peak intensity in the absence (free form) and presence (bound form) of the Ub-binding protein, then divided by the peak intensity of the free form. These data were then fitted to a standard quadratic equation using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggs et al., 2016</xref>). The standard deviation from data fitting is reported. Every binding affinity experiment shown is a separate titration curve using the indicated ratios of proteins. To measure Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE) effects, mutant ANTH domain proteins containing a single cysteine at different positions were created. The Talon resin purified proteins were incubated with 1 mM MTSL in the elution buffer 18 hrs at 4 °C, then dialyzed into NMR buffer. For each spin-labeled Cys mutant protein sample, two HSQC spectra were collected with addition of <sup>15</sup>N-Ub at 30 µM for two NMR samples. One sample had MTSL in the oxidized state, whereas second sample contained MTSL reduced by 5 mM sodium ascorbate as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pashkova et al., 2013</xref>).

It's not referenced where it is described in the text, directly following Figure 5D.</p><p>The supplementary figures that include the data points for Figure 5C, 5E, 5F should be referenced along with these figures at first appearance/experimental description in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In N. Pashkova et al., the authors follow up on results of a large-scale Y2H screen which revealed that the N-terminal portion of the endocytosis protein HIP1 binds ubiquitin (Ub). In the first part of the manuscript the authors clearly establish that the ANTH domain can serve as a Ub binding domain. Through biochemical analysis using GST-pulldown assays the authors showed that the ANTH domain alone was sufficient to bind Ub. Purification of different ANTH domains from various proteins and monitoring of their binding to Ub by HSQC NMR confirmed the initial findings and revealed equilibrium binding constants in the low µM range, which is in line with previous observed Ub binding domains (K.A. Swanson et al., JMB 2006).</p><p>To get insights into the mode of binding between the ANTH domain and Ub the authors pursued a crystal structure of CALM ANTH domain in complex with Ub. This revealed a CALM-ANTH:Ub interface. The key residues establishing the interface were seen in both the NMR experiments as well as the crystal structure. Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE) experiments confirmed the structural information and showed that Ub binds to the same region in solution. Based on this structural information the authors created mutants disrupting the binding between ANTH domains and Ub.</p><p>In the second part of the manuscript N. Pashkova et al., aim to investigate the role of the ANTH:Ub interaction on receptor internalization during endocytosis. For this they use two mutant variants of the α-factor receptor Ste2 which either is dependent or independent on Ub as an internalization signal as well as a mutant lacking both signals. With this system they test the effect of Ub-binding deficient ANTH proteins in Ste2 internalization. Using fluorescence microscopy, they measure indirectly the α-factor internalization by monitoring the fluorescence α-factor signal at the plasma membrane in chase experiments. From these experiments they conclude that Ub-dependent internalization is dependent on all Ub-binding domains within the endocytic machinery, including the Ub-binding property of the ANTH domains. The conclusion of the second part of this manuscript is mostly well supported by data, but some aspects would need to be clarified and extended.</p><p>(1.) The authors do not provide data on how much the additional effect of the ANTH domain on Ub-binding compared to previously described Ub-domains in Ede1, Ent1 and Ent2 is. Internalization of fluorescence α-factor by the Ub-dependent STE2-∆C in Figure 5E should be performed and compared to ede1∆UBA ent1∆Ub ent2∆Ub to estimate the additional effect of the 3xANTH∆Ub combination.</p><p>(2.) Figure 5D should contain microscopy images of all four Ste2 constructs at 10 min to allow comparison, since this timepoint is mainly used for analysis.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript by N. Pashkova et al., provides compelling evidence that the list of Ub-binding motifs with the endocytic machinery is much larger as currently anticipated. They provide initial evidence, that these new motifs might play a role in cargo internalization but more work is necessary to elucidate their mode of action. Additionally, it will be of great interest to see the contribution of those domains on assembly of the endocytic machinery.</p><p>The manuscript by N. Pashkova et al., seems to have a pdf compilation problem. Figure S4-2 is missing and many other figures are duplicated such as Figure 1. This needs to be fixed. Therefore, the bioRxiv version of the manuscript was partially used to evaluate the missing figures. Moreover, some figures such as Figure 3A and 3B are not annotated in the text.</p><p>In Figure 4B the amino acid labelling is too small to read this should be rearranged to make it readable.</p><p>Overall, the result that the ANTH domain serves as a Ub-binding domain is an intriguing finding. It would be very interesting to see if Ub-binding is important for assembly of the CME machinery. The authors provide a discussion but some experimental evidence would be very helpful and increase the impact of the work. For example, does patch life time of endocytic machinery proteins vary in the 3xANTH mutants or Ub∆ mutants?</p><p>The authors mention that 3xANTH∆Ub ede1∆UBA ent1∆Ub ent2∆Ub mutant does not show the same internalization defect as the Ste2-∆C, K&gt;R. The SH3 domain of Sla1 another endocytic machinery protein has also been suggested to bind to ubiquitin (PMID: 17244534). Adding this mutation to the 3xANTH∆Ub ede1∆UBA ent1∆Ub ent2∆Ub could completely abolish receptor uptake and lead to a similar effect as seen in the Ste2-∆C, K&gt;R. This would add additional value since it would show that most likely no additional Ub-binding mutants are necessary.</p><p>The authors mention data about pHIuorin fused Ste2 but do not provide any data. These data should be provided or the section should be removed from the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72583.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the reviewers feel that the paper is important and interesting.

The figures are out of order, some panels not referenced, Figure S4F for example is not abelled as such but rather part of S4E, I can’t find Figure S4-2.

P. 8-9 has quite a bit of introductory text that breaks the flow and distracts from the Results/experimental description with Figure 5C referenced along with Figure 5A (top of p. 9), before description of the experiment. Isn’t Figure 5C the analysis of Figure 5D? It’s not referenced where it is described in the text, directly following Figure 5D.</p><p>The supplementary figures that include the data points for Figure 5C, 5E, 5F should be referenced along with these figures at first appearance/experimental description in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>– The introductory text in the Results section leading to Figure 5 has been shortened, with part moved to the discussion to provide this context to the readers.</p><p>– Prolines of Ub in the <sup>1</sup>H/<sup>15</sup>N HSQC data are indeed absent.

Pashkova et al., the authors follow up on results of a large-scale Y2H screen which revealed that the N-terminal portion of the endocytosis protein HIP1 binds ubiquitin (Ub). In the first part of the manuscript the authors clearly establish that the ANTH domain can serve as a Ub binding domain. Through biochemical analysis using GST-pulldown assays the authors showed that the ANTH domain alone was sufficient to bind Ub. Purification of different ANTH domains from various proteins and monitoring of their binding to Ub by HSQC NMR confirmed the initial findings and revealed equilibrium binding constants in the low µM range, which is in line with previous observed Ub binding domains (K.A. Swanson et al., JMB 2006).</p><p>To get insights into the mode of binding between the ANTH domain and Ub the authors pursued a crystal structure of CALM ANTH domain in complex with Ub. This revealed a CALM-ANTH:Ub interface. The key residues establishing the interface were seen in both the NMR experiments as well as the crystal structure. Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE) experiments confirmed the structural information and showed that Ub binds to the same region in solution. Based on this structural information the authors created mutants disrupting the binding between ANTH domains and Ub.</p><p>In the second part of the manuscript N. Pashkova et al., aim to investigate the role of the ANTH:Ub interaction on receptor internalization during endocytosis. For this they use two mutant variants of the α-factor receptor Ste2 which either is dependent or independent on Ub as an internalization signal as well as a mutant lacking both signals. With this system they test the effect of Ub-binding deficient ANTH proteins in Ste2 internalization. Using fluorescence microscopy, they measure indirectly the α-factor internalization by monitoring the fluorescence α-factor signal at the plasma membrane in chase experiments. From these experiments they conclude that Ub-dependent internalization is dependent on all Ub-binding domains within the endocytic machinery, including the Ub-binding property of the ANTH domains. The conclusion of the second part of this manuscript is mostly well supported by data, but some aspects would need to be clarified and extended.</p><p>(1.) The authors do not provide data on how much the additional effect of the ANTH domain on Ub-binding compared to previously described Ub-domains in Ede1, Ent1 and Ent2 is. Internalization of fluorescence α-factor by the Ub-dependent STE2-∆C in Figure 5E should be performed and compared to ede1∆UBA ent1∆Ub ent2∆Ub to estimate the additional effect of the 3xANTH∆Ub combination.</p><p>(2.) Figure 5D should contain microscopy images of all four Ste2 constructs at 10 min to allow comparison, since this timepoint is mainly used for analysis.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript by N. Pashkova et al., provides compelling evidence that the list of Ub-binding motifs with the endocytic machinery is much larger as currently anticipated. They provide initial evidence, that these new motifs might play a role in cargo internalization but more work is necessary to elucidate their mode of action. Additionally, it will be of great interest to see the contribution of those domains on assembly of the endocytic machinery.</p><p>The manuscript by N. Pashkova et al., seems to have a pdf compilation problem. Figure S4-2 is missing and many other figures are duplicated such as Figure 1. This needs to be fixed. Therefore, the bioRxiv version of the manuscript was partially used to evaluate the missing figures. Moreover, some figures such as Figure 3A and 3B are not annotated in the text.</p><p>In Figure 4B the amino acid labelling is too small to read this should be rearranged to make it readable.</p><p>Overall, the result that the ANTH domain serves as a Ub-binding domain is an intriguing finding. It would be very interesting to see if Ub-binding is important for assembly of the CME machinery. The authors provide a discussion but some experimental evidence would be very helpful and increase the impact of the work. For example, does patch life time of endocytic machinery proteins vary in the 3xANTH mutants or Ub∆ mutants?</p><p>The authors mention that 3xANTH∆Ub ede1∆UBA ent1∆Ub ent2∆Ub mutant does not show the same internalization defect as the Ste2-∆C, K&gt;R. The SH3 domain of Sla1 another endocytic machinery protein has also been suggested to bind to ubiquitin (PMID: 17244534). Adding this mutation to the 3xANTH∆Ub ede1∆UBA ent1∆Ub ent2∆Ub could completely abolish receptor uptake and lead to a similar effect as seen in the Ste2-∆C, K&gt;R. This would add additional value since it would show that most likely no additional Ub-binding mutants are necessary.</p><p>The authors mention data about pHIuorin fused Ste2 but do not provide any data. These data should be provided or the section should be removed from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>– As suggested, we now provide data on internalization of Ste2∆C in ede1∆UBA ent1∆Ub ent2∆Ub mutants with and without additional mutation of the Ub-binding surfaces in the 3 yeast ANTH domain proteins. We agree this is an important addition to the work and helps support the idea that Ub-bindng by ANTH domains contributes to Ub-dependent internalization.</p><p>– We now include pictures of yeast expressing the 4 different Ste2 proteins used in the study as they internalize α factor. Shown are the time 0 timepoint while they are at 0°C and a timepoint 10 min after warming. This now substitutes for the earlier micrographs shown 0min and 20 min after warming. We see that the arrangement of panels in Figure 5 were confusing in that the quantitation of how these 4 different Ste2 proteins should have been juxtaposed to micrograph panels to the right. We have re-arranged Figure 5 to first show what a time course looks like in which we image different cells at different timepoints to avoid quenching artifacts. Then we show quantitation of all the different types of Ste2 proteins we use to keep these concepts separate. The requested micrographs of T0 and T10 are provided in SFig5B and show the same cells imaged at different times to allow readers to appreciate the kinetics of internalization.</p><p>– Again apologies for having to go to the BioRvix version of the paper to get the proper PDF file. We really appreciate your effort. Figure S4-2 is in this version. Figures3A and 3B are specifically called out</p><p>– The amino acid lettering in Figure 4B is indeed way too small to be of use and its also too small in SFig2. We have taken that out and simply labelled it based on amino acid position. In response to a concern to R1, we have also designated proline residues explicitly as well, which do not give an HSQC backbone spectra.</p><p>– The idea of whether Ub-binding alters the assembly kinetics of the CME apparatus is indeed really interesting and something we discuss in the paper. To do this right, we would want to couple that to also looking at cargo and see if assembly around Ub-dependent cargo is different from Ub-independent cargo in the midst of thee mutations. We feel this is an important but quite technically challenging question, we only know of one paper that follows cargo into assembling yeast CME puncta and the regimen to synchronize that movement is fairly different from what we use here. Without solving this, we think the cursory answer we would obtain would be unsatisfying and distracting and possibly a deterrent for others that are currently better suited to address this.</p><p>– Our discussion does indeed mention the possibility that Ub-binding by SlaI could be the one, or one of many remaining Ub adaptors for CME. This speaks to a larger effort to explain all of Ub-dependent internalization activity in yeast vs what we wanted to focus on in this manuscript which was whether Ubbinding by ANTH domains contributed to Ub-dependent internalization. Answering the larger question of how all CME Ub-binding proteins contribute represents making and analyzing a number of complicated strains that we could not complete. For instance, we have had problems altering SLA1. And as a curiosity, we pick up tons of mutations in AVL9 in these complex strains when we alter EDE1, which prevents Ste2 trafficking to the plasma membrane. All that is potentially really interesting, but outside the scope of this focused study on whether Ub-binding by ANTH domains does something.</p><p>– In terms of the effects of pHluorin, we have removed that from the main text and made a technical note in the methods section and show data in supplementary figures that prompted us to switch to un-tagged Ste2. We point out that it still internalizes and that pHluorin itself does not appear to provide an internalization signal since Ste2 without its SlaI binding site (∆C) and lacking its normal ubiquitinated lysines (K&gt;R) does not internalize α factor when appended to pHluorin.</p></body></sub-article></article>
