Many Kv channels undergo a progressive loss of ion conductance in the presence of a prolonged voltage stimulus, termed slow inactivation, but the atomic determinants that regulate the kinetics of this process remain obscure. Using a combination of synthetic amino acid analogs and concatenated channel subunits we establish two H-bonds near the extracellular surface of the channel that endow Kv channels with a mechanism to time the entry into slow inactivation: an intra-subunit H-bond between Asp447 and Trp434 and an inter-subunit H-bond connecting Tyr445 to Thr439. Breaking of either interaction triggers slow inactivation by means of a local disruption in the selectivity filter, while severing the Tyr445–Thr439 H-bond is likely to communicate this conformational change to the adjacent subunit(s).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01289.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01289.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01289.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are made from long chains of smaller molecules, called amino acids. These chains twist and bend into complex three-dimensional shapes, and sometimes two or more chains, or ‘subunits’, are packed into a protein. These shapes are often held together by hydrogen bonds between some of the amino acids. Moreover, since the shape of a protein defines its function, some proteins must be able to switch between different shapes to function properly.</p><p>Ion channels are proteins that form pores through cell membranes, allowing ions to flow in and out of the cell. Potassium ion channels, which are found in neurons and heart muscle cells, have four subunits that move to open or close the central pore in response to various signals.</p><p>The closing of the channels can be ‘fast’ or ‘slow’. When the channels are closed quickly (called fast inactivation), a small part of the protein ‘plugs’ the pore from the inside of the cell. However, the mechanism behind slow inactivation remained obscure. It was thought to involve hydrogen bonds between some of the bulky amino acids that are found at the edge the pore. However, testing this hypothesis—by replacing these amino acids with alternatives that cannot form hydrogen bonds—was tricky because none of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids were alike enough to be suitable replacements.</p><p>Now, Pless et al. have overcome this limitation by using synthetic amino acids that form hydrogen bonds that are stronger or weaker than those formed by the amino acids they are replacing. The results suggest that two types of hydrogen bond keep the pore open: one is a bond between two amino acids in the same subunit, and the other is an inter-subunit bond between amino acids in neighbouring subunits. Pless et al. suggest that opening the channel causes small movements that gradually weaken, and eventually break, these bonds in one of the four subunits. Specific amino acids within the pore are then free to twist and—via a cascade of similar movements in the other three subunits—block the pore and halt the flow of ions. As such, these networks of hydrogen bonds act as pre-set breaking points allowing channels to close, even in response to continued stimulation.</p><p>Since regulated potassium channel activity underpins healthy neurons and heart muscles; understanding what controls their inactivation rate may lead to new approaches to tune their activity and treatments for important diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01289.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01289.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neuroscience</kwd><kwd>ion channel gating</kwd><kwd>unnatural amino acid</kwd><kwd>hydrogen bond</kwd><kwd>channel inactivation</kwd><kwd>molecular timer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM106569</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahern</surname><given-names>Christopher A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-56858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurata</surname><given-names>Harley T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tuning the strength of inter- and intra-subunit hydrogen bonds can control potassium flux across biological membranes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enzymes and catalytic proteins have evolved to balance the thermodynamic challenges of stability and substrate throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shoichet et al., 1995</xref>). Ion channels, for instance, must efficiently interconvert between open, closed and inactivated states to regulate ionic flux across biological membranes. Even small alterations in their function that change the rates of isomerization between states can underlie inherited or acquired diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hille, 2001</xref>). Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are tetrameric membrane proteins with a central ion-conducting pore domain, surrounded by four voltage-sensor domains (VSDs), which tightly regulate the conductive state of the pore domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The pore domain consists of two transmembrane helices (S5–S6) connected by a re-entrant pore helix, which forms the selectivity filter. Kv channels negatively regulate conductance after channel opening through a process termed inactivation. The rate and extent of inactivation exhibit considerable isoform-dependent differences, which are reflected in the physiological contributions of these channels to cellular excitability in neuronal and cardiac tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bean, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spector et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldrich et al., 1979</xref>). Inactivation can be described by two kinetically and mechanistically distinct processes termed fast (or ‘N-type’) inactivation and slow (or ‘C-type’) inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoshi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurata and Fedida, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoshi and Armstrong, 2013</xref>). While the former results from a channel peptide docking within the open cytoplasmic entrance to the permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoshi et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>), the latter is assumed to involve highly cooperative local conformational changes near the selectivity filter, a notion supported by electrophysiological, structural and computational approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopez-Barneo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yellen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Starkus et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiss et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cordero-Morales et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Peng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordero-Morales et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ostmeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van der Cruijsen et al., 2013</xref>). However, and despite this available data, fundamental questions persist regarding the precise molecular determinants that mediate the rate of slow inactivation, the basis for cooperativity and the relationship between slow inactivation and the structural integrity of the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoshi and Armstrong, 2013</xref>). An ongoing challenge is to elucidate how these proteins precisely time the entry into the slow inactivated state in the presence of a sustained voltage stimulus.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01289.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The aromatic cuff is part of a highly conserved region in potassium channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top view of a Kv channel based on the structure of the tetrameric Kv1.2/2.1 chimera (PDB <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2R9R">2R9R</ext-link>; individual subunits are colored in gray, cyan, green and yellow, respectively).

Here, we bypass this experimental hurdle by employing subtle synthetic derivatives of naturally occurring side chains in combination with concatenated subunits to probe the inter- and intra-subunit atomic determinants that control the onset and cooperativity of slow inactivation in Kv channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defining an intra-subunit H-bond between Asp447 and Trp434</title><p>Crystallographic data demonstrate the close physical proximity of highly conserved Asp and Trp side chains within the same subunit of potassium channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2005</xref>). Mutations at these positions (Asp447 and Trp434 by Shaker numbering, which is used throughout the manuscript) elicit drastic changes in channel function, including effects on inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molina et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Loots and Isacoff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loboda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordero-Morales et al., 2011</xref>). However, functional studies have not demonstrated the chemical basis of the interaction between these two side chains. One previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordero-Morales et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoshi and Armstrong, 2013</xref>), but untested possibility is that a H-bond is formed between the hydrogen on the indole nitrogen of Trp434 and the carboxylate moiety of Asp447, and disrupting this H-bond would promote conformational changes associated with slow inactivation. If correct, then a side chain such as Glu (with altered stereochemistry, but a conserved negatively charged carboxylate), might weaken the interaction but not abolish it completely. By contrast, the virtually isosteric but uncharged Asn side chain should not form a significant H-bond with Trp434 and should thus result in dramatically accelerated inactivation. Indeed, the Asp447Glu mutation leads to a rapid and complete decrease in ionic current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molina et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">1998</xref>), and this loss in conductance can be drastically slowed by addition of extracellular tetraethyl ammonium (TEA). This deceleration of current decay in the presence of extracellular TEA is a hallmark of slow inactivation and can serve to discriminate this process from other phenotypes, such as fast inactivation or generic protein dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grissmer and Cahalan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Molina et al., 1997</xref>). The charge-neutralizing Asp447Asn mutation resulted in gating currents only, generally interpreted to reflect an inactivation phenotype too rapid to resolve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hurst et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loots and Isacoff, 1998</xref>). Conversely, manipulations of the putative H-bonding partner Trp 434 should cause complimentary effects. For example, if the hydrogen on the indole nitrogen of Trp434 does, indeed, play a critical role in slow inactivation, then removing it should drastically increase the rate of inactivation. However, there are no naturally occurring Trp derivatives that can faithfully test this hypothesis without perturbing the local structure. Other (smaller) aromatic side chains markedly alter channel function: Tyr in position 434 speeds up slow inactivation (and is sensitive to TEA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), while Phe results in gating currents only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordero-Morales et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, while structural data suggests a possible H-bond between Trp434 and Asp447, the available functional data cannot definitely discriminate between the roles of side chain size and/or volume or hydrogen bonding ability being the major determinant of slow inactivation at position 434. We therefore employed synthetic derivatives of Trp to test the hypothesis that a H-bond between Trp434 and Asp447 is a rate-controlling interaction for slow inactivation. If this H-bond is a critical determinant of the rate of slow inactivation, predicted outcomes are that strengthening the interaction should decelerate inactivation, while weakening the putative H-bond would be expected to increase the rate of inactivation. To this end, we introduced F<sub>4</sub>-Trp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), a fluorinated Trp derivative that increases the acidity of the hydrogen on the indole nitrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deutsch and Taylor, 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">1989</xref>), while leaving side chain size and hydrophobicity intact. This slowed the rate of slow inactivation by threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, this slowing is preceded by an initial faster inactivating component in the Trp434TAG + Trp trace (gray trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which may stem from a small degree of nonspecific incorporation of (endogenous) amino acids other than the one ligated to the tRNA (in this case Trp). This likely produces an underestimate of the true slowing of inactivation through fluorination as all naturally occurring amino acids other than Trp in position 434 lead to accelerated slow inactivation. As a chemical complement, we sought to incorporate 2-amino-3-indol-1-yl-propionic acid (Ind, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lacroix et al., 2012</xref>), a synthetic isosteric Trp derivative in which the indole hydrogen cannot act as a H-bond donor. As co-injection of Trp434TAG cRNA and Ind-coupled tRNA alone did not yield measurable ionic currents, Wild type cRNA was mixed with Trp434TAG cRNA and Ind-coupled tRNA. However, even in the presence of WT (Wild type) subunits, the resulting heteromeric channel population displayed a 70-fold increase in inactivation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), demonstrating that breaking the proposed Asp447–Trp434 H-bond in the absence of steric perturbation leads to substantially accelerated inactivation. Similar to our recordings with Trp434TAG + Trp alone, we observed an initial fast inactivating component with the Trp434TAG + Trp: WT mix (gray trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), possibly indicating a small degree of nonspecific incorporation of endogenous amino acids in position 434. However, this also is unlikely to have a major impact on our results because, first, the resulting fast component is a minor component only visually discernible during the initial phase (less than 1 s) of the depolarization and, second, the overall measured effect is likely more affected (slowed) by the presence of the WT subunits that were necessary to obtain ionic currents with Ind-containing subunits. We thus conclude that slow inactivation is amenable to the simple atomic ‘push/pull’ of a single H-bond, and manipulation of the strength of this H-bond generates a spectrum of inactivation rates, that can be tuned to occur faster or slower than what is observed in WT channels.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01289.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Evidence for an intra-subunit H-bond between Asp447 and Trp434.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of a Kv1.2/2.1 chimera (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2R9R">2R9R</ext-link>) pore region demonstrating the physical proximity of Asp447 and Trp434 (Shaker residue numbering); (<bold>B</bold>) Chemical structures of side chains at position 447 and (normalized) representative currents for Asp447 (WT), Asp447Glu and Asp447Asn (−80 mV to +20 mV in 10 mV increments).

However, while the Trp435Ala mutation produced non-functional channels (as suggested by the absence of ionic or gating currents), Tyr and Phe substitutions at position 435 resulted in WT-like slow inactivation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), ruling out a role for Trp435 H-bonding in slow inactivation. However, the Tyr445Phe mutation results in a mix of gating current and ionic current, with markedly accelerated slow inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harris et al., 1998</xref>) (a phenotype antagonized by TEA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, Tyr445Ala channels exhibited gating currents akin to Trp434Phe channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heginbotham et al., 1994</xref>). Interestingly, crystallographic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Long et al., 2007</xref>) place the Tyr445 hydroxyl within 3 Å of the hydroxyl moiety of a conserved Thr or Ser side chain (Thr439 in <italic>Shaker</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), raising the intriguing possibility of an uncharacterized inter-subunit interaction between Tyr445 and Thr439. Consistent with this possibility, the Thr439Val mutant exhibited exclusively gating currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), while the Thr439Ser mutation resulted in a modest threefold faster inactivation than observed for WT channels, likely indicating a minor role for the Thr439 methyl group in slow inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further, and unlike the Trp434Phe mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kitaguchi et al., 2004</xref>), introducing Tyr445Ala, Tyr445Val or Thr439Val on the Thr449Val background did not slow inactivation to an extent that ionic currents could be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). While these data point to an inter-subunit H-bond between Tyr445 and Thr439, they do not inform on the cooperativity between individual subunits or whether this interaction contributes to the same extent as the Asp447–Trp434 H-bond. However, we speculated that breaking this inter-subunit H-bond may have a more pronounced effect when introduced in only a single subunit, compared to the intra-subunit Trp434–Asp447 H-bond. Consistent with this possibility, either the Tyr445Ala or the Thr439Val mutation in the first of four concatenated <italic>Shaker</italic> subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) had similar phenotypes, with a clearly biphasic inactivation phenotype composed of fast (around 50 ms) and WT-like slow (around 3 s) components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The fast component was affected by TEA, implicating a slow inactivation mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The sizable gating currents at hyperpolarized potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) suggest that either mutation (one per concatenated tetramer) reduces the ratio of ionic current to gating charge at a given voltage, an effect that would arise if a significant portion of channels rapidly adopt a non-conducting conformation. To further test this possibility, the pore blocker agitoxin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eriksson and Roux, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>) was used to assay the gating currents as a metric for normalization of the number of channels present in the cell, and thus permitting an estimate of the relative reduction in ionic current in the mutant concatemers relative to WT concatemers. Indeed, we found the ratio of ionic current to gating charge to be significantly reduced in both mutant concatemers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that a sizable proportion of channels rapidly enter an inactivated state upon depolarization. This behavior is further illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, where currents from Tyr445Ala or Thr439Val concatemers were normalized to WT (by gating charge), thus emphasizing the very rapid and near-complete inactivation in Tyr445Ala and Thr439Val concatemers. These experiments establish a previously unidentified inter-subunit H-bond between Thr439 and Tyr445 that controls slow inactivation in Kv channels.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01289.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>An inter-subunit H-bond connects Tyr445 with Thr439, not Trp435.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of a Kv1.2/2.1 chimera (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2R9R">2R9R</ext-link>) pore region demonstrating the physical proximity of Tyr445 to both Thr439 and Trp435 on the adjacent subunit (Shaker residue numbering).

We aimed to compare the relative contribution of Thr441 and Thr442 to slow inactivation with more extracellular structural elements of the selectivity filter. Interestingly, mutations here produce vastly different outcomes (depending on the amino acid substitution), including loss-of-function, alterations in open state stability, and the appearance of subconductance states with diminished selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yool and Schwarz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heginbotham et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng and Sigworth, 1997</xref>). Consistent with these reports, we found that valine substitutions a 441 and 442 had severe consequences: while Thr442Val displayed a non-expressing phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng and Sigworth, 1997</xref>), the Thr441Val mutation resulted in voltage-dependent currents both in the inward and the outward direction, as well as reduced potassium selectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting a significant perturbation of the local structure. However, Thr441Ser channels displayed a WT-like GV whereas Thr442Ser channels displayed a modest left-shifted activation relationship, yet both had inactivation behaviors similar to WT channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), supporting the notion that the hydroxyl moieties at positions 441 and 442 support normal pore function (in addition to the proposed role of the Thr442 methyl group in ion binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rossi et al., 2013</xref>)). However, despite the disruptive phenotypes observed in homotetrameric Thr441Val or Thr442Val channels, single subunit mutations had minimal effects in the background of a concatenated tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Thus, hydroxyl removal at either 441 or 442 produces channel phenotypes that are very mild compared to perturbations within the aromatic cuff, and importantly, their effects are not propagated to other subunits in the channel tetramer, suggesting they are unrelated to the cooperative mechanism of slow inactivation. We believe this is an important finding as it demonstrates that severe functional consequences of mutations at the selectivity filter are not necessarily linked to changes in slow inactivation.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01289.017</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Thr441 and Thr442 are critical to channel function but not inactivation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of a Kv1.2/2.1 chimera (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2R9R">2R9R</ext-link>) pore region highlighting the positions of Thr441 and Thr442 at the bottom of the selectivity filter (Asp447 and Trp434 are shown for reference; all by Shaker numbering); (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>C</bold>) Chemical structures and (normalized) representative currents for different side chains in position 441 (<bold>B</bold>) and 442 (<bold>C</bold>), respectively (−80 mV to +20 mV, 10 mV increments for WT, Thr441Ser and Thr442Ser; −200 mV to +150 mV, 10 mV increments for Thr441Val and a single pulse to +20 mV for Thr442Val).

A major challenge with addressing the contribution of individual side chains in the selectivity filter and pore helix to slow inactivation is that many amino acids lack naturally occurring analogs that allow subtle manipulation without dramatic disruption of the overall structure of this critical protein region. Furthermore, since slow inactivation is tightly coupled to ion occupancy in the selectivity filter, it has been difficult to distinguish direct effects on the mechanistic underpinnings of slow inactivation from indirect effects arising from changes in the structural integrity of the selectivity filter. Here, we overcome this hurdle by employing subtle synthetic analogs of naturally occurring amino acids and by introducing isolated mutations in single subunits.</p><p>When using concatenated <italic>Shaker</italic> constructs to introduce single mutations in a fourfold symmetric channel, it is crucial to confirm that the concatenated subunits do not form functional channels that vary in their stoichiometry from that predicted from the cloning strategy. Albeit possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McCormack et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hurst et al., 1995</xref>), we believe the constructs used here assemble correctly for three reasons. First, the Thr439Val concatemers and the Tyr445Ala concatemers showed almost complete inactivation over a period of only 200 ms (when corrected for the amount of gating charge). Second, we observed very low ratios of I<sub>max</sub> to Q<sub>max</sub> for Thr439Val concatemers and Tyr445Ala concatemers. Both scenarios are not compatible with the idea of a significant WT-only channel subpopulation; Lastly, Sigworth and co-workers have used the same concatemers and successfully demonstrated that channels containing only a single mutated subunit generally assemble in the correct stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). We conclude that the (vast majority of) concatemers assemble correctly, although we cannot ultimately rule out a small subpopulation of channels with WT-like slow inactivation.</p><p>Further, we employed fluorinated Trp derivatives, which have been used extensively to probe electrostatic (cation-pi) interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dougherty, 1996</xref>) between Trp side chains and organic cations as fluorination allows a step-wise dispersion of the electronegative surface potential of aromatic side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pless and Ahern, 2013</xref>). As such, our finding that F<sub>4</sub>-Trp in position 434 significantly slows channel inactivation could be interpreted as a result of a cation-pi interaction at Trp434 that is being diminished by fluorination. However, if this were true, Ind, a synthetic amino acid which lacks H-bonding ability, should have no effect on channel inactivation as it is isosteric and isoelectric to the native Trp side chain. By contrast, we observe a substantial increase in the rate of slow inactivation with Ind in position 434, a result not compatible with the notion of an energetically significant cation-pi interaction at Trp434. We thus conclude that it is the ability of the indole nitrogen to participate in a H-bond that regulates the strength of the intra-subunit interaction between Trp434 and Asp447.</p><p>Together, our experimental approaches provide strong evidence for two H-bonds that are critical for slow inactivation of Kv channels: one that confers stability within an individual subunit (the Trp434–Asp447 interaction), and a second that stabilizes the relative orientation of two adjacent subunits (the Tyr445–Thr439 interaction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Although disruption of the Trp434–Asp447 interaction has profound effects on slow inactivation, breaking of the Tyr445–Thr439 interaction elicits more functionally significant phenotypes. We surmise that these comparatively more severe phenotypes seen when disrupting the Tyr445–Thr439 pair arise from its location at the inter-subunit interface, but cannot exclude the possibility that this difference arises from the fact that the Tyr445 backbone carbonyl is also directly involved in coordinating permeant ions. Furthermore, the Tyr445–Thr439 interaction is, to our knowledge, the first evidence for an inter-subunit interaction contributing to slow inactivation, possibly providing an explanation for the observed subunit cooperativity during slow inactivation. However, although previous studies have suggested evidence for both constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baukrowitz and Yellen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">1997</xref>) and dilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoshi and Armstrong, 2013</xref>) of the selectivity filter, the data here is not definitive in distinguishing these models of slow inactivation.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01289.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A network of inter- and intra-subunit H-bonds regulates slow inactivation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The left panel shows a top view of pore helix and selectivity filter (based on the Kv1.2/2.1 chimera structure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=2R9R">2R9R</ext-link>); individual subunits are colored in gray, cyan, green and yellow, respectively).

During a sustained voltage stimulus, channels experience a sequential breaking of the Trp434–Asp447 and Tyr445–Thr439 H-bonds and given the relative arrangement of their hydroxyl moieties this would likely result in an anti-clockwise swivel movement of the Tyr445 backbone carbonyl away from the permeation pathway, ultimately disrupting the coordination and occupancy of potassium ions at the outer end of the selectivity filter. Such a scenario would lead to mutual repulsion between the Tyr445 backbone carbonyls of the remaining three subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almers and Armstrong, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoshi and Armstrong, 2013</xref>), further lowering filter-occupancy at its outer mouth. The resulting strain could trigger a cascade of disrupted H-bonds critical to inactivation near the extracellular end of the selectivity filter in all subunits, ultimately resulting in a fully inactivated channel.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology and in vivo nonsense suppression</title><p><italic>Shaker</italic> IR (Inactivation Removed by deletion of amino acids 6–46) cDNA in pBSTA was used as the parent clone unless stated otherwise (note that Cys301 and Cys308 were present).

For experiments with concatenated <italic>Shaker</italic> tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1997</xref>), mutations were introduced in the first of the four subunits only: the first subunit was subcloned into pBSTA with SacI and XbaI, and standard site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce mutations followed by sequence verification. Next, the mutated construct was subcloned (with SacI and XbaI) back into the parent concatemer.</p><p>For electrophysiology experiments, Stage V-VI <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were prepared, and injected with cRNA transcribed with the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pless et al., 2013</xref>). Oocytes were incubated at 18°C and all recordings were conducted within 12–72 hr after injection. The fluorinated Trp derivative F<sub>4</sub>-Trp (4,5,6,7-F<sub>4</sub>-Trp) was purchased from Asis Chem (Watertown, MA) and the Trp analog 2-Amino-3-indol-1-yl-propionic acid (Ind) was synthesized as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lacroix et al., 2012</xref>). The principle of the in vivo nonsense suppression methodology is outlined elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pless and Ahern, 2013</xref>). In short, nitroveratryloxycarbonyl (NVOC) was used to protect the amine of the synthetic amino acid, while the carboxyl group was activated as the cyanomethyl ester for coupling to the dinucleotide pdCpA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The resulting product was stored in DMSO at −80°C before enzymatic ligation to a modified (G73) <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> tRNA, which was synthesized using an oligonucleotide by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) as a template. The NVOC protection group of the aminoacylated tRNA-UAA was removed directly prior to co-injection with the cRNA by UV irradiation for 8 min at 400 W. In a typical experiment, 10–80 ng of tRNA-UAA and 25–50 ng of cRNA were co-injected in a 50 nl vol. In control experiments, the tRNA coupled to pdCpA (without an appended synthetic amino acid) was co-injected with the Trp434TAG cRNA. The control did not yield currents larger than for uninjected oocytes, ruling out significant levels of non-specific amino acid incorporation, or re-charging of the tRNA with endogenous amino acids. Note that incorporation of Ind at position 434 did not result in measurable ionic currents. This was expected given the results with the conventional Trp434Tyr and Trp434Phe mutants, as side chains in position 434 with no propensity to contribute to a H-bond (such as Ind) were shown to result in gating currents only. However, the nonsense suppression method is generally not efficient enough to establish current levels of necessary magnitude to resolve gating currents, even for sites with exceptionally high incorporation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pless et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2013</xref>). We thus co-injected WT <italic>Shaker</italic> cRNA with the Trp434TAG cRNA for incorporation of Ind. Despite the high degree of cooperativity between subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), this likely results in slower and less complete slow inactivation than would be expected for Ind-containing subunits alone and the 70-fold increase in inactivation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is likely to be an underestimate of the real acceleration of inactivation induced by the Ind side chain in position 434.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Electrophysiology and data analysis</title><p>Two electrode voltage-clamp recordings were conducted with an OC-725C voltage clamp (Warner, Hamden, CT) in standard Ringers solution (in mM): 116 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES (pH 7.4).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Using the atomic structure of Kv1.2/2.1 as the roadmap, Pless et al. ask a series of specific questions regarding the mechanism of C-type inactivation focusing on the hydrogen bonds near the selectivity filter. For example, is the (probable) hydrogen bond between W434 and D447 important in C-type inactivation of Shaker potassium channels? Despite the efforts by many, the exact mechanism of C-type inactivation remains mysterious and any specific and firm mechanistic information will be appreciated by those in the field and this study has potential to make an important contribution. The use of unusual amino acids using the in vivo nonsense suppression method brings a fresh approach to study C-type inactivation. The overall experimental rationale/design is straightforward, the experiments are elegant and the conclusions are for the most part solid.</p><p>There are two major central issues that must be addressed:</p><p>1) The overly simplistic treatment of inactivation kinetics must be corrected, taking into account the existence of non-exponential decay.</p><p>Perhaps the most problematic issue with the study described in this manuscript may lie in the data analysis/interpretation and the data description (e.g., the manuscript text). Many of the sample ionic currents involving the in vivo nonsense suppression method exhibit double-exponential inactivation kinetics (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> gray, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> W434F blue). Except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> gray and blue, it is not clear what is responsible for the double exponential character. Is it possible that the nonsense suppression method was not perfect? Given the double exponential character, it is also unclear how the currents were analyzed to estimate the time constant values plotted in the figures. It is also uncertain how the “rate of entry into slow inactivation” often mentioned in the text is estimated. Additionally, the manuscript does not report any attempt to separate the entry and recovery rates – this would be important because many of the sample currents shown (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, 2F, 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) suggest that the inactivated state at depolarized test voltages was not an absorbing state and the recovery rate constant value was appreciable (as evidenced by “steady-state” currents in the sample data shown). If the authors really wish to address the stability of the open state (as opposed to the stability of the inactivated state), they may wish to separate them out.</p><p>2) The work has little power (or relevance) in distinguishing between the pore collapse and pore dilation hypotheses of inactivation. Speculation along these lines should be eliminated. Likewise the distinction between pore stability and inactivation is weak and should be toned down.</p><p>The data presented on the perturbation analysis done on positions Thr441 and Thr442 although extremely interesting are not conclusive evidence to rule out “pore stability and selectivity filter from C-type inactivation”. These far-reaching conclusions have not been systematically addressed by the authors. The fact that the authors introduce the mutation on the first subunit of the tandem tetramer and they saw no effect implies that one subunit is not sufficient to affect slow inactivation and it might need more than one, but concluding that we should “conceptually dissociate pore stability and selectivity filter from C-type inactivation” is mere speculation that is not demonstrated in this paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01289.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) …Many of the sample ionic currents involving the</italic> in vivo <italic>nonsense suppression method exhibit double-exponential inactivation kinetics (e.g.,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref> <italic>blue,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2F</italic></xref> <italic>gray, and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2H</italic></xref> <italic>W434F blue).

In this particular case, we believe the reviewers are referring to the small rapid components at the very beginning of the depolarizing pulses. The reviewers are most likely correct in attributing this to imperfect nonsense suppression. Indeed, we often suspect that a small degree of non-specific incorporation of amino acids other than the one ligated to the synthetic tRNA that we inject. Since Trp434 mutations generate extremely rapid inactivation (cooperatively), even a small amount of non-specific incorporation could be sufficient to translate into a rapid component in macroscopic currents. A small rapid component was observed irrespective of the ligated amino acid – the ‘WT rescue’ experiment that introduces Trp by nonsense suppression shows a similar rapid component, and so we think that this property is best attributed to some imperfections of the nonsense suppression. We were unsure of the importance of going into explicit detail about this in the original submission, so we thank both reviewers for highlighting this point.</p><p>We hope to emphasize that this issue does not significantly impact on the interpretation of our results: it is known from other studies as well as ours that 1) amino acids other than Trp induce a rapidly inactivating phenotype, and 2) that the process of slow inactivation is highly cooperative. Therefore, any ‘imperfections’ of the in vivo nonsense suppression method would lead to phenotypes that inactivate faster than WT. As we still observe a significant slowing in the rate of inactivation for F<sub>4</sub>-Trp, the values obtained by us are actually quite likely to serve as an underestimate of the real extent of slowing induced by fluorination of F<sub>4</sub>-Trp. Similarly, we cannot rule out that some of the fast inactivating component of the Ind-containing channels is ‘contaminated’ through non-specific incorporation of amino acids other than Ind. However, the fast component is very small compared to that observed with Ind. Moreover, Ind-containing subunits had to be mixed with WT subunits to obtain ionic currents (which will significantly slow inactivation). Therefore, values obtained through this approach also reflect acceleration induced through incorporation of Ind. We have now explicitly mentioned these limitations of our approach in the Results section, and we hope this will add significant candor and clarity to the text:</p><p>“However, this slowing is preceded by an initial faster inactivating component in the Trp434TAG + Trp trace (gray trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), which may stem from a small degree of nonspecific incorporation of (endogenous) amino acids other than the one ligated to the tRNA (in this case Trp)…”</p><p><italic>Given the double exponential character, it is also unclear how the currents were analyzed to estimate the time constant values plotted in the figures</italic>.</p><p>We have now clarified this by including explicit information on how the data were fit in all figure legends.</p><p>Regarding the specific case of the Trp434Phe concatemers, we did observe varying rates of inactivation in both Trp434Phe and Asp447Glu concatemers, with some being well-fit by a single exponential, while others may have been better fit with multiple time constants. To account for this observation (and to facilitate comparison with other mutants) we had limited the analysis to the first 2 seconds of the depolarization (for the Trp434Phe and Asp447Glu concatemers), and this is now explicitly mentioned in the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Further, and to exclude any bias introduced by this approach, we also used in parallel a ‘time-to-half- maximal-current’ metric as a more generic quantification of inactivation and obtained virtually identical results (shown in Figure 3–figure supplement 3). Finally, we would like to again remark that the molecular basis for the occurrence of multiple time constants during inactivation does not only show up in our data set, but is a generally accepted phenomena that remains ill- defined, significantly complicating the interpretation of potential multi exponential decays.</p><p><italic>Additionally, the manuscript does not report any attempt to separate the entry and recovery rates – this would be important because many of the sample currents shown (e.g.,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D, 2F, 2H</italic></xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref><italic>) suggest that the inactivated state at depolarized test voltages was not an absorbing state and the recovery rate constant value was appreciable (as evidenced by “steady-state” currents in the sample data shown). If the authors really wish to address the stability of the open state (as opposed to the stability of the inactivated state), they may wish to separate them out</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate this comment and realize the merits of separating the entry and recovery rates from inactivation. However, the recovery from inactivation in potassium channels has been recently shown to be a highly complex molecular orchestration that not only involves protein conformational changes, but is also primarily controlled by the water occupancy behind the selectivity filter (Ostmeyer et al., Nature, 2013). We thus believe that it would be beyond the scope of the current study to investigate effects on recovery from inactivation in a detailed manner. Furthermore, while our current data set does not allow to definitively exclude potential effects on recovery from slow inactivation, we believe major effects on recovery are unlikely for the following reason: in the simplified context of a two state model (open-inactivated), a faster recovery rate from inactivation would also be predicted to result in a faster initial decay that would result in an increased steady-state current (compared to WT). These criteria were not met by any of the mutants tested. Only Trp434TAG + F<sub>4</sub>-Trp displayed an increased steady-state current, but the concomitant initial acceleration of inactivation was due to the ‘imperfect’ incorporation of F<sub>4</sub>-Trp (as verified by the ‘imperfect’ incorporation of Trp; see also our above comments), making a major effect on recovery unlikely.</p><p><italic>2) The work has little power (or relevance) in distinguishing between the pore collapse and pore dilation hypotheses of inactivation. Speculation along these lines should be eliminated. Likewise the distinction between pore stability and inactivation is weak and should be toned down</italic>.</p><p><italic>The data presented on the perturbation analysis done on positions Thr441 and Thr442 although extremely interesting are not conclusive evidence to rule out “pore stability and selectivity filter from C-type inactivation”.

Consequently, we have now removed all such conclusions regarding a potential discrimination between pore dilation vs collapse and pore stability vs slow inactivation. Specifically, we have made the following changes to the manuscript:</p><p>The final sentence of the Abstract has now been changed to: “...triggers slow inactivation by means of a local disruption in the selectivity filter...”</p><p>The second-to-last sentence of the Results section (“These data therefore serve to conceptually dissociate the notion of pore stability and selectivity filter from the mechanism of slow inactivation”) has been removed and the final sentence has been changed to:</p><p>“We believe this is an important finding as it demonstrates that severe functional consequences of mutations at the selectivity filter are not necessarily linked to changes in slow inactivation.”</p><p>Finally, we have now changed the final sentence of the second-to-last paragraph of the Discussion section to: “However, although previous studies have suggested evidence for both constriction and dilation of the selectivity filter, the data here is not definitive in distinguishing these models of slow inactivation.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
