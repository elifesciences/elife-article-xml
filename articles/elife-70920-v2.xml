During the interspike intervals, subthreshold slow depolarization underlies autonomous pacemaking and determines its rate. However, the ion channels that determine slow depolarization are unknown. Here we show that TRPC3 and NALCN channels together form sustained inward currents responsible for the slow depolarization of nigral DA neurons. Specific TRPC3 channel blockade completely blocked DA neuron pacemaking, but the pacemaking activity in TRPC3 knock-out (KO) mice was perfectly normal, suggesting the presence of compensating ion channels. Blocking NALCN channels abolished pacemaking in both TRPC3 KO and wild-type mice. The NALCN current and mRNA and protein expression are increased in TRPC3 KO mice, indicating that NALCN compensates for TRPC3 currents. In normal conditions, TRPC3 and NALCN contribute equally to slow depolarization. Therefore, we conclude that TRPC3 and NALCN are two major leak channels that drive robust pacemaking in nigral DA neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopaminergic neurons</kwd><kwd>substantia nigra</kwd><kwd>pacemaker channels</kwd><kwd>pacemaking</kwd><kwd>TRPC3</kwd><kwd>NALCN</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017R1A2B3005656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Myoung Kyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01ES101648</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Birnbaumer</surname><given-names>Lutz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The non-selective Na<sup>+</sup> leak channel (NALCN) and the transient receptor potential 3 channel (TRPC3) cooperate in driving pacemaking in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) are essential for controlling the motivational parts of brain functions such as voluntary movement, action selection, future movement, and reward-based learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grace and Bunney, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schultz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>). Dysfunction of DA neurons is associated with many neuropsychiatric diseases including Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bozzi and Borrelli, 2006</xref>). Midbrain DA neurons are slow pacemakers that continuously generate spontaneous action potentials, consequentially sustaining ambient DA levels in target areas including the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grace et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morikawa and Paladini, 2011</xref>). However, in response to unexpected reward stimuli, DA neurons also produce high-frequency burst discharges that accompany DA surges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schultz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schultz, 2013</xref>). Thus, the intrinsic basal activity of pacemaking is the basis on which DA neurons operate. The rate and regularity of DA neuron pacemaking are robust against many kinds of pharmacological and molecular perturbations including most known specific blockers for classical candidate pacemaker ion channels, such as HCN and voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VACCs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paladini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>). The robustness of pacemaking suggests the necessity and biological importance of basal DA levels and DA signaling in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Surmeier et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, understanding the pacemaking processes of DA neurons is of paramount importance not only for basic physiological knowledge but also for pathological mechanisms useful in therapeutic approaches.</p><p>The ion channels underlying autonomous pacemaking, therefore, have been the subject of investigation for more than three decades. The key feature of DA neuron pacemaking is the subthreshold slow depolarization during interspike intervals that requires a non-voltage-dependent background sodium current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khaliq and Bean, 2010</xref>). At present, the dominant view is that, in SNc DA neurons, robust pacemaking depends on leak-like nonselective cation channels that constitutively open at relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials. So far, the pacemaking of DA neurons is only stopped by SKF-96365 and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), nonspecific blockers for nonselective cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2007</xref>) that are also blockers for transient receptor potential-canonical (TRPC) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nilius and Flockerzi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lievremont et al., 2005</xref>). TRPC channels constitute a group of nonselective cation channels of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily. The TRPC members can be further divided into four subgroups (TRPC1, TRPC2, TRPC4/5, and TRPC3/6/7) and form homotetramers and heterotetramers among TRPCs and other types of TRP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Among several members of the TRPC family, TRPC3 may be a potential candidate for pacemaker channels in DA neurons because of its constitutive voltage-independent activities at very low membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dietrich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Recently, NALCN has been identified as the background Na<sup>+</sup> leak channel that determines resting Na<sup>+</sup> permeability and neuronal excitability in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2007</xref>). There is increasing evidence that NALCN contributes to the resting membrane potentials and endogenous activities in several neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lutas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>). NALCN is a Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable nonselective cation channel and, therefore, can be a strong candidate for pacemaker channels in DA neurons. In the SNc DA neuron of conditional NALCN knockout (KO) mice, spontaneous firing activity was severely decreased in most cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Philippart and Khaliq, 2018</xref>), implying that NALCN may be an essential channel for pacemaking in SNc DA neurons.</p><p>In this study, we use TRPC3 KO mice, specific TRPC3 channel blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiyonaka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schleifer et al., 2012</xref>), and NALCN channel blockers that we recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2020</xref>) to report that TRPC3 and NALCN are two major leak channels essential for robust pacemaking in SNc DA neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Blockade of either nonselective cation channels or TRPC3 channels stops pacemaking of SNc DA neurons</title><p>Endogenous firing activity of SNc DA neurons was measured by whole-cell patch-clamp recording in midbrain slices of TH-eGFP transgenic mice in which DA neurons express eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jang et al., 2015</xref>). The recorded DA neuron was visualized by Alexa-594 dye in patch pipette and/or presented as a 3D reconstructed image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Most SNc DA neurons recorded from midbrain slices exhibited a very regular firing rhythm with an average firing rate of 3.28 ± 0.13 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, n = 17). DA neuron pacemaking can be characterized by slow depolarization during the interspike interval, which is further divided into three phases: I, the initial afterhyperpolarization due to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and SK channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nedergaard et al., 1993</xref>); II, the middle, very long, steady, and slow depolarization; and III, the last accelerated depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Phase II, occupying more than 3/4 of the interspike interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), most clearly denotes slow depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, green dotted line). Slow depolarization is absolutely necessary for pacemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nedergaard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grace and Onn, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ping and Shepard, 1996</xref>) and determines the pacemaking rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A mild and linear slope in the slow depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) implies the presence of small but continuous depolarizing currents during interspike intervals. HCN and VACCs have been at the center of debate in pacemaking mechanisms of DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branch et al., 2014</xref>). Isradipine blocks dihydropyridine (DHP)-sensitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels including Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, a dominant type of VACCs in DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>), and ZD-7288 is an HCN channel blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zolles et al., 2006</xref>). As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>), they do not affect spontaneous firing rate at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), indicating that L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> and HCN channels are not essential for pacemaking. In addition, the co-application of isradipine and ZD-7288 also failed to slow down the spontaneous firing rate in SNc DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), indicating that these two channels have little importance in the pacemaking of DA neurons. Nevertheless, during interspike intervals, isradipine weakly reduced the afterhyperpolarization possibly via reduced SK channel currents by decreasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poetschke et al., 2015</xref>) and slightly reduced the later slow and accelerated depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,G</xref>), collectively resulting in no significant effect on spontaneous firing rate. On the other hand, ZD-7288 increased slightly afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>), but the increase was too small to affect the firing rate. Regarding the pharmacological effects on firing inhibition, we obtained the same results from the cell-attached patch-clamp recordings in the freshly dissociated single SNc DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that our results from the midbrain slices are not related to either incomplete channel antagonism in brain slice experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>) or perturbation of the intracellular milieu by whole-cell pipette solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zolles et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Importance of subthreshold slow depolarization and TRPC3 channels in the pacemaking of SNc DA neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Projection (top) and 3D reconstruction (bottom) images of TH-positive dopamine neurons from SNc slices filled with Alexa-594 and Fluo-4 through a whole-cell patch pipette.

TRPC channels constitute a large and functionally versatile family of nonselective cation channel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gees et al., 2010</xref>).

These channel blockers completely abolished spontaneous firing of DA neurons in the midbrain slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), together with the disappearance of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, which were measured by Fluo-4 in the whole-cell patch pipette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,G</xref>). Double immunofluorescence staining of the midbrain slices containing the SNc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H,I</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapham et al., 2005</xref>) showed that TH-positive DA neurons were mostly overlapped with TRPC3-positive neurons (overlaps = 92%). In addition, single-cell RT-PCR from the isolated SNc DA neurons showed expression of TRPC3 mRNA in all cells examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Taken together, these results raise the possibility that TRPC3 is a nonselective cation channel essential for the pacemaking of SNc DA neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TRPC3 encodes a nonselective cation channel essential for the slow depolarization of SNc DA neurons during interspike intervals</title><p>In SNc DA neurons of midbrain slices, pyr10 eliminated slow depolarization and spontaneous firing completely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>).

In spontaneously firing DA neurons, application of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker, completely suppressed spontaneous action potentials but slow oscillatory potentials (SOPs) survived in a slightly more depolarized state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nedergaard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Estep et al., 2016</xref>). These SOPs are not essential for pacemaking in DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>), but are mediated by cyclic interactions between L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent SK channels within an adequate range of membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ping and Shepard, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wilson and Callaway, 2000</xref>). Consistent with these reports, further treatment with isradipine suppressed SOPs and lowered the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, pyr10 not only suppressed SOPs but also hyperpolarized membrane potentials more strongly than isradipine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), indicating that pyr10-inhibited channels are able to depolarize the membrane potential even in the more hyperpolarized state. After pyr10 hyperpolarized the membrane potential, the total replacement of external Na<sup>+</sup> with equimolar large cation N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) further hyperpolarized the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), at a value similar to that predicted by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation (V<sub>GHK</sub> = –72.57 mV; see Materials and methods details). All these data suggest that TRPC3 substantially contributes to slow depolarization of the membrane potential in DA neurons, but not alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Selective TRPC3 channel antagonism of Pyr10 in SNc DA neurons in WT mice and compensation of TRPC3-induced leak current in TRPC3 KO mice</title><p>To overcome the limitations of pharmacological approaches, we used TRPC3 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in which the recorded SNc DA neurons with the whole-cell patch pipette containing neurobiotin were later confirmed by double immunostaining of TH and streptavidin after the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, neurobiotin, green; TH, red). Surprisingly, the spontaneous firing of DA neurons in TRPC3 KO mice survived, and the spontaneous firing rate did not differ from that of wild-type (WT) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, n = 23, p=0.23). Moreover, we could not find any significant difference in many electrical properties of DA neurons between TRPC3 KO and WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–I</xref>), suggesting that the DA neuron pacemaking is perfectly normal in TRPC3 KO mice. Therefore, we verified whether selective TRPC3 channel blockers work in these mice. Interestingly, in the TRPC3 KO mice, the application of pyr10 did not affect the spontaneous firing rate of DA neurons at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>), whereas pyr10 completely blocked the pacemaking of DA neurons in the WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These data strongly indicate that the inhibitory action of pyr10 on DA neuron pacemaking in WT mice should be mediated by selective TRPC3 channel antagonism. In addition, unlike WT mice, SKF-96365, which blocks all members of TRPC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nilius and Flockerzi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2020</xref>), did not affect the pacemaking rate of DA neurons in TRPC3 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). The same results were obtained from acutely isolated SNc DA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, we next examined whether pyr10 affects the subthreshold membrane potentials of DA neurons in these mice. To measure the membrane potentials more exactly, we pretreated DA neurons with TTX and ZD-7288 to remove interferences from action potential-induced membrane potential fluctuations and hyperpolarization-activated currents by HCN channels, respectively. Under this condition, pyr10 hyperpolarized the membrane potential of DA neurons in WT mice as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, left), but not in TRPC3 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right). When all extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> was replaced by equimolar NMDG after treatment with pyr10, the membrane potential of DA neurons was maximally hyperpolarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). In the absence of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers may activate SK channels by increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>) and then affect the membrane potential that we measured. Therefore, we examined whether the SK channel blocker apamin (100 nM) affects the membrane potential when extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> was replaced with NMDG. However, there was no change in the membrane potentials, suggesting that this was not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data suggest that the sustained inward currents produced by TRPC3 channels must be compensated by other Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable ion channels in TRPC3 KO mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Different effects of TRPC blockers on the pacemaking activities of DA neurons in wild-type and TRPC3 KO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dopamine neurons were identified from SNc slices by post hoc staining (top) for TH (red) and neurobiotin (green) in TRPC3 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice.

However, the neonatal lethality of NALCN KO mice and lack of specific blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lutas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yeh et al., 2017</xref>) have hampered investigation of the potential role of NALCN in the pacemaking of DA neurons. Recently, we have found that N-benzhydryl quinuclidine (NBQN) compounds, including L-703,606, are a potent blocker for NALCN channels without affecting TRPC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we applied L-703,606 to SNc DA neurons in midbrain slices and observed the complete abolition of pacemaking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Under this condition, step-by-step linear current injections by whole-cell patch pipette to the neuron restored regular pacemaking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>), which is similar to in TRPC3 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). When the firing rate was resuscitated to the control level, the voltage traces between the revived firings and those before L-703,606 treatment were completely aligned to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the pacemaking can be completely revived by a leak-like current.

Because DA neurons highly express hyperpolarization-activated HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branch et al., 2014</xref>) and ZD-7288 had little effect on the peak of afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), we questioned whether HCN channels affect pyr10- or L-703,606-induced hyperpolarization of membrane potentials in SNc DA neurons. After silencing SNc DA neurons with TTX treatment, the application of pyr10 or L-703,606 hyperpolarized the membrane potential to the same extent, but the extent of hyperpolarization was not affected by ZD-7288 in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Ironically, when both pyr10 and L-703,606 were co-applied to SNc DA neurons without ZD-7288, the hyperpolarization was similar to those induced by a single treatment with each blocker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). However, in the presence of ZD-7288, the co-application of pyr10 and L-703,606 further hyperpolarized the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that the blockade of these two channels together causes enough hyperpolarization to activate HCN channels in SNc DA neurons. Therefore, HCN channels appear to activate in response to sufficiently significant hyperpolarization of the membrane potential in SNc DA neurons.

Subthreshold slow depolarization during the interspike interval drives pacemaking of SNc DA neurons that basically generates regular spontaneous firing at 2–6 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grace and Bunney, 1984</xref>). SNc DA neurons strongly express TRPC3 and NALCN channels, which constitute a sustained leak-like inward current responsible for slow depolarization in SNc DA neurons. In addition, knocking out TRPC3 channels increases the functionally identical NALCN channels in the subthreshold range of membrane potential and consequently preserves normal pacemaking activity, demonstrating the flexible adaptive nature of the pacemaking in SNc DA neurons. This slow depolarization driven by multiple leak channels provides the reason why DA neuron pacemaking is robust and resistant to many kinds of pharmacological and molecular perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>). This is the first report to uncover molecular identities and properties of leak channels responsible for the pacemaking in SNc DA neurons.</p><p>SNc DA neurons express a variety of K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and NSCCs, and many ion channels and various factors contribute to pacemaking processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gantz et al., 2018</xref>). The voltage-dependent L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and HCN channels have long been the subject of controversy as the major pacemaker channels in SNc DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Surmeier et al., 2012</xref>). The easiest and best way to find the ion channels responsible for pacemaking is to use specific blockers to see whether autonomous spontaneous firing is blocked. However, consistent with the latest report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>), using both the brain slices and acutely dissociated DA neurons we came to the same conclusion that L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and HCN channels are not necessary for the pacemaking of SNc DA neurons. The HCN channels encoded by four genes (HCN1–4) are a hyperpolarization-activated nonselective cation channel and referred to as a pacemaker channel in many cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zolles et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wahl-Schott and Biel, 2009</xref>). They appear to have a wider range of activation and inactivation kinetics depending on the expression types, binding proteins, and many other factors such as several nucleotides and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zolles et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wahl-Schott and Biel, 2009</xref>). Although HCN channels appear to have little participation in the pacemaking of the SNc DN neurons, they can be activated in response to a sudden and/or significant hyperpolarization of membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gantz et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, HCN channels may play a role in stabilizing pacemaking activities upon sudden hyperpolarizing challenges. Regarding VACCs, Cav1.3 channels are known to be expressed abundantly in SNc DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gantz et al., 2018</xref>). The Cav1.3 channel containing α1D subunits can be characterized by low-voltage activation and slowly inactivating Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents, so it seems more ideal for slow depolarization of DA neurons than other members of the Ca<sub>v</sub>1 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu and Lipscombe, 2001</xref>). However, Cav1.3 channels give rise to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>) via Ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes and form a microdomain with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated SK channels in DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolfart et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, SK channels have an opposite effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-mediated depolarization of the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolfart et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, the continuous spontaneous firing of DA neurons itself causes continuous Ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes through many kinds of VACCs, thus the global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> of DN neurons is always fluctuating and significantly higher than that in the TTX-treated silenced state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2003</xref>). SK channels are abundantly expressed in SNc DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolfart et al., 2001</xref>) and can be already in a state of partial activation in such a [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> level of spontaneously firing DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). It is, therefore, very likely that elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> generates repolarizing outward K<sup>+</sup> currents, not only at microdomain levels but even at global levels. For this reason, Na<sup>+</sup> channels seem to be more important than Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels for the pacemaking of SNc DA neurons. In this aspect, the highly Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable NALCN and TRPC3 channels appear to be ideal for driving pacemaking in SNc DN neurons.</p><p>In the midbrain DA neurons, insensitivity or resistance of the pacemaking to the antagonism of many ion channels have led to the multichannel hypothesis that the pacemaking activity results from the sum of activities of many ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Paladini et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the slow depolarization in DA neurons appears to depend on a leak-like conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khaliq and Bean, 2010</xref>). Therefore, many simulation models for DA neuron pacemaking have assumed a considerably large background leak conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuznetsova et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, DA neurons have a very low input resistance ranging from 30 to 300 MΩ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grace and Bunney, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branch et al., 2014</xref>), and large multipolar DA neurons receive several thousands of synaptic inputs throughout the somatodendritic compartment from network neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schultz, 1998</xref>). Therefore, the DA neurons could be not only electrically very leaky but also geometrically unstable in terms of maintaining the homogenous membrane potential throughout the entire somatodendritic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2014</xref>). In such conditions, to generate and maintain a stable and steady rhythm of pacemaking, voltage-dependent or Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels may not be a good choice. Therefore, unlike the classical pacemaker cells, the slow depolarization of DA neurons appears to depend on multiple voltage-independent Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent leak channels, such as TRPC3 and NALCN channels. Although TRPC3 and NALCN channels belong to NSCCs, they primarily conduct Na<sup>+</sup> ions under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cochet-Bissuel et al., 2014</xref>). The main characteristic of these two channels is their constitutive activation at very low membrane potentials and the linearity of the IV relationship in the subthreshold range of the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dietrich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, because blocking one channel stops pacemaking completely, the pacemaking of SNc DA neurons depends on multiple channels in normal conditions. To analyze the relative contributions of TRPC3 and NALCN channels to the subthreshold depolarization, we measured the membrane potential shift from the K<sup>+</sup> equilibrium potential in the presence of TTX and ZD-7288. Given that blocking each of these channels leads to similar changes in the membrane potential shifts, TRPC3 and NALCN channels appear to equally contribute to slow depolarization in DA neurons. Na<sup>+</sup> substitution experiments show that these two channels are responsible for about 66.7% of the subthreshold leak current, but do not cover the entire leak current completely. Still, some other channels are engaged in slow depolarization. Of course, HCN channels can also contribute to depolarization under excessively hyperpolarized conditions. In fact, when these two main channels are blocked completely, HCN channels can participate in the depolarization of the membrane potential in the over-hyperpolarized conditions.</p><p>Although TRPC3 channel blockers completely stop autonomous firing in DA neurons, the pacemaking of DA neurons in TRPC3 KO mice is perfectly normal, indicating compensation by a functionally identical leak channel. In the neural intrinsic excitability, loss of specific ion channels can often be compensated by other channels due to homeostatic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>). Since SNc DA neurons express a variety of ion channels including VACCs, HCN, and TRPC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tozzi et al., 2003</xref>), we initially suspected that Cav1.3 channels, HCN channels, and TRPC channels may compensate the pacemaking in TRPC3 KO mice. However, all these channels do not appear to participate in the compensation of pacemaking in TRPC3 KO mice. In general, since TRPC3, TRPC6, and TRPC7 have similar primary sequences and activation mechanisms and cluster closely on the phylogenic tree, TRPC6 and TRPC7 were prime candidates for compensation of the pacemaking in TRPC3 KO mice. However, although SKF96365 can block all members of TRPC channels, it did not have any effect on spontaneous firing in TRPC3 KO mice. Therefore, other members of the TRPC family do not appear to compensate the pacemaking in TRPC3 KO mice. Consistent with this result, RT-PCR experiments show that mRNAs of all TRPC channels are not increased in TRPC3 KO mice. On the other hand, the Na<sup>+</sup> leak channel NALCN is known to be widely expressed in the brain including DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ren, 2011</xref>) and, therefore, has been suspected as a pacemaker channel in DA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Surmeier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Philippart and Khaliq, 2018</xref>). Very recently, NBQN compounds were found to act as a NALCN channel blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn et al., 2020</xref>). They do not affect TRPC channels but can partially inhibit voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in high concentrations. By taking this advantage, we find that NALCN is not only another important channel for pacemaking in DA neurons, but also compensates for TRPC3 leak currents in TRPC3 KO mice. NALCN and TRPC3 channels have many binding proteins and upstream regulators, including neurotransmitters and hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cochet-Bissuel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amaral and Pozzo-Miller, 2007</xref>). Therefore, the mechanism of pacemaking regulation can play diverse roles in DA neuron functions. Neurons in the diffuse modulatory systems, including DA neurons, receive and send information from and to wide areas of the brain, requiring a homogeneous and steady release of neurotransmitters to the extracellular fluid. Many of them are slow pacemaker neurons and need robust pacemaking. However, it is not yet clear whether TPRC3 and NALCN may play the same role in other slow pacemaker neurons, such as SNc DA neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

Horizontal midbrain slices of 300 μm thickness were obtained with a TPI vibratome 1000 tissue sectioning system (TPI, USA). SNc regions from the slices were dissected out with a scalpel blade and digested with oxygenated high glucose HEPES-buffered saline containing papain (5–8 U/ml, Worthington, USA) for 20–30 min at 37°C. Next, the slice segments were rinsed with enzyme-free HEPES-saline, and then tissues were gently agitated with varying sizes of fire-polished Pasteur pipettes.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This work clearly demonstrates an important role for two specific sodium-permeable ion channels for maintaining the pacemaker-like firing of midbrain dopamine neurons. These neurons have a key role in motivation, reinforcement and locomotion, and have been implicated in Parkinson's disease and multiple neuropsychiatric disorders. The authors also find that the regular firing of these cells is robustly maintained even when one of the two channels is knocked out, through upregulation of the level of the other channel. The authors have added new data and discussion to address concerns of the reviewers.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TRPC3 and NALCN channels drive pacemaking in substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gary Yellen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers felt that this manuscript does an excellent job of clarifying the roles of TRPC3 and NALCN channels in the pacemaking activity of midbrain dopamine neurons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is one point that would be improved with a further experiment. Many experiments in the paper use the 0 Na (NMDG) condition to estimate the maximal effect of Na-conducting channels on the membrane potential; these are not crucial to the main conclusions, but they are a basis for the quantitative estimates of the contributions of different currents. An important concern is that under these conditions, the Na-Ca exchanger will cease to function or will function in the reverse direction from the normal outward pumping of Ca. Particularly in high Ca load cells like the SNc DA neurons, this can lead to very large increases in intracellular Ca. This could alter the membrane potential, particularly by activating SK channels that will hyperpolarize the neurons. This is a possible confound for measuring the contributions of the different inward currents. To learn whether this is a problem, the authors should apply SK blockers to see if the NMDG hyperpolarization is smaller. It might also be advisable to perform Ca imaging (as in Figure 1) to see if the NMDG condition elevates intracellular Ca.</p><p>Other suggestions can be found in the individual reviewer comments below, but are not felt to be critical to support the main conclusions of the paper (Recommendations for the authors).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 2 illustrates that there are multiple ion channels that can contribute to pacemaker activity in the dopamine neurons. Figure 2 shows that with TRPC3 channels blocked pharmacologically, injection of DC current is sufficient to return the neuron to pacemaking spiking with identical time course (at least in the illustrated cell). The same observation (Figure 4) is seen with NALCN channels blocked. Is the identical timecourse of the action potential always observed? A figure quantifying this would emphasize this point, showing the time course of the depolarizing phases and the depth of the AHP for a number of cells.</p><p>2. To explain the data in Figure 6A, showing that addition of the HCN blocker ZD has a strong hyperpolarizing effect when added after blockade of TRPC3 and NALCN channels, the authors suggest that the membrane is now in a range where HCN channels are activated. However, in the panels next to this with either pyr-10 or L-703 alone, the membrane potential is the same as with both blockers, yet ZD has no further effect. The neuron is clearly in the same voltage range – why would ZD have this effect only in the presence of both other blockers?</p><p>3. Can the authors rule out that autocrine activation of D2 receptors is not involved in the apparent effects of these drugs, given that Phillipart and Khaliq demonstrated a strong effect of D2R activation on NALCN currents?</p><p>4. The rationale for using brain slices vs. dissociated cells in particular experiments should be provided. It would be especially nice to see the data in Figure 4E-G in slices from WT vs. TRPC3 KO mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) I suggested providing a more nuanced description of the inhibitors used, in particular Py10, because the evidence for its specificity for TRPC3 is not strong.</p><p>2) The authors should indicate how many mice were used in the recordings in all figure panels.</p><p>3) The authors should make sure that it is clearly indicated in each figure legend which data were obtained from slices and which from acutely dissociated neurons.</p><p>4) The authors should explicitly indicate whether the voltage traces with and without inhibitor (e.g. Figure 1E) were obtained from the same neuron.</p><p>5) I think it could be interesting for readers if the authors provided a brief discussion on the presence of TRPC3 and NALCN channels in human dopaminergic neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are many experiments here that use the 0 Na (NMDG) condition to estimate the maximal effect of Na-conducting channels on the membrane potential; these are not crucial to the main conclusions, but they are a basis for the quantitative estimates of the contributions of different currents.

To examine whether the membrane potential in the extracellular 0 mM Na<sup>+</sup> condition (NMDG substitution) might be affected by SK channels, we applied the SK channel blocker apamin (100 nM) after the complete replacement of Na<sup>+</sup> with NMDG in the presence of TTX (500 nM). As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 4, application of apamin did not affect the membrane potential at all (NMDG-induced hyperpolarization = -71.81 ± 1.53 mV, NMDG and apamin-induced hyperpolarization = -72.50 ± 1.53 mV; p = 0.711, <italic>n</italic> = 7 from 3 mice). In addition, when we measured intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>) simultaneously, Na<sup>+</sup> replacement with NMDG decreased [ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> rather than increased [ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>. These results suggest that Na<sup>+</sup>/ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers in the 0 mM Na<sup>+</sup> condition have little effect on the membrane potentials that we measured. Because Na<sup>+</sup> replacement with NMDG hyperpolarized the membrane potential, it could close many kinds of voltage-activated ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (mainly L-type ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in DA neurons), consequentially decreasing both ca<sup>2+</sup> influxes and [ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>. We added these results as a new Figure 3—figure supplement 4 and added a brief explanation in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>Results section: “When all extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> was replaced by equimolar NMDG after treatment with pyr10, the membrane potential of DA neurons was maximally hyperpolarized (Figures 3E and 3F). In the absence of extracellular Na<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>/ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers may activate SK channels by increasing intracellular ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub>) and then affect the membrane potential that we measured. Therefore, we examined whether the SK channel blocker apamin (100 nM) affects the membrane potential when extracellular Na<sup>+</sup> was replaced with NMDG. However, there was no change in the membrane potentials, suggesting that this was not the case (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). These data suggest that the sustained inward currents produced by TRPC3 channels must be compensated by other Na<sup>+</sup>-permeable ion channels in TRPC3 KO mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Since the slow depolarization during the interspike interval consists of three phases, we measured each duration. In addition, we also compared slopes of the phase II depolarization and AHP values in phase I. However, when the regenerated firing rate was adjusted to the same control level, we cannot find any significant difference between the control and the regenerated action potentials. Therefore, we added two supplementary figures (Figure 2-supplement 1 and Figure 4-supplement 2) in the manuscript:</p><p>Results section: “When the firing rate was resuscitated to the control level, voltage traces of the regenerated slow depolarization and action potential were completely aligned with those before pyr10 treatment (Figure 2A, right bottom; Figure 2-supplement 1), indicating that the channel inhibited by pyr10 could be a leak-like channel. Consistent with these data, the firing rate was gradually increased within the pacemaking range by a slow ramp-like increase in current injection (Figure 2A, right-top), implying that the amount of leak current determines the pacemaking rate in SNc DA neurons.”</p><p>Results section: “When the firing rate was resuscitated to the control level, the voltage traces between the revived firings and those before L-703,606 treatment were completely aligned to each other (Figure 4C, Figure 4-supplement 2), indicating that the pacemaking can be completely revived by a leak-like current.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To explain the data in Figure 6A, showing that addition of the HCN blocker ZD has a strong hyperpolarizing effect when added after blockade of TRPC3 and NALCN channels, the authors suggest that the membrane is now in a range where HCN channels are activated. However, in the panels next to this with either pyr-10 or L-703 alone, the membrane potential is the same as with both blockers, yet ZD has no further effect. The neuron is clearly in the same voltage range – why would ZD have this effect only in the presence of both other blockers?</p></disp-quote><p>HCN channels in SNc DA neurons appear to depolarize the membrane potential in a significantly hyperpolarized condition. Midbrain DA neurons express HCN2-HCN4 subunits and they begin to activate below -50 mV with a half-maximal activation at –65 mV (Zolles et al., Neuron, 2006, 52 (6):1027-1036). In Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, we show that HCN channels are partially and transiently activated in the lowest part of the AHP below -65 mV in the phase I of the interspike interval. However, activation of HCN channels during the interspike interval is so weak that they cannot change normal pacemaking rate of SNc DA neurons. In Figure 6, since we treated TTX and measured the steady-state membrane potential, the action of HCN channels for the membrane potential may differ from its natural dynamic condition. However, it was possible to directly compare TRPC3 and NALCN currents using specific blockers in this particular condition. They appear to act like ‘leak currents’ and have a linear I-V relationship within the subthreshold membrane potential range (thus additive each other as a depolarizing current). Since pyr-10 or L703,606 similarly hyperpolarized the membrane potential, TRPC3 and NALCN currents contribute equally to the depolarization in the subthreshold range of the membrane potential. Blocking only one of them hyperpolarized the membrane potential up to -60 mV, which is insufficient to significantly activate HCN channels (Figure 6A, black traces). However, when both of these channels are inhibited, the membrane potential is hyperpolarized to more than -70 mV, sufficiently activating HCN channels (Figure 6A, red traces). Therefore, ZD-7288 can affect the membrane potential when both other blockers are present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Can the authors rule out that autocrine activation of D2 receptors is not involved in the apparent effects of these drugs, given that Phillipart and Khaliq demonstrated a strong effect of D2R activation on NALCN currents?</p></disp-quote><p>In one of our previous studies (Jang et al., 2011, J Neurochem. 116:966-974,), we reported the functional role of D2 autoreceptors on the regulation of spontaneous firings in acutely dissociated SNc DA neurons. Using the cell-attached patch-clamp technique, application of the D2 antagonist sulpiride did not affect pacemaking in acutely dissociated SNc DA neurons, suggesting that there is no possible autocrine effect of D2 receptors on the pacemaking activity in acutely dissociated DA neurons. Therefore, in this study, many critical experiments about effects of drugs and chemicals had been performed not only in the midbrain slices, but also in acutely dissociated DA neurons (Figure 1-supplement 2, Figure 3-supplement 2, Figure 4-supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The rationale for using brain slices vs. dissociated cells in particular experiments should be provided. It would be especially nice to see the data in Figure 4E-G in slices from WT vs. TRPC3 KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Brain slices have long been used as a standard technique by many electrophysiologists in neuroscience to study a variety of neuronal properties. A major advantage of brain slices compared to acutely dissociated neurons is that experiments can be performed in better physiological conditions due to the maintenance of the intrinsic structural and functional integrity of synaptic connections. Therefore, electrophysiological recordings in brain slices are generally more stable than those in acutely dissociated neurons. However, most neurons reside deep in the slice tissues, making it difficult to achieve precise concentrations of some drugs and chemicals. In particular, many ion channel blockers have to diffuse tens of micrometers into the slice and bind specific sites buried in the lipid bilayer. Therefore, it takes a much longer time and high concentrations of drugs have been often used. In addition, target neurons in the slices may also be connected to nearby active network neurons and receive constant inputs, and perhaps exposed to ambient neurotransmitters and neurohormones. In this aspect, the acutely isolated neurons are free from diffusion problems of drugs and environmental factors including synaptic inputs, neurohormones, and neurotransmitters. It also allows precise control of the concentration of drugs and chemicals on target ion channels. Especially, it is very useful when investigating intrinsic electrical properties (i.e. pacemaking) which depend on the activities of intrinsic ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane. However, the main disadvantage of using acutely dissociated neurons is the difficulty in isolating neurons and the sufficient number of neurons required. Therefore, by performing channel antagonists experiments in both conditions, we were more confidently and clearly able to find two ion channels essential for pacemaking of SNc DA neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) I suggested providing a more nuanced description of the inhibitors used, in particular Py10, because the evidence for its specificity for TRPC3 is not strong.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed some sentences in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“Therefore, we used pyrazole derivatives such as pyr3 and pyr10 to selectively inhibit TRPC3 channels, although pyr10 is reported to partially inhibit TRPC6, too (Kyonaka et al., 2009; Schleifer et al., 2012).

There is also increasing evidence for many pathophysiological roles of TRPC3 (Zhou et al., 2008, J. Neuroscience, Jan 9;28(2):473-82; Ju et al., 2015, Front Physiol.

However, little is known about TRPC3 and NALCN in human DA neurons yet. Nevertheless, we expect that the importance of TRPC3 and NALCN channels in human DA neurons will emerge in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are many experiments here that use the 0 Na (NMDG) condition to estimate the maximal effect of Na-conducting channels on the membrane potential; these are not crucial to the main conclusions, but they are a basis for the quantitative estimates of the contributions of different currents. An important concern about these experiments is that under these conditions, the Na-Ca exchanger will cease to function or will function in the reverse direction from the normal outward pumping of Ca. Particularly in high Ca load cells like the SNc DA neurons, this can lead to very large increases in intracellular Ca. This could alter the membrane potential, particularly by activating SK channels that will hyperpolarize the neurons.</p><p>This is a possible confound for measuring the contributions of the different inward currents. To learn whether this is a problem, the authors should apply SK blockers to see if the NMDG hyperpolarization is smaller. It might also be advisable to perform Ca imaging (as in Figure 1) to see if the NMDG condition elevates intracellular Ca.</p></disp-quote><p>We replied in the above essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>Figure 1C: Presumably the pie chart refers to the durations of the three phases; the legend should say this.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1D: Why is the distribution of firing rates here so different from the typical firing rates in (e.g.) Figure 2B?</p></disp-quote><p>Most SNc dopamine neurons fire regularly at 1-4 Hz in midbrain slices (Chan et al., Nature, 2007, Jun 28;447(7148):1081-6; Guzman et al., J.

However, some SNc DA neurons in slice recording show higher firing rates up to 7 Hz transiently or permanently according to many factors, such as exposed to K<sup>+</sup> internal solution or synaptic excitation, environment, and mice ages (Hage et al., J. Neurosci., 2012, Feb 22;32(8):2714-21; Branch et al., J. Neurosci., 2016, Apr 6;36(14):4026-37). Therefore, in Figure 1D, in order to see the correlation between spontaneous firing rates and phase II slopes, we binned and summed firing rates in a wider range. However, to observe the effects of ion channel blockers on the spontaneous firing rate (requiring a long time for slice recording or acutely isolated neurons), we performed in more stabilized DA neurons regularly firing at 1-4 Hz before we applied ion channel blockers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1G: How are these data normalized (i.e. what is the x-axis)?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1G is an all-point histogram showing the distribution of fluorescence ratio from the trace showing the dendritic ca<sup>2+</sup> level in Figure 1E.
