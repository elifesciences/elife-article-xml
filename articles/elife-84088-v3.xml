This process is well studied in young animals, but little is known about pro-arrhythmic changes in aged animals. Senescent cells accumulate with age and accelerate age-associated diseases. Senescent cells interfere with cardiac function and outcome post-MI with age, but studies have not been performed in larger animals, and the mechanisms are unknown. Specifically, age-associated changes in timecourse of senescence and related changes in inflammation and fibrosis are not well understood. Additionally, the cellular and systemic role of senescence and its inflammatory milieu in influencing arrhythmogenesis with age is not clear, particularly in large animal models with cardiac electrophysiology more similar to humans than previously studied animal models. Here, we investigated the role of senescence in regulating inflammation, fibrosis, and arrhythmogenesis in young and aged infarcted rabbits. Aged rabbits exhibited increased peri-procedural mortality and arrhythmogenic electrophysiological remodeling at the infarct border zone (IBZ) compared to young rabbits. Studies of the aged infarct zone revealed persistent myofibroblast senescence and increased inflammatory signaling over a 12-week timecourse. Senescent IBZ myofibroblasts in aged rabbits appear to be coupled to myocytes, and our computational modeling showed that senescent myofibroblast-cardiomyocyte coupling prolongs action potential duration (APD) and facilitates conduction block permissive of arrhythmias. Aged infarcted human ventricles show levels of senescence consistent with aged rabbits, and senescent myofibroblasts also couple to IBZ myocytes. Our findings suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting senescent cells may mitigate arrhythmias post-MI with age.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardiac arrhythmia</kwd><kwd>sudden cardiac death</kwd><kwd>myocardial infarction</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>New Zealand White Rabbit</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017540</institution-id><institution>NHLBI Division of Intramural Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL139467</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sedivy</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Koren</surname><given-names>Gideon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017540</institution-id><institution>NHLBI Division of Intramural Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R1AG049608-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sedivy</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Koren</surname><given-names>Gideon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>TUBITAK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIDEB 2214A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sengun</surname><given-names>Elif</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T35 HL094308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mi</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ex vivo, in vitro, and computational modeling studies indicate a persistence of myofibroblast senescence in the infarct border zone with age which can disrupt conduction and promote arrhythmias via senescent myofibroblast-cardiomyocyte coupling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide and is responsible for up to 20% of all deaths in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benjamin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deo and Albert, 2012</xref>). The incidence of SCD increases exponentially with age, which poses a growing problem as the portion of the US population 65 years or older is estimated to increase to 15% by 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benjamin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Partridge et al., 2018</xref>). The vast majority of SCDs are caused by ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) subsequent to myocardial infarction (MI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kolettis, 2013</xref>). Immediate clinical reperfusion interventions can limit the extent of acute ischemic injury and acute arrhythmic mortality post-MI, however progressive tissue remodeling in the days-to-years post-MI can establish a substrate and trigger for potentially lethal arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mendonca Costa et al., 2018</xref>). This tissue remodeling process is well described in young animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van den Borne et al., 2010</xref>), but less is known about what changes to this process occur with age and how these changes increase risk of arrhythmia initiation and propagation.</p><p>We have previously characterized the efficacy of the New Zealand White rabbit as a model of the aging human heart. We showed that the aging rabbit heart recapitulates cardiac dysfunctions observed in aging humans, including aortic stiffening, reduced ventricular compliance, increased interstitial fibrosis, abnormal conduction in the His-Purkinje system, and lower thresholds for induced ventricular arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>). We also demonstrated defects in autophagy and mitochondrial function in isolated aged rabbit myocytes resulting in increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species which oxidized the ryanodine receptor and promoted spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cooper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>). To better investigate the interaction between post-MI tissue remodeling and arrhythmogenesis with age, we have established a minimally invasive surgical procedure to reproducibly infarct the rabbit heart regardless of age or variable coronary anatomy, whereby an embolic coil occludes the left coronary artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>). Infarction by this method results in electrophysiological remodeling characteristic of human MI, including functional reentry anchored at the infarct border zone (IBZ), reduction in ejection fraction, and lower thresholds for monomorphic VT induced by programmed stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Ziv et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Cellular senescence is a stress response characterized by irreversible proliferation arrest, resistance to apoptosis, and secretion of a collection of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteases termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rodier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campisi and Robert, 2014</xref>). Transient senescence plays beneficial roles in young animals in wound healing by limiting fibrosis, in tumor suppression, and in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Storer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Demaria et al., 2014</xref>). However, senescent cells accumulate with age in many tissues and accelerate many aging-associated pathologies in a paracrine manner via SASP-mediated chronic inflammatory signaling and/or in a juxtacrine manner via transfer of intracellular proteins to neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Prata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vicente et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burton and Krizhanovsky, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shibamoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kirschner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biran et al., 2015</xref>). Genetic or pharmacological elimination of senescent cells with age slows the onset and progression of many aging pathologies, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, osteoarthritis, and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Childs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim and Kim, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirkland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Deursen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kirkland and Tchkonia, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the adult infarcted wild-type mouse heart, senescent cells arise in the scar and IBZ around day 3 post-MI and are largely cleared by day 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shibamoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). Most of these senescent cells are cardiac myofibroblasts, the main cell type responsible for secreting extracellular matrix components forming the scar. This observation is consistent with epidermal wound studies in mice, suggesting a role for transient myofibroblast senescence as a normal part of the wound healing process in limiting fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Demaria et al., 2014</xref>). Infarction of adult constitutive p53 KO mice, in which senescence induction is impeded, results in increased fibrosis and decreased inflammation in the scar 7 days post-MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>). In a cell culture model of isolated mouse cardiac fibroblasts, senescent cardiac fibroblasts limit the proliferation of non-senescent cardiac fibroblasts in a juxtacrine but not paracrine fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shibamoto et al., 2019</xref>). These results suggest a beneficial role for transient myofibroblast senescence in limiting fibrosis post-MI. Conversely, insights toward a pathological role of chronic cardiac senescence come from aging mouse models of MI. Treatment of aged mice with the senolytic drug navitoclax (i.e. a drug that specifically eliminates senescent cells) before or after MI significantly reduces senescence burden, improves cardiac function, mitigates cardiac remodeling, and reduces scar size post-MI, although the effects on arrhythmias has not been studied to our knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dookun et al., 2020</xref>). These results suggest that acute induction of senescence followed by timely clearance limits excess scarring, but persistence of cardiac senescence as seen with age can promote cardiac fibrogenesis and worsen cardiac function and might lead to increased risk of arrhythmias. Although these findings in mice are important, the mechanisms underlying a relationship between age-associated senescence and arrhythmogenesis is not well understood, particularly in an animal model like the rabbit whose cardiac electrophysiology is more functionally relevant to humans than that of mice.</p><p>Potential pro-arrhythmic effects of senescent cells could occur through a paracrine fashion via SASP components. Indeed, treatment of isolated rat and mouse cardiomyocytes with exogenous SASP components including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α have pro-arrhythmic effects in ion channel remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Francis Stuart et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aromolaran et al., 2018</xref>). Senescent myofibroblasts might be able to interfere with cardiomyocyte electrophysiology from relatively long distances through chronic inflammatory signaling. Alternatively, the direct cell-cell coupling via gap junctions of senescent myofibroblasts to cardiomyocytes at the IBZ might alter their electrophysiology more than coupling with non-senescent myofibroblasts. Such a process would establish regional heterogeneities in ion channel activity, action potential duration (APD), and other electrophysiological factors anchored at the IBZ that would permit reentrant current and therefore VT/VF.</p><p>We hypothesized that aged infarcted rabbits experience a persistence of senescent myofibroblasts in the scar and IBZ compared to young, and that these senescent myofibroblasts act in a paracrine or juxtacrine fashion to induce pro-arrhythmic remodeling in IBZ cardiomyocytes. Here, we demonstrate that aged rabbits compared to young exhibit increased peri-procedural deaths mostly due to VT/VF, consistent with prolongation of APD and alternans at the IBZ associated with higher frequency VF. We observed no difference in the size of the scar or IBZ geometry over the first 12 weeks post-MI between young and aged rabbits. However, whereas senescent cells in the young rabbit scar were largely cleared by 3 weeks post-MI, senescence of mostly myofibroblasts remained high in the aged rabbits up to 12 weeks post-MI and correlated with increased local expression of inflammatory cytokines. In ventricular tissue samples from aged infarcted human patients, we observed elevated levels of senescence markers, and most senescent cells appeared to be myofibroblasts. Using primary adult rabbit cardiac fibroblasts, we induced senescence via treatment with the drug etoposide. With this method, we did not observe any effect of exogenous or co-cultured conditioned media from senescent cardiac fibroblasts on the I<sub>Kr</sub> current or APD of treated rabbit myocytes compared to conditioned media from proliferating cardiac fibroblasts. However, in both aged rabbit and human cardiac tissue, we observed senescent cardiac myofibroblasts in close proximity to IBZ myocytes, with the gap junction protein Cx43 appearing to couple the cells. Previous studies in rabbits have demonstrated a role for Cx43 in the coupling of myocytes and fibroblasts as evidenced by dye transfer and optogenetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Camelliti et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camelliti et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schultz et al., 2019</xref>). Based on our electrophysiological and volumetric measurements of senescent and non-senescent fibroblasts, we performed computational modeling which suggested that coupling of myocytes with senescent cardiac myofibroblasts would result in prolongation of APD and lower thresholds for conduction block. Altogether, our results indicate a pathological role for the persistence of senescent cardiac myofibroblasts in directly exacerbating arrhythmogenesis at least via a direct cell-cell interaction through gap junctions with age post-MI. These findings suggest that targeted elimination of senescent cells post-MI could be an effective therapeutic method to mitigate senescence burden and combat arrhythmias in aged infarcted individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aged infarcted rabbits exhibit increased incidence of peri-procedural arrhythmias</title><p>A total of 73 young (≤1 year) and 99 aged (≥4 years) female New Zealand White rabbits were subjected to minimally invasive coil embolization of the left coronary artery to induce MI of the apical left ventricular free wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The average age for young rabbits was 7.8 months and for aged rabbits was 4.8 years. Aged rabbits exhibited significantly higher peri-procedural mortality compared to young rabbits (36% of aged rabbits versus 19% of young rabbits, p=0.0120), with most young and aged peri-procedural deaths attributed to VT/VF. We observed no significant difference in SCD in the acute (3–72 hr) or chronic (≥72 hr) periods post-MI between young and aged rabbits. Aged rabbits exhibited a significantly higher incidence of peri-procedural lethal or nonlethal VT/VF (44% of aged rabbits versus 23% of young rabbits, p=0.0040) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Kaplan-Meyer analysis shows aged rabbits had a significantly decreased overall survival post-MI compared to young (p=0.0285), and all mortality of young and aged rabbits occurred within the first 48 hr post-MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Of rabbits that initiated peri-procedural VT/VF, we did not find any significant difference in the number or success rate of defibrillation attempts to restore sinus rhythm (p=0.38 and p=0.54, respectively, data not shown). Overall, our findings indicate the aged rabbit heart is more susceptible to acute, potentially lethal ischemic arrhythmias compared to young rabbits.

However, the cellular mechanisms underlying age-associated differences in post-MI tissue remodeling and their arrhythmogenic consequences are not well understood. We previously demonstrated that coil embolization of the young and aged rabbit left coronary artery resulted in similar scar size 3 weeks post-MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we further investigated potential age-associated changes in the dynamics of scar size, shape, and fibrosis throughout a 12-week timecourse post-MI.

We found no significant difference in the percent infarcted area of the left ventricle between young and aged rabbits at any timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We then compared the functional area of the IBZ between young and aged infarcted rabbits as represented by protrusions of the scar into the surviving myocardia, since IBZ geometry can affect regional heterogeneities in conduction velocity and APD. We utilized hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained frozen left ventricle sections from young and aged infarcted rabbit hearts, laid flat along the circumferential-longitudinal plane prior to freezing. To better characterize the 3D structure of the IBZ from each heart, at least five slides over at least a 500 μm endocardial-to-epicardial span per rabbit were analyzed. We found no significant difference in either the number or length of protrusions between young and aged rabbits at any timepoint post-MI or over time for each age group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To assess potential age-associated changes in fibrosis post-MI, we analyzed frozen left ventricular sections stained with Masson’s trichrome.

Compared to young rabbits, aged rabbits exhibited greater APD heterogeneity along the IBZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In both young and aged rabbits, conduction velocity was significantly slower in the IBZ compared to the RZ (0.32±0.10 m/s in IBZ and 0.96±0.30 m/s in RZ of aged hearts, 0.37±0.05 m/s in IBZ and 0.90±0.13 m/s in RZ of young hearts), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mendonca Costa et al., 2018</xref>). We observed that the IBZ of aged rabbit hearts can support spatially discordant APD alternans at relatively slow heart rates, which has been associated with an increased risk for arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). These results were not observed in the young hearts under the same conditions. To further study age-associated changes in arrhythmogenic substrate, we induced VF by burst electrical stimulations. Representative VF traces and VF frequency maps are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Aged rabbits exhibited significantly higher dominant VF frequency compared to young, which may be related to the underlying complexity of arrhythmia. Additionally, the aged rabbit hearts displayed greater spatial variation of VF frequencies across the RZ compared to young, whereas in young rabbits slower-frequency regions tended to cluster near the IBZ. Altogether, these findings suggest that age-associated changes in electrical remodeling 3 weeks post-MI increased the heterogeneity of rate-dependent APD dynamic properties between the IBZ and RZ, notably the prolongation in APD in the IBZ of aged rabbits, which demonstrates a more arrhythmogenic substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Senescence of myofibroblasts is elevated and persistent in the aged rabbit heart post-MI and correlates with increased inflammation</title><p>To investigate potential cellular mechanisms underlying the increase in arrhythmogenic substrate in aged infarcted rabbits, we next investigated the dynamics of cellular senescence in young and aged rabbit hearts over time post-MI. Whereas in the proliferative phase post-MI, the scar is rich with myofibroblasts secreting ECM components, in the maturation phase, the fibrogenic activity of myofibroblasts is resolved at least partially via induction of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kanisicak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prabhu and Frangogiannis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jun and Lau, 2018</xref>). To interrogate the dynamics of senescence in young and aged infarcted rabbit hearts, we first performed senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining of frozen left ventricular sections from young and aged rabbits over the first 12 weeks post-MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). In the aged rabbit scar, the percent of SA-β-gal+ cells in the scar remained elevated over time even at 12 weeks post-MI.

In the IBZ, the same trend was observed in young and aged rabbits but did not reach statistical significance. The young and aged rabbit RZ displayed relatively very few SA-β-gal+ cells. These RZ data are consistent with our previous assessments of baseline levels of senescence in the non-infarcted young and aged rabbit myocardia, in which we observed similarly low levels of SA-β-gal (not shown). To determine if the observed age-associated difference in senescence could be explained as an artifact of the MI procedure, we compared SA-β-gal histology between young and aged rabbits 2 weeks after sham infarction, a timepoint at which SA-β-gal signal was elevated in the young and aged infarcted rabbit scar.

To account for transient DNA damage in otherwise healthy cells represented by low numbers of γH2AX nuclear foci, only nuclei exhibiting three or more γH2AX foci were scored as γH2AX positive (‘γH2AX+)’. These results corroborated our SA-β-gal data as the percent of γH2AX+ nuclei in the aged rabbits remained elevated over time, whereas the percent of γH2AX+ nuclei in the young rabbit scar was resolved by 3 weeks post-MI, resulting in significant increases in the percent of γH2AX+ nuclei at 3 and 12 weeks post-MI in aged rabbits compared to young (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Specifically, in aged rabbits 12 weeks post-MI, we observed 9.9 ± 3% of cells were γH2AX whereas in young rabbits 12 weeks post-MI, only 0.6 ± 0.2% of cells were γH2AX+. From our αSMA immunostaining, in both the aged and young rabbit scar, we observed initially high percentages of αSMA+ cells followed by a decline over time post-MI with no significant difference between young and aged at any timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, left). At 2 weeks post-MI, 39.5 ± 17.5% of cells were αSMA+ in aged rabbits and 36.5 ± 8.1% of cells were αSMA+ in young rabbits. This observation is consistent with previous mouse genetic lineage tracing reports showing fibroblasts that became myofibroblasts remained in the scar but lost αSMA expression by 2 weeks post-MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). From our double immunofluorescence staining, we observed that the majority of γH2AX+ cells were αSMA+ at 1 week post-MI in aged and young rabbits, consistent with the high levels of αSMA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, right). Interestingly, although at 2 weeks post-MI we observed an ~50% decrease in the percent of αSMA+ cells, we observed that ~80% of γH2AX+ cells were αSMA+, indicating a propensity toward senescence of myofibroblasts. Specifically, at 2 weeks post-MI, 66.9 ± 34.3% of γH2AX+ cells were αSMA+ in aged rabbits, and 66.2 ± 45.0% of γH2AX+ cells were αSMA+ in young rabbits. At 3 and 12 weeks post-MI, relatively few γH2AX+ cells were αSMA+, consistent with the decrease in αSMA signal. We observed no significant differences in the percent of γH2AX+ cells that were αSMA+ between young and aged at any timepoint. From our analysis of CD31 immunofluorescence staining, we observed that relatively few cells (~10–20%) were CD31+ at all timepoints with no significant difference between young and aged rabbits at any timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, left), consistent with previous studies of cell composition post-MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pinto et al., 2016</xref>). At the 2 week post-MI timepoint, 12.1 ± 7.2% of cells were CD31+ in aged rabbits and 15.8 ± 11.0% of cells were CD31+ in young rabbits. Similarly, we observed that relatively few γH2AX+ cells were CD31+ across all timepoints with no significant difference between young and aged rabbits at any timepoint, suggesting endothelial cells make up a minor percentage of senescent cells present in the scar post-MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, right). Two-weeks post-MI, we observed 21.0 ± 20.1% of γH2AX+ cells were CD31+ in aged rabbits and 2.3 ± 4.5% of γH2AX+ cells were CD31+. These findings suggest that myofibroblasts make up the majority of persistent senescent cells in the scar of young and aged rabbits.</p><p>We next assessed the expression of senescence and SASP transcripts from flash-frozen dissections of the scar, IBZ, and RZ of young and aged rabbits at 3 weeks post-MI, a timepoint at which significant differences in senescence were observed between young and aged rabbits. In the aged scar compared to the young scar, we observed a significant upregulation in the expression of all three assayed senescence genes (p16, p21, and p53), as well as the SASP components CXCL2, and TIMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). For both young and aged rabbits, in the scar compared to their respective RZ, the expression of nearly all assayed senescence and SASP genes was significantly upregulated, except IL-6, MMP9, and TIMP1 for aged rabbits and CXCL2 for young rabbits. In the aged IBZ compared to the young IBZ, we found a significant upregulation in the expression of p16 and p53, as well as a significant decrease in the expression of IL-6 and CCL2. Conversely, in the young and aged IBZ relative to their respective RZ, only p16, p21, and TIMP2 were expressed significantly higher in aged and only p16 and TIMP2 were expressed significantly higher in young. In the aged RZ compared to the young RZ, we found a significant increase in the expression of p16 and p21, with no significant decrease in expression of any genes. Overall, our data indicate at 3 weeks post-MI, expression of many senescence and SASP factors is upregulated in the aged scar and IBZ compared to young rabbits, consistent with our histological senescence data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Presence of senescent myofibroblasts in aged infarcted human ventricular tissue</title><p>To investigate whether the observed elevation and persistence of senescence in the aged rabbit scar is recapitulated in humans, we quantified and characterized senescence in left ventricular cadaveric tissue samples from four aged male human patients with prior MI.

Representative SA-β-gal and Masson’s trichrome-stained frozen sections are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Because very little SA-β-gal signal was observed, likely due to loss of β-galactosidase enzymatic activity in the interval between the initial tissue harvest, the flash freezing of tissue, and embedding in OCT, we investigated γH2AX foci by immunofluorescence to quantify senescence. We performed immunofluorescence staining for γH2AX, αSMA, the endothelial cell marker vWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pusztaszeri et al., 2006</xref>), and the macrophage marker CD68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holness and Simmons, 1993</xref>) in the scar.

From our double immunofluorescence staining, we observed an average of 69 ± 28% of γH2AX+ cells were αSMA+, 20 ± 25% of γH2AX+ cells were vWF+, and 41 ± 17% of γH2AX+ cells were CD68+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, our analysis of the human scar reveals comparable levels of cellular senescence with that seen in the aged rabbits at 3 and 12 weeks post-MI, with around 60% of senescent cells appearing to be myofibroblasts, similar to observations in the rabbit heart.

To test this hypothesis, we employed an in vitro model using 3-week-old rabbit cardiomyocytes and adult rabbit cardiac myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kabakov et al., 2021</xref>). Acutely dissociated cardiomyocytes from 3-week-old rabbits were treated for 30 min with conditioned media collected from adult rabbit cardiac fibroblasts treated for 12 days with either vehicle (‘proliferating-CM’) or 20 μM etoposide (‘SASP-CM’), followed by patch clamping of the myocytes. We measured I<sub>Kr</sub>, the main potassium currents regulating repolarization and APD in these cells, in voltage clamp mode. The holding potential was –40 mV. Three seconds depolarizing voltage steps were applied from –30 mV to 40 mV in 10 mV intervals. Experiments were done before and after addition of 5 µM E4031, a specific blocker of I<sub>Kr</sub>.

Modeling the CL of the S2 beat at which AP failure occurred at variable values for myocyte Na channel conductance (gNa, normal = 12 mS/μF) and fibroblast capacitance (Cm<sub>CF</sub>) revealed a slight decrease in the CL at onset of AP failure with increasing gNa values and an increase in the CL at onset of AP failure with increasing Cm<sub>CF</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, left). At our extrapolated capacitance values for the young and aged conditions, AP failure occurs at greater CL values under aged conditions compared to young. Representative modeled AP traces for young and aged simulations during S1S2 protocol are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, left. We also modeled the occurrence of AP failure with varying myocyte inward rectifier channel conductance (gK1, normal ~0.30 mS/μF) values and myofibroblast capacitance values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, right). Compared to our modeling of various gNa values, we observed a steeper relation of increasing gK1 values to decreasing CL values at onset of AP failure for a given capacitance value.

Additionally, our findings suggest that senescent myofibroblasts in the IBZ may be exerting pro-arrhythmic effects on surviving myocytes in a cell-cell interaction mediated by myocyte-fibroblast coupling via gap junctions. We propose that persistence of senescent myofibroblasts is a major driver of arrhythmogenic tissue remodeling with age post-MI, and that the timely pharmacological elimination of senescent cells might alleviate risk of arrhythmias particularly in elderly infarcted patients.</p><p>From our MI surgical procedures, we observed significantly increased mortality of aged rabbits mostly due to peri-procedural VT/VF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The reason for this increase in peri-procedural mortality with age is likely related to our previous observations of increased interstitial fibrosis, disorganization of the His-Purkinje system, and altered myocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling with age in non-infarcted aged rabbits, in that these age-associated changes likely increase peri-procedural mortality by lowering the threshold for arrhythmias triggered by the acute ischemic insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Terentyev et al., 2014</xref>). Based on our previous observations showing low levels of senescence in non-infarcted young and aged rabbits (not shown), we posit that senescence likely does not play a role in peri-procedural arrhythmias.</p><p>The anatomical characteristics of the scar, including scar size, functional IBZ area, and dense and interstitial fibrosis, could influence age-associated differences in arrhythmogenesis. However, the fact that we did not observe any significant difference in the timecourse of scar size, IBZ area, and overall or interstitial fibrosis suggests that age-associated changes in other cellular processes, including cellular senescence, are driving the increase arrhythmogenicity that we observe from optical mapping studies. Our findings of overall scar size are consistent with our previous study showing 30% infarcted area of the left ventricle from our MI surgical procedure, and the present data suggest no epicardial infarct expansion occurs over time in young or aged rabbits. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Electrophysiological remodeling at the IBZ includes separation of myocyte bundles via interstitial and replacement fibrosis and significant disruptions of APD and reductions in conduction velocity, myocyte-myocyte coupling, and anisotropy ultimately permitting unidirectional conduction block, sustained reentry, and subsequent VT/VF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kolettis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rutherford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Di Diego and Antzelevitch, 2011</xref>). Although these changes are well characterized in young animal models, we sought to investigate age-associated changes in these processes and their underlying mechanisms. From our optical mapping studies, we observed aged rabbit hearts 3 weeks post-MI exhibited more extreme arrhythmogenic remodeling at the IBZ compared to young, including relative prolongation of APD as compared to the RZ, spatially discordant alternans near the IBZ at relatively slow heart rate, and higher frequency of sustained spontaneous VF following burst pacing. These pathological characteristics indicate that aged rabbits undergo remodeling at the IBZ differently than young animals, culminating in a stronger substrate for arrhythmias anchored at the IBZ. Specifically, prolonged APD near the IBZ has been shown to facilitate a reentrant circuit around the scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campos et al., 2019</xref>). Meanwhile, in young rabbits, the significantly shorter APD at the IBZ compared to the RZ and scar can also induce and maintain arrhythmia through increasing APD dispersion and AP conduction block. This finding of shortened APD in the border zone of young rabbits is consistent with previous data using relatively young Yucatan minipigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hegyi et al., 2018</xref>). However, young infarcted rabbits experience less arrhythmias than aged infarcted rabbits, as indicated by the lack of observed voltage alternans at slow heart rate and slower VF frequency. The observation of similarly slower conduction velocity at the IBZ relative to the RZ in both young and aged rabbits is consistent with our histological observations showing no difference in the number or length of IBZ protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>The accumulation of senescent cells in many tissues has been shown to exacerbate age-associated pathologies via paracrine or juxtacrine mechanisms. Studies in mice have demonstrated increased senescence in the scar post-MI with age, the pharmacological clearance of which limits scar size and improves cardiac function and outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Walaszczyk et al., 2019</xref>). However, little is known about whether these findings translate to large animal models with more electrophysiological relevance to the human heart, or the mechanisms through which senescent cells might promote arrhythmogenesis in the aged infarcted heart. Here, we show that cellular senescence as measured by SA-β-gal and γH2AX staining between young and aged rabbits is similar for the first 2 weeks post-MI but persists in aged rabbits at 3 and up to 12 weeks post-MI in the scar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>) and is associated with higher local expression of inflammatory SASP factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Consistent with previous findings from our group and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>), we found very few SA-β-gal-positive cells in the RZ of young or aged rabbits. These data, along with our previous results assessing young and aged non-infarcted rabbits, suggest a low baseline of senescence in the normal young and aged rabbit heart which is reasonable considering the relatively low proliferation of myocardial cells under baseline conditions. The similarly low levels of SA-β-gal in young and aged rabbits 2 weeks post-sham infarction indicate that the age-associated significant difference in senescence post-MI was not an artifact of the MI procedure. Additionally, we did not observe any evidence of senescent cardiomyocytes in young or aged rabbits at any timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom) as well as from human ventricular tissues samples from SA-β-gal staining, which differs from previous reports of mouse tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). This important observation suggests that the rabbit heart could be a more appropriate animal model than the mouse to study the effects of cardiac aging relevant to humans. Interestingly, we observed no difference in either total fibrosis of the LV free wall or interstitial fibrosis over time between young and aged rabbits even though we observed persistence of senescence in the aged rabbit heart over time compared to young. It is well known that the content of the SASP changes over time and depending on cell type and the induction source, and so it is possible that pro-fibrotic and anti-fibrotic SASP factors are present in functionally equivalent amounts ultimately resulting in no difference in fibrosis. This hypothesis is supported by our RT-qPCR data, indicating upregulation in expression of the pro-fibrotic factors TGF-β, TIMP1, and TIMP2 as well as anti-fibrotic factor MMP9. Further investigation into this hypothesis is warranted.</p><p>From our immunofluorescence staining, the high degree of αSMA signal in young and aged rabbits at 1 and 2 weeks post-MI and the subsequent decrease in αSMA signal is consistent with genetic lineage tracing studies in mice which suggest that myofibroblasts remain present in the scar but lose αSMA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Our observation that the percent of γH2AX+ cells that are αSMA+ remains high at 2 weeks post-MI when αSMA signal begins to decline suggests that most of the senescent cells present in the scar are αSMA+ myofibroblasts that lose αSMA expression after 2 weeks post-MI. This observation is consistent with previous studies characterizing the identity of senescent cells in the scar post-MI in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Meyer et al., 2016</xref>). The relatively lower percent of CD31+ cells at any timepoint between young and aged rabbits is consistent with previous reports of cellular composition in the scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pinto et al., 2016</xref>). The small percent of γH2AX+ foci that were CD31+ reinforces our conclusion that myofibroblasts are the majority of cells undergoing senescence in the young and aged heart post-MI.</p><p>Our RT-qPCR data of young and aged rabbits 3 weeks post-MI further demonstrates differences between the senescence profiles of the aged rabbit and the aged mouse. Consistent with our SA-β-gal and γH2AX data, we observed an increase in the expression of p16, p21, and p53 in aged rabbits compared to young. However, the only SASP factors for which we measured a significant change in expression in the scar zone between young and aged were CXCL2 and TIMP2, whereas the contents of the cardiac SASP were largely different between young and aged mice (albeit with a non-canonical SASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). Given these results, special attention should be placed on conclusions for the relevance of senescence studies performed in mice in regard to their clinical relevance for humans. Similar to our SA-β-gal data, we observed a similar but lower magnitude of changes in overall expression between the young and aged rabbit IBZ, and no differences in senescence and SASP gene expression between the young and aged RZ. The significant decrease in IL-6 expression in the aged IBZ compared to young IBZ is interesting, however senescence and SASP signatures are known to be variable depending on cell line and senescence induction method, and this decrease in IL-6 expression has also been observed in studies of young and aged non-infarcted murine myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). Overall, our data suggest that senescence and the inflammatory SASP is largely confined to the scar.</p><p>To investigate the clinical relevance of our observations of persistent senescence in the aged infarcted rabbit heart, we measured senescence in aged infarcted human ventricular frozen sections. We observed a relatively high percent of cells in the scar exhibited nuclei with three or more γH2AX foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating the presence of senescent cells in the human tissue, which may contribute to arrhythmogenic tissue remodeling leading to increased incidence of potentially lethal arrhythmias in the chronic phase post-MI. These γH2AX senescence data are similar to what we observed in the aged rabbit 12 weeks post-MI. From our αSMA analysis of human tissue, we observed a high percent of cells were αSMA+ unlike the progressive decrease in αSMA+ cells over time that we observed in the young and aged rabbits. Because the specific timing of MI is difficult to diagnose especially out-of-hospital, we are unable to ascertain how long post-MI the samples were at time of death. If senescent cells indeed persist in the aged human scar as we hypothesize, it is possible that growth factors like TGF-β in the chronic SASP activate fibroblasts in the months-to-years post-MI. Alternatively, the content of the SASP could differ from what we observe in rabbits, contributing to differential activation of myofibroblasts. Similar to our observations in young and aged rabbits, our γH2AX and αSMA double immunofluorescence assays indicate that the majority of cells with three or more γH2AX nuclear foci were also αSMA+, further suggesting that myofibroblasts are the predominant cell type undergoing senescence. Relatively fewer cells with three or more γH2AX nuclear foci were either vWF+ or CD68+, consistent with previous reports in mice, suggesting relatively fewer senescent cells are endothelial cells or macrophages, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To better study the mechanisms by which senescence might be promoting arrhythmias with age post-MI, we established an in vitro method to induce senescence in adult rabbit cardiac fibroblasts. Low doses of the drug etoposide induced senescence, measured by SA-β-gal and γH2AX staining as well as RT-qPCR in a time-depending manner, with the vast majority of cells positive for senescence markers after 12 days of treatment with 20 μM etoposide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These data establish a platform to future studies screening the efficacy of senolytic drugs to eliminate senescent cells post-MI.</p><p>To investigate whether senescent cells might have a paracrine effect on myocytes, we treated primary isolated myocytes from 3-week-old rabbits with conditioned media harvested from proliferating (proliferating-CM) or senescent (SASP-CM) fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). From our patch clamping studies, we observed no significant difference in I<sub>Kr</sub> current or in APD between proliferating-CM or SASP-CM groups. Separately, we co-cultured isolated myocytes with proliferating or senescent cardiac fibroblasts for longer durations and also found no significant difference in I<sub>Kr</sub> or APD. These findings suggest that senescent rabbit fibroblasts likely do not act in a paracrine manner to disrupt the electrophysiology of rabbit myocytes, but further study is needed to verify this. Because we are limited by the number of commercially available assays to determine the specific contents of the rabbit SASP, we are unable to exclude the possibility that the conditioned media lacked physiologically relevant levels of SASP factors to induce a significant effect. Besides, components in the media used or the absence thereof might have blunted a paracrine effect. One could also envisage that degradation of conditioned media occurred between harvest and treatment, as well as potential issues with incubation period and responsiveness of the 3-week-old myocytes to the SASP. Additionally, transfer of the cells from the conditioned media to the patch clamping media might have allowed for rapid recovery of the cardiomyocytes prior to patch clamp recording, which would not be detectable from the data presented.</p><p>We next investigated whether senescent fibroblasts might directly couple with myocytes at the IBZ to influence pathological electrophysiological remodeling. Homo- and hetero-typic coupling occurs in the healthy and diseased heart via connexins, including Cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kohl and Gourdie, 2014</xref>). We observed a significantly higher percentage of senescent cells neighboring IBZ myocytes in aged rabbits 3 weeks post-MI compared to young. Our immunofluorescence studies suggest that Cx43 facilitates homocellular coupling between senescent adult rabbit cardiac fibroblasts, as well as heterocellular coupling between senescent myofibroblasts and myocytes at the IBZ of aged rabbits and human frozen sections.</p><p>Our computational modeling of proliferating and senescent myofibroblasts as well as simulations of cardiomyocyte-myofibroblast interactions in young and aged tissue shed critical light for explaining mechanisms by which senescent myofibroblasts might promote arrhythmogenic tissue remodeling with age post-MI. Although electrical remodeling in the IBZ is a complex phenomenon with multiple contributing factors, our results indicate that myocyte-fibroblast interaction becomes a potential contributor to arrhythmogenesis in the aged MI condition. A large, flattened morphology is one of the hallmark characteristics of senescent cells in other models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuilman et al., 2010</xref>), and we observed this for cardiac myofibroblasts both in vitro and in vivo. The larger size of senescent myofibroblasts likely explains the greater extrapolated values for in vivo capacitance, and all differences in modeling between proliferating and senescent myofibroblasts are driven by the larger capacitance of senescent myofibroblasts. Importantly, the prolongation in APD from our modeling of aged condition relative to young is consistent with our optical mapping findings from young and aged rabbits 3 weeks post-MI and validates the relevance of our modeling. From our S1S2 modeling under young and aged conditions, we would predict that aged rabbits would have higher risks for conduction block than young rabbits. Although we did not observe a significant difference in the CL at which VF was induced, VF frequencies were higher and heterogeneous in the IBZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that the prolongation of APD in myocytes coupled to senescent myofibroblasts would result in lower threshold for conduction block and wavebreak, overall driving faster VF frequency. These observations are consistent with our hypothesis that myocyte coupling to senescent myofibroblasts in the IBZ of aged rabbits leads to pro-arrhythmic electrophysiological remodeling and increases risk of reentrant current anchored to the IBZ.</p><p>In summary, we have characterized an age-associated accumulation of senescent myofibroblasts in the aged infarcted rabbit heart, and our findings suggest that these senescent cells remodel the electrophysiology of IBZ myocytes at least via direct myocyte-fibroblast coupling mediated by Cx43, which would increase risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Previous studies have shown that pharmacological elimination of senescent cells with age via the senolytic drug navitoclax limits cardiac fibrosis in infarcted and non-infarcted mice and improves the survival and cardiac function of infarcted young and aged mice, but little is known about the effects of senescence on arrhythmogenesis with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Walaszczyk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings demonstrate an important role of persistent senescence in arrhythmogenesis with age post-MI, suggesting the use of senolytic therapy to mitigate senescence burden with age might be promising strategy to mitigate chronic arrhythmias in aged infarcted individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal ethical statement</title><p>This investigation conformed with the current Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication, Revised 2011) as well as the standards recently delineated by the American Physiological Society (‘Guiding Principles for Research Involving Animals and Human Beings’) and was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rhode Island Hospital (Permits numbers 5001-21 and 5040-22).

AP recordings were analyzed with a Python (Python Software Foundation, Beverton, OR, USA) software script written in the lab. The APD was measured from the time of maximum slope during the rising phase of the AP to either 50% or 90% repolarization from the peak amplitude. For APD statistics and plotting, Origin 2019 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA) was used. IKr and Ito currents were recorded from ventricular cardiomyocytes by whole-cell patch clamp with an Axopatch-200B amplifier at 34–36°C. The pipette solution contained (in mM): 130 KCl, 10 NaCl, 0.36 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 5 HEPES, 5 glucose, 5 Mg-ATP, 5 Tris-phosphocreatine, 0.25 Tris-GTP (pH 7.3 with KOH).

The protocol for IKr recordings was a 3 s voltage step protocol (40 to –30 mV, 10 mV intervals) from a holding potential of –40 mV. The IKr protocol was recorded before and after adding 5 mM E4031. The peak E4031 sensitive tail currents were analyzed. Ito was recorded in the presence of E4031 with a 500 ms voltage step protocol (50 mV to –50 mV, 10 mV intervals) from a holding potential of –70 mV.

The current amplitudes were measured relative to the tail of the current at the end of the voltage step to minimize the inclusion of leak current. The resulting normalized current-voltage relation was plotted for proliferating and senescent fibroblasts and each fit with a Boltzmann equation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). The Boltzmann curves were shifted to bring the reversal potential to the resting potentials recorded with sharp intracellular electrodes. The resulting equations were used to model the proliferating and senescent fibroblast currents with the addition of gPro and gSen conductance constants multiplied by the equations to allow adjustment of the current amplitude. To calculate the extrapolated capacitance for the proliferating and senescent myofibroblasts used in the model, the surface area was calculated from the mean volumes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> assuming spherical cells. Then we calculated the ratio of a single fibroblast surface area in tissue to a single fibroblast surface area in culture for proliferating and senescent cells. These ratios were used to scale the capacitance values measured by whole-cell patch clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) to ‘tissue’ capacitance values. Since the measured capacitance was similar in proliferating and senescent fibroblasts (probably due to the normalization of cell size with trypsin treatment on the day of recording), we used the tissue-extrapolated capacitance value for proliferating cells and then multiplied that by 1.95, the ratio of senescent to proliferating fibroblast surface area in tissue. The gap junction conductance was set to 20 nS. Numerical calculation of the different equations in the model was performed by the Euler method with an adaptive time step of t=0.05–5 μs. The simulations to investigate the effect of coupling senescent myofibroblasts to ventricular myocytes were carried out with double precision on a Nvidia Tesla K40 multicore graphic processing unit using the CUDA toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone">https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Paul Delgado Olguin (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Both reviewers have responded positively to the overall science. Reviewer 1 considers that you have presented important results and convincing evidence linking myofibroblast senescence in the aged heart with a pro-arrhythmogenic phenotype and higher mortality after myocardial infarction in the aged rabbit heart. He/she does comment that the evidence supporting the contention that senescent myofibroblasts promote arrhythmia when coupled with cardiomyocytes is incomplete and would benefit from experimentally testing the in-silico model. He also comments that stronger evidence of coupling of myofibroblasts and cardiomyocytes linked to arrhythmia would raise interest from basic and clinician scientists studying cardiac function and disease. Reviewer 2's comments are of a more technical and presentational nature.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers make the following scientific comments which we would request you address:</p><p>Reviewer 1's comments concern the detailed interpretation of the results:</p><p>1) The cells in Figure 4F and G, do not appear to correspond to either myofibroblasts or endothelial cells. Given that γH2AX+ cells are significantly increased in the aged heart, could the results presented suggest that a different cell type might be more important for the aged heart's response to MI? Providing some insight into the identity of these cells would be helpful to better understand the results presented. For example, cardiomyocyte senescence could contribute to arrhythmic phenotypes.</p><p>2) The results presented show that treatment of cardiomyocytes with conditioned media from, and co-cultured with, senescent myofibroblasts did not change action potential duration in cardiomyocytes. This led to the conclusion that paracrine signalling is unlikely to contribute to a pro-arrhythmogenic phenotype. It is possible that cardiomyocytes do couple with myofibroblasts in the in vitro system used. In which case, the results presented would not favor the proposed model.</p><p>3) Another important possibility to be considered is that myofibroblasts might not have produced senescence-associated secretory phenotype-mediators at concentrations high enough to alter action potential duration in the conditions tested. Experimental evidence of the levels of selected mediators of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in conditioned media would help assess a potential paracrine effect.</p><p>4) The evidence of coupling, i.e., the presence of connexin-43 in the interphase between αSMA+ and cardiomyocytes needs to be strengthened. Perhaps analyzing Z-stack 3D reconstructions would help to better define adjacent cells and more precisely reveal the localization of connexin-43.</p><p>Reviewer 2 has more technical issues to raise:</p><p>1) Some reflection on the media used to study paracrine effects is needed – more experiments here would be beneficial.</p><p>2) Patch clamp experiments – how does bath solution alter the effect of any limited paracrine effect – we are removing cells from the treatment media and putting them in physiological solutions – an opportunity to recover?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84088.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers make the following scientific comments which we would request you address:</p><p>Reviewer 1's comments concern the detailed interpretation of the results:</p><p>1) The cells in Figure 4F and G, do not appear to correspond to either myofibroblasts or endothelial cells.

We suspect the gH2AX+ aSMA- cells are myofibroblasts that have lost aSMA expression. We attempted to verify this using stainings for other myofibroblast-specific markers (including vimentin, PDGFRα, DDR2, and Tcf21), but such stainings were not successful due to limited availability of verified primary antibodies against rabbit tissue for immunofluorescent microscopy. We did not observe evidence of cardiomyocyte senescence through SABgal staining or gH2AX staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The results presented show that treatment of cardiomyocytes with conditioned media from, and co-cultured with, senescent myofibroblasts did not change action potential duration in cardiomyocytes.

However, we have found no evidence of coupling in our co-culture assay. We recorded transient capacitive currents during a hyperpolarizing voltage step (-80 to -100 mV) in cardiomyocytes cultured on top of senescent myofibroblasts, as well as in single cardiomyocytes cultured alone. We fit the transient current decay with a two-exponential decay function. If a cardiomyocyte and myofibroblast were coupled, we would expect that the capacitive transient would have a significantly larger slow time constant and greater total capacitive charge (measured as an integral of the capacitive transient) than in a single myocyte in the absence of myofibroblasts. This is because in the coupled cells the total electric capacitance of cell membranes is larger, and the electrical access resistance of gap junctions to the myofibroblast is significantly higher than the pipette access resistance to the cardiomyocyte membrane. However, we found no significant difference in time constants between these two groups. A similar analysis was done to show coupling of descending vasa recta endothelial cells (Zhang 2006 Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol, PMID 16840652). Furthermore, when we added 100 mM carbenoxolone to block gap junctions in the co-culture system, there was no significant difference in the slow time constants between the two groups of cells, indicating no significant electrical connections between the cardiomyocytes and the fibroblasts. A sentence mentioning this analysis has been added to the manuscript (lines 468-471).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another important possibility to be considered is that myofibroblasts might not have produced senescence-associated secretory phenotype-mediators at concentrations high enough to alter action potential duration in the conditions tested. Experimental evidence of the levels of selected mediators of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype in conditioned media would help assess a potential paracrine effect.</p></disp-quote><p>This is possible, or alternatively the long-term effect of relatively low concentration paracrine signaling, as expected from aged infarcted animals, might have an effect on cardiomyocyte electrophysiology. Previous studies in mice and rats have indicated that exogenous administration of individual cytokines found in the SASP can alter the activity of ion channels and prolong cardiomyocyte APD (Stuart 2016 J Mol Cell Cardiol PMID 26739214). These are important questions to address to fully understand the spatiotemporal contribution of senescence towards inflammation and arrhythmias, however the results presented in this manuscript are not meant to rule out a paracrine effect. Further investigation is needed to characterize nuances in potential paracrine and juxtacrine effects but is outside the scope of this manuscript. Of note, other investigators reported that IL-6 may block I<sub>Kr</sub> (Chowdhury 2021 Int J Mol Sci, PMID 34681909; Aromolaran 2018 PLoS One, PMID 30521586). Given that the conditioned media had no significant effects on I<sub>Kr</sub> current density and APD, we feel that assessing the low levels of multiple cytokines in the media will not be productive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The evidence of coupling, i.e., the presence of connexin-43 in the interphase between αSMA+ and cardiomyocytes needs to be strengthened.

(Rubart 2018 Cardiovasc Res, PMID 29016731) that demonstrated electrical coupling between cardiomyocytes and myofibroblasts (nonmyocytes) in the infarcted mouse heart. The latter report also provided 3D reconstructions of fluorescence confocal images that were acquired from infarct border zones. Here (Figure 6B-D), the authors presented convincing data that showed the expression of connexins 43 and 45 between myocytes and myofibroblasts. As confocal imaging requires a compromise between resolution, scan time, and photobleaching of the samples, we decided to choose a high enough resolution (approximately 200um width, 200um height, 6um depth) to create informative 2D images (the juxtaposition of cardiomyocytes and senescent myofibroblasts). This information was added to the methods section, (lines 878-879). However, the resolution chosen is not high enough for any convincing 3D reconstruction as we felt at that time that an in-depth study of the aforementioned already established heterocellular coupling would not add any new information to the manuscript.</p><p>However, we would like to present the reviewer additional confocal images that show the presence of Cx43 between cardiomyocytes and myofibroblasts (indicated by yellow circles) confirming the aforementioned observations made by Rubert et al. in a larger animal. These additional images have been included in the manuscript as Figure 8—figure supplement 1 (line 541). Our data would also somewhat corroborate an earlier finding (Camelliti 2004 Circ Res, PMID 14976125) that reported coupling between neighboring fibroblasts and myocytes in rabbit sinoatrial node as evidenced by dye transfer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 has more technical issues to raise:</p><p>1) Some reflection on the media used to study paracrine effects is needed – more experiments here would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience, rabbit cardiomyocytes deteriorate over course of hours in unusual or substandard media. Standard cardiomyocyte growth media used was DMEM + 7% FBS + 1X Pen/Strep, and standard cardiac fibroblasts growth media used was DMEM-F12 + 10% FBS + 1X Pen/Strep. Standard cardiomyocyte growth media as described in the methods section (lines 952-953) was used to co-culture the myocytes and fibroblasts 24-30 hours before the patch clamping. The discussion was revised to include reflection on how the media used might have masked a paracrine effect (lines 762-763), however a several-hour co-culture in substandard media might induce stress in cardiomyocytes that might also introduce artefacts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Patch clamp experiments – how does bath solution alter the effect of any limited paracrine effect – we are removing cells from the treatment media and putting them in physiological solutions – an opportunity to recover?</p></disp-quote><p>Correct, the patch clamping media differed from the co-culture media, although the patch clamping media was introduced shortly before patch clamping. Any possible rapid recovery of cardiomyocytes immediately before patch clamping would therefore not be detected in our experiments. However, we believe that such a scenario is unlikely. This this addressed in the revised discussion (lines 765-767).</p></body></sub-article></article>
