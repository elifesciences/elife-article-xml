Two types of enzymes, namely cohesin and condensin confer the topology of chromosomal DNA by extruding DNA loops. While condensin normally configures chromosomes exclusively during mitosis, cohesin does so during interphase. The processivity of cohesin’s loop extrusion during interphase is limited by a regulatory factor called WAPL, which induces cohesin to dissociate from chromosomes via a mechanism that requires dissociation of its kleisin from the neck of SMC3. We show here that a related mechanism may be responsible for blocking condensin II from acting during interphase. Cells derived from patients affected by microcephaly caused by mutations in the MCPH1 gene undergo premature chromosome condensation. We show that deletion of <italic>Mcph1</italic> in mouse embryonic stem cells unleashes an activity of condensin II that triggers formation of compact chromosomes in G1 and G2 phases, accompanied by enhanced mixing of A and B chromatin compartments, and this occurs even in the absence of CDK1 activity. Crucially, inhibition of condensin II by MCPH1 depends on the binding of a short linear motif within MCPH1 to condensin II’s NCAPG2 subunit. MCPH1’s ability to block condensin II’s association with chromatin is abrogated by the fusion of SMC2 with NCAPH2, hence may work by a mechanism similar to cohesin. Remarkably, in the absence of both WAPL and MCPH1, cohesin and condensin II transform chromosomal DNAs of G2 cells into chromosomes with a solenoidal axis.</p></abstract><kwd-group

that they are first disentangled and organised into individual sister chromatids before being pulled in opposite directions by the mitotic spindle upon the dissolution of sister chromatid cohesion by separase. Chromatid formation during mitosis and sister chromatid cohesion necessary for bi-orientation are mediated by highly related structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC)-kleisin complexes, namely condensin and cohesin respectively. In both cases, the activity of their ring-like SMC-kleisin trimers is regulated by large hook-shaped proteins composed of tandem HEAT repeats, known as HAWKs (HEAT repeat proteins associated with kleisins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The conundrum that complexes with such similar geometries appear to perform such dissimilar functions has been resolved by the realisation that cohesin also organises DNAs into chromatid-like structures, albeit during interphase and only upon ablation of a regulatory protein called WAPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>) as well as naturally during meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Challa et al., 2018</xref>) or during V(D)J recombination when WAPL is downregulated in pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hill et al., 2020</xref>). There is now considerable evidence that cohesin and condensin organise chromosomal DNAs during interphase and mitosis, respectively, by extruding DNA loops in a processive manner. Indeed, both exhibit such loop extrusion (LE) activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>). LE mediated by cohesin is halted or at least retarded at specific sequences bound by CTCF, and the processivity of the complex is reduced by WAPL which induces cohesin’s dissociation from chromatin, albeit only infrequently every 10–20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wutz et al., 2020</xref>). No such site-specific DNA binding proteins are known to regulate condensin. In both cases, chromatid formation is envisaged to arise from processive LE activity, which organises DNA into a series of loops, each emanating from a central core containing the SMC-kleisin loop extruders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian cells possess two types of condensin complexes: condensin I and II. Both complexes share the same SMC proteins, SMC2 and SMC4, which both contain 50 nm long anti-parallel coiled coils connecting a hinge domain at one end with an ATPase domain, formed from the N- and C-terminal extremities, at the other. Dimerisation via their hinges creates V-shaped SMC2/4 heterodimers whose ATPase heads are inter-connected by their kleisin subunits, NCAPH1 for condensin I and NCAPH2 for condensin II. These in turn recruit different HAWK regulatory subunits, NCAPD2 or D3 and NCAPG or G2 for condensin I and II, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cutts and Vannini, 2020</xref>). While condensin II remains in the nucleus during interphase and starts to organise chromosomal DNAs during prophase, condensin I only has access to the DNA after nuclear envelope break down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hirota et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ono et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ono et al., 2003</xref>). Despite this difference, both accumulate along the longitudinal axes of metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ono et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walther et al., 2018</xref>). HiC data suggest that condensin I extrudes shorter loops that are nested within longer ones previously created by condensin II. Interactions between distant loops suggest that the loops created by condensin II may be organised radially around a coiled or solenoidal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>). The ratio between condensin I and condensin II adjusts the coiling of chromosome axes, partly by altering the width of the central spiral and generating curled chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baxter and Aragón, 2012</xref>).</p><p>An important factor in limiting the processivity of loop extrusion by cohesin is its release from chromatin. This process that depends on WAPL involves engagement of cohesin’s ATPase heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elbatsh et al., 2016</xref>) and dissociation of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of its SCC1 kleisin subunit from the coiled coil (neck) that emerges from SMC3’s ATPase head domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>). Because a co-translational fusion of SCC1’s NTD to the C-terminal domain of SMC3’s ATPase blocks release, it has been proposed that it involves passage of DNAs previously entrapped inside its SMC-kleisin ring through an exit gate created by dissociation of SCC1 from SMC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, the kleisin NTDs appear to dissociate in vitro from engaged SMC2 and SMC4 heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hassler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2020</xref>) as well as those of SMC1 and SMC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buheitel and Stemmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herzog et al., 2014</xref>). This observation raises the possibility that release via a kleisin-SMC exit gate might be a feature of chromosomal condensin complexes as well as cohesin. However, whether release of this nature occurs in vivo and whether it has an important function is not known.</p><p>Condensin II’s activity and functions within the nuclei of interphase cells are poorly understood. While some studies have reported that it binds to chromatin during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ono et al., 2013</xref>), its depletion from post mitotic mouse liver cells has little or no effect on genome organisation or transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, the notion that condensin II is activated as cells enter mitosis via kinase cascade involving CDK1 and PLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2011</xref>) also begs the question as to whether it has any significant role during interphase. However, an important clue that condensin II can in principle function during this stage of the cell cycle comes from the characterisation of patients carrying a mutation of the <italic>Mcph1</italic> gene, which causes a reduction in the size of the cerebral cortex known as primary microcephaly (OMIM 608585) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thornton and Woods, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Woods et al., 2005</xref>). Cells from such patients have an increased number of prophase-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neitzel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trimborn et al., 2004</xref>). The prophase-like organisation of chromosomal DNA has since been shown to be mediated by condensin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Trimborn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>), whose abnormal activity triggers premature condensation in G2 and late de-condensation in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arroyo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neitzel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trimborn et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>MCPH1 is only found in metazoa. It contains three BRCT domains, one N-terminal and two C-terminal, separated by a disordered region. The diverse phenotypes of mutant cells have led to many different and often conflicting suggestions for its roles. Binding of MCPH1’s C-terminal BRCT domains to phosphorylated histone H2AX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Venkatesh and Suresh, 2014</xref>) is thought to play a part in the DNA damage response, while the premature chromosome condensation caused by mutations within its N-terminal BRCT has been attributed to this domain’s defective association with the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodelling complex and SET1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Leung et al., 2011</xref>). MCPH1 is also thought to bind DNA and has been proposed to function in telomere maintenance, centriole organisation and CHK1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Alderton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cicconi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gruber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin and Elledge, 2003</xref>). In contradiction to the finding that MCPH1 binds directly to condensin II, it is widely believed that the N-terminal ~200 residues of MCPH1 compete with condensin II for chromosomal binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>), in other words, MCPH1 has been proposed to occupy loci required for condensin II’s chromosomal activity.</p><p>Given the diversity and conflicting views of MCPH1’s function, we have re-addressed its role in regulating chromosome structure by analysing the consequences of deleting its gene in mouse ES cells. We show that loss of MCPH1 induces a prophase-like organisation of chromatin during G1 and G2 but not during S phase, and that this depends on condensin II. Crucially, this phenotype, which is accompanied by condensin II’s stable association with chromosomes, is unaffected by inhibiting CDK1, suggesting that MCPH1 does not inhibit chromosome condensation merely by delaying the CDK1 activation normally necessary for condensin II activity as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Alderton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gruber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tibelius et al., 2009</xref>). We demonstrate that MCPH1 instead regulates the organisation of chromosomal DNA through the binding of condensin II’s NCAPG2 subunit by a conserved short linear motif (SLiM) situated within its central domain. Such binding does not per se explain how MCPH1 regulates condensin II and has little or no effect on its ATPase activity, at least in vitro. Presumably, other domains, for example its N-terminal BRCT, which is frequently mutated in human microcephaly patients, have an effector function, by interacting with other sites within the condensin II pentamer or recruit other cellular factors.</p><p>A clue to the role of MCPH1 is the resemblance between the stable association of condensin II with chromosomal DNA induced by MCPH1 ablation with the effect on cohesin of mutating <italic>Wapl</italic>, which binds to the cohesin HAWK equivalent to NCAPG2, namely STAG2, also using an FY SLiM. We therefore tested whether like WAPL, MCPH1 prevents condensin II from associating stably with DNA by opening the interface between NCAPH2’s NTD with the neck of SMC2’s ATPase domain. Remarkably, a translational fusion between SMC2’s C-terminus and NCAPH2’s N-terminus is not only functional in mouse oocytes but also resistant to the inhibition mediated by an excess of MCPH1 induced by mRNA micro-injection. This raises the possibility that like WAPL, MCPH1 acts by opening the interface between the kleisin’s NTD and the neck of the SMC ATPase domain. Finally, we investigated the consequences of inducing the stable association with G2 chromosomes of both cohesin and condensin and found that the chromosomal axes created by cohesin upon mutating <italic>Wapl</italic> are turned into solenoids in cells deleted for both <italic>Wapl</italic> and <italic>Mcph1</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Mcph1</italic> deletion induces chromosome condensation during interphase in embryonic stem cells</title><p>Premature chromosome condensation is a key feature of cells isolated from patients carrying <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutations.

In wild-type G1 and G2 cells, different centromeres and peri-centric regions cluster in chromocenters.

The localisation of NCAPH2 was analysed by labelling its Halo-tag with the fluorescent TMR ligand. In wild type, NCAPH2 has a diffuse nuclear distribution throughout most of the interphase, with no enrichment at any particular site. The protein starts to accumulate at centromeres during G2 and subsequently along the length of chromosomes from prophase until the end of telophase. Deletion of <italic>Mcph1</italic> caused NCAPH2 to associate with the prophase-like chromosomes in all G1 and G2 cells and become enriched at their individualised centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MCPH1 restricts Condensin II activity during G1 and G2</title><p>The change in chromosome organisation caused by deletion of <italic>Mcph1</italic> is accompanied by a change in the localisation of condensin II.

Because this completely reversed the re-organisation of chromosomal DNA caused by <italic>Mcph1</italic> deletion (no condensation observed in 150 cells counted, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), we conclude that altered regulation of condensin II is largely if not completely responsible.

Despite its conservation, the sequences are predicted to be disordered, suggesting that it could be a short linear motif (SLiM) that binds to condensin II. To test this, we performed fluorescence polarisation binding assays with a 5-FAM-labelled MCPH1 peptide spanning residues 407–424 and found that it bound to condensin II, with a fit Kd of 0.64 ± 0.12 µM (mean ± SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

By inducing cohesin’s dissociation from chromatin, albeit only rarely approximately every 15 min., WAPL merely moderates the processivity of loop extrusion mediated by cohesin. MCPH1 has a more drastic effect, preventing most condensin II complexes from ever associating stably with chromatin. The entire architecture of interphase chromatin therefore depends on these two key regulatory factors. Although condensin II is presumed like cohesin to act as a DNA loop extruder, the deregulation of cohesin and condensin II induces different chromosomal morphologies. <italic>Wapl</italic> deletion enables cohesin to form thread-like structures and to accumulate along their longitudinal axes, creating so called vermicelli. In contrast, <italic>Mcph1</italic> deletion enables condensin II to produce soft spherical or ‘gumball’ chromosomes and to associate stably throughout chromosomal DNA, albeit at high levels at centromeres. Strangely, condensin II does not form or accumulate along the sort of axes observed when wild type cells enter mitosis. Thus, the activities of condensin II and cohesin unleashed by <italic>Mcph1</italic> and <italic>Wapl</italic> deletion produce DNA loops with very different arrangements, respectively. We therefore set out to address two questions. First, is this difference intrinsic to differences in the behaviour of cohesin and condensin II or merely due to differences in the type of cell used, namely mouse fibroblasts and ES cells? Assuming that it is in fact, the former, what happens when both factors are deregulated simultaneously? To this end, we altered the <italic>Mcph1</italic> and <italic>Wapl</italic> genes in E14 cells in which SCC1 is tagged with Halo and NCAPH2 with GFP.

Because the majority of SCC1 remains on chromosomes during mitosis, most is cleaved by separase during anaphase and daughter cells inherit considerably less cohesin than normal. As a consequence, axial cohesin vermicelli are rarely if ever observed during G1, especially as this cell cycle phase is very short in ES cells. Pronounced vermicelli are only observed in G2. As expected, <italic>Wapl</italic> deletion neither alters condensin II’s distribution during interphase nor hinders its accumulation along chromatid axes during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">Figure 10—figure supplement 2</xref>). Despite cohesin’s persistence on mitotic chromosomes and the participation of a large fraction in sister chromatid cohesion, condensin II still manages to localise to and help create the axes of individual chromatids, between which run inter-chromatid axes coated in cohesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>, Δ<italic>Wapl</italic>). There are presumably two pools of chromosomal cohesin in post-replicative <italic>Wapl</italic>-deleted cells, one involved in cohesion and a second engaged in the loop extrusion responsible for the formation of vermicelli. The former clearly persists and accumulates along the inter-chromatid axis when loop extrusion mediated by condensin I and II individualise chromatids, but the fate of the latter is unclear.</p><p>Deletion of <italic>Mcph1</italic> had little effect on cohesin’s distribution. Despite the formation of gumball chromosomes during G1 and G2, cohesin remains uniformly associated with chromatin and does not form vermicelli. As in wild-type cells, most dissociates from chromosome arms when cells enter mitosis and little can be detected along the inter-chromatid axes connecting the two condensin II axes of individualised chromatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, Δ<italic>Mcph1</italic>).</p><p>Deletion of both <italic>Wapl</italic> and <italic>Mcph1</italic> had a dramatic effect. The cohesin vermicelli caused by the lack of WAPL in G2 cells adopt a coiled configuration upon the simultaneous deletion of <italic>Mcph1</italic>. This coiling increases during prophase. By the time cells reach metaphase, the coiling leads to the formation of chromosomes that have the shape of a spring (or solenoid), a configuration that is visible with SCC1-Halo, NCAPH2-GFP and DNA staining (DAPI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, Δ<italic>Wapl,</italic>Δ<italic>Mcph1</italic>). Moreover, the two distinct axes of condensin II associated with each chromatid remain intermingled in the double mutant.</p><p>To analyse the axial organisation of these chromosomes in greater detail, we used super-resolution three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to compare the distribution of SCC1-Halo in <italic>Wapl</italic> deleted and double mutant cells. Unfortunately, fluorescence due to NCAPH2-GFP was insufficient to reveal reliable images using this technique. Analysis of G2 cells revealed that a modest coiling of cohesin axes surrounded by DNA loops in <italic>Wapl</italic> single mutants is greatly accentuated in double-mutant cells, with a pronounced increase in the radii of coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig11video1">Figure 11—video 1</xref>). In metaphase cells, the cohesin axes that seem to have a spring-like appearance in confocal microscopy are revealed to have a much more complicated organisation, being composed of twisted segments that regularly change handedness. It is noticeable that the formation of chromosomes with this morphology is not simply due to the combined activity/presence of cohesin and condensin II during mitosis, which also occurs in <italic>Wapl</italic> single mutants.

It normally only associates stably with chromosomal DNA and organises it into a series of loops when cells enter M phase. The restriction of condensin II’s activity to M phase was previously attributed to its phosphorylation by CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Alderton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gruber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tibelius et al., 2009</xref>). Our finding that in the absence of MCPH1, condensin II is capable of transforming the topology of chromosomal DNA in cells arrested in G2 using a CDK1 inhibitor implies that condensin II is capable of substantial activity in the absence of CDK1-mediated phosphorylation normally associated with M phase. In other words, it is MCPH1 that prevents condensin II’s association with chromosomes during G2 not the lack of CDK1 phosphorylation.</p><p>Our observation that phosphorylation of a CDK1 consensus sequence abolishes association between a conserved and essential SLiM within MCPH1’s central domain and condensin II’s NCAPG2 subunit raises the possibility that CDK1 exerts at least part of its effect by preventing MCPH1’s association with condensin II. Our conclusion that the SLiM within MCPH1’s central domain is essential for its inhibitory activity contradicts the claim that it is not necessary, an inconsistency that we attribute to the fact that previous studies tested the function of over-expressed MCPH1 alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wood et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>). Accordingly, when a version of <italic>Mcph1</italic> deleted for the SLiM domain was overexpressed in mouse oocyte, it was still inhibiting Condensin II association with chromosomes (data not shown). This result suggests that MCPH1 with a deletion of this short motif can still have an effect on condensin II when expressed at high levels and is consistent with previous studies. However, we have shown that the SLiM is essential for the inhibition of condensin II when the protein is expressed at endogenous levels, demonstrating the importance of performing experiments using endogenous protein levels to prevent the conclusion being biased by the protein expression levels.</p><p>Our findings as well as those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arroyo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neitzel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trimborn et al., 2004</xref>) show that MCPH1 is responsible for inhibiting condensin II during G1 as well as G2 phase. Thus, in the absence of MCPH1, condensin II organises chromosomal DNAs into chromatid-like structures during G1 and G2 but strikingly not during S phase when some other (MCPH1-independent) mechanism prevents it from associating stably with chromatin.</p><p>MCPH1’s inhibition of condensin II depends on its N-terminal BRCT domain in addition to its central SLiM. Indeed, most of <italic>MCPH1</italic> mutations identified in microcephaly patients affect the BRCT domain, which possibly interacts with some other part of condensin II once MCPH1 has been recruited via its SLiM. However, the function of this domain remains mysterious.</p><p>How does MCPH1 inhibit condensin II? An important clue stemmed from the numerous similarities between MCPH1 and WAPL, a protein that facilitates cohesin’s release from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>). WAPL binds to STAG, the cohesin subunit equivalent to NCAPG2, using a SLiM and its inactivation leads to cohesin’s stable association with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tedeschi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wutz et al., 2020</xref>). Cohesin release mediated by WAPL involves dissociation of the NTD of cohesin’s SCC1 kleisin subunit from the coiled coil that emerges from SMC3’s ATPase head, known as its neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eichinger et al., 2013</xref>). It is currently thought that kleisin-neck dissociation takes place, albeit rarely, upon engagement of cohesin’s SMC1 and SMC3 ATPase heads in the presence of ATP when SMC3 is unacetylated and in the absence of SCC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beckouët et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). Crucially, the fusion of SMC3’s C-terminus to SCC1’s N-terminus completely blocks WAPL from triggering cohesin’s release from chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eichinger et al., 2013</xref>). It could do so either by creating a barrier to the passage of DNA through an opened kleisin-neck interface, i.e. by blocking the exit of DNAs previously entrapped within cohesin rings, or merely by hindering kleisin-neck dissociation, which has some other poorly understood function necessary for release.</p><p>Our finding that an analogous fusion, between the C-terminus of SMC2 and the N-terminus of NCAPH2, prevents the release of condensin II from meiosis I chromosomes in oocytes upon over-expression of MCPH1 suggests that MCPH1 prevents condensin II’s association with chromatin by a mechanism that is similar to cohesin’s release by WAPL. It has been reported that engagement of SMC2 and SMC4 heads triggered by ATP binding induces the release of the NTD of the kleisin from SMC2’s neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hassler et al., 2019</xref>), raising the possibility that MCPH1 blocks condensin II’s stable association with chromatin by facilitating such a process. Irrespective of the actual mechanics, which remains poorly understood, our observations emphasise that MCPH1 blocks condensin II’s association with chromosomes using a mechanism similar to that that employed by WAPL to cause cohesin release.</p><p>Despite these striking similarities, the mode of action of these two proteins may differ in an important respect. Though WAPL alters cohesin’s residence time on chromatin exclusively by facilitating release, our experiments demonstrated that MCPH1 was unable to release condensin II from chromosomes arrested in meiosis I, suggesting that over-expression of MCPH1 in oocytes prevents de novo association of condensin II but does not remove complexes previously associated with chromosomes (data not shown).</p><p>Recent advances have shown that both human condensin and cohesin complexes extrude DNA loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Golfier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kong et al., 2020</xref>), and cryo-electron microscopy structures of yeast condensin, and yeast and human cohesin are starting to provide insight into how these complexes engage with DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Higashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of cohesin, it has been suggested that an early step is the clamping of DNA on top of SMC1 and SMC3 ATPase domains that have engaged with each other in the presence of ATP. Clamping in this manner requires cohesin’s SCC2 HAWK protein, which is equivalent to condensin II’s NCAPD3. SCC2 is necessary to prevent cohesin’s release from chromatin and may perform this function by preventing dissociation of its kleisin subunit from SMC3’s neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Srinivasan et al., 2019</xref>). If NCAPD3 had a similar role, then MCPH1 could conceivably block condensin II’s association with chromatin by interfering with NCAPD3’s ability to block the release of NCAPH2 from SMC2.</p><p>One of the earliest insights into the cell division cycle was that one of the main constituents of the nucleus undergoes a dramatic morphological transformation shortly before division, namely the transformation of an apparently amorphous mass of chromatin into thread-like structures now known as chromosomes, each composed of a pair of chromatids joined together. It is now recognised that this transformation is brought about by condensins I and II which act by extruding DNA loops. It is also recognised that interphase chromosomal DNA is not in fact amorphous but instead characterised by a complex and dynamic network of interactions known as topologically associated domains or TADs, which are created by cohesin that like condensin is a DNA loop extruder, albeit one that is active during interphase and blocked by the site specific DNA-binding protein CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>There are two reasons why DNAs are not organised into thread-like chromatids during interphase. By causing cohesin release, WAPL prevents loop extrusion by cohesin going to completion while MCPH1 prevents condensin II associating with DNA stably and thereby extruding loops. Crucially, inactivation of either protein leads to the formation of chromatid-like structures during interphase, albeit by different loop extruders and with different actual morphologies. Interestingly, depletion of both proteins simultaneously leads to a major transformation of chromosome structure as cells enter mitosis, which is associated with coiling of the entire axis of the chromosome. Understanding how and why this comes about through the unregulated activities of cohesin and condensin II may help reveal further insight into how loop extrusion creates chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strain, in vitro culture, and oocytes micro-injection</title><p><italic>Ncaph2</italic><sup>tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi</sup> (MBCH;EPD0070-2-G090) were obtained from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.

ATPase assays were performed using the EnzChek Phosphate Assay Kit (Invitrogen) modified for a 96 well plate format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Voulgaris and Gligoris, 2019</xref>). 50 bp double-stranded DNA sequence with the same as that used in the EMSA (without a fluorescent label). Reactions contained 50 nM protein with or without 800 nM DNA. Final conditions included 1 mM ATP and a total salt concentration of 50 mM. Protein/DNA was preincubated in reaction mix without ATP for 15 min at room temperature before the reaction was started by addition of ATP immediately before putting it in the plate reader to track phosphate release. A standard curve ATPase rate was determined from a linear fit of data from the first 60 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Electromobility shift assays</title><p>EMSAs were performed using 50 nM of 50 bp double-stranded DNA labelled with Cy5 at the 5’ with the sequence:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><named-content content-type="sequence">CTGTCACACCCTGTCACACCCTGTCACACCCTGTCACACCCTGTCACACC</named-content></p></list-item></list><p>For MCPH1 EMSAs, MCPH1-MBP constructs were diluted in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 % glycerol, 1 mM DTT and mixed 1 in two with DNA in 20 mM HEPES pH 8, 300 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 % glycerol and 1 mM DTT.</p><p>For condensin II/MCPH1 EMSAs, condensin II diluted in 20 mM HEPES pH 8, 300 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 % glycerol and 1 mM DTT and mixed with MCPH1<sub>1-435</sub>-MBP, MBP or 5-FAM-MCPH1<sub>407-424</sub> diluted in in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 % glycerol, 1 mM DTT.

Several figures/figure legends would benefit from more detail:</p><p>a) Figure 4 and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1. A better annotation of the HI-C contact matrices and explanation should be given. In particular, the general reader will need greater direction as to what features of the maps lead to the following observation: &quot;enhances the frequency of inter-compartment (A to 275 B) contacts as compared to intra-compartment contacts (A to A and B to B) (Figure 4 276 —figure supplement 1A and B).

In experiments of mouse oocytes, it is unclear how much endogenous Mcph1 is expressed and how abundant the exogenous Mcph1 is.

In page 17 line 422-427, the authors mention that Mcph1 cannot dissociate condensin II in meiosis I, therefore claim that Mcph1 prevents the &quot;initial loading&quot; of condensin II on chromosomes but has little effect on complexes already stably associated with chromosomes. However, they injected Mcph1 in GV stage that is corresponding to G2 phase, when Mcph1 should be already loaded on chromatin. It is also conceivable that in mitosis, condensin II is located to the axis of condensed mitotic chromosomes and it could be hard to be accessed by Mcph1. Such difference in accessibility could also be the cause of different consequence between G2 and mitotic behavior of condensin II. To clarify this point, it would be better to perform Mcph1 over expression experiments in synchronizing culture cells and test if pre-loaded condensin II is resistant to Mcph1 in late G2 phase.</p><p>5. If fusion condensin II is resistant to Mcph1 while it is fully functional to restore NCAPH2 depletion, the fusion expression itself should cause precocious condensation like seen in Mcph1 depleted cells. Is this the case?<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>During prophase, condensin II drives the formation of chromosome loops to promote chromosome condensation, but this process is limited in interphase. In this manuscript the authors address how condensin II activity is limited by MCPH1. They show that MCPH1 limits condensin II-dependent loop formation, and provide evidence that it does so by opening of condensin II at its SMC2-NCAPH2 interface to remove it from the DNA. This is reminiscent of the mechanism by which WAPL removes cohesin during prophase. These conclusions are based on experiments using a diverse range of approaches in complementary systems, including ES cell engineering, in vitro biochemistry, Hi-C, live cell imaging of mouse oocytes. This range of approaches is a major strength of the manuscript. Overall, the manuscript presents a convincing case that MCPH1 counteracts condensin activity, in a similar way to restriction of cohesin activity by WAPL. This is an important advance in chromosome biology. Furthermore, since MCPH1 is frequently mutated in microcephaly patients, this work has direct medical relevance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The activity of the two mammalian condensin complexes is restricted to M phase. Condensin I activity is restricted at least partly via its sequestration in the cytoplasm during interphase. In contrast, a sizeable pool of condensin II remains in the nucleus throughout interphase and hence additional mechanisms are required to prevent inappropriate loop extrusion activity.</p><p>Prior work has implicated the MCPH1 protein as a negative regulator of condensin II activity, but how it exerts this function was unclear. Elucidating how MCPH1 regulates condensin II has potential clinical relevance: MCPH1 is the most frequently mutated gene in human congenital microcephaly, and condensin II mutations, although much rarer, cause a related phenotype.</p><p>This paper confirms prior findings and makes significant progress towards elucidating the mechanism through which MCPH1 regulates condensin II. The authors show that MCPH1 prevents condensin II from binding to, and condensing, chromosomes during G1 and G2 but (intriguingly) not during S phase. Interphase condensin II activity in MCPH1 mutant cells is shown to be independent of CDK1 activity, and therefore distinct from activation mechanisms that operate during mitotic prophase. The authors identify an evolutionarily conserved short linear motif on MCPH1 that interacts with NCAPG2, and provide evidence that it can be phosphorylated via CDK1, tentatively suggesting a mechanism via which MCPH1-mediated inhibition of condensin II loading might be alleviated to facilitate loading during mitosis.</p><p>An elegant series of rescue experiments performed in mouse oocytes showed that MCPH1 overexpression prevents NCAPH2 binding to chromosomes during meiosis I, which in turn prevents chromosome segregation during anaphase. In this system, inhibition of NCAPH2 binding requires the N-terminal BRCT domain of MCPH1. The most interesting finding of the paper, in my view, is that the effect of MCPH1 deletion on NCAPH2 loading is prevented by a genetic fusion between SMC2 and the NCAPH2 N-terminus, implying that MCPH1 might prevent condensin II loading by regulating the opening of this subunit interface. There are potential parallels here with Wapl-mediated cohesin removal, which involves regulated opening of the equivalent interface.</p><p>A technical strength of the paper is the diverse combination of experimental approaches, including live and fixed cell imaging, in vitro biochemistry and genomics, used to characterise how MCPH1 interacts with condensin, and how this interaction influences chromosome structure. Where possible, the perturbation experiments have been performed in gene edited and non-transformed mammalian cells, avoiding the potentially confounding effects of protein overexpression and background chromosomal instability.</p><p>The paper opens up several interesting questions for future studies, e.g. how is condensin II activity restricted during S phase in MCPH1-deficient cells? Is condensin II able to avoid the protein roadblocks present on interphase chromosomes that are thought to constrain cohesin-mediated loop extrusion? More insight into this latter question might be gleaned from cell cycle resolved Hi-C experiments. It seems possible that the high proportion of S phase cells in the unsynchronised mESC cultures used in Figure 4 would have made it more challenging to identify signal from G1 and G2 cells, in which condensin II activity is unleashed by MCPH1 deletion.</p><p>Overall, the conclusions are justified in my opinion, and it is commendable that the authors exercise caution in their interpretations and offer alternative explanations where appropriate.<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Houlard et al., revisited the mechanisms of Mcph1 to inhibit condensin II in mouse cells and in biochemical approaches. Previous studies have shown that patient cells carrying Mcph1 mutations or Mcph1 knockdown cells undergo premature chromosome condensation that depends on condensin II. In this manuscript, by using biochemical and cell biological approaches, the authors found that NCAPG2 subunit in condensin II is required for the association with Mcph1 and the central short linear motif (SLiM) of Mcph1 is responsible for the association. The central SLiM inhibits neither ATPase activity of condensin nor condensin II binding to chromatin, suggesting that SLiM inhibits the activity of condensin II other than ATPase.</p><p>Hi-C data is one of the major advances of this study from previous works. The authors show that Mcph1 deletion enhances in the frequency of long-range, intra-chromosomal contacts and inter-compartment (A to B) contacts. This is consistent with the compaction of individual chromosomes after MCPH1 deletion.</p><p>The authors also tested the function of Mcph1 in mouse oocytes and showed that overexpression of Mcph1 caused chromosome missegregation that is similar phenotype of previously reported NCAPH2 depletion. In addition, the authors claim that Mcph1 and Wapl, a cohesin removal factor, function in a similar way because closure of Smc2-NCAPH2 interface, which corresponds to Smc3-Scc1 interface in cohesin and is known as an exit gate opened by the action of Wapl, could bypass the condensin removal activity of Mcph1. Finally, in mouse embryonic stem cells, they performed double knockdown of Wapl and Mcph1 and showed that these factors act independently to each other. Intriguingly, Mcph1 knockdown transforms interphase cohesin axis formed by Wapl knockdown into solenoidal axis.</p><p>Their conclusions are mostly well supported by biochemical data, but several aspects of in vivo data need to be quantified</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73348.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

The fact that the version of MCPH1 with a deletion of the N-terminal domain does not impede on the association of condensin II with DNA suggests that the results observed are specific and not due to any side effect triggered by the injection process. Furthermore, this result is consistent with other studies using different systems (such as Wood et al., JBC 2008 and Yamashita et al., JCB, 2011) which observed that the N-terminal domain is essential for MCPH1 repression of condensin II activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We assume that the reviewers meant condensin and not MCPH1 when they say “when Mcph1 should be already loaded on chromatin”.</p><p>In the oocyte experiments, NCAPH2-GFP produced from mRNA injection at the GV stage is loaded onto chromosomes (Figure 8D).</p><p>When Mcph1 mRNA is co-injected at the GV stage with NCAPH2-GFP, MCPH1 is able to prevent the association of NCAPH2-GFP with chromosomes.</p><p>However, when oocytes are first injected at the GV stage with mRNA coding for NCAPH2-GFP and Mad2, the oocytes after release are arrested in metaphase I and condensin II is all along the chromosome arms. These oocytes are then injected a second time with Mcph1 mRNA and followed by microscopy. However, condensin II remains on the chromosomes of these oocytes (data not shown). Some reduction of condensin II can eventually be detected 5 hours after injection of MCPH1, twice the half-life of condensin II on chromosomes as reported previously in the same condition (Houlard et al., 2015). This lead to our suggestion that, unlike WAPL with cohesin, MCPH1 cannot actively remove the preloaded condensin II from the chromosomes.</p><p>In mES cells, condensin II is only visible at the centromere during G2, not along the chromosome arms. While an inducible over expression of MCPH1 in G2 might be able to reduce condensin II accumulation at the centromere, we do not see how it would distinguish between de novo loading or removal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an experiment that we tried in E14 cells. To avoid overexpression of the fusion we used a Tetracyclin inducible promoter to drive the expression of the fusion after targeting at one specific locus (Tigre) in E14 genome. Unfortunately, while the fusion was expressed at high levels, it remained in the cytoplasm of the cell during interphase preventing any analysis.</p><p>However, the nuclear localization of the fusion is not a problem in oocytes as, during meiosis, the chromosome condensation begins after the nuclear envelope break down (GVBD). During live cell imaging of oocytes injected with the fusion, no apparent modification of the condensation kinetic were observed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
