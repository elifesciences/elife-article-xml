myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disease that causes neuromuscular transmission dysfunction. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying MG have not been fully elucidated. Here, we present the crystal structure of the nAChR α1 subunit bound by the Fab fragment of mAb35, a reference monoclonal antibody that causes experimental MG and competes with ~65% of antibodies from MG patients. Our structures reveal for the first time the detailed molecular interactions between MG antibodies and a core region on nAChR α1. These structures suggest a major nAChR-binding mechanism shared by a large number of MG antibodies and the possibility to treat MG by blocking this binding mechanism. Structure-based modeling also provides insights into antibody-mediated nAChR cross-linking known to cause receptor degradation. Our studies establish a structural basis for further mechanistic studies and therapeutic development of MG.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23043.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23043.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23043.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Myasthenia gravis is a disease that causes chronic weakness in muscles. It affects more than 20 in every 100,000 people and diagnosis is becoming more common due to increased awareness of the disease. However, most current treatments only temporarily relieve symptoms so there is a need to develop more effective therapies.</p><p>The disease occurs when the immune system produces molecules called antibodies that bind to and destroy a receptor protein called nAChR. This receptor is normally found at the junctions between nerve cells and muscle cells, and its destruction disrupts communication between the nervous system and the muscle. However, it is not known exactly how these antibodies bind to nAChR, partly due to the lack of a detailed three-dimensional structure of the antibodies and nAChR together.</p><p>The human nAChR protein is made up of several subunits, including one called alpha1 that is the primary target of Myasthenia gravis antibodies. Noridomi et al. used a technique known as X-ray crystallography to generate a highly detailed three-dimensional model of the structure of the alpha1 subunit with an antibody from rats that acts as in a similar way to human Myasthenia gravis antibodies. The structure reveals the points of contact between the antibodies and a core region of the nAChR alpha1 subunit and suggests that many different Myasthenia gravis antibodies may bind to nAChR in the same way.</p><p>These findings may aid the development of drugs that bind to and disable Myasthenia gravis antibodies to relieve the symptoms of the disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23043.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23043.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>myasthenia gravis</kwd><kwd>nicotinic acetylcholine receptors</kwd><kwd>crystallography</kwd><kwd>autoantibodies</kwd><kwd><italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> </kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Autoantibodies from myasthenia gravis patients bind a common core region on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor through a largely conserved mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a ligand-gated ion channel that mediates rapid signal communication between spinal motor neurons and the muscle cells. This receptor is also a major target of autoimmune antibodies in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disease that afflicts more than 20 in 100,000 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindstrom, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vincent et al., 2001</xref>). MG is the first and, so far, only autoimmune disease with well-defined autoantigen target; the binding of nAChR by MG antibodies leads to complement-mediated lysis of the postsynaptic structure and internalization of the receptor, thereby disrupting neuromuscular transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engel and Arahata, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drachman et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomez et al., 2010</xref>). The majority of MG cases can be diagnosed by the detection of autoantibodies to human muscle nAChR, and current treatment options include the use of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, non-specific immunosuppressive drugs, plasmapheresis and thymectomy. Most of these treatments are for symptomatic control except for thymectomy that may lead to disease remission. Other therapeutic approaches to treating MG, such as nAChR-specific immunosuppressive therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo and Lindstrom, 2015</xref>), need to be explored.</p><p>The autoimmune nature of MG was first suggested by the discovery of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) induced in rabbits immunized with nAChR purified from <italic>Electrophorus electricus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patrick and Lindstrom, 1973</xref>). Subsequent studies with passive transfer of MG patient serum or purified nAChR antibodies to induce EAMG further established nAChR antibodies as the major pathological agents of MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Toyka et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lindstrom et al., 1976</xref>). In fact, more than 85% of MG patients carry nAChR antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindstrom, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vincent et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meriggioli and Sanders, 2009</xref>). However, the total amount of nAChR antibodies in the serum of MG patients does not seem to correlate with disease severity, suggesting that various nAChR antibodies that bind different regions on nAChR may contribute differently to this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Somnier, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berrih-Aknin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mossman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tzartos et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Mammalian muscle nAChR has a pentameric structure composed of two α1, one β1, one δ, and one ε (adult form) or γ (fetal form) subunit(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Unwin, 2005</xref>). Extensive studies suggest that antibodies to α1 play a major role in MG pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sideris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tzartos et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kordas et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, more than half of all autoantibodies in MG and EAMG bind an overlapping region on the nAChR α1 subunit, known as the main immunogenic region (MIR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tzartos et al., 1998</xref>). The MIR is defined by the ability of a single rat monoclonal antibody (mAb), mAb35, to inhibit the binding of about 65% autoantibodies from MG patients or rats with EAMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tzartos and Lindstrom, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tzartos et al., 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">1983</xref>). Subsequent studies have mapped MIR to a peptide region that spans residues 67–76 on nAChR α1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barkas et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tzartos et al., 1988</xref>). Monoclonal antibodies directed to the MIR can passively transfer EAMG and possess all the key pathological functions of serum autoantibodies from MG patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tzartos et al., 1987</xref>). Moreover, a recent study showed that titer levels of MIR-specific antibody from MG patients, rather than the total amount of nAChR antibodies, correlate with disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masuda et al., 2012</xref>). These observations suggest that antibodies binding to the MIR on nAChR α1 play a major role in the pathogenesis of MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tzartos et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The myasthenogenic role of nAChR was established more than four decades ago. Since then, extensive efforts have been put into characterizing the interactions between MG antibodies and nAChR using biochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barkas et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tzartos et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das and Lindstrom, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saedi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Papadouli et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morell et al., 2014</xref>), structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dellisanti et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beroukhim and Unwin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kontou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poulas et al., 2001</xref>), and modeling approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleinjung et al., 2000</xref>). These studies aimed to understand the basic mechanisms of MG and also the structure/function of nAChR in order to develop effective diagnosis and treatment for MG. However, exactly how antibodies bind and functionally affect nAChR has not been fully elucidated since no high-resolution structure of the complex between MG antibodies and nAChR was available. Here we describe the first crystal structure of muscle nAChR α1 subunit bound by an EAMG antibody at 2.61 Å resolution and present detailed analyses of the molecular interactions in myasthenia gravis. These structural analyses, in the context of the large amount of biochemical and functional data from previous MG research, provide unprecedented insights into the molecular mechanisms of MG and a basis for developing more effective diagnosis and treatment for this debilitating disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crystal structures of the antibody/receptor complexes</title><p>mAb35 was chosen for structural analysis because it shares many functional characteristics with serum antibodies from MG patients and has been used as a reference MG antibody in extensive biochemical and functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tzartos et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">1981</xref>). Although mAb35 is derived from rat immunized with <italic>Electrophorus</italic> AChR, it competes with more than two thirds of serum antibodies from MG patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tzartos et al., 1982</xref>). At the functional level, mAb35 binds complement causing focal lysis of the postsynaptic membrane, cross-links AChRs thereby increasing their internalization, and can passively transfer EAMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tzartos et al., 1987</xref>). To facilitate crystallization, we used the Fab fragment of mAb35 (Fab35) and also included α-bungarotoxin (α-Btx) to stabilize flexible regions of nAChR α1 ECD that may hinder crystallization. We used a mutant of nAChR α1 ECD that contains three stabilization mutations, referred to as α211 as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dellisanti et al., 2007a</xref>). Although mAb35 does not bind well to the denatured receptor, it has been shown to bind natively folded nAChR α1 with high affinity (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> =~2 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>). Our native PAGE analysis showed that nAChR α1 ECD, α-Btx and Fab35 can form a well-defined ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), and the ternary complex of Fab35/nAChR α1 ECD/α-Btx was stable during purification by gel filtration. We obtained ternary complex crystals with both human and mouse nAChR α1 ECD and solved the structures (2.61 Å and 2.70 Å resolution, respectively) by molecular replacement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

At Asn68, another hotspot site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), the amide group of Asn68 side chain forms three hydrogen bonds with V<sub>L</sub> (the carbonyl of Tyr91 main chain and the amide and carbonyl of Gly94 main chain).

The tip of the CDR-H3 loop, including Arg102 and Ala103, makes extensive van der Waals contacts to the surrounding receptor residues. The guanidinium group of Arg102 is sandwiched by the carboxylic amide of Asn64 side chain and the carbonyl of Asp14 main chain of nAChR α1 in a parallel orientation that may favor π-stacking. Arg102 also forms water-mediated (H<sub>2</sub>O 82) hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyl groups of Leu11 and Asn64 of nAChR α1. Adjacent to the CDR-H3 interaction site, Tyr63 of nAChR α1 forms a hydrogen bond with Lys50 of the CDR-L2, which is stabilized by a cation-π interaction with Tyr32 of the CDR-L1. Lys50 of the CDR-L2 also engages in electrostatic interaction with Glu23 of nAChR α1.

To address this question, we compared the structure of Fab35 with that of two other MG mAbs (Fab198: PDB ID, 1FN4 and Fab192: PDB ID, 1C5D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kontou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poulas et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, superposition of the structure of Fab198 onto that of Fab35 in the ternary complex shows that these two Fabs share not only a conserved immunoglobulin fold but also a similar antigen-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). As such, the MIR loop fits well into the pocket surrounded by the CDR-H2, CDR-H3 and CDR-L3 loops of Fab198, as predicated by previous modeling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleinjung et al., 2000</xref>). The CDR-H2 loop of Fab198 is also in position to interact with the N-terminal helix adjacent to the MIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Even more remarkably, many key α1-binding residues in Fab35 are also conserved in Fab198 and they appear to make similar contacts to nAChR α1 in the modeled Fab198/nAChR α1 binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and c</xref>). These residues include Trp47 (CDR-H2), Arg50 (CDR-H2), and Tyr95 (CDR-L3) at the center of the MIR-binding pocket, and Trp52 and Asp54 (both CDR-H2) which interact with the N-terminal helix. However, in contrast to the above structural similarities, the CDR-H3 loops between Fab198 and Fab35 differ significantly in length and sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). As a result, the CDR-H3 loop of Fab198 is too short to interact with the surface pocket of nAChR α1, which is, in the case of Fab35, occupied by the corresponding CDR-H3 loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>).

To address the first part of this question, Fab35-contacting residues were mapped onto aligned sequences of human nAChR subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). A subset of nAChR family members, including α2, α3, α5 and β3, has either identical or homologous residues at the key Fab35-binding positions. These analyses suggest that Fab35 and other MIR-directed mAbs may be able to bind these nAChR subunits. On the other hand, the other nAChR members have divergent sequences at the Fab35-binding sites. For example, the key Fab35-binding residues in the MIR of nAChR α1, Asn68 and Asp71, are replaced by Asp and Gln in nAChR α9, respectively. On the N-terminal helix of nAChR α1, the key Fab35-binding residues, Arg6 and Lys10, are also replaced by Lys and Asp in nAChR α9, respectively.

The model built on the <italic>Torpedo</italic> AChR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>) is very similar to that built on the α4β2 nAChR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The primary differece between the models is that the N-terminal helix of the α1 subunit in the <italic>Torpedo</italic> AChR appears to adopt a different orientation from the conserved conformation adopted by the corresponding helix in a number of nAChR structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Unwin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dellisanti et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morales-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). The source of this structural difference is currently unknown but our analysis shows that it has little effect on the overall structure of the modeled full antibody-receptor complex. The modeled complex structure shows that the antibody is projected away from the central pore of the receptor, consistent with previous EM analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beroukhim and Unwin, 1995</xref>). After putting all of the molecular components on proper scale and orientation, our model of the full-length antibody/receptor complex suggests that, as a result of steric and geometric constraints, the two Fabs from a single mAb35 antibody are unable to bind to the two α1 subunits within the same nAChR pentamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Consequently, MG antibodies will bind two α1 subunits from different pentamers, thereby cross-linking the nAChRs. Our modeling analyses are consistent with previous sucrose density gradient studies showing that mAb35 and similar mAbs cannot bind the two α1 subunits within the same pentamer but can cross-link adjacent nAChR pentamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conti-Tronconi et al., 1981</xref>). Considering that each muscle nAChR pentamer contains two α1 subunits and the relatively high density of nAChRs at the postsynaptic membrane, such inter-pentamer cross-linking mediated by MG antibodies could lead to a super high-order of antibody/receptor complex at the neuromuscular junction. Previous studies have shown that the binding of nAChR by the divalent MG antibodies rather than the monovalent Fab fragment leads to accelerated degradation of the receptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drachman et al., 1978</xref>). This observation suggests that cross-linking of the nAChRs is a critical step in receptor degradation. Our analyses suggest that receptor cross-linking is an intrinsic property of mAb35 and mAb35-like MG antibodies. This cross-linkig could lead to the formation of large antibody-receptor complexes that disrupt the structure and function of the neuromuscular junction and induce the degradation of the nicotinic receptor proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our crystal structure of Fab35 bound to the nAChR α1 ECD provides the first atomic view of the detailed interactions between an EAMG antibody and the nAChR. Our structure reveals that the MIR loop inserts deeply into the antigen-binding pocket of Fab35 and that the adjacent N-terminal helix makes extensive contacts with the CDR-H2 loop of the heavy chain. The binding interface structure and detailed interactions observed in the crystal can be cross-validated with existing biochemical data. Earlier studies mapped the core region of MIR to residues 67–76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barkas et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tzartos et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das and Lindstrom, 1989</xref>). More recent studies using natively folded nAChR α1/α7 chimera proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>) or GFP-fused protein fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morell et al., 2014</xref>) showed that the N-terminal helix (residues 1–14) is also important for high-affinity MG antibody binding. These studies further indicated that other regions of nAChR, including the loop following helix 1 (residues 15–32) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>) and the β5-β6-loop packing against the MIR (residues 110–115) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morell et al., 2014</xref>), also contribute to the binding of some MG antibodies. Our structures reveal that the antibody-receptor binding interface indeed centers on the MIR and the N-terminal helix and also includes peripheral regions such as residues 15–23. Although the β5-β6-loop (residues 110–115) does not contact Fab35 in our structure, it may contribute to antibody binding indirectly by maintaining the natively folded structure of MIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morell et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Specific residues on MIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Papadouli et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellone et al., 1989</xref>) and the N-terminal helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morell et al., 2014</xref>) have also been analyzed using peptide/protein fragments containing mutations at specific positions for their roles on MG antibody binding. These studies showed that Asn68 and Asp71 of MIR are essential for MG antibody binding while the surrounding residues including Pro69 and Tyr72 showed partial effect when mutated. The essential role of Asn68 and Asp71 was further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of N68D and D71K in the intact receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saedi et al., 1990</xref>). On the N-terminal helix of <italic>Torpedo</italic> nAChR α1, two exposed residues, Arg6 and Asn10, which correspond to Arg6 and Lys10 in human nAChR α1, respectively, are found to be critical to MG antibody binding by mutational analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morell et al., 2014</xref>). Most of the nAChR residues found to be essential for antibody binding by mutagenesis studies, including Asn68 and Asp71 from the MIR and Arg6 and Lys10 from the N-terminal helix, indeed correspond to interaction ‘hotspots’ at the Fab35/nAChR α1 interface. These ‘hotspot’ residues anchor multiple interaction networks at the interface and make extensive contacts to the antibody. Although biochemical mapping of antibody-binding residues on nAChR α1 were performed with different antibodies (e.g. mAb210 and mAb132A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barkas et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tzartos et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Das and Lindstrom, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saedi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Papadouli et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morell et al., 2014</xref>), it is remarkable that these biochemical data agree so well with our crystal structure, suggesting that many MIR-directed antibodies may share high similarities in their binding sites on the nAChR. It has been suggested that EAMG and MG antibodies may bind epitopes different from MIR and that these MG antibodies may be competed off by mAb35 through steric effect rather than direct epitope competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>). Our structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>) indeed support this possibility, which is represented by mAb192 (also see below). However, our structural analyses also reveal that many MIR residues at the center of the antibody-receptor are important for the high affinity binding of a variety of MG antibodies (e.g., mAb35, mAb210, and mAb132A). This is a rather surprising finding given the potential heterogeneity of nAChR antibodies mentioned above. An important implication of this finding is that molecular mimicries of the MIR and its immediate surrounding regions could be developed to bind a significant fraction of MIR-directed MG autoantibodies. Such molecules could be useful leads for developing diagnostics and therapeutics for MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tzartos et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masuda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sophianos and Tzartos, 1989</xref>).</p><p>MIR-directed antibodies display a wide range of binding properties. Some such antiboies (e.g. mAb35) exclusively bind natively folded receptor and others (e.g. mAb210) are also capable of binding denatured receptor or isolated MIR peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morell et al., 2014</xref>). The binding mechanisms between different MG antibodies may have subtle or significant differences. Our comparative structural analyses indicate that Fab35 and Fab198 share highly similar binding mechanisms to nAChR α1, especially in the MIR/N-terminal helix core region. On the other hand, Fab192 seems to have very different nAChR-binding mechanisms from Fab35 and Fab198 even though Fab192 can be competed off by mAb35 through steric effect. Most MIR-directed mAbs, such as mAb35, bind preferably to folded receptors. Our structure shows that the complete epitope consists of two separated peptide regions (the MIR loop and the N-terminal helix) that are required to fold together properly for optimal binding. These structural observations are consistent with previous studies of chimeras and mutants showing that the native conformation of the MIR that permits binding of mAbs 35 and 198 depends on the interaction of the N-terminal helix with the MIR loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dellisanti et al., 2007a</xref>). Moreover, for mAb35, a significant amount of binding energy may derive from the insertion of its CDR-H3 loop to the surface pocket on nAChR α1, whose structure can only form in the natively folded receptor. This unique feature of mAb35 is consistent with the observation that mAb35 is particularly conformation sensitive in binding to nAChR α1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our modeling analyses indicate that neighboring subunits in the nAChR pentamer do not make direct contact to Fab35, suggesting that the binding interactions observed in our crystal structures represent most, if not all, of those in the native complexes between mAb35 and the full-length nAChR pentamer. However, it is known that antibodies in MG serum and mAbs bind mature and pentameric nAChR more tightly than the unassembled nAChR α1 monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merlie and Lindstrom, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conroy et al., 1990</xref>), and there is evidence that MIR plays an important role in initiating conformational maturation of subunits prior to their assembly into pentameric AChR receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>). Structural differences between monomeric α1 and α1 in a muscle nAChR heteropentamer could account for the different binding affinities. Although the N-terminal helix of the α1 subunit in the full length <italic>Torpedo</italic> nAChR has a significantly different orientation from that in the monomeric mouse/human α1 crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Unwin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dellisanti et al., 2007a</xref>), it is not clear if this structural difference, which may be due to the limited resolution (4 Å) of the full length <italic>Torpedo</italic> nAChR, is realistic and hence responsible for the different binding affinities. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that subtle structural differences between the monomeric and pentameric forms of mammalian nAChR α1 could affect the binding affinity, especially for MG autoantibodies, like mAb35, that are particularly conformation sensitive. Furthermore, the monomeric α1 may be more dynamic than its counterpart in the fully assembled pentamer, and the conformational flexibility could reduce the binding affinity through entropic effects.</p><p>Our studies reveal two structural insights into the antibody-nAChR interaction that may have important mechanistic and clinical implications. The first is the conservation of the key Fab35-binding residues in a number of nAChR family members, including α2, α3, α5 and β3. This observation suggests potential cross-reactivity of α1-derived MG antibodies to these nAChR family members. As discussed above, because many MIR-directed mAbs share the same binding residues on nAChR α1, this cross-reactivity may not be limited to mAb35, but can also occur among other MG autoantibodies. Consistent with this notion, it has been shown that some MG mAbs bind neuronal nAChR subunits. mAb35 was shown to bind chicken nAChR α3 and also suggested to bind human α2, α3, α5 and β3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conroy and Berg, 1995</xref>). Another MIR-directed antibody, mAb210, has been used to bind human α5 and β3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuryatov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 1996</xref>). The wide expression and diverse physiological functions of nAChR members within and outside the neuronal system are being increasingly recognized, raising an intriguing question whether the cross-reactivity of nAChR with autoantibodies has broader pathological effects than currently recognized.</p><p>The second is the structural basis of antibody-mediated receptor cross-linking. Our crystal structures reveal a well-defined orientation of the bound antibody with respect to the receptor due to the relatively rigid binding interface. Based on this structural feature, we modeled the complex of full-length nAChR pentamer bound by the intact MG antibody, which suggests that MG antibodies are unlikely to bind the two α1 subunits within the same muscle nAChR pentamer, but rather two α1 subunits from different pentamers, thereby cross-linking the nAChR receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tzartos et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conti-Tronconi et al., 1981</xref>). These modeling analyses provide a structural support for previous functional observations that MG antibody-mediated nAChR cross-linking accelerates the degradation of the receptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drachman et al., 1978</xref>). We further noticed that MG antibodies are unlikely to bind two nAChR pentamers oriented vertically on a flat membrane surface even when considering the hinge flexibility of the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Assuming that the nAChR pentamers in the membrane cannot be tilted freely, a potential effect of antibody-mediated receptor cross-linking is membrane curvature. This raises an intriguing question if such distortion of the membrane structure could play a role in the internalization and degradation of nAChRs at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>). While the detailed mechanisms by which antibody-mediated receptor cross-linking induces the receptor degradation remain to be elucidated, molecular mimicries of the MIR should prevent such cross-linking and degradation of nAChR by competitive binding to MG antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sophianos and Tzartos, 1989</xref>). Our studies suggest that it is possible to develop drug molecules to inhibit the binding of a large fraction of MG antibodies to nAChR and related pathological immune reactions, and the crystal structures presented here provide a basis for developing such drug molecules.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of the stabilized nAChR α1 ECD (= α211)</title><p>The mouse α211 construct was provided by Dr. Zuo-Zhong Wang, Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, Department of Cell and Neurobiology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California.

For each residue of nAChR α1 involved in antibody binding (Chain B/α211 listed in the first column), its interacting residues from the light chain (Chain C listed in the second column) and the heavy chain (Chain D listed in the third column) of Fab35 are listed in the corresponding row. Residues on the N-terminal helix is highlighted in yellow and residues on the MIR loop is highlighted in light green. Note that several nAChR α1 residues, including R6, K10, N68 and D71/Y72 (red font), contact a large number of antibody residues. These residues can be considered as ‘hotspots’ of the binding interface. Y72 can be considered as part of the Asp71 ‘hotspot’ (see the text).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Jon M Lindstrom (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript from Lin Chen's group describes structural efforts to understand the interactions of an antibody with the nicotinic receptor that can trigger myasthenia gravis (MG). The manuscript presents the first high resolution structure of a soluble extracellular domain of the alpha1 subunit of the nicotinic receptor in complex with a Fab fragment from the standard antibody known to cause experimental myasthenia gravis. The authors use the structure of this complex as a basis for speculation on the relative significance of different atomic interactions at the receptor-Fab interface in determining subunit specificity, and perform sequence comparisons and qualitative binding assays by native PAGE to test binding to the soluble extracellular domain of the alpha1 and alpha9 subunits. The authors then present a speculative mechanism suggesting that cross-linking of pentamers by the whole IgG could trigger membrane deformation, resulting in receptor internalization and eventually myasthenic syndrome.</p><p>The strengths of this manuscript and underlying work are in the introductory and structural sections. The authors lay out nicely the physiological background and significance, setting up the structural findings effectively. This piece of the study, alone, is impactful. We have some concerns about the refinement details, described below, but we do not expect those issues to change the overall interpretations or conclusions made in the manuscript. The following are essential revisions that are needed to improve the presentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The crystallographic statistics raise two issues that need to be addressed. First, for both datasets, there is an unacceptably large spread between R and Rfree (8.5-10%). This large spread suggests a high degree of model bias and inappropriate restraints used during refinement. This large spread is surprising given the relatively small spread between R and Rfree in the original alpha1-bungarotoxin complex structure from the same group (2.4% difference, PMID 17643119). Second, the Ramachandran statistics are poor; &gt;90% of the residues should be in the favored region, and good justification should be made for any residues in the outlier region. Strong electron density and/or comparison with higher resolution structures is a requirement for confidence in modeling a residue in an outlier conformation. Thus, regions with poor electron density should have better Ramachandran statistics, not worse, as suggested by footnote b in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The authors need to address these two issues either by improving the quality of the refined model or explaining why the statistics, as they currently stand, are justified. One way to improve model quality without too much effort might be using a reference model during refinement (phenix.refine makes this reasonably straightforward).</p><p>2) The mechanism suggested for pentamer cross-linking inducing curvature and thereby internalization and pathology is very speculative and needs to be toned down. The reference cited in the Discussion (Drachmann et al., 1978) on cross-linking and curvature does not, as far as we see, actually propose, test or validate a curvature mechanism. As the authors discuss, modeling of cross-linked pentamers is tentative, in part because it relies on the older EM model of the Torpedo receptor, which has a 'funny' alpha1 helix conformation compared to all other structures, and in part because Fabs/IgG's have a great deal of inherent flexibility. We request that you move <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and 7 to a single supplemental figure and to limit presentation of this hypothetical mechanism to a single paragraph in the Discussion section.</p><p>3) The manuscript would have been strengthened by the addition of mutants and binding assays to specifically interrogate the interface seen in the X-ray structure. Although we appreciate that this would require considerable additional work, the authors can and should bring in the literature to help support the interface they see in the structure, as Luo et al., 2009 and others have predicted some of the interactions seen in the present study.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structural insights into the molecular mechanisms of Myasthenia Gravis and therapeutic implications&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Kenton Swartz as Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as Senior editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) There is something funny going in paragraph four of the Discussion section. A part of one sentence appears to have been deleted.</p><p>2) It would be helpful for the authors to include a few remarks on the following two issues:</p><p>Although mAb 35 and mAb 198 are very similar in structure, other EAMG and MG antibodies that bind to this region may not be so similar or bind to identical epitopes. The high frequency of MIR antibodies in MG and EAMG sera was determined by competitive binding between mAbs with serum antibodies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> clearly illustrates how large Fab 35 is with respect to the extracellular domain of α 1. Large intact mAb 35 is likely to compete with intact large serum autoantibodies for binding in this region to nearby but somewhat different epitopes than are recognized by mAb 35. mAB 192 is a similar case. The relative size of an antibody and an AChR is nicely illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. The variety of epitopes in the main immunogenic region is an important factor relevant to the Discussion, paragraph two, about trying to treat MG with mimotopes or for developing epitope-specific diagnostics.</p><p>In the Results section it is noted that the N terminal α helix of α 1 in Torpedo AChR differs from that in Bellone, Tang, Milius and Conti-Tronconi, 1989. It is worth noting that Morell et al., 2014 shows that variations in MIR structure have large effects on ACh sensitivity. AChR sensitivity involves both ACh binding sites and transmembrane regions. The transmembrane regions are greatly effected by lipid. Solubilization of Torpedo AChRs puts them in an inactive conformation that can be corrected by reconstitution into the proper lipid composition (C daCosta and J Baenziger (2013) Cell Structure 21: 1271-1283). Most crystallized receptors are solubilized and consequently contact lipids partially or completely removed. The 5-HT3 receptor after solubilization was crystallized bound to nano bodies directed at its C loops that function as potent antagonists (Hasssaine et al. (2014) Nature 512: 276-281). This too may have global conformation consequences. Torpedo AChRs are unique in having had their structures determined in their native membrane. Of course, artifacts in their structural determination might also occur.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23043.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The crystallographic statistics raise two issues that need to be addressed.

We reprocessed human and mouse nAChR α1 ECD/α-Btx data up to 2.60 and 2.70 Å, respectively. The new data stats are listed in the Table 1. This time, we include the CC<sub>1/2</sub> (1)of the highest resolution shell. They are 0.568 and 0.537 for human and mouse nAChR α1 ECD/α-Btx data, respectively. We used multiple refinement programs (Phenix, autoBuster, and Remac5) to refine structures, and the final TLS and restrained refinement was performed with Refmac5 up to 2.61 Å resolution (<italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub>=20.7/26.0) for Fab35/Human nAChR α1 ECD/α-Btx and 2.70 Å resolution (<italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub>=22.8/26.9) for Fab35/Mouse nAChR α1 ECD/α-Btx. The R and R<sub>free</sub> spread is reduced to 4.1-5.3% [Previous R and R<sub>free</sub> gap was significantly large (8.5-10%).] The refinement stats are improved as well. Ramachandran statistics defined in MolProbity (2)shows 95.8 and 95.6% (&gt; 90%) of residues are in the favored region. There is no Ramachandran outliers.</p><p><italic>2) The mechanism suggested for pentamer cross-linking inducing curvature and thereby internalization and pathology is very speculative and needs to be toned down. The reference cited in the Discussion (Drachmann et al., 1978) on cross-linking and curvature does not, as far as we see, actually propose, test or validate a curvature mechanism. As the authors discuss, modeling of cross-linked pentamers is tentative, in part because it relies on the older EM model of the Torpedo receptor, which has a 'funny' alpha1 helix conformation compared to all other structures, and in part because Fabs/IgG's have a great deal of inherent flexibility. We request that you move <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and 7 to a single supplemental figure and to limit presentation of this hypothetical mechanism to a single paragraph in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments on the speculative nature of our hypothesis that nAChR pentamer cross-linking induces membrane curvature and receptor internalization. In our modeling analyses, we have considered the limited quality of the EM model of the Torpedo receptor and the unusual conformation of the alpha1 helix, and also the flexibility of the antibody structure. We are reasonably confident about the main structural features of the constructed model as discussed in the manuscript. However, in the absence of any experimental data and precedents, we agree that the hypothesis is indeed speculative. Reference #4 is cited to show previous studies indicating that the binding of nAChR by divalent MG antibodies rather than the monovalent Fab fragment leads to accelerated degradation of the receptor proteins. This is meant to support the idea that cross-linking of the nAChRs is a critical step in receptor degradation, not to test and validate a curvature mechanism. We have revised the manuscript as following to address this issue. First, we generated the full-length antibody-receptor complex model using a second template, the recently published human α4β2 nicotinic receptor (PDB ID, 5KXI, 3.94 Å resolution). Although the overall structure of this model is similar to that built on the Torpedo AChR template, the alpha1 helix in the α4β2 nicotinic receptor has a “normal” conformation as seen in other monomeric and pentameric nicotinic receptor proteins and homologues. As a result, the modeled full-length antibody-receptor complex has an antibody-receptor binding interface that closely resembles the Fab35/nAChR α1 interface observed in our experimentally determined structure. These improvements increase the confidence of the modeling analyses. Second, we have eliminated any description of the membrane curvature hypothesis in the Results section and Abstract, and modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to focus on the possible effect of neighboring subunits on the antibody-receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) and the structural basis of antibody-mediated receptor cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Third, we have placed reference #4 in the correct context. Finally, we have limited our discussion of the hypothetical model of antibody cross-linking induced membrane curvature to two sentences in the Discussion section and converted Figure 7 into two supplemental figures to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The manuscript would have been strengthened by the addition of mutants and binding assays to specifically interrogate the interface seen in the X-ray structure.

This can be found in the first two paragraphs of the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) There is something funny going in paragraph four of the Discussion section.

The variety of epitopes in the main immunogenic region is an important factor relevant to the Discussion, paragraph two, about trying to treat MG with mimotopes or for developing epitope-specific diagnostics.</italic> </p><p>This is a very important point relevant to epitope-specific MG therapies and diagnostics. Before our crystal structure, it has been suggested that EAMG and MG antibodies may bind epitopes different from MIR and that these MG antibodies may be competed off by mAb35 through steric effect rather than direct epitope competition (Luo et al., 2009). Our structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) indeed support this possibility, and we also mentioned that mAb192 may represent one such case (Discussion section, paragraph two). However, our structures also reveal that many MIR residues center at the antibody-receptor interface, and these MIR residues have been found to be important for the high affinity binding of a number of MG antibodies (e.g., mAb35, mAb210, and mAb132A). This is a rather surprising finding given the potential heterogeneity of nAChR antibodies mentioned above. Based on this observation, we suggest that molecular mimicries of the MIR and its immediate surrounding regions may be used to compete a large fraction of MIR-directed MG autoantibodies that share the same binding mechanism. We revised the manuscript to reflect both aspects of this point (Discussion section, paragraph two).</p><p><italic>In the Results section it is noted that the N terminal α helix of α 1 in Torpedo AChR differs from that in Bellone, Tang, Milius and Conti-Tronconi, 1989. It is worth noting that Morell et al., 2014 shows that variations in MIR structure have large effects on ACh sensitivity. AChR sensitivity involves both ACh binding sites and transmembrane regions. The transmembrane regions are greatly effected by lipid. Solubilization of Torpedo AChRs puts them in an inactive conformation that can be corrected by reconstitution into the proper lipid composition (C daCosta and J Baenziger (2013) Cell Structure 21: 1271-1283). Most crystallized receptors are solubilized and consequently contact lipids partially or completely removed. The 5-HT3 receptor after solubilization was crystallized bound to nano bodies directed at its C loops that function as potent antagonists (Hasssaine et al. (2014) Nature 512: 276-281). This too may have global conformation consequences. Torpedo AChRs are unique in having had their structures determined in their native membrane. Of course, artifacts in their structural determination might also occur.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the importance of the structural variations of the N-terminal α helix and the nearby MIR and are aware of the work described in reference 30. The suggestion that lipid may be a reason for the unique N-terminal α helix conformation observed in the Torpedo AChR is interesting. However, we feel that this is a complex question that is hard to resolve with information currently available. The packing interactions between the N-terminal helix and the MIR or MIR-equivalent region on various nAChRs and homologues are highly conserved. The strong chemical forces explain the highly conserved conformation between the N-terminal helix and the MIR or MIR-equivalent region on many published crystal structures of nAChRs and homologues. On the other hand, the Torpedo AChRs was solved by unique experimental approaches using native membrane. It is not entirely clear if the structural difference of the N-terminal helix is due to the membrane effect or intrinsic errors associated with different experimental techniques. Future studies may be needed to address this interesting and important questions. Because of this uncertainty, we modeled the full antibody-receptor complex using both the Torpedo AChrs and the a4b2 nAChRs to show that overall spatial arrangements of each components are similar regardless of the orientation of the N-terminal aloha helix. We have added one sentence to further clarify this point (paragraph two, subsection “Models of higher-order antibody-receptor structure”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
