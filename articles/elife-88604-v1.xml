Because segregating inversions suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci, they are also commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence. However, it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect, and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect. Here, we use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower: <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic>, <italic>Helianthus argophyllus</italic>, and <italic>Helianthus petiolaris</italic>, which each harbour a large number of species-specific inversions. We find evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species. This shows that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion. While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation, most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In plants, like in humans, DNA is arranged into sections known as genes that are in turn organised into structures called chromosomes. Mutations that modify the activity of these genes can help plant species to adapt to a new environment or to extreme conditions such as drought. However, successful adaptation often requires changes in many different genes. If these sets of genes are located close to each other on the same chromosome, any mutations will likely be passed onto the next generation together. If the genes are located further away, or even on different chromosomes, they may instead be inherited separately so that the next generation does not benefit as much from the adaptation.</p><p>A chromosome inversion – when a segment of chromosome breaks off and reattaches the other way around – can increase the likelihood that sets of mutations on the same chromosome will be inherited together. Many previous studies have found that chromosome inversions tend to drive the ability of species to adapt to different environments by keeping together mutations that affect the same characteristics. However, it is not clear how inversions affect the repeatability of the adaptation, that is, if another group of closely related plants faced the same challenge in their environment would they evolve in the same way, or would they evolve a new response?</p><p>To address this question, Soudi, Jahani et al. used a genetics approach known as a genome wide association study to explore how three closely related species of sunflower have adapted to their respective environments. Two of the species grow in various environments across the centre and west of the USA that are often hot and dry, whereas the third species is restricted to the more humid coastal plain of Texas, USA.</p><p>The experiments found that a few key genes had changed in all three sunflower species. However, each species also had mutations in a larger set of unique genes that were not changed in the other species. Regions of chromosomes harbouring inversions in one of the species tended to have more of the key genes within them, compared to other genomic regions. This was also true for species that did not have inversions in those regions. This demonstrates that genes in regions affected by chromosome inversions can still help plants adapt to changes in the environment even in the absence of inversions.</p><p>Sunflowers are widely grown for their edible oily seeds. In the future, some of the key genes identified in this work may be useful candidates for plant breeding to improve the resilience of sunflowers to drought, high temperatures and other environmental challenges.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sunflower</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd><kwd>inversions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The genetic basis of local adaptation is sometimes highly repeatable, with examples of large effect genes driving responses in multiple species, such as <italic>FT</italic> affecting flowering time in numerous plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Izawa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auge et al., 2019</xref>) or

Local adaptation can also be repeated for polygenic traits, with significant patterns of similar association found across many loci for comparisons of conifers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeaman et al., 2016</xref>), maize and its wild relative teosinte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tittes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohutínská et al., 2021</xref>), to name a few. While we have a growing number of examples of repeatability in the basis of adaptation, it is also interesting to know if species use different genes to adapt to the same selection pressure. Genotypic redundancy – the potential for many genotypes to yield a given phenotype – is one critical factor affecting the repeatability of adaptation, as high redundancy would be expected to result in lower repeatability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yeaman et al., 2018</xref>). Another critical factor affecting repeatability is shared standing variation, whether present due to introgression or incomplete lineage sorting. In either case, variants shared among lineages are much more likely to contribute to a repeated response than new mutations (MacPherson and Nuismer 2018; Ralph and Coop 2015). Consistent with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohutínská et al., 2021</xref> found that repeatability was negatively related to phylogenetic distance. While we are now accumulating more studies about the repeatability of adaptation, we still have very few examples and much remains unknown about the relative importance of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeaman, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Inversions have been implicated in local adaptation in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wellenreuther and Bernatchez, 2018</xref>), likely due to their effect to suppress recombination among inverted and non-inverted haplotypes, and thereby maintain linkage disequilibrium (LD) among beneficial combinations of locally adapted alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rieseberg, 2001</xref>; Noor et al. 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirkpatrick and Barton, 2006</xref>). This has been approached by models studying the establishment of inversions that capture combinations of locally adapted alleles present as standing variation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirkpatrick and Barton, 2006</xref>), as well as models examining the accumulation of locally adapted mutations within inversions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaal et al., 2022</xref>). If there is variation in the density of loci that can potentially contribute to local adaptation, inversions would be expected to preferentially establish and be retained in regions harbouring a high density of such loci (and this expectation would hold for both the capture and accumulation models). We would also expect to see stronger signatures of repeated local adaptation in such high-density regions. Despite mounting evidence of their importance in adaptation, it is unclear how inversions may covary with repeatability of adaptation among species. A fundamental parameter of importance in these models is the relationship between migration rate and strength of selection on individual alleles, which may not make persistent contributions to local adaptation without the suppressing effects of recombination if selection is too weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bürger and Akerman, 2011</xref>). If most alleles have small effects relative to migration rate and can only contribute to local adaptation via the benefit of the recombination-suppressing effect of an inversion, then we would expect little repeatability at the site of an inversion – other species lacking the inversion would not tend to use that same region for adaptation because selection would be too weak for alleles to persist. On the other hand, if some loci are particularly important for local adaptation and regularly yield mutations of large effect, with these patterns being conserved among species, repeatability within regions harbouring inversions may be substantial. Thus, studying whether adaptation at the same genomic region harbouring an inversion is observed in other species lacking the inversion can give insights about the underlying architecture of adaptation, and the evolution and maintenance of inversions.</p><p>Here, we explore the repeatability of local adaptation in three species of sunflowers, <italic>Helianthus annuus</italic>, <italic>Helianthus argophyllus,</italic> and <italic>Helianthus petiolaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which harbour large regions of suppressed recombination (‘haploblocks’), most of which are inversions, and are often associated with adaptive traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>H. annuus</italic>, the common sunflower, is the closest wild relative of cultivated sunflower, which was domesticated from it around 4000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blackman et al., 2011</xref>). Populations of <italic>H. annuus</italic> are distributed throughout the central and western United States and generally found on mesic soils, but can grow in a variety of disturbed or extreme habitats, such as semi-desertic or frequently flooded areas, as well as salt marshes. <italic>H. petiolaris</italic>, the prairie sunflower, prefers sandier soils, and ecotypes of this species are adapted to sand sheets and sand dunes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ostevik et al., 2016</xref>). Here we include samples from two subspecies: <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> ssp<italic>. petiolaris</italic>, which is commonly found in the southern Great Plains, and <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> ssp<italic>. fallax</italic>, which is limited to more arid regions in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heiser et al., 1969</xref>). <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> and <italic>H. annuus</italic> have broad and overlapping distributions throughout the central and western United States and appear to have adapted to similar changes in temperature, moisture, and photoperiod regimes. There is also evidence indicating <italic>H. annuus</italic> and <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> have likely been exchanging genes during much of their history of divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strasburg and Rieseberg, 2008</xref>), although partially isolated by strong pre- and post-zygotic barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sambatti et al., 2012</xref>). The third species, <italic>H. argophyllus</italic>, the silverleaf sunflower, is found exclusively in the southeast coast of Texas and includes both an early flowering ecotype on the coastal barrier islands and a late flowering ecotype inland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moyers and Rieseberg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>H. argophyllus</italic> is thought to have undergone cycles of sympatry and allopatry with <italic>H. annuus</italic> and <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> over time, but currently only overlaps with <italic>H. annuus,</italic> with thus overlap likely being a recent event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heiser, 1951</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sampling sites and phylogenetic relationship among surveyed species.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sampling locations of wild sunflower populations studied in this study, and (<bold>B</bold>) phylogenetic relationship of the four (sub-)species.

An inherent problem in studying the basis of local adaptation is accounting for the covariance between genome-wide population genetic structure and environment. When the selection pressure driving local adaptation tends to parallel a main axis of demographic expansion or isolation by distance, neutral alleles will have spatial patterns resembling those of causal alleles. Methods that do not correct for population structure have large numbers of false positives because allele frequencies at neutral loci tend to correlate with the environment more than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lotterhos and Whitlock, 2014</xref>). By contrast, methods that use structure correction tend to suffer from false negatives because the causal loci have similar patterns of allele frequency variation as the genomic background, and so their statistical signatures are decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeRaad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Booker et al., 2023a</xref>). When a non-corrected approach is applied to multiple species, the false-positive problem can be mitigated when testing for loci that contribute to repeated adaptation as the same gene should not tend to be a false positive in multiple species more often than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeaman et al., 2016</xref>). Here we use a conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach with structure correction to study the basis of phenotypes, which vary both within and among populations, and use an uncorrected approach to test association to environment, which only varies among populations (as all individuals within the same population have the same value of environmental variable). For the environmental association portions of the study, we also explore the effect of structure correction in some analyses to contrast the false-negative vs. false-positive problem inherent in each approach. We apply these approaches individually to <italic>H. annuus</italic>, <italic>H. argophyllus</italic>, and the two <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> subspecies, and make pairwise and higher-order comparisons among combinations of these four lineages to study repeatability.</p><p>Our overall aim is to characterize the extent of repeatability of local adaptation for different traits and environments and explore the importance of inversions and other factors that may drive differences in repeatability. This analysis builds upon the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>, which focused on the evolution of haploblocks within each species, but did not systematically study patterns of repeatability in signatures of association among species. We begin by using the strength of correlations between environment and phenotypes measured in a common garden to identify which environmental variables are likely driving local adaptation within each species, and use an index to quantify the relative similarity in these patterns among pairs of species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> for a schematic overview of methods and research questions). We then conduct genome-wide association tests to identify regions most strongly associated with phenotypes and environments within each species. To assess the similarity in these association statistics among species, we use methods similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeaman et al., 2016</xref> to identify regions of the genome that exhibit greater similarity in signatures of association among pairs of lineages than expected by chance, which are likely driven by repeated adaptation using the same genes (but not necessarily the same alleles). We then explore how the number and total size of these regions of repeated association covary with the index of similarity in environmental importance. We also explore whether these regions of repeated association tend to covary with patterns of shared standing variation and test if they are enriched within previously identified haploblocks to explore the role of inversions in adaptation. We then identify candidate genes that show particularly strong signatures of repeated association across multiple lineages. Finally, based on the number of signatures of association that are shared vs. non-shared among lineages, we estimate the number of regions genome-wide that could potentially contribute to local adaptation for each variable and phenotype, which is related to the genotypic redundancy. Taken together, our results show that local adaptation in sunflowers tends to involve both strong repeatability at a small number of genes, often associated with inversions, coupled with high redundancy and non-repeated responses across a much larger number of loci.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Local adaptation at the phenotypic level</title><p>The four taxa vary considerably in the breadth of environmental variation spanned by their respective ranges, with <italic>H. annuus</italic> spanning the widest niche and <italic>H. argophyllus</italic> spanning the narrowest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To quantify the similarity among pairs of species in the strength of local adaptation at the phenotypic level (and to later compare this to results at the genomic level), we calculate an index we refer to as the similarity in phenotype–environment correlation (SIPEC), which is maximized when both species have strong correlations (in either direction) between a phenotype and environmental variable (see ‘Materials and methods’). For each environmental variable, we take the maximum value of SIPEC across all phenotypes as a relative measure of the importance of the variable for driving local adaptation in both species (such that when SIPEC is low, the variable is not a strong driver of phenotypic adaptation in at least one of the two species).

To identify windows of repeated association (WRAs) between pairs of species, we then assessed whether top candidate windows identified in one focal taxon also tended to be enriched for strong signatures of association to the same environment or phenotype in each of the other taxa (using the null-W test, which tends to be more sensitive than just finding the overlap between the top candidate windows; see ‘Materials and methods’). As recombination rate can affect the sensitivity of these kinds of window-based genome scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Booker et al., 2020</xref>), the identification of WRAs was conducted after binning windows by recombination rate, although in many cases we did not observe substantial differences in the null distributions among these bins (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>).

While we find significantly more WRAs than the 5% expected by chance, ranging from 6.3 to 44.1% (mean = 14.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>), multiple factors can violate the assumptions of this test and increase the proportion of windows classified as WRAs. Most importantly, similarity in signatures of association can be driven by shared ancestral variation or ongoing introgression, and this must always be considered as an alternative explanation. It is clear that most regions of the genome harbour some shared standing variation between all six pairwise comparisons of the taxa, whether due to segregating ancestral variation or introgression, based on an index quantifying the proportion of shared to non-shared SNPs in each window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). However, we do not find consistent differences in the amount of shared standing variation within windows when comparing WRAs with the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). Thus, while introgression may make subtle contributions to WRAs, a lack of increased shared standing variation in the significant windows suggests that it is not a primary driver of these patterns.</p><p>A second source of inflation in the number of WRAs is due to hitchhiking: if a given locus is a true positive driving adaptation, LD with other windows in tight physical linkage will result in spurious correlations causing them to also be classified as WRAs increasing the genome-wide proportion above 5%, and this effect will be particularly exaggerated in haploblocks. To control for this, we binned neighbouring WRAs together that exhibited high LD (&gt;95th percentile) over short spans of the genome (&lt;1 cM) in either species, yielding regions we refer to as clusters of repeated association (CRAs). While this clustering method should provide a partial control for the effect of hitchhiking, we note that the number of CRAs cannot be taken as a reliable estimate of the number of independent targets of natural selection. Instead, we treat the number and size of these CRAs as proxies for the relative genome-wide similarity in association between each pair of species, and conduct downstream analyses to test hypotheses about the factors driving local adaptation.</p><p>CRAs varied in number and size across the six pairwise-species comparisons, with particularly large CRAs identified at the sites of known haploblocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>). For CRAs identified for phenotypic associations, their extent ranged from 168 clusters spanning 48,524,903 bp (covering only 1.6% of the genome) in <italic>H. argophyllus-H. pet. petiolaris</italic> to a maximum of 1667 clusters spanning 426,409,647 bp (14.2% of the genome) in <italic>H. pet. petiolaris-H. pet. fallax</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>). CRAs identified for environmental variables tended to be more numerous and cover a larger region of the genome, varying from 1154 clusters comprising 15% of the total genome for <italic>H. argophyllus-H. pet. fallax</italic> up to 2260 distinct clusters covering 29% of the genome between <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> subspecies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>). The large extent of the genome covered by CRAs is mainly driven by their occurrence within many different haploblocks, which tend to be unique to each species and cover substantial portions of their genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>). Genes within CRAs tend to be enriched for a large number of GO terms spanning many different categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">10</xref>). When we use an approach that corrects for population structure in the genotype–environment association tests (BayPass), we find substantially reduced numbers of CRAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>). This reduction is likely due to reduced power to detect true positive causal loci when population structure covaries with environment, as true positives do not ‘stand out’ relative to the genomic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Booker et al., 2023a</xref>). While single-species association tests without correction for population structure typically yield large numbers of false positives, the null-W test comparing association results across species accounts for the chance that the same region is a false positive in both species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeaman et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Repeated association in the genome reflects patterns at the phenotypic level</title><p>If natural selection is driving repeated patterns of local adaptation in the genomes of two species, we should see greater similarity for associations with environmental variables that are also strongly associated with phenotypic variation in both species. Consistent with this prediction, we found that environmental variables with a high maximum SIPEC index (i.e. high correlation between environment and some axis of phenotypic variation in both species; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>) also tended to have a larger number of CRAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), with higher repeatability at both the phenotype and genome level for temperature-related variables and much lower repeatability for soil-related variables (with similar patterns for mean SIPEC index; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>). Unfortunately, given the non-independence of environmental variables there is pseudo-replication in these data so it is not possible to conduct a formal significance test of these patterns. In all cases, the number of CRAs exhibited a weak negative relationship with the index of standing variation, with environmental variables that had the greatest number of CRAs having the lowest relative amounts of shared standing variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref>). This suggests that the observed similarity in patterns of association among species is not being strongly driven by incomplete lineage sorting or introgression, as we would expect a positive relationship between the index of shared standing variation and the number of CRAs. We found similar but weaker patterns in the association between SIPEC and size of CRAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>). The weakening of these patterns relative to those for number of CRAs may reflect comparatively greater contribution of haploblocks driving patterns with size rather than number (i.e. if a particularly large haploblock is a CRA, then that variable will have a particularly large value relative to its actual importance for local adaptation).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Relationship between maximum similarity in phenotype–environment correlation (SIPEC) and number of clusters of repeated association (CRAs).</title><p>SIPEC was calculated for each phenotypic principal component analysis (PCA) axis, with the maximum taken across the axes that cumulatively explain 95% of the phenotypic variance for each environment.

If a given species exhibits a signature of association to environment at a segregating inversion, it is interesting to test whether similar signatures of association are found in other species that lack a segregating inversion at the same region of the genome. This would suggest that particularly strong selection is acting on loci in this region, as signatures of association can still evolve even without the recombination suppressing effect of the inversion. While not all of the low-recombination haploblocks identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todesco et al., 2020</xref> have been validated as inversions, for simplicity we treat each haploblock as representative of a segregating inversion. The majority of these haploblocks are present as segregating variation in only one of the three species, but when they occur in <italic>H. petiolaris</italic>, they tend to be found as segregating variation within both subspecies. Thus, if we find significant enrichment of the regions of repeated association (WRAs and CRAs) within haploblocks, this suggests that both the species with a segregating inversion and the species lacking an inversion are using this region of the genome to drive local adaptation. As a first test of this relationship, we assessed two-way contingency tables for whether top candidate windows within a species were also significant WRA (WRA/non-WRA) and whether they fell within haploblocks (yes/no). This approach controls for the potential enrichment of top candidate windows within haploblocks relative to the rest of the genome and asks if the proportion of WRAs within haploblocks is even higher than non-WRA top candidate windows. For most phenotypes and environments, we found that the proportion of WRAs occurring within haploblocks was much higher than the proportion of non-WRAs occurring within haploblocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Across all species comparisons and environmental/phenotypic variables, a total of 310 contrasts showed significant enrichment for WRAs in haploblocks compared to only 23 contrasts showing a significantly higher proportion of non-WRAs in haploblocks (note that because of non-independence of the phenotypes and environmental variables, there is pseudo-replication inherent in these estimates). In <italic>H. argophyllus</italic>, while non-WRA top candidates tended to fall within haploblocks less commonly than in the other taxa, WRAs tended to be very strongly enriched within haploblocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As a follow-up, we also tested whether CRAs were enriched within haploblocks (without controlling for whether top candidate windows also tended to be enriched), also finding strongly significant enrichment of CRAs within haploblocks for many traits and environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7C and D</xref>).

Here, we have shown evidence of significant repeatability in the basis of local adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), but also an abundance of species-specific, non-repeated signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>). In particular, we find that regions of the genome that harbour inversions in one species also tend to be strongly enriched for signatures of association in other species lacking the inversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together, this suggests that local adaptation in these species is highly flexible – different species apparently use quite different sets of loci to adapt to the same environment – yet still involves some component that has minimal redundancy, with inversions playing a particularly important role.

Inversions are commonly associated with local adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wellenreuther and Bernatchez, 2018</xref>), likely because they reduce the rate at which recombination breaks up combinations of co-selected alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirkpatrick and Barton, 2006</xref>), which perhaps facilitates contributions by alleles that would be individually too weakly selected to overcome swamping by migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bürger and Akerman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeaman and Whitlock, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaal et al., 2022</xref>). Evidence here suggests these regions still tend to contribute to adaptation in the species lacking the recombination-suppressing effect of an inversion, consistent with a strong effect of selection relative to migration on at least one locus in the region (rather than adaptation exclusively via many alleles of small effect; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeaman, 2022</xref>). As an example, chromosome 15 harbours a large (72 Mbp) haploblock in <italic>H. annuus</italic> that is strongly associated with NFFD, and also shows some signatures of association in the other taxa, with particularly strong signatures of association on either side of the haploblock in <italic>H. argophyllus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, loci of repeated association identified by PicMin within this region include two genes whose homologs are known to regulate responses to cold: <italic>COLD-RESPONSIVE PROTEIN KINASE 1</italic>,<italic>CRPK1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2017</xref>) and <italic>LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL</italic>, <italic>LHY</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mizoguchi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dong et al., 2011</xref>). It seems likely that strong selection relative to migration is therefore acting upon several loci in this region, and in many others harbouring inversions.</p><p>The observed repeatability associated with inversions further supports the local adaptation model as an explanation for the long-term persistence of segregating inversions (at least in sunflower), rather than mechanisms based on dominance or meiotic drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rieseberg, 2001</xref>). If there is variation across the genome in the density of loci with the potential to be involved in local adaptation, then the establishment and maintenance of inversions would be biased towards regions harbouring a high density of such loci under this model. If the genomic basis for local adaptation is conserved amongst species, then these same regions are more likely to have high repeatability. Thus, our observation of genomic regions harbouring inversions also being enriched for WRAs is consistent with this general model for inversion evolution. Unfortunately, our observations do not provide much insight into whether inversions evolve through the capture (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirkpatrick and Barton, 2006</xref>) or accumulation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaal et al., 2022</xref>) type of model as either model would be consistent with our results. Most of the sunflower inversions are &gt;1 My old, and therefore predate any current local adaptation patterns, but likely do not predate the genes underlying local adaptation (which appear to be shared among the species we studied). As for the alleles underlying local adaptation, they may be younger than the inversions, but as our work suggests, these regions are prone to harbouring locally adaptive alleles, so it is possible that they also harboured other ancestral locally adaptive alleles. While many studies have demonstrated the importance of inversions for adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wellenreuther and Bernatchez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hager et al., 2022</xref>), to our knowledge only two other studies have documented the involvement of the same loci making contributions in the absence of the recombination-suppressing effect of the inversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coughlan and Willis, 2019</xref>). This also highlights how comparative studies of a species lacking an inversion may help identify which genes are driving adaptation in another species with an inversion, as segregating inversions tend to have extensive LD that prevents identification of any potential targets of natural selection within them.</p><p>While our results suggest a large number of loci can potentially contribute to adaptation, implying high redundancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>), there are several factors that complicate inference. Separating the effects of drift and selection to detect signatures of local adaptation is notoriously difficult because population structure often covaries with features of the environment that drive adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lotterhos and Whitlock, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoban et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeRaad et al., 2021</xref>). As found by other analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeaman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeRaad et al., 2021</xref>), when we use structure correction in our genotype–environment association tests, we find many fewer signatures of repeated association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>), likely due to the reduced power of BayPass to detect true positives when the environment covaries with population structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Booker et al., 2023a</xref>). Here, we have side-stepped the issues involved in correction for population structure by instead relying on comparisons among species to identify loci with associations more extreme than expected by chance in multiple species, using the null-W and PicMin tests. This assumes that most loci in the genome are not involved in local adaptation, so that the relatively small proportion that are driving adaptation can therefore be picked out due to their tendency to fall into the tail of the distribution of association statistics in at least one other species (which would only occur at the rate of random chance under a purely neutral model). While this approach should be relatively robust for identifying loci with repeated patterns of adaptation, there is no way to formally estimate significance of associations found in only a single species, many of which may be false positives due to covariation of population structure and environment. However, even if we assume that 80% of the observed non-repeated loci are false positives, we still find that estimates of the effective number of loci contributing to adaptation (<italic>L<sub>eff</sub></italic>) are in the hundreds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig15">Appendix 1—figure 15C</xref>). As we are unable to detect loci of small effect due to the limited power, but these loci still likely make important contributions to heritability, our estimates of <italic>L<sub>eff</sub></italic> will also be biased downwards by excluding these potentially important drivers. Finally, it is also difficult to exclude the contribution of introgression or incomplete lineage sorting to the observed signatures of repeated association. If a locus tended to be highly introgressed between two species in a restricted region of their range, it is possible it could also covary with environment and therefore result in a signature of repeated association that would be mistakenly interpreted as adaptation. While it is difficult to preclude this from our analysis, regions of the genome with signatures of repeated association do not tend to have higher levels of shared standing variation than background regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>), suggesting that this is not a broad explanation for our observations. If anything, shared standing variation would be expected to increase repeatability of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">MacPherson and Nuismer, 2017</xref>), adding further weight to the inference that there is high genotypic redundancy in these species.</p><p>In general, we find that temperature is the strongest driver of repeated adaptation at both the phenotypic and genomic levels. We quantified local adaptation at the phenotypic level using correlations between traits measured in common gardens and the home environment of the population they were sampled from. Across all phenotypes, these correlations tended to be strongest and most similar among species for temperature variables, particularly in comparisons among <italic>H. annuus</italic> and <italic>H. petiolaris</italic> subspecies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). We see similar patterns of repeatability reflected in the genome, where temperature variables also tend to have the greatest repeatability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The similarity in these phenotypic and genomic signatures is consistent with an effect of strong selection as other artefactual or drift-based explanations for repeatability would not be expected to reflect patterns found at the phenotypic level. It should be noted that the reduced importance of soil variables in the SIPEC index might be partly driven by the fact that all traits were measured on above-ground features due to the difficulty of getting non-disruptive phenotypic measurements for roots.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that some fraction of the genome contributes to adaptation with low redundancy and high repeatability (which tends to be enriched within genomic regions where there exist inversions in at least one species), while the remainder of the adaptive response is driven by loci with high redundancy and species-specific contributions. Theoretical models of adaptive evolution necessarily involve simplified representations of genetics: population genetic approaches explore cases where strong selection deterministically drives a change in allele frequency at one or a few loci (usually without epistasis), whereas quantitative genetic approaches make the infinitesimal assumption that phenotypic change can be realized through small frequency changes at many loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barghi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeaman, 2022</xref>). Such models implicitly make quite different assumptions about redundancy: if a population genetic model of directional selection includes no epistasis, then it is implicitly assuming there is no redundancy as every locus can increase fitness and no locus can affect the potential of another locus to increase fitness. On the other hand, quantitative genetic models implicitly assume complete redundancy as the loci driving trait variation have interchangeable effects. Given that differences in redundancy result in quite different evolutionary dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hollinger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yeaman, 2022</xref>), it is important to re-evaluate the behaviour of theoretical models in light of what we can learn about redundancy from empirical data. Our results suggest that adaptation is a complex process that does not map cleanly onto the assumptions of either approach. At least some component of trait variation experiences sufficiently strong selection and has low enough redundancy to drive the significant signatures of repeatability above the random null that we observe here. On the other hand, most of the strongest signatures of association are specific to a single species, implying high redundancy for most of the genome, even if there are still some detectable signatures of repeatability. Such observations may be consistent with classifying loci into ‘core’ and ‘peripheral’ sets similar to the omnigenic model, but would involve classification based on redundancy rather than gene expression, as advocated by Boyle et al. (2017). Theoretical models adopting a two-class representation of the genetic basis of trait variation may provide more realism than models assuming a simpler distribution, and perhaps yield new insights about qualitatively different dynamical behaviour. Given the difficulty of rigorously quantifying the contribution of alleles of small effect and loci contributing to local adaptation in only one species, it remains an open question what proportion of adaptive response is governed by loci with dynamical behaviour that follow the infinitesimal assumption. This could perhaps be quantified explicitly by decomposing heritabilities for traits driving local adaptation, as has been done for standing variation in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Visscher et al., 2017</xref>), but this would require a considerable increase in sample size as methods such as GCTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2011</xref>) do not yield accurate estimates at the sample sizes used here. Future work could perhaps resolve this question using multi-generational crossing designs to break up the LD that tends to accompany local adaptation, allowing a more accurate parsing of the effect sizes of genomic regions and the contribution by repeated vs. redundant components of adaptive trait variation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data collection, common garden, and phenotyping</title><p>Seed samples were collected from 151 wild sunflower populations covering most of their native distributions during the summer of 2015 (<italic>H. annuus</italic>: 61 populations for GWAS and 71 populations for GEA; <italic>H. petiolaris fallax</italic>: 23 populations; <italic>H. petiolaris petiolaris:</italic> 18 populations; and <italic>H. argophyllus</italic>: 30 populations, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

This SIPEC index is maximized when the correlation between a phenotype and an environmental variable is large in both species regardless of the direction, so it does not differentiate phenotypically convergent vs. divergent patterns of local adaptation (e.g. increasing temperature causing an increase in flowering time in one species and a decrease in the other), and provides a means of estimating the relative importance of an environment driving local adaptation in both species in a similar way across all measured phenotypes. To account for non-independence among traits, for each pair of species we fit a PCA to all measured phenotypes and use the principal components that collectively explain 95% of the variance, and calculate SIPEC on the correlations of each of these axes with environment. For comparisons including <italic>H. argophyllus</italic>, 95% of the variance was typically explained by 8–10 PC axes (out of 28 or 29 phenotypes), whereas for comparisons among other taxa this included 21 or 22 PC axes (out of 65 or 66 phenotypes). We then report the maximum and mean value of SIPEC for each environmental variable across these phenotypic PCA axes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Tests of SNP association with environment (GEA) and phenotype (GWAS)</title><p>A total of 39 environmental variables (21 climatic variables, 3 geographic variables, 15 soil variables; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were used for the genotype–environment association analysis (GEA). We refer to the climatic, soil, and geographic variables collectively as the ‘environmental variables’ for simplicity. Soil data were collected by taking 3–5 soil samples collected at each population from across the area in which seeds were collected and submitted to Midwest Laboratories Inc (Omaha, NE) for analysis. Climate data for each population were collected over a 30-year period (1961–1990) from geographic coordinates of the locations where the samples were collected using the software package Climate NA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). We used the package BayPass version 2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gautier, 2015</xref>), which provides a re-implementation of the Bayesian hierarchical model, and explicitly accounts for the covariance structure among the population allele frequencies that originate from the shared history of the populations through the estimation of the population covariance matrix. This renders the identification of SNPs subjected to selection less sensitive to the confounding effect of population demography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunther and Coop, 2013</xref>). Population structure was estimated by choosing a random and unlinked set of 10,000 SNPs and running BayPass under the core model (i.e. no covariates). Then the Bayes factors (BF) were calculated running BayPass under the STD covariate model to evaluate association of SNPs with environmental variables (i.e. adjusting for population structure). For each SNP, the Bayes factor (denoted BF<sub>is</sub> as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gautier, 2015</xref>) was presented in deciban units (db) via the transformation 10 log<sub>10</sub> (BF). BF<sub>is</sub> relies on the importance sampling algorithm proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunther and Coop, 2013</xref> and uses MCMC samples obtained under the core model. To produce a narrower set of outlier loci, we followed the popular Jeffreys’ rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeffreys, 1961</xref>) that identified outlier loci with BF ≥ 10. As genome scan methods that correct for population structure can remove some potential signals of local adaption when there is covariation between the demographic history of the species and the environmental variables or phenotypic traits of interest, we also calculated Spearman’s rank correlation (ρ, uncorrected GEA) between population allele frequencies for each SNP and each environment variable.</p><p>GWAS analysis was performed on 86, 30, and 69 developmental and morphological traits in <italic>H. annuus, H. argophyllus,</italic> and <italic>H. petiolaris,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Population structure was controlled for in GWAS by including the first three principal components as covariates, as well as an identity-by-state (IBS) kinship matrix calculated by EMMAX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kang et al., 2010</xref>).

For every SNP/peak above the Bonferroni significance threshold, candidate genes were selected within a 100 kb interval centred in the SNP with the lowest p-value, or within the boundaries of the GWAS peak, whichever was larger. All variants used for association were initially filtered for VQSR 90% tranche, and then further filtered to only include bi-allelic SNPs genotyped in ≥90% of samples and with a minor allele frequency ≥3%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Identification of top candidate windows</title><p>We calculated the bottom 0.05 quantiles for the p-values from association tests, Spearman’s rank correlation (uncorrected GEA), and GWAS (corrected and uncorrected), yielding two 5% cutoffs. For each environmental and phenotypic variable, we identified all outlier SNPs as those that fell below the respective 5% cutoff. For BayPass, we considered SNPs with BF ≥ 10 as outlier SNPs. For each 5 kb window that we defined across the whole genome, we counted the number of outlier SNPs (<italic>a</italic>) and the total number of SNPs (<italic>n</italic>). To identify top candidate windows for each variable, we compared the number of outlier SNPs per each 5 kb window to the 0.9999 quantile of the binomial expectation where the expected frequency of outlier SNPs per window is calculated as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (summation over all 5 kb windows), calculating <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> independently for each environmental and phenotype variable and excluding windows with 0 outliers from the calculation of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeaman et al., 2016</xref>).

Therefore, to account for local recombination rate variation, all genomic windows were binned by their estimated recombination rates into five equally sized bins (bin1: 0–20% quantile; bin2: 20–40% quantile; bin3: 40–60% quantile; bin4: 60–80% quantile; bin5: 80–100% quantile). For each recombination bin, we estimated expected frequency of SNPs per window (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>ρ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) and calculated cutoff separately. Windows falling above the threshold were identified as top candidate windows.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Genome-wide survey of repeatability (null-W test)</title><p>To explore repeatable genomic signatures of adaptation for each of the six pairwise contrasts among the four taxa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we used the method developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeaman et al., 2016</xref> with some modifications. A common approach is to identify candidates for adaptation independently in each species and then examine the overlap between these lists; however, this approach is quite stringent and may miss many interesting signals. The null-W test is more sensitive as it takes the list of top candidates from one species and tests whether they tend to show more extreme signatures of association than expected by chance. The null-W test is especially favourable when LD increases divergence of SNPs in tight linkage with causal SNPs but does not raise the test values enough for a window to be classified as an outlier according to the binomial test. For each top candidate window that we identified for each focal species in a pair, we refer to the same window in the other species as ‘top candidate ortholog’. The null distribution for each focal species and variable was constructed by randomly sampling 10,000 background SNPs from non-top candidate ortholog windows. For each non-top candidate window, we then estimated the test statistic (<italic>W</italic>) for the Wilcoxon signed-rank test vs. the 10,000 background SNPs. This resulted in a null distribution representing the differences between the 10,000 background SNPs and the non-top candidate ortholog windows.

Empirical p-values were then calculated by comparing the Z-score for each top candidate window to the null distribution. When individual windows had values of W that exceeded the bounds of the null distribution, their empirical p-value was set to the reciprocal of the number of genes in the null distribution.

To construct the null distribution, we generated a distribution of LD measurements between 10,000 randomly chosen windows with the same physical distance as between two significant WRAs (excluding all WRAs from the null distribution). If the <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> between the two neighbouring significant WRAs was greater than the 95th percentile of the null distribution, we clustered these two windows together. This process was repeated successively with the next closest neighbouring significant WRA, walking out along the chromosome until one of two stopping criteria was reached: (1) the LD between the last two windows did not exceed the 95% of the tail distribution or (2) the distance between the initial window and the current window next to it was larger than 1 cM, based on the linkage map from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>. When the first round of clustering stopped due to either of these two criteria, all the clustered windows were removed from the dataset and the process started with the second smallest empirical p-value.

We calculated the Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> statistic on this table and then permuted the location of haploblocks throughout the genome to construct a null distribution of χ<sup>2</sup> statistics, and calculated the p-value as the proportion of the null that exceeded the observed χ<sup>2</sup> statistic (to account for non-independence of nearby WRAs), which is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Secondly, we compared observations of the length and number of overlapping regions to expectations based on a randomization approach. For each pair of species, we kept the position of each CRA constant and randomized the position of haploblocks 10,000 times to build a null distribution. By keeping the position of the CRAs constant, we maintained the architecture of adaptation independent from chromosomal rearrangements. We assessed significance by testing whether the observed overlaps between CRAs and haploblocks were more extreme than the 95th percentile of the tail of null distribution, which is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>.

Briefly, for a given trait or environment, the set of association test scores within each species is classified into ‘associated’ or ‘non-associated’ using the binomial top candidate approach. For a given pair of species (<italic>i</italic> = 1, 2), the observed number of associated windows in each species (<italic>a</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>a</italic><sub>2</sub>) can be compared to the number of windows that are associated in both species (<italic>a<sub>b</sub></italic>) and the total number of windows being analysed (<italic>a<sub>x</sub></italic>). Under a null hypothesis where all windows in the genome have equal potential to be involved in adaptation (i.e. associated with the trait or environment), the expected number of windows associated in both species will be described by a hypergeometric distribution, with the expectation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> . The difference between the observed and expected amount of overlap in association scores can be quantified as a C-score by scaling the difference by the standard deviation of the hypergeometric (i.e. a C-score of 2 means that the observed amount of overlap is 2 standard deviations above the expectation under randomness).</p><p>We assess the C-scores for each phenotype and environment trait by classifying the top 0.5% of all 5 kb windows within each species as ‘associated’ (<italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic>; based on the binomial top candidate index), and begin by calculating the C-score obtained when <italic>a<sub>x</sub></italic> is set to the union of <italic>a<sub>i</sub></italic> across all four focal species/sub-species (i.e. only those windows associated in at least one species are included in <italic>a<sub>x</sub></italic>, a number much lower than the total number of windows in the genome). This yields a negative C-score as a random draw from such a small number of windows tends to yield many more overlapping associations by chance than the observation. When the C-score = 0, it means that the observed overlap between the pair of taxa being considered is consistent with a random draw of their respective ‘associated’ windows from an overall pool of <italic>a<sub>x</sub></italic> windows. Thus, by adding rows to the matrix with ‘non-associated’ scores for all four species/sub-species until finding the matrix that yields C-score = 0, we can estimate the effective number of loci that contributed to variation for the trait or environment being considered (<italic>L<sub>eff</sub></italic>), under the assumption that all such <italic>a<sub>x</sub></italic> = <italic>L<sub>eff</sub></italic> windows had an equal chance of contributing to the associations.</p><p>To run the C-score analysis on LD-clustered windows, we ran the following algorithm for each trait/environmental variable: for each species, we identified all CRAs that also had a top candidate index in top 0.5%. In most cases, a large cluster with associated windows in one species corresponds to either no clusters or a small cluster in another species. To harmonize cluster boundaries across species, we bin any overlapping clusters together to their maximum extent and take the average top candidate index for each cluster in each species as either (a) the mean across all windows that were ‘associated’ in that species or (b) the average across all windows associated in any species, if no windows were associated in that species. This yields a matrix that can be submitted to the hypergeometric C-score analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Visualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Visualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Tables showing phenotypes and environmental variables for all sampled individuals and populations, as well as legends for details associated with each variable (reproduced from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-88604-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-88604-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All scripts used for analysis and figures are deposited in a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.wpzgmsbtd">Dryad Digital Repository</ext-link>.

study, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todesco et al., 2020</xref> for details). Briefly, all libraries were sequenced at the Genome Quebéc Innovation Center on HiSeq2500, HiSeq4000, and HiSeqX instruments to produce paired end, 150 bp reads (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries with a low number of reads were re-sequenced to increase genome coverage. After quality filtering (see below), a total of 60.7 billion read pairs were obtained. Illumina adapters and poor quality reads were hard-clipped using Trimmomatic (v0.36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>).

PCR duplicates were marked and removed using picard MarkDuplicates 2.9.3. Genomic regions containing transposable elements (~3/4 of the sunflower genome) were excluded to reduce computational time and improve variant quality. Genotyping for each species was performed independently as joint genotyping on the whole ensemble of samples was computational impractical. GATK’s VariantRecalibrator (v4.0.1.2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van der Auwera and O’Connor, 2000</xref>), which filters variants in the call set according to a machine learning model inferred from a small set of ‘true’ variants, was used to remove low-quality calls and produce a dataset of a more manageable size. In the absence of an externally validated set of known sunflower variants to use as calibration, we computed a stringently filtered set from top-N samples with highest sequencing coverage for each species (N = 67 for cultivated sunflower and N = 20 for wild sunflower species). The stringency of the algorithm in classifying true/false variants was adjusted by comparing variant sets produced for different parameter values (tranche 100.0, 99.0, 90.0, 70.0, and 50.0). For each cohort, results for tranche = 90.0 were chosen for downstream analysis, based on heuristics: the number of novel SNPs identified, and improvements to the transition/transversion ratio (towards GATK’s default target of 2.15).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>Remapping sites to the HA412-HO reference genome</title><p>As described with details by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Todesco et al., 2020</xref>, haploblock analysis highlighted contig ordering issues with the XRQv1 reference assembly (see below). To overcome this, all sites were transferred to a new reference, HA412-HOv2, which used Hi-C for contig and scaffold ordering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Belton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marie-Nelly et al., 2014</xref>). To do this, the 200 bp of reference sequence flanking each site in XRQv1 were extracted and aligned to HA412-HOv2 using BWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li, 2013</xref>). These alignments were filtered for mapping quality &gt;40 and the HA412-HOv2 position for the variant site was extracted. Since all remapped sites were not in repetitive regions and had passed VQSR filtering, remapping success rate was high (96–98%). Whenever mapping suggested two different variants on the XRQv1 genome were in the same position on the HA412-HOv2 genome, likely due indels and imprecise alignment, one site was shifted by 1 bp so that they did not overlap. Remapping was preferred to de novo read alignment and variant calling against the HA412-HOv2 assembly because of the prohibitive amount of computational time that would have required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3"><title>Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of regions with repeated association</title><p>Genes that overlapped with CRAs associated with environmental and phenotypic variables were screened for enrichment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms.

To me, your results point to the fact that though inversions are often presented as important for local adaptation, they seem to be highly contingent on the context of adaptation in each species. First, repeatability results are only at the window/gene level in your results, the specific mutations are not under scrutiny. Is it possible that inversions are only necessary when sets of small effect mutations are used, opposite to a large effect mutation in other species? Additionally, in a model with epistasis, fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the genomic background and it is possible that inversions were necessary in only certain contexts, even for the same mutations, i.e. some adaptive path contingency. Finally, do you have specific demographic history knowledge in this system that maps to the observations of the presence of inversions or not? For example, have the species &quot;using&quot; inversions been subject to more gene flow compared to others?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the great suggestions and helpful comments. Regarding the question of demography, each of the species actually harbours quite a large number of haploblocks (13 in H. annuus spanning 326Mb, 6 in H. argophyllus spanning 114 Mb, and 18 in H. petiolaris spanning 467 Mb; see Todesco et al. 2020 for more details) so there does not seem to be any clear association with demography. We agree about the complexities that might underly the evolution of inversions that you outline above, and have refined some of the text where we discuss their evolution in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study the authors sought to understand the extent of similarity among species in intraspecific adaptation to environmental heterogeneity at the phenotypic and genetic levels.

For example, in Figure 4 there is a range of SIPEC from 0 to 0.03 for most species pairs, with some pairs only as high as ~0.01. This does not appear to be a high degree of similarity in phenotype-environment correlation. For example, given the equation on line 517 for a single phenotype, if one species has a phenotype-environment correlation of 1.0 and the other has a correlation of 0.02, I would postulate that these two species do not have similar evolutionary responses, but the equation would give a value of (1+0.02)<italic>1</italic>0.02/1 = 0.02 which is pretty typical &quot;higher&quot; value in Figure 4. I also question the logic behind using absolute values of the correlations for the SIPEC, because if a trait increases with an environment in one species but decreases with the environment in another species, I would not predict that the genetic basis of adaptation would be similar (as a side note, I would not question the logic behind using absolute correlations for associations with alleles, due to the arbitrary nature of signing alleles). I might be missing something here, so I look forward to reading the author's responses on these thoughts.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a very good point about the range of SIPEC, and we have changed our analysis to reflect this, now reporting the maximum value of SIPEC for each environment (across the axes of the PCA on phenotypes that cumulatively explain 95% of the variance), in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures S2 and S13. For consistency among manuscript versions and to illustrate the effect of this change, we retain the mean SIPEC value in one figure in the supplementary materials (S12), which shows the small effect of this change on the qualitative patterns. Figure 4 now shows that the maximum SIPEC value is regularly quite strong, which should address the reviewer’s concern that this is not being driven by anomalous and small values. We appreciate this point and think this change now more closely reflects how we are trying to estimate the biological feature of interest – that some axis of phenotypic space is strongly (or not) responding to selection from the environmental variable.</p><p>With respect to the logic behind using absolute value, we still feel this is justified for traits, because if a trait evolves to be bigger or smaller, it may still use the same genes. For example, flowering time may change to be later or earlier, which would result in opposite correlations with a given environment, but might use the same gene (e.g. FT) for this. As such, we think keeping absolute value is more representative as otherwise species with strong but opposite patterns of adaptation would look like they were very different. We have added a statement on line 584 in the methods section to further clarify the reason for this choice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An additional potential problem with the analysis is that from the way the analysis is presented, it appears that the 33 environmental variables were essentially treated as independent data points (e.g. in Figure 4, Figure 5). It's not appropriate to treat the environmental variables independently because many of them are highly correlated. For example in Figure 4, many of the high similarity/CRA values tend to be categorized as temperature variables, which are likely to be highly correlated with each other. This seems like a type of pseudo replication and is a major weakness of the framework.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and we fully agree. It is for this reason that we didn’t present any p-values or statistical tests of the overall patterns that are shown in these figures (i.e. the linear relationship between SIPEC and number of CRAs in figure 4 and the tendency for most points to fall above the 1:1 line in figure 5). But to make sure this is even more clear, we have added statements to the captions of these figures to remind readers that points are non-independent. We still feel that in the absence of a formal test, the overall patterns are strongly consistent with this interpretation. A smaller number of non-pseudo-replicated points in Figure 4 would still likely show linear patterns.

We have tried to clarify that this is our aim in various places in the manuscript. Our analysis for Figure 5 is the one supporting these claims, and it uses the Chi-square test statistic to assess the number of WRAs and non-WRAs that fall within vs. outside of inversions, and a permutation test to assess the significance of this observation, for each environmental variable and phenotype. We don’t think that this test has any direction to it – it’s simply testing if there is non-random association between the levels of the two factors. Thus, we think the wording we have used is consistent with the test result and our aims.

As described above, we do not understand why we can’t claim that repeated signatures are enriched within haploblocks. We thought the reviewer is perhaps referring to the fact that the points are pseudo-replicated in the figures due to environment? We note that a very large number of points are significantly different from random in terms of the distribution of WRAs within vs. outside of haploblocks (light- vs. dark-shaded symbols), and that almost all of them fall above the 1:1 line. While there may be pseudo-replication preventing a test of the bigger multi-environment/multi-species hypothesis across all phenotypes and environments, there is almost a complete lack of significant results in the other direction. This seems like quite strong evidence about enrichment of WRAs within haploblocks, across many environments/species contrasts. We have added some text to the description of patterns in figure 5 to try to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation, most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species.&quot; (Abstract)</p><p>Figure 3B certainly makes it look like there is very little similarity among species in the genetic basis of adaptation, which leaves the question as to how important the repeated signatures really are for adaptation if there are very few of them.

We think that both interpretations are possible: that most of the regions of the genome that are driving adaptation are non-repeated, but that a small but significant proportion of regions driving adaptation are repeated above what would be expected at random. Thus, it seems that there is high redundancy, coupled with adaptation via some genes that seem particularly functionally important and non-redundant, and therefore repeated.

I found the paper quite hard to follow, and got fairly lost in the various layers of analyses done. Partially, this represents the complexity of empirical genomic data, which rarely deliver simple stories of convergence at a few genes. However, the properties of the various statistics used to detail local adaptation and convergence are not particularly clear and the figures presented were not intuitive representations of the data. This leaves the reader with an incomplete view of how much weight to put in the various lines of evidence marshaled. I would suggest simplifying the presentation of the results considerably.

It is the load created by these alleles being constantly maintained in the face of migration and subsequent recombination that allow an inversion to be selected for because it keeps together locally adapted alleles. Thus these models predict that there could well be standing local adaptation at these loci in the absence of the inversion in other species, and that these locally adapted alleles while not fixed may be at high frequency. (After establishment, inversions housing locally adapted alleles, can shield more weakly, locally beneficial alleles from migration allow other alleles to build up.) Empirically it's interesting to find signals of local adaptation in other species that don't contain putative inversions. But the logic of the different predictions is not particularly clear from the introduction, and only becomes somewhat clearer in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this murkiness, we have re-written portions of both the Introduction and Discussion to clarify this aspect.</p><p>From the introduction:Inversions have been implicated in local adaptation in many species (Wellenreuther and Bernatchez 2018), likely due to their effect to suppress recombination among inverted and noninverted haplotypes, and thereby maintain LD among beneficial combinations of locally adapted alleles (Rieseberg 2001; Noor et al. 2001; Kirkpatrick and Barton 2006). This has been approached by models studying the establishment of inversions that capture combinations of locally adapted alleles present as standing variation (e.g., Kirkpatrick and Barton 2006), as well as models examining the accumulation of locally adapted mutations within inversions (e.g., Schaal et al. 2022). If there is variation in the density of loci that can potentially contribute to local adaptation, inversions would be expected to preferentially establish and be retained in regions harbouring a high density of such loci (and this expectation would hold for both the capture and accumulation models). We would also expect to see stronger signatures of repeated local adaptation in such high density regions. Despite mounting evidence of their importance in adaptation, it is unclear how inversions may covary with repeatability of adaptation among species. A fundamental parameter of importance in these models is the relationship between migration rate and strength of selection on individual alleles, which may not make persistent contributions to local adaptation without the suppressing effects of recombination if selection is too weak (Yeaman and Whitlock 2011; Bürger and Akerman 2011). If most alleles have small effects relative to migration rate and can only contribute to local adaptation via the benefit of the recombination-suppressing effect of an inversion, then we would expect little repeatability at the site of an inversion – other species lacking the inversion would not tend to use that same region for adaptation because selection would be too weak for alleles to persist. On the other hand, if some loci are particularly important for local adaptation and regularly yield mutations of large effect, with these patterns being conserved among species, repeatability within regions harbouring inversions may be substantial. Thus, studying whether adaptation at the same genomic region harbouring an inversion is observed in other species lacking the inversion can give insights about the underlying architecture of adaptation, and the evolution and maintenance of inversions.</p><p>From the Discussion:The observed repeatability associated with inversions further supports the local adaptation model as an explanation for the long-term persistence of segregating inversions at least in sunflowers, rather than mechanisms based on dominance or meiotic drive (Rieseberg 2001). If there is variation across the genome in the density of loci with the potential to be involved in local adaptation, then the establishment and maintenance of inversions would be biased towards regions harbouring a high density such loci under this model. If the genomic basis for local adaptation is conserved amongst species, then these same regions are more likely to have high repeatability. Thus, our observation of genomic regions harbouring inversions also being enriched for WRAs is consistent with this general model for inversion evolution. Unfortunately, our observations do not provide much insight into whether inversions evolve through the capture (e.g. Kirkpatrick and Barton 2006) or accumulation (e.g. Schaal et al. 2022) type of model, as either model would be consistent with our results. Most of the sunflower inversions are &gt;1 My old, and therefore predate any current local adaptation patterns, but likely do not predate the genes underlying local adaptation (which appear to be shared among the species we studied). As for the alleles underlying local adaptation, they may be younger than the inversions, but as our work suggests, these regions are prone to harbouring locally adaptive alleles so it is possible that they also harboured other ancestral locally adaptive alleles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As a minor comment, there's a fair number of places where a more nuanced view of the field is needed, e.g.:</p><p>&quot;Models in evolutionary genetics tend to focus on extremes: population genetic approaches explore cases where strong selection deterministically drives a change in allele frequency&quot; --This seems like a strange strawman. Population genetic models span a huge parameter range. The empirical approaches of looking for sweeps by detecting genome-wide statistical outliers is predicated on strong selection, but there are numerous papers that have looked for signals of weak selection genome-wide.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point, we have changed our wording here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Comments</p><p>My main comment on the manuscript is that the different levels and diversity of analyses are slightly hard to follow on the first, and even second, read.
