involved are poorly understood. Here, we report that Kindlin-1 promotes anti-tumor immune evasion in mouse models of breast cancer. Deletion of Kindlin-1 in Met-1 mammary tumor cells led to tumor regression following injection into immunocompetent hosts. This was associated with a reduction in tumor infiltrating Tregs. Similar changes in T cell populations were seen following depletion of Kindlin-1 in the polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyV MT)-driven mouse model of spontaneous mammary tumorigenesis. There was a significant increase in IL-6 secretion from Met-1 cells when Kindlin-1 was depleted and conditioned media from Kindlin-1-depleted cells led to a decrease in the ability of Tregs to suppress the proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which was dependent on IL-6. In addition, deletion of tumor-derived IL-6 in the Kindlin-1-depleted tumors reversed the reduction of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Overall, these data identify a novel function for Kindlin-1 in regulation of anti-tumor immunity, and that Kindlin-1 dependent cytokine secretion can impact the tumor immune environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>IL6</kwd><kwd>anti-tumor immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C157/A24837</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Webb</surname><given-names>Emily R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C157/A29279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Webb</surname><given-names>Emily R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dodd</surname><given-names>Georgia L</given-names></name><name><surname>Noskova</surname><given-names>Michaela</given-names></name><name><surname>Bullock</surname><given-names>Esme</given-names></name><name><surname>Muir</surname><given-names>Morwenna</given-names></name><name><surname>Frame</surname><given-names>Margaret C</given-names></name><name><surname>Serrels</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name><name><surname>Brunton</surname><given-names>Valerie G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New roles in anti-tumour immunity for the adhesion protein Kindlin-1 via regulation of cytokine secretion and T cell regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kindlin-1 is a four-point-one, ezrin, radixin, moesin (FERM) domain-containing adaptor protein that localises to focal adhesions, where it plays an important role in controlling integrin activation via binding to integrin Î² subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rognoni et al., 2016</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding Kindlin-1, <italic>FERMT1,</italic> leads to Kindler Syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis that causes skin atrophy, blistering, photosensitivity, hyper or hypo-pigmentation, increased light sensitivity and an enhanced risk of developing aggressive squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guerrero-Aspizua et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lai-Cheong et al., 2009</xref>). However, Kindlin-1âs role in cancer is complex as it can also have a tumor-promoting role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rognoni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhan and Zhang, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In breast cancer, Kindlin-1 expression is higher in tumor <italic>versus</italic> normal breast tissue and its expression is associated with metastasis-free survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azorin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sin et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with its recognised role in regulating integrin-extracellular matrix interactions, Kindlin-1 controls both breast cancer cell adhesion, migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azorin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarvi et al., 2018</xref>). Kindlin-1 also regulates TGFÎ² signaling and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sin et al., 2011</xref>). We have previously shown in the polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyV MT)-driven mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis, that loss of Kindlin-1 significantly delays tumor onset and reduces the incidence of lung metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarvi et al., 2018</xref>). Mechanistically, Kindlin-1 stimulates metastatic growth in this model via integrin-dependent adhesion of circulating tumor cells to endothelial cells in the metastatic niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarvi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Kindlin-1 has also been shown to regulate inflammation in the skin of Kindler syndrome patients, where a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines are upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinemann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier et al., 2016</xref>), and increased expression of genes associated with cytokine signaling have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">ChacÃ³n-Solano et al., 2019</xref>). Progressive fibrosis of the dermis that follows inflammation in Kindler Syndrome is consistent with enhanced cytokine signaling, and the resulting âactivationâ of fibroblasts leads to enhanced extracellular matrix deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinemann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">ChacÃ³n-Solano et al., 2019</xref>). Although inflammatory cytokines can play an important role in tumor progression, it is not known whether, and if so how, Kindlin-1 regulation of inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment influences tumor growth. Here we report that Kindlin-1 promotes an immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic microenvironment in a mouse model of breast cancer. Specifically, genetic deletion of the gene encoding Kindlin-1 leads to a reduction in tumor infiltrating Tregs and impairment of their immune-suppressive activities, and the generation of an immunological memory response. This implicates Kindlin-1 in a previously unrecognised function of immune-modulation in the breast cancer microenvironment in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of Kindlin-1 leads to tumor clearance and immunological memory</title><p>We used a syngeneic model in which <italic>Fermt1</italic> had been deleted in the Met-1 murine breast cancer cell line (Kin1-NULL) and to which either wild type Kindlin1 (Kin1-WT), or a mutant that is unable to bind Î²-integrin (Kin1-AA) were reintroduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarvi et al., 2018</xref>). Tumor growth was monitored following subcutaneous injection of cells into both CD-1 nude immune-compromised and FVB (syngeneic) mice. Loss of Kindlin-1 led to reduced tumor growth in CD-1 nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) with significant differences in tumor size noted from day 10 onwards. A similar reduced tumor growth rate in CD1 nude mice was seen following injection of human MDA-MB-231 cells in which Kindlin-1 was depleted using shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In both cell models loss of Kindlin-1 had no effect on in vitro cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), while immunohistochemical analysis of Ki67 and phospho-histone H3 in tumors showed there was no effect on proliferation in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast when Met-1 cells were injected into immune competent FVB mice, although Kindlin-1 loss led to a similar delay in tumor growth at day 10, there was complete tumor regression by day 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Thus, Kindlin-1 is required for tumor growth of Met-1 cells in mice with a functional immune system, similar to what we reported previously for FAK-deficiency in a mouse model of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serrels et al., 2015</xref>). Growth of the Kin1-AA mutant-expressing tumors was indistinguishable from Kin1-WT tumors in both CD1 nude and FVB mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref> respectively), implying that integrin dependent functions of Kindlin-1 are not important for the growth of Met-1 tumors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of Kindlin-1 leads to tumor clearance and immunological memory.</title><p>(<bold>A, C</bold>) Met-1 Kin1-WT, Kin1-NULL or Kin1-AA tumors were established via subcutaneous injection into flanks of CD1 nude mice (<bold>A</bold>) or FVB mice (<bold>C</bold>).

Following regression of Kin1-NULL tumors, mice were re-challenged with either Kin1-WT or Kin1-NULL cells on day 35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Neither Kin1-WT nor Kin1-NULL cells grew palpable tumors in mice which had been pre-challenged with Kin1-NULL cells, while injection of Kin1-WT or Kin1-NULL cells into naive mice on the same day showed normal tumor growth and survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). These data suggest that deletion of Kindlin-1 promotes effective immunosurveillance, resulting in tumor regression and lasting immunological memory. Furthermore, the inability of Kin1-WT cells to give rise to tumors in mice previously harbouring a Kin1-NULL tumor suggests that Kindlin-1 does not regulate key antigens permitting T-cell tumor recognition and effective immunosurveillance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of Kindlin-1 modulates tumor associated myeloid populations</title><p>To understand how loss of Kindlin-1 promotes immunosurveillance, flow cytometry was used to profile the immune landscape of Kin1-WT and Kin1-NULL tumors at 10 days post tumor challenge. The percentages of major myeloid subsets were quantified within the tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Of note there were significantly reduced CD45<sup>+</sup> cells within Kin1-NULL tumors, alongside a reduction in both monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, no significant differences were observed in expression of the phenotype markers MHC II, CD206 and SIRPÎ±, between Kin1-WT and Kin1-NULL tumor-associated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that there is no change in the âpolarisationâ status of these cells. Although there was no difference in total dendritic cell (DC) percentages, analysis of DC subsets demonstrated a significant increase in conventional type I DCs (cDC1) within Kin1-NULL tumors compared to Kin1-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). cDC1s are efficient at cross presentation, essential for CD8<sup>+</sup> responses and have been demonstrated to be important for anti-tumor immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laoui et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we observed increased expression of the T-cell co-stimulatory molecule CD80 on DCs in Kin1-NULL tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), and increased expression of the T cell inhibitory PD-1 receptor ligand PD-L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Additionally, analysis of bulk tumor RNA demonstrated an increase in antigen presentation (<italic>H2-Q2</italic> and <italic>H2-Eb1</italic>) and antigen transport (<italic>Tap2</italic>) related genes within Kin1-NULL tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). An increase in <italic>Ifng</italic> was also seen in the Kin1-NULL tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), consistent with increased expression of IFNÎ³-inducible PD-L1, and MHC/Antigen processing genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garcia-Diaz et al., 2017</xref>). These data suggest that loss of Kindlin-1 may result in increased cross-presentation of tumor antigen by DCs, promoting T-cell activation and anti-tumor immunity. Despite an increase in PD-L1 protein expression noted on cDC1 cells, overall PD-L1 gene (<italic>Cd274</italic>) expression was found to be decreased on CD45<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from both tumors and draining lymph nodes (dLN) of Kin1-NULL tumors, compared to Kin1-WT tumors, although this did not reach significance in the tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Analysis of a publicly available human breast cancer data set (METABRIC), demonstrated a small but significant correlation between <italic>FERMT1</italic> (Kindlin-1) and <italic>CD274</italic> (PD-L1) gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Together these data show that loss of Kindlin-1 can lead to modulation of PD-L1 expression on tumor infiltrating immune cells, suggesting that the PD-1/L1 pathway may contribute to the anti-tumor immune response.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Loss of Kindlin-1 reduces tumor associated macrophages and increases cDC1 dendritic cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Met-1 Kin1-WT or Kin1-NULL tumors were established via subcutaneous injection in FVB mice, and harvested at day 10 for immunophenotyping by flow cytometry.

We found no significant changes in memory marker expression on non-Treg CD4<sup>+</sup> cells; however, an increase in naÃ¯ve (CD62L<sup>+</sup> CD44<sup>-</sup>) CD8<sup>+</sup> cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, a significant increase in CD62L<sup>+</sup> Treg cells was evident within Kin1-NULL tumors when compared to Kin1-WT tumors at day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A corresponding reduction in CD62L<sup>-</sup> Treg proportions were also noted. CD62L<sup>+</sup> Treg cells have been categorised into resting Tregs, with reduced proliferative capacity, whereas CD62L<sup>-</sup> populations are reported to be activated Tregs with increased suppressive capacity, and accumulation of these cells into tumors drives CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huehn et al., 2004</xref>). The switch in the prominence of these two subsets in the Kin1-NULL tumors suggests that more resting Tregs are present compared to Kin1-WT tumors. We found minimal changes in activation (PD-1<sup>+</sup> TIM-3<sup>-</sup>) and exhaustion (PD-1<sup>+</sup> TIM-3<sup>+</sup>) markers on effector (or CD62L<sup>-</sup> Tregs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) non-Treg T cells.

MMTV-PyV MT mice were crossed with mice in which exons 4 and 5 of the <italic>Fermt1</italic> gene were flanked with LoxP1 recombination sites, and in which Cre recombinase was expressed in the mammary epithelium under transcriptional control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarvi et al., 2018</xref>). Tumors that formed were collected from MMTV-PyV MMTV-Kin-1<sup>wt/wt</sup> (MT-Kin-1<sup>wt/wt</sup>) and MMTV-PyV MMTV-Kin-1<sup>fl/fl</sup> (MT-Kin-1<sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice and immune cell populations analyzed.

Furthermore, there was a reduction of PD-L1 expression on CD45<sup>+</sup> cells in MT-Kin-1<sup>fl/fl</sup> tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B</xref>), as well as reduced PD-L1 on several myeloid subsets, demonstrating modulation of the PD-L1 pathway in Kindlin-1-deficient tumors also in this spontaneous breast cancer model.</p><p>Analysis of T cell subsets demonstrated significant reduction of T cells in MT-Kin-1<sup>fl/fl</sup> tumors as a percentage of total cells when compared to MT-Kin-1<sup>wt/wt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3C</xref>), although there was large variability between animals. This may be due to the asynchronous growth characteristics of the spontaneous MMTV model, with some of the mammary tumors enveloping nearby lymph nodes as they progress. Of note, total CD3 infiltration of these tumors was lower than in the Met-1 model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). However, when analyzed as a percentage of total CD3<sup>+</sup> cells, MT-Kin-1<sup>fl/fl</sup> tumors had significantly fewer Treg cells with an increase in percentage of non-Treg CD4<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3D</xref>), that was similar to the Met-1 cell-line-derived tumor model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). These data demonstrate immune modulation upon the loss of Kindlin-1 tumor expression in distinct models of breast cancer, with consistent changes in Treg and cDC1 cells resulting from Kindlin deficiency. However, in the MT-Kin-1<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice we do not see tumor regression, which most likely reflects the incomplete loss of Kindlin-1 in the mammary tumor cells in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarvi et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Kindlin-1 knock-out cells modulate Treg phenotype and function</title><p>As Tregs, which drive suppression of effector T cell function, were observed to be reduced in number in Kin1-NULL tumors, assessment of immunosuppressive pathways was conducted. Analysis of RNA from CD45<sup>+</sup> tumor infiltrating cells isolated from Kin1-WT and Kin1-NULL tumors was carried out which showed a reduction of various T cell inhibitory checkpoint pathway related genes, including <italic>Cd274, Vsir and Havcr2</italic> in Kin1-NULL tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). As many of these suppressive receptor pathways are known to be utilised by Treg cells for effector cell suppression, we next addressed whether Kindlin-1 deficiency leads to widespread disruption of Treg phenotype and function. Detailed Treg profiling from the Met-1 cell line derived tumors at day 10 by flow cytometry, was carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4BâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Of note, downregulation of TNF superfamily co-stimulatory receptors GITR, 4-1BB and OX40 was observed in Kin1-NULL infiltrating Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A, D</xref>), which are critical for Treg development and promoting their proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Willoughby et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alissafi et al., 2019</xref>). Expression of the inhibitory receptors LAG-3, CTLA-4, TIGIT and PD-1 were also downregulated on the surface of Tregs in Kin1-NULL tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B, D</xref>). Although ligation of these receptors in CD8<sup>+</sup> and non-Treg CD4<sup>+</sup> cells inhibits effector function, these receptors are crucial for Treg differentiation and immunosuppressive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alissafi et al., 2019</xref>). There was significant downregulation of both CD73 and CD39 expression on Tregs from Kin1-NULL tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C, D</xref>). The CD39/CD73 pathway is a major modulator of Treg activity via metabolism of ATP to create extracellular adenosine, in turn inhibiting effector T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonioli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allard et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that loss of Kindlin-1 may cause metabolic changes in Treg cells, resulting in impairment of their suppressive capacity. Despite these phenotypic changes, there was no overt modulation of Treg proliferation seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Taken together, downregulation of these phenotypic markers suggests that Tregs from Kin-1 NULL tumors could be less immunosuppressive, and therefore allow development of a sufficient anti-tumor immune response, leading to tumor clearance. To that end, analysis of activation markers on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was assessed. Although, we have previously shown little modulation of CD8<sup>+</sup> cell number and expression of PD-1 and TIM-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), this expanded panel allowed for assessment of CD8 activation in greater depth. There was an increase in expression of OX40, CD83 and CD29 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrating Kin1-NULL tumors compared to those in Kin1-WT tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These receptors are associated with activated T cells and an increase in cytotoxic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Willoughby et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nicolet et al., 2020</xref>).To confirm this, analysis of CD107a expression (degranulation marker) and Granzyme B expression (cytotoxic granule) demonstrated a marked and significant increase in expression of these two markers on CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells in Kin1-NULL tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Together, these data suggest that loss of Kindlin-1 causes a reduction in Treg suppressive function, which can enhance the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells, leading to reduced tumor growth.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Loss of Kindlin-1 modulates Treg phenotype and function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Met-1 Kin1-WT or Kin1-NULL tumors were established via subcutaneous injection in FVB mice, and harvested at day 10 for RNA analysis of isolated CD45<sup>+</sup> cells using Nanostring Immune Exhaustion panel.

We therefore focussed on IL-6 as previous studies have demonstrated the importance of IL-6 in influencing the differentiation of naÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimura and Kishimoto, 2010</xref>) and Treg suppressive function in various settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garg et al., 2019</xref>).

Here we show that Kindlin-1 can also regulate breast cancer progression by modulating the anti-tumor immune response through regulation of the immune composition of the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Kindlin-1 is part of a family of proteins consisting of Kindlin-1,â2, and â3. They bind Î² integrin subunits and are required for integrin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rognoni et al., 2016</xref>) with most studies reporting their integrin-dependent roles in cellular phenotypes, such as cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. However, integrin-independent functions of Kindlin-1 have also been reported, where it can initiate downstream signaling independently of integrin adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rognoni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Patel et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we used a mutant of Kindlin-1 (Kin1-AA) that cannot bind Î² integrins, which we have previously shown leads to reduced levels of activated Î²1 integrin and integrin-dependent adhesion in Met-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sarvi et al., 2018</xref>). We show that the ability of Kindlin-1 to bind integrins is not required for the growth of Met-1 tumors, or their immune clearance in immunocompetent animals. Furthermore, the secretion of both IL-6 and CXCL13 was not altered by the ability of Kindlin-1 to bind Î²1 integrins, supporting a role for secreted cytokines in driving the integrin-independent immune changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Redundancy between Kindlin-1 and Kindlin-2 has been reported in relation to integrin-dependent functions, where they have overlapping roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azorin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2011</xref>). However, in the Met-1 cell line model we used here, we saw no change in Kindlin-2 expression following depletion of Kindlin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), implying that an increase in Kindlin-2 is not driving the effects on immune cell populations and anti-tumor immunity. Interestingly, Kindlin-2 has been reported to control the recruitment of immunosuppressive (F4/80<sup>+</sup>, CD206<sup>+</sup>) macrophages in orthotopic breast cancer models; Kindlin-2 in the tumor cells is required for the secretion of colony-stimulating factor-1 that acts as a chemoattractant for the macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sossey-Alaoui et al., 2017</xref>). Although we observed a reduction in macrophages in the Met-1 tumors lacking Kindlin-1, analysis of phenotypic markers (MHC II, SIRPÎ±, and CD206), did not suggest any changes in their âpolarisationâ.</p><p>Our previous work has demonstrated the importance of the focal adhesion protein FAK in regulating anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serrels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Serrels et al., 2017</xref>), which is driven in part by transcriptional regulation of cytokine production. Here we show that Kindlin-1 can also alter cytokine production leading to changes in the immune environment. However, for IL-6 (and CXCL13) this is not controlled at the level of transcription. Although <italic>Il6</italic> is primarily regulated via transcription the secretion of IL-6 is also regulated by other processes including via trafficking through the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Revelo et al., 2019</xref>). Further studies are required to establish how Kindlin regulates IL-6 secretion, although Kindlin-dependent regulation of integrin trafficking has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Margadant et al., 2012</xref>). Of note is the observation that IL-6 secretion is also increased from keratinocytes from Kindler syndrome patients that lack Kindlin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qu et al., 2012</xref>), although its function is not known.</p><p>Although IL-6 has well-known pro-tumorigenic roles, a number of studies have demonstrated the importance of IL-6 in reducing Treg suppressive function in various settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garg et al., 2019</xref>), and also in the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimura and Kishimoto, 2010</xref>). Here, we show that the Kindlin-1-dependent regulation of IL-6 secretion controls the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and the ability of Tregs to suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation in vitro, while also regulating Treg numbers in the tumor microenvironment. We also saw an IL-6 dependent reduction in Granzyme B production, and degranulation of cytotoxic T cells. As Granzyme B is an important cytotoxic molecule secreted alongside Perforin in granules by activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in order to induce apoptosis of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Voskoboinik et al., 2015</xref>), these data imply that Kindlin-1 can impair the ability of T cells to mediate tumor cell killing. However, the inability of IL-6 blockade to impact on the clearance of Kin1-NULL tumors means that other mechanisms of immune regulation are also involved. Indeed, in addition to widespread downregulation of numerous functional markers on Tregs in Kindlin-1-depleted tumors that are required for their activation and suppressive activity, an increase in cDC1 cell numbers was also observed in Kindlin-1-depleted tumors. These cells are a subset of dendritic cells that express CD103 and are capable of efficient cross-presentation of antigens to both CD4 and CD8 T cells. They have also been implicated in generation of T-cell-driven anti-tumor immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laoui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Noubade et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, loss of Kindlin-1 impacts several immune cell types that are known to contribute to anti-tumor immunity and future studies will explore how other factors act in concert with IL-6 to drive anti-tumor immunity in response to Kindlin-1 depletion.</p><p>In summary, we provide novel mechanistic insight into how Kindlin-1-expressing tumors can evade immune destruction. As Kindlin-1 is upregulated in breast cancer and linked to survival, targeting Kindlin-1-dependent pathways linked to immune phenotypes may provide a novel strategy to increase the efficacy of immunotherapies in breast cancer, particularly methods relating to reinvigorating the anti-tumor T cell response.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Met-1 cells were originally acquired from B.

The cytokine assay was carried out in microarray format using validated capture/detection antibody pairs (R&amp;D Systems). For each sample, a selected panel of 64 capture antibodies was printed as four-replicate sub-array sets on a single nitrocellulose-coated glass slide (Supernova Grace Biolabs). Each sample was incubated overnight with a 64 sub-array slide. After washing and blocking each sub-array was incubated with the appropriate biotin-labelled detection antibody. A final incubation with fluorescently labelled streptavidin followed by slide scanning using an InnoScan710IR scanner (Innopsys) generated array images. Images were analyzed and signals quantified using Mapix software (Innopsys). Only proteins which were determined to be above background binding were further analyzed. All values were normalised to protein concentration, and calculated as fold change over the mean of Kin1-WT values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>NaÃ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> differentiation assay</title><p>Spleens and lymph nodes (inguinal, axillary, brachial, and mesenteric) were harvested from FVB/N mice, minced and passed through a 70 Î¼m strainer. After washing, cells were incubated in RBC lysis buffer to remove red blood cells and resuspended in PBS + 0.5% BSA + EDTA. 1x10<sup>8</sup> cells were used to isolate by negative selection naive (CD44<sup>-</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells using Mouse naive CD4<sup>+</sup> cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotech) following manufactures instructions. 96-well plates were coated overnight in anti-CD3 antibody (7.5 Î¼g/ml; cat# 100340), and anti-CD28 (2 Î¼g/ml; cat#), TGFÎ² (1 ng/ml; cat#763102) and IL-2 (5 ng/ml, cat# 575402; All Biolegend) were added along with T cell media (RPMI, 10% FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, 0.5% Penicillin-Streptomycin). For CXCL13 blocking, anti-CXCL13 antibody (Biolegend; cat# 934503) was added. 5x10<sup>4</sup> cells per well were added, and stimulated for 5 days in the presence of either Kin1-WT, Kin1-NULL, Kin1-NULL IL-6 NULL or Kin1-NULL IL-6 CTRL conditioned media (30%).

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Kindlin-1 controls anti-tumor immunity by regulating T-regs in breast cancer mouse models&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> in its present form.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers found your study uncovering a novel role for the adhesion protein Kindlin-1 in regulating anti-tumor immunity in breast cancer interesting. But they also concluded that the manuscript lacks in vivo confirmation of the mechanism and that extensive additional data is required to support the central hypothesis.</p><p>However, should further revisions allow you to improve the paper by addressing the issues raised by the reviewers, we will be happy to consider the revised paper, which will be considered as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors have elucidated how Kindlin-1 loss impairs breast cancer growth. They have shown that genetic deletion of Kindlin-1 reduces the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating Tregs in the breast tumor microenvironment. It also severely impacted their immune-suppressive abilities, which helped in the generation of immunological memory. Moreover, Kindlin-1 deletion upregulates IL-6 production, which decreases the immune-suppressive activity of Tregs thereby, reduces breast tumor growth. The authors present intriguing observations, and the findings are well supported by the data, however, the data lacks some important mechanistic details. Overall, the study will be of substantial interest to researchers engaged in basic and clinical sciences.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here the authors show that the deletion of Kindlin-1 in tumor causes a delay in its growth and reduces overall tumor burden. This effect was more pronounced in T cell sufficient hosts compared to the T cell deficient ones. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that tumor infiltrating T cells are controlled, at least in part, by Kindlin-1. Although the authors present some phenotypical changes in the DC and T cell compartments, it is still unclear whether these changes account for an altered anti-tumor T cell activity. Furthermore, the authors claim that the effect is possibly driven by increased IL-6 in the TME in the absence of Kindlin-1, however, in vivo data supporting this claim are missing. While the overall effects of the lack of tumor derived Kindlin-1 is interesting, how this regulates T cell activity and which mechanism(s) are responsible remain elusive due to insufficient evidence.</p><p>Figure 1 -</p><p>To prove that the deletion of Kindlin-1 promotes lasting immunological memory, have the authors also rechallenged Kindlin WT group with Kindlin WT tumor?

The authors found that deletion/depletion of kindlin-1 resulted in the suppression of tumor growth, concluding kindlin-1 promotes breast tumor development. Surprisingly, they find that the integrin-binding capacity of kindlin-1 is not required for this function. They analyzed the infiltration of immune cells within the tumor and find that the population of Treg cells was significantly decreased in the kindlin-1 null tumor. Cytokine-profiling revealed that the secretion of IL-6 and several other cytokines were altered. The author used conditioned medium from Kindlin-1 WT and Kindlin-1 null cells to treat the co-culture of Treg and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from the mice spleen. They found that kindlin-1 deletion increased the proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the co-culture system and this effect can be blocked by addition of IL-6 antibody. The author suggests that the upregulation of IL-6 secretion from the kindlin-1 null tumor cells modulates the T cell differentiation, which lead to decrease of the Treg population and function and therefore the increase of anti-tumor immune response.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study which focus on the role of kindlin-1 in the anti-tumor immunity. However, in my opinion, some experiments need to be refined and more data is needed to clarify and support the hypothesis.</p><p>Specific points</p><p>1. The authors showed that deletion of kindlin-1 impaired tumor growth in both breast cancer models. The rest of the manuscript completely focuses on the immunoregulation within the tumor. Kindlin proteins are essential activator of integrin signaling, which can cooperate with growth factor receptors to promote cell proliferation. The proliferation of the tumor cells themselves should be monitored as well (in vitro MTT assay, kindlin-1 WT VS kindlin-1 null cells; phospho-histone H3 staining in the WT and kindlin-1 null tumors) to exclude the possibility that kindlin-1 directly promotes tumor cell proliferation.</p><p>2. The authors mentioned that kindlin-1 expression is higher in tumor compared to normal tissues. What happen to the xenograft if kindlin-1 is overexpressed in the met-1 cells? Will it promote the onset of tumorigenesis/ increase the tumor size and also decrease IL-6 secretion? What happen to the tumor growth and cytokine profile if an integrin-binding deficient mutant of kindlin-1 (AA mutant) is overexpressed?</p><p>3. In the discussion, although it was mentioned that kindlin-2 expression was not changed when kindlin-1 was deleted, there is not kindlin-2 western blot nor staining provided in the manuscript to support this claim. Regarding the functional redundancy between kindlin-1 and kindlin-2, which was also pointed out by the authors, it is important to include this data in the manuscript.</p><p>4. IL-6 and CXCL13 were both upregulated in the secretome of met-1 cells when kindlin-1 was deleted. CXCL13's upregulation was much more pronounced than IL-6 (20 folds VS 5 folds). Although CXCL13 is mainly involved in B cell recruitment, it was also reported to recruit T cells and regulate their functions (Li et al., DOI: 10.1016/j.jhep.2019.09.031; Zhou et al., DOI: 10.1126/science.abd5926). It is risky to exclude the possibility that CXCL13 also plays a role in the increased anti-tumor immunity induced by kindlin-1 deletion. Furthermore, in the supplementary Figure 5, which is the basis of the claim that CXCL13 does not play a role, it seems to me that there is a trend of decrease in the B cell recruitment when kindlin-1 was deleted. The P value is very close to 0.05 and the sample number is only 3. In this case, increasing the N number is essential to justify the claim. I strongly suggest to include CXCL13 antibody in the experiment in Figure 6 E and F.</p><p>5. IL-6 can have opposing effects on tumor development depending on the context. Chronic IL-6 signaling has been linked in many mouse tumor models (Fisher et al., DOI: 10.1016/j.smim.2014.01.008; Bent et al., DOI: 10.1038/s41467-021-26407-4). As far as I know, the authors did not directly test the role of IL-6 in the in vivo xenograft or PyV-MT models. Can injection of IL-6 or its antibody modulate the tumor growth and T cell differentiation in these two models? In my opinion, the best way to justify the essential role of IL-6 in the proposed model would be knocking out IL-6 on top of Kindlin-1 deletion in met-1 cells and check if this could abrogate the decreases of Treg population and tumor growth.</p><p>6. It is a surprise that re-expression of kindlin-1 AA mutant was able to restore the tumor growth. This is an important observation as it implies that integrin activation by kindlin-1 is not required for the growth of met-1 tumor xenograft. Interestingly, in their previous study (Sarvi et al., Cancer Research, 2018), the authors demonstrated that the integrin-binding capacity of kindlin-1 is required for the lung metastasis of met-1 cells. Combining both studies, it seems that the integrin signaling mediated by kindlin-1 is not required for the tumor growth itself but is indispensable for the tumor metastasis. I suggest the authors perform more control experiments to strengthen this conclusion. For example, 9EG7 staining in the WT or AA kindlin-1 expressing cells or tumor and then quantify the integrin activation. Can the re-expression of AA kindlin-1 mutant in the kindlin-1 null cells restore the cytokine profile?</p><p>This study focuses on the effect of kindlin-1 deletion on immunoregulation of myeloid cells within breast tumor. Although this is an interesting observation, the author did not provide any mechanistic explanation about how kindlin-1 regulates cytokine production/secretion. Does this regulation depend on the mechano-transduction mediated by kindlin-1? It is most likely not because the author showed the integrin-binding deficient kindlin-1 also promoted tumor growth. There are already several studies showed that Kindlin-2 can regulate the transcription of Axin2, <italic>Sox9</italic> and YAP/TAZ (Yu et al., EMBO reports, 2012; Wu et al., Nat Comm, 2015; Guo et al., J Cell Biol, 2018). The author should at least add a section discussing the potential mechanism by which kindlin-1 regulates IL-6 secretion in the discussion.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Kindlin-1 regulates IL-6 secretion and modulates the immune environment in breast cancer models&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Figure 7 shows that deletion or blockade of IL-6 was not able to influence tumor growth, although it did increase the Foxp3+ Treg population. On the other hand, the depletion of CD25+ cells reduced tumor growth. Blockade of CD25 could have very complex and profound effects as it is a less specific marker for T reg cells compared to Foxp3. The effects of CD25 blockade might not solely come from the inhibition of Tregs. I suggest directly targeting the Foxp3+ Tregs (e. g. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2019.1570778; doi: 10.1136/jitc-2021-003892) to confirm whether Treg is responsible for kindlin-1's function in tumor immunity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed (or justified where experiments cannot be performed) all my concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85739.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

This effect was more pronounced in T cell sufficient hosts compared to the T cell deficient ones. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that tumor infiltrating T cells are controlled, at least in part, by Kindlin-1. Although the authors present some phenotypical changes in the DC and T cell compartments, it is still unclear whether these changes account for an altered anti-tumor T cell activity. Furthermore, the authors claim that the effect is possibly driven by increased IL-6 in the TME in the absence of Kindlin-1, however, in vivo data supporting this claim are missing. While the overall effects of the lack of tumor derived Kindlin-1 is interesting, how this regulates T cell activity and which mechanism(s) are responsible remain elusive due to insufficient evidence.</p><p>Figure 1 -</p><p>To prove that the deletion of Kindlin-1 promotes lasting immunological memory, have the authors also rechallenged Kindlin WT group with Kindlin WT tumor?

However, as the Kin1-WT cells do not express or secrete IL-6 we took an alternative approach to determine the role of tumor-derived IL6 in the Kin1-NULL tumors. As antibody treatment in vivo would impact on IL6 secreted from both tumour and stromal cells we first generated Kin1-NULL Met-1 cells in which we genetically deleted IL6 using CRISPR Cas-9. This resulted in a significant reduction in secretion of IL6 (Figure 6C) in Kin1-NULL cells. Subsequent immune profiling of tumors collected 10 days following tumor cell implantation showed that deletion of IL6 in Kin1-NULL tumors led to an increased number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and also an increase in the number of Tregs (Figure 7A). Although depletion of IL6 in the Kin1-NULL tumours was able to increase the number of Tregs cells to levels equivalent to those seen in the Kin1-WT tumors, and reduce the number of activated (CD107a<sup>+</sup> GranzymeB<sup>+</sup>) cytotoxic T cells (Figure 7B), there was no effect on tumor clearance (Figure 7C, D). We then carried out experiments with an IL-6 neutralizing antibody in mice implanted with the Kin1-NULL cells. There was no effect tumor clearance in mice treated with the IL6 neutralizing antibody (Figure 7E). Together these data show that although the increased secretion of IL6 following loss of Kindlin-1 can reverse the effects on Treg infiltration and also reduce the number of activated cytotoxic T cells, it is not sufficient to prevent tumor clearance indicating that other mechanisms are involved in the anti-tumor immunity. As discussed in the text the data we show support a role for Kindlin-1 in several potential methods of immune cell regulation. It is likely therefore that in the context of the complex tumor environment that the IL6 mediated effects on the suppressive activity of Tregs on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (demonstrated in vitro) is not sufficient on its own to prevent Kin1-NULL tumor clearance. However, the data presented does provide the first description of how Kindlin-1 regulates the tumor immune environment which IL6 contributes to. Such a detailed study provides a significant advance in our understanding of how this key adhesion protein impacts on tumor progression and we therefore believe it warrants publication. Future studies will explore how other pathways and factors may act in concert with IL6 to drive anti-tumor immunity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, have the authors thought about the possibility that Kindlin-1 wt TME may have more TGF-b?

There are already several studies showed that Kindlin-2 can regulate the transcription of Axin2, Sox9 and YAP/TAZ (Yu et al., EMBO reports, 2012; Wu et al., Nat Comm, 2015; Guo et al., J Cell Biol, 2018). The author should at least add a section discussing the potential mechanism by which kindlin-1 regulates IL-6 secretion in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present evidence that indicate a transcription independent mechanism of IL-6 regulation of IL-6 by Kindlin-1. Analysis of data from the Nanostring PanImmune panel show that there is no difference in expression of Il6 between the Kin1-WT and Kin1-NULL cells (Figure 5D). Although IL-6 is regulated primarily via transcription, the regulation of IL-6 secretion is controlled by additional mechanisms including regulation of trafficking through the exocytic pathway (doi:10.1242/jcs.234781). Further work is required to establish how Kindlin-1 is regulating secretion of IL-6 but of note Kindlin-dependent regulation of integrin trafficking to the plasma membrane has been reported (doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.060). This has been discussed in the text.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The resubmitted manuscript clarified some of this reviewer's concerns, however, there are still some remaining.</p><p>1.

Figure 7 shows that deletion or blockade of IL-6 was not able to influence tumor growth, although it did increase the Foxp3+ Treg population. On the other hand, the depletion of CD25+ cells reduced tumor growth. Blockade of CD25 could have very complex and profound effects as it is a less specific marker for T reg cells compared to Foxp3. The effects of CD25 blockade might not solely come from the inhibition of Tregs. I suggest directly targeting the Foxp3+ Tregs (e. g. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2019.1570778; doi: 10.1136/jitc-2021-003892) to confirm whether Treg is responsible for kindlin-1's function in tumor immunity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that CD25 is not a specific Treg cell marker, and that depletion by anti-CD25 antibody may have effects on other cell functions. However, in mice it is constitutively and highly expressed on Treg cells, compared to other immune cells. Furthermore, depletion of Treg cells by anti-CD25 antibodies has been widely used throughout the literature, and therefore could be regarded as a standard method of analysing effects of Treg depletion in vivo. Incidentally, antibodies which target CD25 are currently being optimised and tested in clinical trials, with the main mechanism of action being targeted Treg depletion. This therefore, is why we chose to use this method of depletion. Although, the suggestion of targeting of FoxP3 as proposed by the reviewer, does sound very promising, these involve use of new approaches for which the materials are not readily available. These will however be useful in confirming the effect we see here in future investigations of the role Tregs play in this model.</p><p>To ensure that the anti-CD25 antibody was depleting the cells of interest (Tregs), we analysed tumours of mice after treatment, which demonstrated a depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>+</sup> (Treg cells), with no significant decrease in CD4<sup>+</sup> FoxP3<sup>-</sup> (non-Treg CD4s) cells (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1). We believe these data provide support, that in this model, the anti-CD25 antibody was specifically depleting Treg cells. However, to clarify that CD25 is not an exclusive marker present on T cells, we have added a statement in the text (p19).</p></body></sub-article></article>
