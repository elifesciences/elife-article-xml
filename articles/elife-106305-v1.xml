vesicle. To understand the mechanistic basis of this process, we investigated the changes in prosensory cell patterning, proliferation, and character during the segregation of some of the vestibular organs in the mouse and chicken otic vesicle. We discovered a specialised boundary domain, located at the interface of segregating organs. It is composed of prosensory cells that gradually enlarge, elongate, and are ultimately diverted from a prosensory fate. Strikingly, the boundary cells align their apical borders and constrict basally at the interface of cells expressing or not the Lmx1a transcription factor, an orthologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Apterous. The boundary domain is absent in <italic>Lmx1a</italic>-deficient mice, which exhibit defects in sensory organ segregation and is disrupted by the inhibition of ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility. Altogether, our results suggest that actomyosin-dependent tissue boundaries ensure the proper separation of inner ear sensory organs and uncover striking homologies between this process and the compartmentalisation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc by lineage-restricted boundaries.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inner ear</kwd><kwd>sensory organ formation</kwd><kwd>tissue boundary</kwd><kwd>prosensory specification</kwd><kwd>LMX1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05w6qh410</institution-id><institution>Action on Hearing Loss</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G76</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Żak</surname><given-names>Magdalena</given-names></name><name><surname>Daudet</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05w6qh410</institution-id><institution>Royal National Institute for Deaf People</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P27</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Żak</surname><given-names>Magdalena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03x94j517</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S003029/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Żak</surname><given-names>Magdalena</given-names></name><name><surname>Daudet</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03x94j517</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/W005123/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Żak</surname><given-names>Magdalena</given-names></name><name><surname>Daudet</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00cwqg982</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L003163/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daudet</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00cwqg982</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R000549/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Daudet</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A boundary between the sensory and nonsensory domains contains cells that undergo a series of morphological changes and form basal constriction to separate the segregating inner ear sensory organs.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The inner ear of vertebrates is composed of a series of liquid-filled chambers containing distinct sensory organs. Each organ contains a sensory epithelium populated with mechanosensory ‘hair cells’, separated from one another by supporting cells. In amniotes, the ventral part of the inner ear forms the cochlea, which hosts an auditory epithelium called the basilar papilla in birds and crocodiles, or the organ of Corti in mammals. The dorsal part forms the vestibular system, with three cristae (anterior, posterior, and lateral) and their associated semicircular canals responding to the angular rotations of the head, and the maculae of the utricle and saccule, sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration. These sensory organs are separated from one another by non-sensory territories with essential roles in inner ear function and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ekdale, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The development of the inner ear is a remarkable example of 3D tissue morphogenesis that starts with the formation of the otic placode, an epithelial thickening located on both sides of the hindbrain. The placode rapidly invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme to form the otic cup. Subsequently, the cup pinches off from the surface ectoderm and closes into the otic vesicle (or otocyst), which then undergoes a drastic remodelling to give rise to the inner ear (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsina and Whitfield, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basch et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>How are the different cell types and territories of the inner ear specified and positioned during its embryonic development? The prevalent view is that diffusible signals (e.g. Wnt, Hedgehog, FGF, retinoic acid) secreted by tissues surrounding the otocyst direct the expression of key factors (transcription factors and signalling molecules) to specify various otic cell identities (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fekete and Wu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ohta and Schoenwolf, 2018</xref>). It was also proposed that once specified, adjacent but distinct populations of otic progenitors might be prevented from intermixing by lineage-restricted tissue boundaries akin to those discovered at the interface of ‘embryonic compartments’ in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brigande et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fekete, 1996</xref>). This ‘compartment boundary’ model has received some support from the analysis of mouse mutants exhibiting defects in restricted domains of the inner ear and some fate map studies, but it remains hypothetical with respect to the existence and precise location of tissue boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kil and Collazo, 2002</xref>).</p><p>One aspect of inner ear development that results in the spatial separation of adjacent groups of cells is the formation of its sensory organs. In the chicken or mouse otic vesicle, the prospective sensory domains, or prosensory domains, are recognisable as thickened epithelial patches in the ventro-medial and posterior regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knowlton, 1967</xref>). The prosensory patches express the Notch ligand Jag1, which promotes the maintenance of the prosensory fate by Notch-mediated lateral induction (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daudet and Żak, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kiernan, 2013</xref>). They also express the high-mobility group transcription factor Sox2, which is essential for the formation of all inner ear sensory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dabdoub et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiernan et al., 2005</xref>), as well as otic neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steevens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steevens et al., 2017</xref>). At early developmental stages, Sox2 marks a wide antero-posterior ‘pan-sensory’ domain occupying the ventro-medial wall of the otocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steevens et al., 2019</xref>), due at least in part to the inhibition of Sox2 expression by Wnt activity in the dorsal aspect of the otocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Żak and Daudet, 2021</xref>). Subsequently, the pan-sensory domain splits into the posterior crista and several sensory organs in the anterior part of the otocyst: the anterior crista (AC), the lateral crista (LC), and the utricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sánchez-Guardado et al., 2013</xref>). This segregation process was first described in the inner ear of fish and amphibians more than a century ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Norris, 1892</xref>) and could have played an essential role in the evolution of the vertebrate inner ear, by allowing new sensory organs to acquire specific functions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fritzsch et al., 2002</xref>). Genetic studies in the mouse have shown that mutations or absence of specific transcription factors and signalling molecules can lead to defects in sensory organ segregation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsina and Whitfield, 2017</xref>). One such factor is Lmx1a (cLmx1b in the chicken), a LIM-homeodomain transcription factor whose orthologue Apterous acts as a ‘selector gene’ for the dorsal compartment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rincón-Limas et al., 1999</xref>). In the mouse inner ear, Lmx1a is expressed in the non-sensory territories separating the sensory organs, and its absence causes severe morphogenesis defects and partial fusions between adjacent sensory territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nichols et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Steffes et al., 2012</xref>). Our previous work has shown that Lmx1a antagonises Jag1/Notch signalling within some early sensory-competent cells, thereby leading those cells to adopt a non-sensory fate between adjacent sensory organs (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daudet and Żak, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mann et al., 2017</xref>). Live-imaging studies in zebrafish embryos have also shown that a progressive reduction in Jag1b expression occurs within the cells located between segregating sensory organs, confirming the central role played by the regulation of Notch activity in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma and Zhang, 2015</xref>). Despite these insights into the genetic regulation of sensory organ segregation, the cellular basis of this process remains unclear. Is it solely dependent on changes in cell character regulated by Notch and Lmx1a, or does it involve other processes and if so, of which type?</p><p>To tackle this question, we examined the changes in cell morphology during the segregation of the LC and AC cristae from the pan-sensory domain in the embryonic chicken and mouse otocyst. We identified a population of prosensory cells with enlarged surfaces, which appear at the interface of segregating organs and gradually elongate and re-align along the border of the prospective cristae before down-regulating Sox2 expression. As segregation proceeds, these large cells constrict basally at the interface of Lmx1a-positive (on the cristae side) and -negative (on the pan-sensory domain side) cells, strongly suggesting the formation of a lineage-restricted tissue boundary. In Lmx1a-null mouse otocysts, the boundary domain is disrupted; the AC and the LC initiate their segregation from the utricle but they remain fused to one another, indicating that Lmx1a is required for the differentiation of the non-sensory cells separating the two cristae. Finally, we show that the perturbation of ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility, a common player in the establishment of lineage-restricted boundaries, leads to defects in the organisation of the boundary domain and abnormal sensory organ segregation.</p><p>Altogether, our results strongly suggest that a lineage-restricted tissue boundary forms at the interface of segregating sensory organs, providing support to the compartment-boundary model of inner ear development. They also uncover striking similarities in the genetic circuits and cellular mechanisms of tissue segregation in the inner ear and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A specialised boundary domain forms between segregating vestibular organs in the chicken otocyst</title><p>We focused in this study on the formation of the AC and LC, using whole-mount preparations of the otic vesicle immunostained for the prosensory marker Sox2.

At stage 1 (HH25–26), the prospective LC formed a budding that was not yet separated from the pan-sensory domain (n=4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and d–e’’</xref>). Seven to nine rows of Sox2-positive cells located at the interface of the future LC and the pan-sensory domain appeared slightly larger than those located on either side. At stage 2 (HH26–27; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and g–h’’</xref>), Sox2 started to be down-regulated within the interface domain separating the LC from the pan-sensory domain (n=4). Scattered Sox2-positive nuclei were also present at the edge of a second Sox2-positive lobe of the LC, which remained connected to the pan-sensory domain. Of note, the second lobe of the LC does not give rise to sensory cells at later developmental stages and, as discussed later, it is not present in the mouse inner ear. In some cases, the large cells appeared to align their apical borders along the edge of the crista, forming a multicellular actin-cable-like structure, suggesting a coordinated increase in cell bond tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g–h’’</xref>). At stage 3 (HH27–28; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and j–k’’</xref>), the two lobes of the LC were clearly separated from the pan-sensory domain by an 80- to 180-µm-wide territory containing cells with no (or very reduced) Sox2 expression (n=4). At the border of the LC, 7–10 rows of large cells remained visible. Comparable changes were observed at the border of the AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), although we were not able to analyse the early stages of segregation for this organ.</p><p>Concomitant to these changes in cell surface morphology, we noticed a progressive enrichment in F-actin staining at the base of the epithelium along the presumptive border of the LC (n=4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–f”, i–i”, and l–l”</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). At stages 2–3, it was associated with a clear basal constriction of the cells and an upward displacement of the basal lamina along the presumptive border of the LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l–l’’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>). This suggests that the basal constriction could at least partly explain the enlarged apical surface of the cells composing the specialised boundary domain.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A multicellular basal constriction forms at the interface of the lateral crista (LC) and pan-sensory domain.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) Samples stained for F-actin and Sox2 expression at stages 1–3 of LC segregation in the chicken inner ear.

Cell skeletons were generated from phalloidin-stained preparations (n=3 samples per stage), allowing the quantification of cell surfaces, elongation (the ratio between their long and short axis), and orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This analysis showed that the large cells at the interface of the LC and pan-sensory domain expanded their apical surface and increased in number from stage 1 to stage 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref>); they became more elongated than neighbouring cells from stage 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) and their long axis became gradually aligned along the same planar polarity vector, parallel to the edge of the crista, at stages 2–3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>). The increase in cell surface area was maximum in the interface domain but observed throughout the tissue, explaining the overall reduction in cell density observed between stage 1 and stage 3. The elongation and re-orientation of the cells were also noticeable throughout the epithelium, suggesting that these processes are primarily driven by global anisotropic changes in tissue tension. As seen in LC samples stained for the apical surface marker ZO-1 and DAPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a-a’’</xref>), the majority of cells with a large surface area were not undergoing mitosis, and their nuclei had a comparable size to those of neighbouring prosensory and non-sensory cells.

In the apical plane of the epithelium, cells elongate and align their borders in the middle of the large cell domain, at the precise interface of Lmx1a-expressing and non-expressing cells. In the basal planes, the interface of Lmx1a-GFP and positive cells is marked by the formation of multicellular actin-cable-like structures, and in some cases a basal constriction and upward displacement of the basal lamina.

Consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mann et al., 2017</xref>), Sox2 expression was maintained in the GFP-positive cells within the fused cristae, suggesting that the fusion of the two cristae is, to a large extent, due to a specification defect: in the absence of Lmx1a, sensory-competent cells fail to differentiate into non-sensory cells at the interface of the AC and LC, producing instead a large and continuous sensory territory. However, a relatively straight border of GFP expression was present at the edge of the fused cristae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b and i</xref>), and a domain with reduced Sox2 expression was present between the cristae and utricle of the <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> samples, although not as clearly defined as in the <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> samples (stars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–d and j–k</xref>). This suggests that the initial segregation of the crista and utricle pools of sensory progenitors is, to some extent, independent from Lmx1a function. Nevertheless, there were some differences in GFP pattern, cell morphology, and organisation at the interface of the fused cristae and utricle. Firstly, the GFP pattern was very mosaic across <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> cells, including at the border of the GFP-positive domain. This may be due to the abnormal differentiation of cells of the Lmx1a lineage, as well as increased mixing between cells belonging or not to the Lmx1a lineage at the edge of the cristae. Secondly, there was no basal constriction at the interface of the GFP-positive and -negative cells in the <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> samples (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f–g and m–n</xref>). Finally, the cellular organisation of the boundary domain was markedly different in the <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> samples. In fact, a quantitative analysis of cell surface morphology showed that cells on both sides of the boundary domain in <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> samples (n=3) tended to be larger, more aligned with one another and more elongated than in <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/+</sup></italic> ones (n=2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The analysis of surface cell morphologies with Epitool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b–d</xref>) showed that RIIC1-GFP causes a mild (approximately 23%) but statistically significant (p&lt;0.01, Mann-Whitney test U=10622.5) increase in the average apical surface area of transfected otic cells (18.22 µm<sup>2</sup>; SD = 11.04) compared to untransfected cells (14.84 µm<sup>2</sup>; SD = 8.38), consistent with an inhibition of cortical actomyosin contractility. In comparison, cells transfected with a control RCAS-GFP construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8e</xref>) do not have significantly enlarged apical surface area (p=0.56, Mann-Whitney test U=77504). Next, we used the RCAS retroviral system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hughes, 2004</xref>) to investigate the effects of RIIC1-GFP on cristae segregation, since EP of a replication-competent retrovirus proviral DNA leads to a sustained and widespread transgene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freeman et al., 2012</xref>). The right otic cups of E2 (HH13–14) embryos were electroporated with either the RCAS-GFP (control) or the RCAS-RIIC1-GFP proviral DNA, and the embryos were incubated for 3–5 days post-EP. In controls (n=8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g–h’’’</xref>), the LC was present in six out of eight samples and separated from the utricle by distances ranging from 55 µm to 155 µm. We hypothesise that the absence of LC in two of the controls may be due to abnormal or delayed development of the inner ear after EP. The pattern of GFP expression was very variable among samples, but in general, it encompassed sensory and non-sensory regions. However, in two samples, we noted a very marked difference in GFP fluorescence levels on each side of the boundary of the LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h’</xref>). Although several factors could potentially explain this observation (e.g. different rate of GFP production or degradation in different cell populations), it fits with the idea that there is limited cell intermixing at this particular location.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of ROCK in the developing chicken inner ear disrupts sensory organ segregation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Surface view of otic epithelial cells 24 hr after in ovo electroporation with the pRCII-GFP expression plasmid.

Tissue boundaries play an important role in this process by preventing, at specific locations, the intermingling of cells destined to form distinct anatomical structures. Besides this ‘physical’ role, tissue boundaries can act as signalling centres or ‘organisers’, regulating the proliferation and differentiation of adjacent cells through various intercellular signalling pathways. Tissue boundaries were discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garcia-Bellido et al., 1973</xref>) and most studied in the imaginal wing disc of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where they establish lineage-restricted compartments along the dorso-ventral and antero-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang and Dahmann, 2020</xref>). In vertebrates, they are present in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addison and Wilkinson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Langenberg and Brand, 2005</xref>), in the ectoderm of the limb bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altabef et al., 1997</xref>), or in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith and Tabin, 2000</xref>). Their formation typically involves three consecutive steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addison and Wilkinson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dahmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang and Dahmann, 2020</xref>). Firstly, ‘selector’ genes (encoding transcription factors) assign a specific identity to different populations of cells. Secondly, these cells interact through signalling molecules and sort themselves into adjacent domains according to their genetic identity through adhesive or repulsive interactions. Finally, actomyosin-dependent processes increase cell tension at the interface of adjacent compartments to create and maintain a stable ‘fence’ preventing cell mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Major and Irvine, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Monier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monier et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The morphogenesis of the inner ear has long been proposed to depend on the formation of lineage-restricted embryonic compartments analogous to those present in the fly wing disc. In fact, some genes have sharply defined domains of expression in the otic vesicle before any sign of morphological differentiation, and their absence prevents the formation of specific structures of the adult inner ear, suggesting that these may act as selector genes for a particular otic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brigande et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fekete, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fekete and Wu, 2002</xref>). Fate map and lineage studies have also suggested the existence of lineage-restricted boundaries in the dorsal part of the chicken otic vesicle, which gives rise to the endolymphatic duct and sac, although their exact location and cellular features remain unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brigande et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kil and Collazo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sánchez-Guardado et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we provide strong evidence that the segregation of the AC and LC from the prospective utricle is associated with the formation of a tissue boundary. It is composed of a subset of prosensory cells which progressively enlarge, elongate, and align their apical cell borders at the precise junction between Lmx1a-positive and negative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In the absence of lineage-tracing or live-imaging experiments, we do not have definitive proof that these cells generate a strict lineage-restricted boundary. However, their position (at the interface of two distinct ‘genetic compartments’) and cellular features (basal constriction, basal multicellular actin-cable-like structure, and alignment of their apical cell borders) are consistent with this idea. Furthermore, a lineage-restricted boundary could explain why we observed, in some of our RCAS-infection experiments, an uneven distribution of GFP-expressing cells on either side of the basal constriction separating the LC from the utricle. In a previous study, we argued that the changing patterns of Lmx1a and Sox2 expression in the embryonic inner ear suggested some form of dynamic competition for the adoption of the sensory versus non-sensory fates at the lateral border of sensory organs, as opposed to the existence of a strict lineage boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mann et al., 2017</xref>). Our new results, which focused on earlier stages of sensory organ formation, call for a revision of this conclusion: the early prosensory cells are indeed labile, but their initial separation into distinct pools of sensory progenitors (for the cristae and the utricle at least) appears to be associated with the formation of a transient lineage-restricted tissue boundary.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A schematic representation of sensory organ segregation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The up-regulation of Lmx1a expression within the pan-sensory domain coincides with the formation of a specialised boundary domain composed of cells with enlarged cell surfaces. At the interface of Lmx1a-expressing and non-expressing cells, cells align their borders apically and form multicellular basal constrictions and actin-cable-like structures at the base of the epithelium. We propose that it is a transient lineage-restricted boundary, dependent on actomyosin contractility, which separates adjacent pools of sensory progenitors. As the spatial segregation proceeds, the Lmx1a-expressing cells give rise to non-sensory cells separating sensory organs.

In a previous study, we showed that Lmx1a is essential for the specification of the non-sensory territories separating sensory organs and its overexpression in the chicken inner ear antagonises prosensory specification, suggesting that it acts as a ‘selector’ gene for the non-sensory fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mann et al., 2017</xref>). The present study confirms this hypothesis: in its absence (in <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> embryos), cells of the Lmx1a lineage commit to a prosensory fate, leading to a fusion between the lateral and anterior cristae. On the other hand, the fused cristae and the utricle are separated by a Sox2-negative domain, suggesting that the initial segregation of these two sensory domains proceeds independently from Lmx1a function. Nevertheless, the typical features (large cell domain and basal constriction) of the boundary domain separating the cristae from the utricle were absent in all but one of the <italic>Lmx1a</italic>-null samples examined. Altogether, these results suggest that Lmx1a plays a role in the maintenance or continued differentiation of the boundary domain, but is not required for its initial formation. Finally, the patterning abnormalities in <italic>Lmx1a<sup>GFP/GFP</sup></italic> samples occurred in both GFP-positive and negative territories, which points at some type of interaction between Lmx1a-expressing and non-expressing cells, and the possibility that the boundary domain is also a signalling centre influencing the differentiation of adjacent territories.</p><p>Given its conserved role in tissue boundaries, we hypothesised that actomyosin contractility could contribute to the formation or maintenance of the boundary domain. The in vitro results showed that short-term inhibition of ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility with Y-27632 disrupts the morphology and patterning of boundary cells. Interestingly, the large cells were still present, but more elongated and more polarised than in control cultures. This suggests that global anisotropic forces within the developing otocyst contribute to a large extent to the elongated cellular shapes and long axis alignments observed at the interface of segregating organs. Nevertheless, the spatial separation of cells expressing either high or low levels of Sox2 was maintained. Longer-term treatments led to an apparent fusion of adjacent sensory territories, but this may have been caused by the complete loss of epithelial integrity observed in these experiments. On the other hand, the overexpression in the chicken inner ear of a dominant-negative form of ROCK, unable to interact with its upstream regulator Shroom3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008</xref>), produced more informative results. Firstly, the LC failed to segregate normally from the pan-sensory domain, indicating a requirement for ROCK activity in this process. Secondly, the border of the LC was very irregular, with some intermingling between cells expressing high and low levels of Sox2. This would be expected if an actomyosin-dependent lineage boundary had been disrupted. Altogether, these results show that ROCK-dependent coordination of actomyosin contractility is crucial for the segregation of the sensory organs and the maintenance of a straight boundary between these, yet other mechanisms are likely to contribute to the initial sorting of the Lmx1a-expressing and non-expressing cells. One strong candidate is the basal constriction and actin-cable-like structure at the edge of the cristae, which resembles the one described at the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gutzman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutzman et al., 2008</xref>) and could contribute to the physical separation of sensory progenitors. It has been proposed that a zone of non-proliferating cells could impede cell movements between adjacent compartments at the dorso-ventral wing disc boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blair, 1993</xref>; see however <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O’Brochta and Bryant, 1985</xref>, for a different view) or between rhombomeres in the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guthrie et al., 1991</xref>). However, the results of our EdU-incorporation assays show extensive proliferation of the cells composing the boundary domain at early and late stages of segregation, arguing against this hypothesis. Other mechanisms involved in boundary formation in the hindbrain and insect compartments include differential cell adhesion or repulsive interactions mediated by eph-ephrin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dahmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilkinson, 2018</xref>). It is also possible that the repositioning of cells through medial intercalation could contribute to the straightening of the boundary, as well as the widening of the non-sensory territories in between sensory patches. Further studies will be needed to determine which of these mechanisms, if any, contributes to sensory organ segregation in the inner ear.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Deep homologies between sensory organ segregation and <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc compartmentalisation: co-option of a tissue boundary module?</title><p>An increase in cortical cell tension or a multicellular actin cable has been described along many tissue boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fagotto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang and Dahmann, 2020</xref>): the dorso-ventral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Major and Irvine, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Major and Irvine, 2005</xref>) and antero-posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Landsberg et al., 2009</xref>) boundaries of the wing disc, the parasegments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monier et al., 2010</xref>) and salivary gland placode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Röper, 2012</xref>) boundaries in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and at the interface of rhombomeres of the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calzolari et al., 2014</xref>) in vertebrates. Hence, the implication of actomyosin-dependent processes to prevent cell intermixing is a conserved feature of tissue boundaries, which is also present in the inner ear. Perhaps more surprisingly, the core elements of the gene regulatory network regulating sensory organ segregation in the inner ear and the dorso-ventral compartmentalisation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc are remarkably similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daudet and Żak, 2020</xref>). In fact, Notch signalling acts by lateral induction in both tissues: to maintain prosensory character in the inner ear or to enhance Notch activity at the dorso-ventral boundary in the wing disc. We have argued that <italic>Lmx1a</italic> and <italic>Apterous</italic>, which are orthologous genes, play a selector-like function in both tissues, specifying the identity of dorsal cells in the wing disc and that of the non-sensory cells separating the vestibular organs in the inner ear. In both tissues, the interactions between Apterous/Lmx1a and Notch signalling have a comparable outcome: a reduction in the levels of Notch activity within Apterous/Lmx1a-expressing cells. In the wing disc, Apterous drives the expression of Fringe, a glycosyl-transferase that makes the Notch receptor less sensitive to the Serrate ligand in dorsal cells, potentiating signalling through Delta, expressed by ventral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Celis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doherty et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Panin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rauskolb et al., 1999</xref>). We do not know yet if any of the vertebrate Fringe orthologues contribute to the regulation of Notch activity at the border of inner ear vestibular organs. However, it has been shown that Lfng and Mfng are expressed at the medial border of the prosensory domain in the embryonic mouse cochlea, and <italic>Lnfg;Mfng</italic> double mutants exhibit patterning defects consistent with an abnormal positioning of the medial border of the organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basch et al., 2016b</xref>). Further studies should investigate the roles of Fringe proteins during vestibular organ segregation. By extension, it would be worth investigating the potential role of Wnt signalling in this process, since one of the important consequences of Notch activity at the dorso-ventral wing disc boundary is to induce the expression of Wingless, which then regulates the growth and patterning of the wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Celis et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diaz-Benjumea and Cohen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rulifson and Blair, 1995</xref>). It is worth noting that a similar genetic circuit including Notch signalling (Fringe, Jagged) and Lmx1 is deployed in vertebrate limbs to position the apical ectodermal ridge, the domain that acts as a growth zone and lineage boundary between the dorsal and the ventral ectoderm of the limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altabef et al., 1997</xref>). This ‘deep homology’, defined as ‘the sharing of the genetic regulatory apparatus that is used to build morphologically or phylogenetically disparate animal features’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shubin et al., 2009</xref>), suggests that Notch, Lmx1, and actomyosin contractility are part of an ancestral module for tissue boundary formation that has been co-opted and adapted for the patterning of a great variety of tissues.</p><p>Within the inner ear itself, it is possible that modifications of this core module are responsible for some of the interspecies differences in sensory organ numbers and morphologies. It is thought that the ancestral inner ear resembled that of jawless vertebrates (the lamprey and the hagfish), with only two cristae (anterior and posterior) and a single ventral macula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond and Whitfield, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Higuchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jørgensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lowenstein et al., 1968</xref>). Jawed vertebrates harbour three semicircular canals and cristae, as well as additional sensory organs in the vestibular and ventral part of the inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Retzius, 1884</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Retzius, 1881</xref>), enabling in particular the detection of air-borne sound in land vertebrates. Differences in inner ear sensory organ numbers, size, and morphologies are commonplace among vertebrates, and it is possible that some of these originate from changes in the genetic networks controlling sensory organ segregation. In the present study, we found at least a clear indication of interspecies variations in the segregation of the cristae: in the chicken inner ear, the anterior crista segregates before the lateral one, whilst in the mouse the segregation of the two cristae occurs simultaneously. Furthermore, the chicken LC is formed by two Sox2-positive lobes, one of which turns into a non-sensory territory. The fact that the specification of prosensory cells and their segregation is regulated by signalling pathways with well-known spatial patterning activities (FGF, Wnt, and Notch signalling) may have offered ample opportunities for ‘sensory organ experimentation’, facilitating in the course of vertebrate evolution the emergence of additional organs with new functionalities or, on the contrary, the suppression of redundant ones.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Fertilised White Leghorn chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) eggs were obtained from Henry Stewart UK and incubated at 37.8°C for the designated times.

At the end of the immunostaining protocol, the samples were further dissected under a Leica MZ16F stereomicroscope equipped with a fluorescence light source to visualise precisely the position of the Sox2-expressing sensory organs and facilitate their mounting in Vectashield (Vector labs, UK). A fine layer of vacuum grease was applied between the slide and coverslip to avoid excessive flattening of the tissue. Confocal stacks were acquired using a Zeiss LSM880 inverted confocal microscope or a Perkin Elmer spinning-disc confocal and further processed with ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of cell morphologies</title><p>Phalloidin labelling was used to visualise and analyse apical cell surfaces. Confocal z-stacks of the surface of the samples were processed with ImageJ and exported into Epitool for automated cell segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heller et al., 2016</xref>). The cell skeletons were manually corrected using the CellEdit plug-in in the Icy software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Chaumont et al., 2012</xref>). Colour scale of cell surface area and elongation ratio was generated based on the corrected cell skeleton using CellOverlay plug-in in Icy. Quantitative data on cell morphologies were exported into Excel spreadsheet, and scatter plots, radial histogram, box plots, and statistics of the data were generated using OriginPro 2017 and R. For the quantification of cell surfaces in Y-27632 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), a subset of cells located within a ± standard deviation interval from the location of the largest cells of each sample was analysed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Organotypic cultures</title><p>The anterior domain of the otocysts and its underlying mesenchyme were dissected from E5 (HH26) chicken embryos in room temperature L-15 medium (Leibovitz). The dissected tissues were either fixed at t=0 or cultured in 150–300 µl DMEM medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% HEPES and 20 µm Y-27632 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat # Y0503, lot # 103M4711V; dissolved in DMEM) in a tissue culture incubator (5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 37 degrees) for 3 hr or 24 hr. For the 3 hr-long experiments, the tissues were placed in 96-well plates and free-floating in DMEM medium. For the 24 hr-long experiments, the tissues were placed in 35 mm Mattek dishes and coated with a small (approximately 20 µl) drop of 0.4–0.8% agarose (low gelling temperature, Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.1 M PBS before adding DMEM medium. The cultured tissues were then fixed and processed for immunostaining as previously described.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell proliferation assays</title><p>Fertilised eggs were windowed at E4–5 (HH23–25) and a 200 µl drop of a PBS solution containing 200 µM of EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) was applied on top of the embryo. The eggs were sealed with tape and returned to incubation for 2 hr, then the embryos’ heads were collected and fixed for 30 min at room temperature in PBS with 4% formaldehyde. Following several rinses in PBS and PBT, the inner ear tissue was dissected and processed for Click-iT EdU reaction (Thermo Fisher UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At the end of the reaction, the tissue was further processed for Sox2 immunostaining as described above and labelled with DAPI before mounting. For the mapping of mitotic figures (identified by DAPI staining), a 72×36 µm<sup>2</sup> ‘region-of-interest’ centred on the boundary between the LC and pan-sensory domain was selected from a confocal stack acquired with a 40x objective. The position of each mitotic figure was recorded in x,y, and the results plotted for different samples collected at stage 1 (n=7) or 2–3 (n=7).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Measurement of the distance between segregating sensory organs</title><p>The distance between the LC and the utricle was measured in maximum intensity projections of z-stacks using ImageJ. The distance (μm) was measured in five different positions along the boundary domain in each analysed sample. Next, all the results were analysed in R using two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and two-sided Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with United Kingdom legislation outlined in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and approved by the UK Home Office in the Project Licence PP8324029.

Previously, this research group has described the importance of the chicken Lmx1b in establishing the boundary between sensory and non-sensory domains in the chicken inner ear. Here, the authors described a series of cellular changes during border formation in the chicken inner ear, including alignment of cells at the apical border and concomitant constriction basally. The authors extended these observations to the mouse inner ear and showed that these morphological changes occurred at the border of Lmx1a positive and negative regions, and these changes failed to develop in Lmx1a mutants. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that the ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility is important for this border formation and blocking ROCK function affected epithelial basal constriction and border formation in both in vitro and in vivo systems.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The morphological changes described during border formation in the developing inner ear are interesting. Linking these changes to the function of Lmx1a and ROCK dependent actomyosin contractile function are provocative.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are several outstanding issues that need to be clarified before one can pin the morphological changes observed being causal to border formation and that Lmx1a and ROCK are involved.</p><p>Comments on the latest version:</p><p>The revised manuscript has provided clarity of their results on some levels, but unfortunately, the basal restriction during border formation remains unclear and the study did not advance the understanding of role of Lmx1a in boundary formation. Overall comments are indicated below:</p><p>(1) The authors states in the rebuttal, &quot;we do not think that ROCK activity is required for the formation or maintenance of the basal constriction at the interface of Lmx1a-expressing and non-expressing cells&quot;</p><p>If the above is the sentiment of the authors, then the manuscript is not written to support this sentiment clearly, starting with this misleading sentence in the Abstract, &quot;The boundary domain is absent in Lmx1a-deficient mice, which exhibit defects in sensory organ segregation, and is disrupted by the inhibition of ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility.&quot;</p><p>(2) As acknowledged by the authors, the data as they currently stand could be explained by Lmx1a functioning in specifying the non-sensory fate and may not function directly in boundary formation. With this caveat in mind, the role of Lmx1a in boundary formation remains unclear.</p><p>(3) I feel like the word &quot;orchestrate&quot; in the title is an overstatement.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106305.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Ziqi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCL Ear Institute, University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zak</surname><given-names>Magdalena</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCL Ear Institute, University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Shuting</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCL Ear Institute, University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>de Andrés</surname><given-names>Javier</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCL Ear Institute, University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Daudet</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>UCL Ear Institute, University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript investigated the mechanism underlying boundary formation necessary for proper separation of vestibular sensory end organs.

Despite these remaining questions, the conceptual advances are significant, since this study provides the first evidence that a tissue boundary forms in between segregating sensory organs in the inner ear (there are only a handful of embryonic tissues in which a tissue boundary has been found in vertebrates) and highlights the evolutionary conservation of this process. This work also provides a strong descriptive basis for any future study investigating the mechanisms of tissue boundary formation in the mouse and chicken embryonic inner ear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Chen et al. describe the mechanisms that separate the common pan-sensory progenitor region into individual sensory patches, which presage the formation of the sensory epithelium in each of the inner ear organs. By focusing on the separation of the anterior and then lateral cristae, they find that long supra-cellular cables form at the interface of the pansensory domain and the forming cristae. They find that at these interfaces, the cells have a larger apical surface area, due to basal constriction, and Sox2 is down-regulated. Through analysis of Lmx1 mutants, the authors suggest that while Lmx1 is necessary for the complete segregation of the sensory organs, it is likely not necessary for the initial boundary formation, and the down-regulation of Sox2.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript adds to our knowledge and provides valuable mechanistic insight into sensory organ segregation. Of particular interest are the cell biological mechanisms: The authors show that contractility directed by ROCK is important for the maintenance of the boundary and segregation of sensory organs.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript would benefit from a more in-depth look at contractility - the current images of PMLC are not too convincing. Can the authors look at p or ppMLC expression in an apical view? Are they expressed in the boundary along the actin cables? Does Y-27362 inhibit this expression?</p><p>The authors suggest that one role for ROCK is the basal constriction. I was a little confused about basal constriction. Are these the initial steps in the thinning of the intervening nonsensory regions between the sensory organs? What happens to the basally constricted cells as this process continues?</p></disp-quote><p>In our hands, the PMLC immunostaining gave a punctate staining in epithelial cells and was difficult to image and interpret in whole-mount preparations, which did not allow us to investigate its specific association to the actin-cable-like structures. It is a very valuable suggestion to try alternative methods of fixation to improve the quality of the staining and images in future work.</p><p>The basal constriction of the cells at the border of the sensory organs was not always clearly visible in freshly-fixed samples, and was absent in the majority of short-term organotypic cultures in control medium, which made it impossible to ascertain the role of ROCK in its formation using pharmacological approaches in vitro (see Figure 7 and corresponding Result section). On the other hand, the overexpression of a dominant-negative form of ROCK (RCII-GFP) in ovo using RCAS revealed a persistence of basal constriction in transfected cells despite a disorganisation of the boundary domain (Figure 8). We conclude from these experiments that ROCK activity is not necessary for the formation and maintenance of the basal constriction. We also remain uncertain about the exact role of this basal constriction. It could be either a cause or consequence of the expansion of the apical surface of cells in the boundary domain, it could contribute to the limitation of cell intermingling and the formation of the actin-cable-like structure at the interface of Lmx1a-expressing and non-expressing cells, and may indeed prefigure some of the further changes in cell morphology occurring in non-sensory domains separating the sensory organs (cell flattening and constrictions of the epithelial walls in between sensory organs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The steps the authors explore happen after boundaries are established. This correlates with a down-regulation of Sox2, and the formation of a boundary. What is known about the expression of molecules that may underlie the apparent interfacial tension at the boundaries? Is there any evidence for differential adhesion or for Eph-Ephrin signalling? Is there a role for Notch signalling or a role for Jag1 as detailed in the group's 2017 paper?</p></disp-quote><p>Great questions. It is indeed likely that some form of differential cell tension and/or adhesion participates to the formation and maintenance of this boundary, and we have mentioned in the discussion some of the usual suspects (cadherins, eph/ephrin signalling,…) although it is beyond the scope of this paper to determine their roles in this context.</p><p>As we have discussed in this paper and in our 2017 study (see also Ma and Zhang, Development, 2015 Feb 15;142(4):763-73. doi: 10.1242/dev.113662) we believe that Notch signalling is maintaining prosensory character, and its down-regulation by Lmx1a/b expression is required for the specification of the non-sensory domains in between segregating sensory organs. Although we have not tested this directly in this study, any disruption in Notch signalling would be expected to affect indirectly the formation or maintenance of the boundary domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A comment on whether cellular intercalation/rearrangements may underlie some of the observed tissue changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not addressed this topic directly in the present study but we have included a brief comment on the potential implication of cellular intercalation and rearrangements in the discussion: “It is also possible that the repositioning of cells through medial intercalation could contribute to the straightening of the boundary as well as the widening of the nonsensory territories in between sensory patches.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The change in the long axis appears to correlate with the expression of Lmx1a (Fig 5d). The authors could discuss this more. Are these changes associated with altered PCP/Vangl2 expression?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure about the first point raised by the referee. We have quantified cell elongation and orientation in Lmx1a-GFP heterozygous and homozygous (null) mice, and our results suggest that the elongation of the cells occurs throughout the boundary domain, and is probably not dependent on Lmx1a expression (boundary cells are in fact more elongated in the Lmx1a mutant). We have not investigated the expression of components of the planar cell polarity pathway. This is a very interesting suggestion, worth exploring in further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lmx1a is an orthologue of apterous in flies, which is important for dorsal-ventral border formation in the wing disc. Previously, this research group has described the importance of the chicken Lmx1b in establishing the boundary between sensory and non-sensory domains in the chicken inner ear. Here, the authors described a series of cellular changes during border formation in the chicken inner ear, including alignment of cells at the apical border and concomitant constriction basally. The authors extended these observations to the mouse inner ear and showed that these morphological changes occurred at the border of Lmx1a positive and negative regions, and these changes failed to develop in Lmx1a mutants. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that the ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility is important for this border formation and blocking ROCK function affected epithelial basal constriction and border formation in both in vitro and in vivo systems.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The morphological changes described during border formation in the developing inner ear are interesting. Linking these changes to the function of Lmx1a and ROCK dependent actomyosin contractile function are provocative.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are several outstanding issues that need to be clarified before one could pin the morphological changes observed being causal to border formation and that Lmx1a and ROCK are involved.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the specific comments and suggestions of the reviewer below. We wish however to point out that we do not think that ROCK activity is required for the formation or maintenance of the basal constriction at the interface of Lmx1a-expressing and nonexpressing cells (see previous answer to referee #2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>(1) Figures 1 and 2, and related text. Based on the whole-mount images shown, the anterior otocyst appeared to be a stratified epithelium with multiple cell layers. If so, it should be clarified whether the x-y view of in the &quot;apical&quot; and &quot;basal&quot; plane are from cells residing in the apical and basal layers, respectively. Moreover, it would be helpful to include a &quot;stage 4&quot;, a later stage to show if and when basal constrictions resolve.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, at these early stages of development, the otic epithelium is “pseudostratified”: it is formed by a single layer of irregularly shaped cells, each extending from the base to the apical aspect of the epithelium, but with their nuclei residing at distinct positions along this basal-apical axis as mitotic cells progress through the cell cycle. The nuclei divide at the surface of the epithelium, then move back to the most basal planes within daughter cells during interphase. This process, known as interkinetic nuclear migration, has been well described in the embryonic neural tube and occurs throughout the developing otic epithelium (e.g. Orr, Dev Biol. 1975, 47,325-340, Ohta et al., Dev Biol. 2010 Sep 15;347(2):369–381. doi: 10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.09.002;). Consequently, the nuclei visible in apical or basal planes in x-y views belong to cells extending from the base to the apex of the epithelium, but which are at different stages of the cell cycle.</p><p>We have not included a late stage of sensory organ segregation in this study (apart from a P0 stage in the mouse inner ear, see Figure 4) since data about later stages of sensory organ morphogenesis are available in other studies, including our Mann et al. eLife 2017 paper describing Lmx1a-GFP expression in the embryonic mouse inner ear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Related to above, the observed changes in cell organization raised the possibility that the apical multicellular rosettes and basal constrictions observed in Stage 3 (and 2) could be intermediates of radial cell intercalations, which would lead to expansion of the space between sensory organs and thinning of the boundary domains. To see if it might be happening, it would be helpful to include DAPI staining to show the overall tissue architecture at different stages and use optical reconstruction to assess the thickness of the epithelium in the presumptive boundary domain over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this referee. Besides cell addition by proliferation and/or changes in cell morphology, radial cell intercalations could indeed contribute to the spatial segregation of inner ear sensory organs (a brief statement on this possibility was added to the Discussion). It is clear from images shown in Figure 4 (and from other studies) that the non-sensory domain separating the cristae from the utricle gets flatter and its cells also enlarge as development proceeds. We do not think that DAPI staining is required to demonstrate this. Perhaps the best way to show that radial cell intercalations occur would be to perform liveimaging of the otic epithelium, but this is technically challenging in the mouse or chicken inner ear. An alternative model system might be the zebrafish inner ear, in which some liveimaging data have shown a progressive down-regulation of Jag1 expression during sensory organ segregation (and a flattening of “boundary domains”), suggesting a conservation of the basic mechanisms at play (Ma and Zhang, Development, 2015 Feb 15;142(4):763-73. doi: 10.1242/dev.113662).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Similarly, it would be helpful to include the DAPI counterstain in Figures 4, 7, and 8 to show the overall tissue architecture.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have DAPI staining for these particular images but in most cases, Sox2 immunostaining gives a decent indication of tissue morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 2(z) and Figure 4d.

Besides the presence of multicellular rosettes, we have not seen direct evidence of radial cell intercalation – this would be best investigated using liveimaging. As development proceeds, the epithelial domain separating adjoining sensory organs becomes wider.

However, we have followed the referee’s advice and analysed Factin staining in x-y views in the Lmx1a-GFP knock-in (heterozygous) mice. We found that the first signs of basal F-actin enrichment and multicellular actin-cable like structures at the interface of Lmx1a-positive and negative cells are visible at E11.5, and F-actin staining in the basal planes increases in intensity and extent at E13.5.

It is also clear from this study that the absence of Lmx1 causes non-cell autonomous defects in the boundary domain and we have already mentioned this in the discussion: “Finally, the patterning abnormalities in Lmx1a<sup>GFP/GFP</sup> samples occurred in both GFP-positive and negative territories, which points at some type of interaction between Lmx1a-expressing and nonexpressing cells, and the possibility that the boundary domain is also a signalling centre influencing the differentiation of adjacent territories.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 6 and related text.

A caveat of long-term Rock inhibition is that it can affect cell proliferation and differentiation of both sensory and non-sensory cells, which would cause secondary effects on boundary formation. This caveat was not adequately addressed. For example, does Rock signaling control either the rate or the orientation of cell division to promote boundary formation? Together with the mild effect of acute Rock inhibition, the precise role of Rock signaling in boundary formation remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree that the exact function of ROCK could not be ascertained in the in vitro experiments, for the reasons we have highlighted in the manuscript (no clear effect in short term treatments, great level of tissue disorganisation in long-term treatments). This prompted us to turn to an in ovo approach.

Very often, it seems to be the Sox2 staining that shows the upward pull better than the F-actin staining. Perhaps, adding an anti-laminin staining to indicate the basement membrane may help.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the upward pull of the basement membrane is not always very clear. We performed some anti-laminin immunostaining on mouse cryosections and provide below (Figure 1) an example of such experiment. The results appear to confirm an upward displacement of the basement membrane in the region separating the lateral crista from the utricle in the E13 mouse inner ear, but given the preliminary nature of these experiments, we believe that these results do not warrant inclusion in the manuscript. The term “pull” is somehow implying that the epithelial cells are responsible for the upward movement of the basement membrane, but since we do not have direct evidence that this is the case, we have replaced “pull” by “displacement” throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is not clear how well the cellular changes are correlated with the timing of border formation as some of the ages shown in the study seem to be well after the sensory patches were separated and the border was established.</p></disp-quote><p>For some experiments (for example E15 in the comparison of mouse Lmx1a-GFP heterozygous and homozygous inner ear tissue; E6 for the RCAS experiments), the early stages of boundary formation are not covered because we decided to focus our analysis on the late consequences of manipulating Lmx1a/ROCK activity in terms of sensory organ segregation. The dataset is more comprehensive for the control developmental series in the chicken and mouse inner ear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The Lmx1a data, as they currently stand could be explained by Lmx1a being required for non-sensory development and not necessarily border formation. Additionally, the relationship between ROCK and Lmx1a was not investigated. Since the investigators have established the molecular mechanisms of Lmx1 function using the chicken system previously, the authors could try to correlate the morphological events described here with the molecular evidence for Lmx1 functioning during border formation in the same chicken system. Right now, only the expression of Sox2 is used to correlate with the cellular events, and not Lmx1, Jag1 or notch.</p></disp-quote><p>These are valid points. Exploring in detail the epistatic relationships between Notch signalling/Lmx1a/ROCK/boundary formation in the chicken model would be indeed very interesting but would require extensive work using both gain and loss-of-function approaches, combined with the analysis of multiple markers (Jag1/Sox2/Lmx1b/PMLC/Factin..). At this point, and in agreement with the referee’s comment, we believe that Lmx1a is above all required for the adoption of the non-sensory fate. The loss of Lmx1a function in the mouse inner ear produce defects in the patterning and cellular features of the boundary domain, but these may be late consequences of the abnormal differentiation of the nonsensory domains that separate sensory organs. Furthermore, ROCK activity does not appear to be required for Sox2 expression (i.e. adoption or maintenance of the sensory fate) since the overexpression of RCII-GFP does not prevent Sox2 expression in the chicken inner ear. This fits with a model in which Notch/Lmx1a regulate cell differentiation whilst ROCK acts independently or downstream of these factors during boundary formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>(1) Figure 1.

The new data included in the revised version include images of basal planes of the boundary domain at E11.5, which reveal F-actin enrichment and the formation of an actin-cable-like structure (Figure 4 suppl. Fig1). Furthermore, the chicken dataset shows that the changes in cell size, alignment, and the formation of actin-cable-like structure precede sensory patch segregation and are visible when Sox2 expression starts to be downregulated in prospective non-sensory tissue (Figure 1, Figure 2).
