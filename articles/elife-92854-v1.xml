assess with standard electrophysiological approaches. Within the medial entorhinal cortex, representation of location by grid and other spatial cells involves circuits in layer 2 in which excitatory stellate cells interact with each other via inhibitory parvalbumin expressing interneurons. Whether this connectivity is structured to support local circuit computations is unclear. Here, we introduce strategies to address the functional organization of excitatory-inhibitory interactions using crossed Cre- and Flp-driver mouse lines to direct targeted presynaptic optogenetic activation and postsynaptic cell identification. We then use simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from postsynaptic neurons to assess their shared input from optically activated presynaptic populations. We find that extensive axonal projections support spatially organized connectivity between stellate cells and parvalbumin interneurons, such that direct connections are often, but not always, shared by nearby neurons, whereas multisynaptic interactions coordinate inputs to neurons with greater spatial separation. We suggest that direct excitatory-inhibitory synaptic interactions may operate at the scale of grid cell clusters, with local modules defined by excitatory-inhibitory connectivity, while indirect interactions may coordinate activity at the scale of grid cell modules.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>excitatory neuron</kwd><kwd>inhibitory neuron</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>synaptic organisation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M025454/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/200855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100015504</institution-id><institution>Simons Initiative for the Developing Brain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garden</surname><given-names>Derek LF</given-names></name><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Critical determinants of these interactions include the spatial extent over which given presynaptic neurons influence their targets, and whether connectivity is specific to subsets of neurons within the potential target population. These circuit properties can be challenging to assess experimentally. For example, while simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from pairs of neurons provide a gold standard for assessment of functional properties of synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markram et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">SjÃ¶strÃ¶m et al., 2001</xref>), even with impressive advances in maximizing the numbers of simultaneously recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), their low throughput makes them less well suited to investigation of the spatial extent and organization of connectivity.</p><p>The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is a promising higher order cortical area for elucidation of principles for circuit level computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moser and Moser, 2013</xref>). The striking spatially periodic firing properties of grid cells found within the MEC has an anatomical organization that shares features with the columnar organization of sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burgalossi and Brecht, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naumann et al., 2018</xref>). Nearby grid cells have a similar spatial scale and orientation, which is maintained across superficial and deep cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>). For grid cells at different dorsoventral locations the scale and orientation of their firing fields varies, with larger scales found in more ventral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>). This variability arises from discrete groups of grid cells that have firing fields with similar scale and orientation and form functional modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stensola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>). Individual modules can be partitioned into cell clusters, with each cluster containing topographically ordered grid cells encoding the full range of possible spatial phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heys et al., 2014</xref>). A critical goal in determining the mechanisms that subserve grid firing is therefore to establish principles for organization of synaptic interactions at these anatomical scales.</p><p>Within layer 2 of the MEC, synaptic interactions between excitatory stellate cells (SCs) and inhibitory parvalbumin positive interneurons (PV+ INs) have received attention as a possible substrate for emergence of grid firing fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buetfering et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shipston-Sharman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Widloski and Fiete, 2014</xref>). Layer 2 of the MEC contains a high density of grid cells, with both stellate and pyramidal cells (PCs) in this layer having grid fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domnisoru et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heys et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rowland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schmidt-Hieber and HÃ¤usser, 2013</xref>). Interactions between SCs appear to be primarily via PV+ INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winterer et al., 2017</xref>), and models based on this connectivity are able to account for grid firing and local theta-nested gamma frequency network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shipston-Sharman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Solanka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Widloski and Fiete, 2014</xref>), while silencing PV+ INs reduces the spatial periodicity of grid firing in layer 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miao et al., 2017</xref>). However, previous investigation of interactions between SCs and PV+ INs have focused on nearby pairs of cells, typically separated by &lt;150 Âµm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhillon and Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grosser et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winterer et al., 2017</xref>). We know much less about their functional synaptic interactions at distances at the scale of grid cell clusters or modules.

To do so, we developed strategies to assess the functional organization of synaptic input to pairs of identified postsynaptic neurons from genetically defined populations of presynaptic neurons. Our results indicate that connectivity between SCs and PV+ INs is organized at the scale of grid cell clusters, such that nearby PV+ INs (or SCs) receive a large proportion, although not all, of their input from the same SCs (or PV+ INs), with this proportion dropping steeply with increasing cell separation. We also find evidence that indirect coordination can operate at longer distances, that networks of interacting SCs and PV+ INs have a modular organization, and that distinct PV+ INs coordinate SCs and nearby pyramidal cells. Our results suggest highly structured and localized synaptic interactions within layer 2 of the MEC as candidates for the organization of spatial representations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Entorhinal stellate cells have extensive intralaminar axon collaterals</title><p>To investigate axonal substrates for intra-layer connectivity of SCs, we first reconstructed neurons from adult mice using methods that maximize recovery of axonal morphology following whole-cell recordings in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>).

The number of locations from which action potentials were initiated increased with increasing stimulation intensity, although at the maximal stimulation intensity action potentials were still typically triggered at relatively few locations close to the soma (4.5Â±2.78 locations). Therefore, because focal stimulation activates SCs with latencies that vary from trial to trial, and individual SCs vary in their light intensity thresholds, postsynaptic events occurring simultaneously in pairs of PV+ INs are likely to originate from the same presynaptic SC. Because activation of SCs was sparse and postsynaptic responses unlikely to be sufficient to drive spiking (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winterer et al., 2017</xref>), it is unlikely that multisynaptic pathways would be activated through this focal stimulation approach.</p><p>To use focal stimulation to assess the extent to which pairs of PV+ INs received common input, we focused on response to stimulus intensities that evoked 335â908 EPSCs across all trials, which corresponds to approximately 7 x the threshold for a detectable response in either of the pair of PV+ INs. We calculated a correlation probability (Pc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâE</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>), which we determined by finding the peak of the summed cross-correlations for all events across all stimulus locations, subtracting the corresponding peak from a shifted dataset, and normalizing by the estimated number of evoked events (see Methods). To identify pairs with Pc unlikely to be generated by chance, we generated a shuffled distribution by calculating Pc for synthetic pairs of PV+ INs recorded at different times.

In this experiment low values of P<sub>C</sub> could reflect local network structure, such that some nearby PV+ INs rarely receive common input from the same SCs, or it may reflect undersampling of the possible SC inputs to each pair of PV+ INs. To distinguish these possibilities, we compared correlation probabilities between stimulus intensities over which the number of postsynaptic events in PV+ INs differs across an approximately two-fold range. We found that the correlation probability was independent of the number of activated SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1H</xref>), suggesting that differential sampling of SC axons does not account for the variation in correlation probability between nearby pairs of PV+ INs.</p><p>These data show that focal laser stimulation of ChR2 expressing presynaptic neurons in combination with simultaneous recordings from postsynaptic neurons can assess the extent to which pairs of neurons receive common inputs.

Alternatively, if there is no clear spatial organization of SC to PV+ INs connections, then the correspondence between active stimulus locations for pairs of PV+ INs should have a random distribution.</p><p>To distinguish these possibilities, we built maps for responses of individual PV+ INs across all stimulation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5DâE</xref>).

Using these approaches, we find that direct functional interactions between SCs and PV+ INs in L2 of the MEC appear localized largely to within ~250 Âµm. The probability of shared connectivity in each direction is variable, with functional connections from SCs to PV+ INs appearing to be demarcated by distinct boundaries. We speculate that directly interacting SCs and PV+ INs may occupy discrete zones that correspond to reported grid cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heys et al., 2014</xref>), while indirect interactions may operate at the scale of grid cell modules.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Assessment of common input to postsynaptic neurons</title><p>Functional investigation of synaptic connectivity, including within MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhillon and Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winterer et al., 2017</xref>), typically relies on simultaneous recordings in which pre- and postsynaptic neurons are identified but are usually within 150 Âµm of one another. Local optical activation of unidentified neurons has also been used to infer connectivity principles but with a focus on responses of single postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beed et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, our primary goal was to address the coordination of downstream neurons by genetically defined upstream neurons. To do so, we introduced new strategies that are potentially applicable to many brain areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). By recording from pairs of PV+ INs (or SCs), and optogenetically activating SCs (or PV+ INs) we were able to assess the extent and organization of projections from one population to the other. We find that with either wide-field or focussed optical activation of upstream neurons defined by genetically targeted expression of ChR2, it is possible to identify pairs of downstream neurons that receive common input. While with either strategy it is possible that weak connections are not detected, results from the two approaches corroborate one another showing similar location-dependence of functional synaptic coordination. Our focal optogenetic stimulation approach also offers insight into the spatial organization of presynaptic neuronal populations, with the advantage, compared to focal glutamate uncaging previously used to investigate connectivity in the MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beed et al., 2010</xref>), that the identity of the presynaptic cell population is genetically defined.</p><p>Our approach to identifying common inputs to pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons is conceptually similar to classic investigations of circuits in visual cortex, which used focal glutamate uncaging to activate upstream neurons while recording from pairs of postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshimura and Callaway, 2005</xref>). An advantage of optogenetic activation is that we were able to address connectivity between genetically defined populations of pre- and postsynaptic neurons. A possible concern with focal single photon optogenetic activation is that activation has limited spatial specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anastasiades et al., 2018</xref>). This means we are not able to identify the individual activated presynaptic neurons, but strict somatic localisation is not necessary for our conclusions based on asynchronous activation of presynaptic neurons. Nevertheless, adoption of soma-targeted opsins would be a useful extension to our approach by facilitating mapping of the activated presynaptic neurons.</p><p>Our widefield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) and focal activation approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) both rely on the fact that neurons expressing ChR2 have different thresholds for initiation of spikes, and that their spike latency is variable from trial to trial. Thus, responses in downstream cells that are highly correlated may either originate from the same presynaptic neuron, or from presynaptic neurons with activity coordinated through multisynaptic pathways. It is important to note here that the absence of correlated inputs in one slice plane does not rule out the possibility that the same cell pair receives common inputs in a different plane, as these inputs would most likely not be activated if the cell bodies of the presynaptic neuron were removed by slicing. Multisynaptic coordination would require ChR2 expressing SCs to activate other neuronal populations. Such intermediary populations are unlikely to include other SCs or pyramidal cells as inputs to both populations from SCs are weak or absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhillon and Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winterer et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this, we did not observe synchronous activation of optogenetically activated SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Instead, the sensitivity of correlated inputs to distant PV+ INs to block of fast GABAergic transmission is consistent with multisynaptic coordination involving interneuron populations. By contrast, correlated responses of nearby PV+ INs appear unlikely to involve multisynaptic coordination as they were maintained during block of fast GABAergic transmission and were observed following focal stimulation, which because it is sparse is unlikely to recruit multisynaptic pathways. Responses of SCs to ramping activation are also unlikely to involve multisynaptic coordination as the activated PV+ INs would inhibit rather than drive activity of their downstream targets.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Spatial extent and functional organization of L2 circuits</title><p>Our results demonstrate that activation of SCs leads to common excitatory synaptic input to pairs of PV+ INs, and activation of PV+ INs leads to common synaptic input to pairs of SCs. Several features of this shared input may be relevant to network computations in L2 of the MEC. (1) Correlation coefficients indicative of common input in each direction were always less than 1 and usually in the region of 0.4â0.6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Thus connectivity in each direction may be incomplete rather than all to all, and the input to any pair of neurons is likely only to be partially overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The incompleteness may in part result from loss of some inputs by tissue slicing. However, the fact that axons were well preserved and typically extended beyond the range of functional correlations, while many cell pairs that did not receive correlated input were relatively close to one another and had overlapping dendritic fields, argues against tissue slicing being a major contributor to incompleteness. (2) Local interactions through direct electrical synapses appear only able to coordinate PV+ INs with short separations (&lt;100 Âµm) relative to the extent of functional coordination, while synaptic interactions between PV+ INs were not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). (3) Many nearby cells donât appear to share common input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), suggesting they are part of distinct networks, or are separated within the connectivity space of the same network. (4) Indirect inhibitory interactions can boost coordination for inputs in the dorsoventral plane, increasing the spatial extent of relatively strong correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). (5) The organization of slice locations that activate inputs from SCs to PV+ INs is relatively similar for neurons that receive common input, can be anticorrelated for neurons that do not, and can often show discrete borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This is consistent with a modular organization within layer 2. (6) Pairs of SCs and pyramidal cells in L2 do not generate correlated responses when PV+ INs are activated.

First, PV+ INs separated by &lt;100 Âµm interact through gap junction connections (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandez et al., 2022</xref>). Second, populations of interacting PV+ INs and SCs separated by up to ~250 Âµm form local modules defined by the common inputs between each cell population (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dhillon and Jones, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Winterer et al., 2017</xref>).

Given the continuous attractor dynamics of grid cell populations observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gardner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoon et al., 2013</xref>), such connectivity could support emergence of activity bumps through excitatory-inhibitory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guanella et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shipston-Sharman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Widloski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Widloski and Fiete, 2014</xref>).

In this framework, intra-modular coordination could result from interactions between clusters mediated by non-PV interneurons. Discrete and incomplete local connectivity could also be consistent with models for grid firing that do not require synaptic interactions between SCs or that focus on pyramidal neurons (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgess et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grossberg and Pilly, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kropff and Treves, 2008</xref>).

Series resistance in voltage-clamp recordings was compensated up to 70%. Voltage-clamp recordings were performed with a holding potential of â70 mV unless otherwise indicated. Data were acquired and filtered at 6 kHz using a Multiclamp 700B Amplifier (Axon Instruments) and digitized at 20 kHz. All data were acquired using Axograph software.</p><p>To block GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission 20 ÂµM GABAzine (Hello Bio) was added to the standard ACSF perfusing the slice. Experiments recording isolated inhibitory postsynaptic currents used ACSF including 5 ÂµM NBQX (Hello Bio) and 50 ÂµM D-AP5 (Hello Bio) and a modified intracellular solution with composition (mM): KCl 140, HEPES 10, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, EGTA 0.1, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 2, Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.3, Na-Phosphocreatine 10 and biocytin 0.5%. Stellate cells were identified by their characteristic sag potentials in response to negative and positive current steps and by their prominent afterhyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pastoll et al., 2012a</xref>). To facilitate recovery of the axonal morphology recordings were maintained for at least 1 hr (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neuronal reconstruction</title><p>To reveal biocytin labeling of the axonal and dendritic morphology of the recorded neurons we adopted previously described procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, following recording slices were fixed overnight at 4 Â°C in 4% paraformaldehyde. They were then washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), incubated overnight with Streptavidin-Alexa 647 (1:500 in PBS), washed in PBS containing 0.3% triton, dried and mounted using Mowiol 4â88 (Aldrich). Identification of stellate cells and pyramidal cells was further confirmed post-hoc by the multiple dendritic processes in the former and the prominent apical dendrites in the latter. Cell data with incomplete biocytin-filled morphology were discarded from analysis. Stellate cells were excluded if the axon was cut prior to leaving the entorhinal cortex. Sample sizes were determined by the number of successful reconstructions that could be obtained from biocytin filled neurons.</p><p>Biocytin-filled cells were manually reconstructed using Neurolucida 360 software (MBF Bioscience) and analyzed using Neurolucida Explorer (MBF Bioscience). To correct X and Y shrinkage, a Ã4 magnification image from the electrophysiology rig was compared to a 4 x confocal image using a 250 Î¼m grid scaled for the electrophysiology rig. Distances of interest (e.g. distance from the cell to the dorsal border of the MEC) were scaled from the 4 x image to the 4 x confocal image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pastoll et al., 2012a</xref>). To correct Z shrinkage the depth of the imaged fixed slice was rescaled to the depth of the slice during recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Photo-stimulation</title><p>For widefield activation of ChR2 we used a 470 nm LED (Thorlabs) attached to the epifluorescence port of the experimental microscope (Olympus BX-51), and focused onto the slice chamber using a 40 x objective (Olympus). The irradiance of the LED was controlled by custom analogue voltage commands. The maximal intensity used in this study was ~22Â mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. The region of neurons activated by the LED had a radius of approximately 100 Âµm and depth greater than 100 Âµm. Before evaluating responses to asynchronous activation of presynaptic neurons, we tested each cell pair for functional ChR2 driven postsynaptic responses using a 3ms duration square pulse of intensity ~22Â mW/mm<sup>2</sup> delivered 3 times. We included cell pairs for analysis when both cells demonstrated suprathreshold membrane potential responses in current-clamp mode or amplitude of EPSCs/IPSCs &gt;100 pA in voltage-clamp mode. To asynchronously activate ChR2 expressing neurons, we used an 8 s duration ramp-modulated light stimulus (~10Â mW/mm<sup>2</sup> final intensity) repeated 5 times and with the field of view centered approximately at the equal point between two simultaneously recorded cells.</p><p>For focal activation of ChR2, laser light was generated using a 100 mW 473 nm diode laser (RappOpto; Hamburg, Germany), integrated into the light path of the microscope and focused onto the slice using a 40 x objective. A neutral density filter with 1% transmission rate was used to attenuate the laser beam. In the focal plane of the slice the diameter of the stimulation site was ~1 Âµm. Stimulation sites were organized in a 7x10 grid with adjacent sites spaced 20 Âµm apart along each row and column, giving an overall scanning area of 120 Âµm x 180 Âµm. The longer scanning axis was parallel to the dorsal-ventral axis in sagittal slices and the medial-lateral axis in horizontal slices. The center of the laser scanning area was focused on the region where ChR2-expressing cell bodies were most abundant. In cases where the viral expression between the pair of recorded cells was homogenous, the objective was focused approximately at the equal point between the two recorded cells. In the laser scanning protocol, a 1 ms light pulse was applied to one location at a time. Five locations were stimulated per second in a serial, pseudorandom order, with 5 s breaks after every 15 s of laser scanning. The laser scanning was repeated 10 times for each laser power. Data were sampled at a range of laser powers, from the intensity that gives minimum light-evoked responses to the minimum laser intensity that renders light-evoked responses from all the 70 scanning sites. The step size of linear increment of laser power was 10 or 100 ÂµW, according to the range of light responsiveness of recorded cells. The trials in which the baseline was fluctuating were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis, simulations, and statistics</title><p>All data were analyzed using built in and custom written routines in IGOR pro (Wavemetrics), Axograph, MATLAB (Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox; Mathworks) and R (R Core Team).</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Simulation of convergent synaptic input</title><p>The goal of our simulations was to assess if cross-correlations between somatic membrane currents recorded from pairs of neurons could be used to establish whether they receive shared input from the same pre-synaptic neuron. While this should be obvious if neurons exclusively receive shared input, we wanted to establish whether shared input is detectable when each neuron also receives independent inputs of similar frequency and amplitude to the shared input. Because we considered experimental conditions in which neurons are voltage-clamped, and therefore capacitance currents are zero and voltage-gated currents are stationary, we simulate only the synaptic currents resulting from activation of populations of presynaptic SCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To generate times for activation of the presynaptic inputs, we first recorded responses of ChR2 expressing SCs to ramping light stimuli and extracted the spike times. We then convolved the spike times with simulated postsynaptic EPSC waveforms, approximating those recorded from PV+ INs, described using the following functions:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>g</italic> is the conductance, <italic>gmax</italic> is the maximum conductance (set to 1 ÂµS), <italic>tau</italic> is the time to peak of the conductance change (1ms), <italic>i</italic> is the synaptic current, <italic>v</italic> is the resting membrane potential (â70 mV) and <italic>e</italic> is the equilibrium potential for the transmitter-gated event (0 mV). This resulted in simulated postsynaptic current responses to each presynaptic spike train. To capture trial-to-trial variability in timing we computed current responses for multiple ramping responses of each SC.</p><p>Because experiments were conducted in the voltage-clamp configuration, we simulate responses to activation of multiple presynaptic SCs by summing the individual current traces generated from spike trains of different experimentally recorded SCs. In each simulation, two postsynaptic neurons, equivalent to the experimentally voltage-clamped PV+ INs, received input from 8 SCs, while the number of shared presynaptic inputs varied systematically between simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Analyses of electrophysiological data</title><p>To evaluate potential shared input to pairs of neurons on the basis of responses to ramp-like optical activation of presynaptic neurons, the recorded postsynaptic membrane currents were first bandpass filtered between 10 and 120 Hz. The cross-correlation coefficients between filtered membrane currents from each pair of simultaneously recorded neurons were then calculated using a 250 ms time window that was shifted at 10ms intervals across the duration of the response to the ramp stimulus. The maximum cross-correlation coefficient was calculated by averaging and smoothing cross-correlation coefficients over five trials, and extracting the maximal value during photo-stimulation. The minimum variance of time lags was calculated by averaging and smoothing the standard deviation of time lags over 5 trials, extracting and squaring the minimal value during the time series of photo-stimulation.</p><p>To evaluate shared input on the basis of experiments with focal optical activation of presynaptic neurons, EPSCs were first detected from the recorded postsynaptic currents using the template matching function implemented in Axograph. We defined a template EPSC from experimental data, and then set the algorithm to detect the shape of EPSC events that matches the template including the events that overlap partially in time. The signal-to-noise ratio for detecting events was set to 2.5. Correlation probabilities were calculated using previously described procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>). Cross-correlograms were calculated for each pair of stimulation locations using 4 ms histogram bins, with the central bin spanning 0Â±2ms. The cross-correlograms for each scanning location were summed up. The same data and approach, but with stimulus labels shifted, was used to generate shifted cross-correlograms. The value in the central bin of the shifted cross-correlogram was subtracted from that of the unshifted cross-correlogram. The result was then normalized by dividing by the total number of evoked EPSCs, to give the correlation probability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Anatomical reconstructions</title><p>The densities of reconstructed axons and dendrites were calculated using the TREES toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuntz et al., 2011</xref>). The size of voxels was 5 Âµm in the calculation of densities of cellular processes. We varied the distance between two postsynaptic cells and their locations relative to the presynaptic cell along either dorsoventral or mediolateral axes in each simulation. An estimate of axodendritic overlapping was measured by multiplying voxel by voxel densities of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal processes and summing across all voxels. We normalized this value with the value obtained by setting the soma of three neurons to the same coordinates, which gives a ratio of overlapping. To specifically evaluate the axodendritic overlapping from one presynaptic neurons onto two postsynaptic neurons, we only consider the cases where the axodendritic densities of both pre- and postsynaptic pairs are positive values, otherwise we set the ratio of overlapping to be zero.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-4"><title>Statistics</title><p>For group comparisons where the distribution of data points was approximately normal we used standard parametric statistics. Differences in axon and dendritic length between layers and slice plane were evaluated with two-way repeated measures ANOVA, with slice plane and layer as the group variables and repeated measures used because the same neuron contributes measures to each layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref>). The relative extent of axons and dendrites were compared using paired t-tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6G</xref>). Comparisons of correlograms used ANOVA with time bin and whether the correlogram was directly obtained from the data or from shuffled data as group variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Relationships between variables were evaluated by fitting linear models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F, H</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D</xref>).

To understand the mechanism, the current study investigated synaptic interactions between stellate cells (SC) and PV+ interneurons (IN) in layer 2 of the MEC by combing optogenetic activations and paired patch-clamp recordings. The results convincingly demonstrated highly structured interactions between these neurons: specific and direct excitatory-inhibitory interactions existed at the scale of grid cell phase clusters, and indirect interactions occurred at the scale of grid modules.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is very well written, the approaches used are clever, and the data were thoroughly analyzed. The study conveyed important information towards understanding the circuit mechanism that shapes grid cell activity. It is important not only for the field of MEC and grid cells, but also for broader fields of continuous attractor network and neural circuit.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The study largely relies on the fact that ramp-like wide field optogenetic stimulation and focal optogenetic activation both drove asynchronous action potentials in SCs, and therefore, if a pair of PV+ INs exhibited correlated activity, they should receive common inputs. While the asynchronization of action potentials during ramp-like wide field optogenetics was shown in Figure 2 Figure Supplement 1, the asynchronization during focal optogenetic activation was not confirmed in the current experimental setting.

The study conveyed important information for understanding the circuit mechanism that shapes grid cell activity. It is important not only for the field of MEC and grid cells, but also for broader fields of continuous attractor networks and neural circuits.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The study largely relies on the fact that ramp-like wide-field optogenetic stimulation and focal optogenetic activation both drove asynchronous action potentials in SCs, and therefore, if a pair of PV+ INs exhibited correlated activity, they should receive common inputs. However, it is unclear what criteria/thresholds were used to determine the level of activity asynchronization, and under these criteria, what percentage of cells actually showed synchronized or less asynchronized activity. A notable percentage of synchronized or less asynchronized SCs could complicate the results, i.e., PV+ INs with correlated activity could receive inputs from different SCs (different inputs), which had synchronized activity. More detailed information/statistics about the asynchronization of SC activity is necessary for interpreting the results.</p></disp-quote><p>The percentage of SCs that show synchronised activity during ramping optogenetic activation is zero. To make this clear we've added new quantification to the analyses of simultaneously activated SCs in Figure 2, Figure Supplement 1. This includes confidence intervals for the correlograms and statistical comparisons of the correlograms to shuffled data from each pair of neurons. We also validate our statistical analysis strategy by showing that it successfully identifies autocorrelation peaks for the same cells.</p><p>Synchronisation during focal optogenetic activation is also expected to be zero. We did not commit resources to experiments to directly test this for focal stimulation because we had already tested the possibility with ramping stimuli discussed above, and because the established biophysics of local SC circuits is such that synchronised activity during selective activation of SCs is unlikely. In particular, because direct excitatory connections between SCs are either rare or absent (Fuchs et al. 2016; Couey et al. 2013; Pastoll et al. 2013; Winterer et al. 2017), and when detected have small amplitude (Winterer et al. 2017), no mechanism exists that could drive synchronisation. The absence of coordination in responses to ramping stimuli quantified above is consistent with this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The hypothesis about the &quot;direct excitatory-inhibitory&quot; synaptic interactions is made based on the GABAzine experiments in Figure 4. In the Figure 8 diagram, the direct interaction is illustrated between PV+ INs and SCs. However, the evidence supporting this &quot;direct interaction&quot; between these two cell types is missing. Is it possible that pyramidal cells are also involved in this interaction? Some pieces of evidence or discussions are necessary to further support the &quot;direction interaction&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We were insufficiently clear in our previous attempts to ground these interpretations in the context of previous work. The hypothesis about &quot;direct excitatory-inhibitory&quot; interactions wasn't made solely on the basis of Figure 4, but from multiple previous studies that directly demonstrate these interactions (e.g. Fuchs et al. 2016; Couey et al. 2013; Pastoll et al. 2013). Similarly, the diagram in Figure 8 doesn't only reflect the conclusions of the present study but integrates work from these and other previous studies.</p><p>A possible role for pyramidal cells in coordination would require that they can be driven to fire action potentials by input from SCs. However, SCs appear not to connect to pyramidal cells (0/126 tested connections in Winterer et al. 2017). Thus, this possibility is inconsistent with the previously published data.</p><p>To make these points clearer we have added additional discussion and citations to the results (p 5), discussion (p 11) and legend to Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, Huang et al. employed optogenetic stimulation alongside paired whole-cell recordings in genetically defined neuron populations of the medial entorhinal cortex to examine the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs and the functional-anatomical structure of the MEC. They specifically studied the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs from parvalbumin-expressing interneurons to pairs of excitatory stellate cells. Additionally, they explored the spatial distribution of synaptic inputs to pairs of PV INs. Their results indicate that both pairs of SCs and PV INs generally receive common input when their relative somata are within 200-300 ums of each other. The research is intriguing, with controlled and systematic methodologies. There are interesting takeaways based on the implications of this work to grid cell network organization in MEC.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Results indicate that in brain slices, nearby cells typically share a higher degree of common input. However, some proximate cells lack this shared input. The authors interpret these findings as: &quot;Many cells in close proximity don't seem to share common input, as illustrated in Figures 3, 5, and 7. This implies that these cells might belong to separate networks or exist in distinct regions of the connectivity space within the same network.&quot;.</p><p>Every slice orientation could have potentially shared inputs from an orthogonal direction that are unavoidably eliminated. For instance, in a horizontal section, shared inputs to two SCs might be situated either dorsally or ventrally from the horizontal cut, and thus removed during slicing. Given the synaptic connection distributions observed within each intact orientation, and considering these distributions appear symmetrically in both horizontal and sagittal sections, the authors should be equipped to estimate the potential number of inputs absent due to sectioning in the orthogonal direction. How might this estimate influence the findings, especially those indicating that many close neurons don't have shared inputs?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion, however systematically generating estimates that account in full for the relative position of the postsynaptic neurons, for variation in the organisation of their dendritic fields and for unknowns such as the location and number of synaptic contacts made, quickly leads to a large potential parameter space, while not advancing our understanding beyond qualitative assessment of the raw data.</p><p>Given this, we make the following comments:</p><p>'We note that the absence of correlated inputs in one slice plane does not rule out the possibility that the same cell pair receives common inputs in a different plane, as these inputs would most likely not be activated if the cell bodies of the presynaptic neuron were removed by slicing.' (p10) and:</p><p>'The incompleteness may in part result from loss of some inputs by tissue slicing. However, the fact that axons were well preserved and typically extended beyond the range of functional correlations, while many cell pairs that did not receive correlated input were relatively close to one another and had overlapping dendritic fields, argues against tissue slicing being a major contributor to incompleteness.' (p10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The study examines correlations during various light-intensity phases of the ramp stimuli. One wonders if the spatial distribution of shared (or correlated) versus independent inputs differs when juxtaposing the initial light stimulation phase, which begins to trigger spiking, against subsequent phases. This differentiation might be particularly pertinent to the PV to SC measurements. Here, the initial phase of stimulation, as depicted in Figure 7, reveals a relatively sparse temporal frequency of IPSCs. This might not represent the physiological conditions under which high-firing INs function.</p><p>While the authors seem to have addressed parts of this concern in their focal stim experiments by examining correlations during both high and low light intensities, they could potentially extract this metric from data acquired in their ramp conditions. This would be especially valuable for PV to SC measurements, given the absence of corresponding focal stimulation experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer's comments recognise, the consistent results with focal stimulation already provide direct experimental validation to our ramp stimulation approach. We appreciate the suggestion for further analysis, but as we understand it this analysis would be hard to interpret. First, variation between pairs in the activity at different phases of the light ramp will be confounded by slice to slice differences in the level of ChR2 expression, e.g. in Figure 2, Figure Supplement 1 within slice variability is low, whereas between slice variation is relatively high. This is because in slices with relatively low expression spike onset is relatively late, while in slices with relatively high expression spike onset is early in the ramp and later in the ramp neurons experience depolarising block. Second, the onset of changes in cross-correlation coefficients and lag variation is typically abrupt. This makes it challenging to assign windows to onset phases or to interpret the resulting data.</p><p>(3) Re results from Figure 2: Please fully describe the model in the methods section. Generally, I like using a modeling approach to explore the impact of convergent synaptic input to PVs from SCs that could effectively validate the experimental approach and enhance the interpretability of the experimental stim/recording outcomes. However, as currently detailed in the manuscript, the model description is inadequate for assessing the robustness of the simulation outcomes. If the IN model is simply integrate-and-fire with minimal biophysical attributes, then the findings in Fig 2F results shown in Fig 2F might be trivial. Conversely, if the model offers a more biophysically accurate representation (e.g., with conductance-based synaptic inputs, synapses appropriately dispersed across the model IN dendritic tree, and standard PV IN voltage-gated membrane conductances), then the model's results could serve as a meaningful method to both validate and interpret the experiments.</p><p>We have expanded the description of the modelling given in the methods including clearer motivation and justification (p 15). Two points are helpful to consider:</p><p>First, the goal of the model is to assess the feasibility of the correlation based approach given the synaptic current responses recorded at the soma. We now make this clearer by stating that:</p><p>'The goal of our simulations was to assess if analysis of cross-correlations between currents recorded from pairs of neurons could be used to establish whether they receive shared input from the same pre-synaptic neuron. While this should be obvious if neurons exclusively receive shared input, we wanted to establish whether shared input is detectable when each neuron also receives independent inputs of similar frequency and amplitude to the shared input.' (p 15).</p><p>The suggestion that the results in Figure 2F are trivial doesn't make sense to us. Indeed, it strikes us as non-trivial that with this approach shared input from a single common presynaptic neuron is not detectable, but input from two or more is.</p><p>Second, because we are simulating a somatic voltage-clamp experiment the details of the neuronal time constants, voltage-gated channels or other integrative mechanisms that reviewer suggests may be important here are not actually relevant to the interpretation.
