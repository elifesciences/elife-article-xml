MCAK (mitotic centromere-associated kinesin), a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, is an end-binding regulator of catastrophe frequency. It is intriguing how MCAK specifically binds to growing microtubule ends. Here, we measure the end-binding kinetics of MCAK using single-molecule imaging and reveal that MCAK not only binds to the distalmost ends, but also to the proximal region of GTP cap where EB1 preferentially binds. Further analysis shows that MCAK strongly binds to GTPγS microtubules which mimic the GDP·Pi-tubulin-enriched region of GTP cap, and this binding preference is dependent on the nucleotide state of MCAK. This finding suggests that MCAK recognizes the nucleotide-dependent feature of microtubule ends. Moreover, we show that although MCAK and XMAP215 partly share binding regions at the distalmost ends, they act largely independently, influencing catastrophe frequency and growth rate, respectively. Overall, our findings provide new insights into how MCAK regulates microtubule end dynamics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MCAK</kwd><kwd>microtubule dynamics</kwd><kwd>end binding</kwd><kwd>depolymerization</kwd><kwd>GTP cap</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h0zpd94</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01h0zpd94</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32370730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A key finding is that MCAK binds to the proximal region of GTP cap where GDP‧Pi-tubulins accumulate, in addition to curved protofilaments at the distalmost tip.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules are essential components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, supporting a wide range of cellular processes, including cell division, polarization, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberts, 2015</xref>). However, their properties can vary considerably across different cellular contexts and structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janke and Magiera, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wittmann et al., 2001</xref>). This variability reflects the complex and tightly regulated mechanisms that govern the dynamics of cellular microtubules, among which the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) play crucial roles.</p><p>Kinesin superfamily members not only facilitate the transport of cargo along microtubules but also serve as regulators of microtubule dynamics, as exemplified by the kinesin-13 family. Initially identified through studies of spindle functions and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aizawa et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Noda et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walczak et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wordeman and Mitchison, 1995</xref>), kinesin-13 has since been implicated in a broad range of cellular processes, including spindle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ohi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Walczak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walczak et al., 1996</xref>), chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kline-Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maney et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>), directional migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zong et al., 2021</xref>), ciliary length control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Piao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vasudevan et al., 2015</xref>), and neuronal polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Homma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Puri et al., 2021</xref>). The loss of kinesin-13 often results in altered structural and dynamic properties of cellular microtubules. Moreover, the subcellular localizations of kinesin-13, such as at growing microtubule ends, centrosomes, and centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kline-Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kline-Smith and Walczak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mennella et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moore and Wordeman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Moore et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walczak et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wordeman and Mitchison, 1995</xref>), are key regulatory sites for microtubule dynamics. These observations suggest that kinesin-13 family members are key regulators for the length, mass, and polarity of cellular microtubules.</p><p>As a representative member of the kinesin-13 family, MCAK has been characterized as both a microtubule depolymerase and a catastrophe factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kline-Smith and Walczak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maney et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walczak et al., 1996</xref>). It has been proposed that MCAK targets growing microtubule ends by interacting with end-binding proteins (EBs) or motors, such as Kif18b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montenegro Gouveia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McHugh and Welburn, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tanenbaum et al., 2011</xref>). Upon binding, MCAK destabilizes the protective GTP cap at growing microtubule ends by bending and disassembling underlying substrate, including terminal tubulin dimers or protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moores and Milligan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), thereby increasing the frequency of catastrophe events. MCAK can also function independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>), potentially targeting stabilized microtubule ends through direct binding or rapid diffusion along the microtubule lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oguchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Previous structural studies suggest that MCAK recognizes curved protofilaments at microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trofimova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). However, these studies primarily focus on stabilized microtubules, short protofilaments, or tubulin dimers, leaving the mechanism by which MCAK binds to growing microtubule ends remaining elusive.</p><p>In this study, we use single-molecule imaging to investigate the direct binding of MCAK to growing microtubule ends. A key finding is that MCAK binds to the proximal region of GTP cap where GDP‧Pi-tubulins accumulate, in addition to its known binding at the distalmost tip, where XMAP215 binds to curved protofilaments. Further analysis reveals that MCAK strongly binds to GTPγS microtubules, which are thought to mimic GDP·Pi-tubulins enriched in the EB cap. These findings indicate that MCAK recognizes the nucleotide-dependent feature of growing microtubule ends. Having confirmed that MCAK binds to the entire GTP cap structure, we next examine how MCAK co-regulates microtubule dynamics in collaboration with XMAP215 and reveal their separate effect on growth rate and catastrophe frequency, respectively. Overall, this study provides novel insights into how MCAK binds to and acts at growing microtubule ends.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MCAK shows a binding preference for growing microtubule ends</title><p>We began by measuring the single-molecule binding kinetics of MCAK at growing microtubule ends using the in vitro microtubule dynamics assay. This experiment was performed in BRB80 supplemented with 50 mM KCl and 1 mM ATP, providing a near-physiological ion strength of approximately 0.2 M, similar to what was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scopes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Storey, 2004</xref>). The size-exclusion chromatography analysis showed that the purified GFP-MCAK exists as dimers under this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We observed MCAK binding events both at growing microtubule ends and along the lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To characterize these events, we measured the fluorescence intensity of each binding event (see Materials and methods) and plotted a probability distribution of all binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used the range of fluorescence intensity from the probability distribution (μ±2σ: 300±145 A.U.) to identify single MCAK dimers. Using a custom software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maurer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song et al., 2020</xref>), we determined the end-binding position of each individual MCAK molecule in each frame by fitting a Gaussian function to the intensity profile along the longitudinal axis of the microtubule, with the plus-end serving as the positional reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The average position over the dwell time of each MCAK molecule was taken as the position of this binding event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). From this, we generated a probability distribution of all binding positions, derived from 152 binding events across three assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This analysis revealed that the MCAK binding region was 162 nm in length (FWHM, Full Width at Half Maximum), corresponding to approximately 20 layers of tubulin dimers. We categorized the binding events of MCAK within this region as ‘end binding’ and those located more proximally as ‘lattice binding’.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MCAK preferentially binds to growing microtubule ends.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative kymographs of single-molecule GFP-MCAK (green, 10 nM, measured in terms of monomer concentration unless otherwise stated) binding events on dynamic microtubules (red, tubulin: 16 mM) growing from GMPCPP microtubule seeds (blue) in the presence of 1 mM ATP.

Previous studies, mostly based on tubulin dimers, short protofilaments, or stabilized microtubules, suggested that MCAK binds microtubule ends by recognizing curved protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moores and Milligan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trofimova et al., 2018</xref>). This model predicts that MCAK binds to the distalmost end of growing microtubules, overlapping with the binding region of XMAP215 family members (i.e. the distalmost cap; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brouhard et al., 2008</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we quantified the end-binding regions of MCAK, EB1, and XMAP215 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) by measuring the FWHM of their spatial distribution. To our surprise, the probability distribution of MCAK’s positions exhibited a significant difference from that of XMAP215 (p&lt;10<sup>–5</sup>, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The end-binding region of MCAK (FWHM = 185 nm) was longer than that of XMAP215 (FWHM = 123 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It extended proximally towards the lattice, covering the binding region of EB1 (i.e. the EB cap, FWHM = 118 nm).

In each frame, we measured the distance between the intensity peaks of XMAP215 and MCAK along the microtubule’s longitudinal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The average distance over MCAK’s binding duration was then calculated to determine its relative position to XMAP215. Subsequently, we plotted a probability distribution of all relative distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This distribution peaked at –65 nm, indicating that MCAK predominantly binds behind XMAP215, with 14.5% of binding events occurring within XMAP215’s binding region (distance &gt;0).

To address this, we performed the experiments for MCAK‧AMPPNP, MCAK‧ADP, and MCAK‧APO. The MCAK variants bound to the lattice of microtubules with different affinities (MCAK‧APO &gt;MCAK‧AMPPNP &gt;MCAK‧ADP &gt;MCAK‧ATP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with the results observed on the lattice of dynamic microtubules.

We sought to identify the key domains responsible for MCAK’s preference for the EB cap. Previous studies have shown that the α4 helix and the L2 loop are critical for mediating MCAK’s interaction with curved protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, the α4 helix of MCAK interacts with the intradimer interface of the tubulin heterodimer, while the L2 loop contacts the interdimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, the electrostatic interactions between the α4 helix and the L2 loop of MCAK with the tubulin heterodimer are important for MCAK’s interactions with microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2008</xref>), as phosphorylation at T537 disrupts MCAK’s microtubule-end binding and depolymerization activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanhaji et al., 2010</xref>). We then wondered whether these domains also contribute to the binding preference for the EB cap.

Both are capable of binding to dynamic microtubule ends and regulating microtubule dynamics. In the previous reports, they were shown to antagonistically regulate microtubule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr and Gergely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kinoshita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moriwaki and Goshima, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tournebize et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, structural models have indicated that both MCAK and XMAP215 bind to curved tubulin dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trofimova et al., 2018</xref>), raising the possibility of competition for binding sites in the distalmost cap. However, while XMAP215 was reported to promote microtubule catastrophe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holmfeldt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vasquez et al., 1994</xref>), our findings showed that MCAK binds more proximally relative to the binding region of XMAP215 at growing microtubule ends. The extent to which competition from XMAP215 would antagonize the function of MCAK remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the collective effect of MCAK and XMAP215 on microtubule dynamics remains an intriguing question.</p><p>To investigate this issue, we studied how MCAK and XMAP215 together regulate microtubule growth rate and catastrophe frequency. Based on our pilot experiments, we chose 20 nM for MCAK and 50 nM for XMAP215 as representative concentrations. In the presence of 20 nM MCAK, dynamic microtubules could grow, but their catastrophe frequency was significantly increased, and their lifetime was shortened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). In contrast, 50 nM XMAP215 increased the growth rate more than fourfold (control: 0.8±0.1 µm min<sup>–1</sup>, n=97 microtubules from 6 assays; 50 nM XMAP215: 3.7±0.3 µm min<sup>–1</sup>, n=50 microtubules from 3 assays). Notably, XMAP215 alone also caused a mild shortening of microtubule lifetime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>; 50 nM XMAP215: 264.6±12.9 s, n=237 growing events from 3 assays), as compared to that of the control group (323.4±12.6 s of control, n=443 growing events from 6 assays; p&gt;1, the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction). This is consistent with previous reports suggesting that XMAP215 enhances fluctuations in microtubule end structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farmer et al., 2021</xref>). When both 20 nM MCAK and 50 nM XMAP215 were added, the microtubule growth rate was comparable to that observed with XMAP215 alone (3.9±0.3 µm min<sup>–1</sup>, n=52 microtubules from 3 assays; p=0.5, the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction), suggesting that MCAK does not significantly affect XMAP215’s function as a polymerase. However, the lifetime of dynamic microtubules (170.3±7.5 s, n=283 growing events from 3 assays) was shorter than that observed with XMAP215 alone (p=2×10<sup>–6</sup>, the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction), while it was similar to that observed with MCAK alone (196.7±6.6 s, n=621 growing events from 6 assays; p&gt;1, the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To determine whether this reflects the simple summation of the individual contributions of MCAK and XMAP215 or a synergistic effect, we calculated the probability-based catastrophe frequency for all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>). We found that the effects of MCAK and XMAP215 on the probability of microtubule catastrophe were additive, indicating that there was no synergistic effect on catastrophe frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This suggests that, at least at this concentration combination, MCAK and XMAP215 independently regulate different parameters of microtubule dynamics, namely catastrophe frequency and growth rate, while simultaneously interacting with microtubule ends.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Functional specification of MCAK and XMAP215 at growing microtubule ends.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative kymographs of dynamic microtubules (tubulin: 10 µM) under four conditions: control (no MAPs), 20 nM MCAK (1 mM ATP), 50 nM XMAP215 or both (1 mM ATP).

The previously established view on the end-binding mechanism of MCAK is based on its specific recognition of curved protofilaments at the distalmost end of growing microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moores and Milligan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mulder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The findings presented here expand on this model by showing that MCAK also recognizes the nucleotide-dependent feature of growing microtubule ends, more specifically the EB cap where the GDP‧Pi-tubulins accumulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Below, we discuss our key findings and their implications.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Cartoon schematics depicting the working model of MCAK at growing microtubule ends.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A hypothetical model for the binding of MCAK at growing microtubule ends.

This conclusion is based on four main lines of evidence. First, localization analysis demonstrates that MCAK not only binds to the distalmost cap but also to the EB cap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Second, MCAK‧ADP shows the significantly reduced, but not abolished, binding preference for growing microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), while their binding preference for curved protofilaments is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These different binding behaviors suggest that additional structural features, beyond curved protofilaments, contribute to MCAK’s growing end-binding preference. Third, MCAK preferentially binds to GTPγS microtubules over GDP microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Since the tubulins in GTPγS microtubules are considered to mimic, at least, some of the key features of the GDP‧Pi-tubulins in the EB cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maurer et al., 2012</xref>), this suggests that MCAK can recognize the molecular features of tubulin dimers within the EB cap. Fourth, previous cryo-EM studies have shown that GTP hydrolysis leads to longitudinal compression of tubulin dimers, increasing the contact area at the interdimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LaFrance et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manka and Moores, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the interface in GTPγS microtubules is characteristic, being larger than that of a straight GMPCPP-tubulin lattice but smaller than that of a straight GDP-tubulin lattice. We find that the L2 loop contributes to the binding preference to the EB cap, and it was previously reported that the L2 loop of MCAK directly contacts the interdimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trofimova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), potentially providing a structural basis for MCAK to distinguish the nucleotide-dependent features of tubulin dimers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The end-binding affinity of MCAK</title><p>In our experiments, we observed that MCAK exhibits a relatively low end-binding affinity (69 µM), raising the question of its physiological relevance. Several factors may contribute to this observation. First, the in vitro system used may not fully recapitulate physiological conditions. For instance, lowering the salt concentration significantly increases binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McHugh et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, while numerous binding events with short durations were detected, we excluded transient interactions from our analysis to facilitate quantification. This likely led to an underestimation of the on-rate and, consequently, the binding affinity. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that retaining a His-tag markedly enhances microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maurer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>). To minimize interference from purification tags, we ensured complete removal of the His-tag during protein preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which may explain the lower apparent binding affinity in our study compared to others. Finally, a low affinity is not necessarily unexpected. Considering the microtubule end as a receptor with multiple binding sites for MCAK, the overall binding affinity is in the nanomolar range (260 nM). Indeed, only a few MCAK molecules may be sufficient to induce microtubule catastrophe.</p><p>A natural follow-up question is the physiological relevance of MCAK’s direct binding to microtubule ends compared to the well-established EB1-mediated pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Montenegro Gouveia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honnappa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McHugh and Welburn, 2023</xref>). The relative contributions of these two pathways depend on MCAK’s end-binding affinity. To estimate their proportional contributions, we employed a simple model (Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). The modeling results suggest that MCAK’s direct end-binding affinity contributes through two distinct mechanisms (Appendix 1). First, MCAK establishes an EB1-independent regulatory pathway. Simultaneously, it enhances the EB1-dependent pathway by increasing the microtubule-end affinity of the MCAK-EB1 complex. Notably, these two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive. Particularly intriguing is that the direct regulatory pathway may account for previously observed experimental phenomena. For example, prior studies have shown that both MCAK and EB1 accumulate at the centromere and centrosome during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahmanyar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fodde et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kline-Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maney et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wordeman and Mitchison, 1995</xref>). However, EB1 neither influences MCAK’s localization at these sites nor significantly modulates its local functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Domnitz et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for the working mechanism of MCAK</title><p>We think that our findings add to the current working model of MCAK in several ways. First, the end-binding preference of MCAK for growing microtubule ends is nucleotide state-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The present study demonstrates that MCAK exhibits the strongest end-binding preference in the ATP-bound state, suggesting that MCAK‧ATP could more effectively distinguish between the end and the lattice. This supports the view that MCAK acts at growing microtubule ends in the ATP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asenjo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benoit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Second, the binding preference of MCAK to the GDP‧Pi-tubulins provides a mechanism for MCAK remaining bound to the GTP cap after ATP hydrolysis. In a speculative scenario, after the terminal tubulin dimers are removed, the MCAK motor domain transitions to the ADP state and loses its affinity for curved protofilaments. However, it still preferentially binds to GDP‧Pi-tubulins, allowing MCAK to stay within the GTP cap. As ADP is replaced by a new ATP, the motor domain could locally diffuse to explore a new working site for the next round of catalysis, which may facilitate MCAK’s processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friel and Howard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunter et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Third, we found that XMAP215 and MCAK independently regulate the growth rate and catastrophe frequency of microtubules, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Previous studies have suggested that XMAP215 and MCAK exert antagonistic effects on microtubule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr and Gergely, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kinoshita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moriwaki and Goshima, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tournebize et al., 2000</xref>), possibly through competition for binding sites. Structural studies have indicated overlap in the binding sites of MCAK and XMAP215 on tubulin dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayaz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trofimova et al., 2018</xref>), lending support to this hypothesis. However, in the present study, we observed that the binding regions of XMAP215 and MCAK at growing microtubule ends are not entirely overlapping, with MCAK predominantly binding proximally to the binding region of XMAP215 at growing microtubule ends. These findings suggest an alternative mechanism for the combined effects of XMAP215 and MCAK. In this model, MCAK and XMAP215 independently regulate catastrophe frequency and growth rate, respectively, modulating microtubule dynamics through additive effects, rather than through direct competition for binding sites. This model may provide a mechanistic explanation for why ch-TOG (the mammalian homolog of XMAP215) doesn’t suppress MCAK activity in mammalian interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holmfeldt et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Protein expression in Sf9 cells</title><p>Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were utilized for the expression of MCAK, its mutants, and XMAP215 protein, employing a modified Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system.

Briefly, fluorescence calibration of the captured movie was performed using fluorescent beads (T7279, Thermo Fisher Scientific). During the dwell time of a single-molecule binding event, the microtubule lattice was considered as a Gaussian wall and its end as a half-Gaussian in every frame. The peak position of the half-Gaussian was used as a reference to measure the intensity profile of single-molecule binding events frame by frame. A Gaussian function was employed to fit the intensity profile of individual molecules. The position at the peak of the intensity profile was taken as the single molecule’s location in every frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Subsequently, the average of these positions was taken to represent the single-molecule binding event’s position during its dwell time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This procedure was iterated for all single-molecule binding events to determine their positions during their respective dwell times. Then, the spatial positional distributions of GFP-MCAK and XMAP215-GFP were fitted by Gaussian fitting and the spatial positional distribution of EB1-GFP was fitted to an exponentially modified Gaussian function, from which we calculated the FWHM as an estimation for their length of the binding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Location precision analysis</title><p>The observed image results from the convolution of the fluorescent object with the system’s point spread function (PSF). Consequently, the standard deviation of the observed image reflects a combination of measurement error (standard deviation) in determining the object’s position and the width of the PSF (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bohner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demchouk et al., 2011</xref>). To characterize the PSF of the imaging system, we used multicolor fluorescent beads (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat. # T7279) with a 100 nm diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirvonen et al., 2009</xref>). When measuring the position of a microtubule end in a single image, we modeled the microtubule lattice as a Gaussian wall and its end as a half-Gaussian. Using this fitting approach, we estimated the measurement error (standard deviation) of the convolved microtubule end positions and deconvolved the system’s PSF contribution using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>. The mean standard deviation of end positions over the dwell time of a binding event was then used as the measurement error for the microtubule end position. This procedure was iterated for all microtubule ends with single-molecule binding events to construct their measurement errors. Then, the probability distribution of measurement errors was fitted by Gaussian fitting. The standard deviation of the probability distribution was taken as the precision in estimating microtubule end positions (~1.3 nm). The same calculation method was applied to determine the positional precision of other single molecules (~18 nm).<disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(5)</label><alternatives><mml:math id="m5"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math><tex-math id="t5">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle \sigma _{\mathrm{I}}^{2}=\sigma _{\mathrm{O}}^{2}+\sigma _{\mathrm{P}\mathrm{S}\mathrm{F}}^{2}$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Microtubule polymerization</title><p>GMPCPP, GDP, and GTPγS microtubules were polymerized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manka and Moores, 2018</xref>).

However, I had difficulty understanding some of the authors' responses. The logic was not always apparent, the writing was occasionally confusing or would benefit from more careful wording, and some of the provided responses were superficial or raised new concerns. In some cases, the underlying data needed to support their responses were not shown. Thus, the current version of the manuscript does not sufficiently resolve the following critical issues raised by myself and other reviewers.</p><p>(1) A clear new insight into a physiological process or cellular behavior remains lacking. The study largely confirms prior observations of MCAK binding to both the microtubule wall and end. However, it is still unclear whether direct binding to the tip-as opposed to accumulation via wall diffusion or interaction with other tip-binding proteins-is a significant mechanism.</p><p>(2) The newly revealed adenosine-nucleotide-dependent binding preferences do not help clarify MCAK's catalytic function or its mechanisms of tip recognition. Consequently, the final summary figure remains speculative and is not convincingly supported by the data. It is also unclear what exactly is meant by the &quot;working model&quot; (figure title), or by the claim of &quot;a simple rule of how the end-binding regulators coordinate their activities&quot; (abstract).</p><p>(3) As noted in my previous review, the effects of adding different adenosine nucleotides on MCAK binding to microtubules are much more pronounced than the differences in MCAK binding to tubulin with various guanosine-containing nucleotides, or to lattice versus tip (e.g., Fig. 5E). Therefore, the manuscript title-&quot;MCAK recognizes the nucleotide-dependent feature at growing microtubule ends&quot;-does not do justice to the scale of these effects.</p><p>(4) The title implies that MCAK selectively recognizes a feature determined by the tubulin-bound guanosine nucleotide. However, the authors frequently claim that MCAK binds to the &quot;entire GTP cap.&quot; It appears that they exclude structural protrusions from their definition of the cap, which is debatable. Even using their definition, the conclusion that MCAK recognizes a specific &quot;nucleotide-dependent feature&quot; seems inconsistent with the claim that it binds uniformly across the cap. These distinctions were not made clear.</p><p>(5) Some important technical details are still absent. For example, when reading the authors' response to another reviewer's question, I could not find an explanation of how the kon values for end and wall binding were calculated. These calculations clearly require assumptions, e.g. about the number of binding sites, but these details are not described. In addition, the binding data are expressed in units per tubulin dimer, which are non-standard and make comparisons to other published results difficult. There are other instances where more technical detail would be desirable, but they are too numerous to list here.</p><p>(6) Several aspects of data presentation as graphs will make it difficult for other researchers to analyze or interpret the findings. Numerical Excel-style data sheets should be provided for all measurements, including raw data-not just the ratios or derived values shown in plots. Other, more significant issues include use of mean values for non-Gaussian distributions (e.g., dwell times); binding affinities inferred from single-concentration measurements, often under varying conditions (e.g., Figs. 3C, 4); and absence of side-by-side plotted controls (e.g., Fig. 6).</p><p>(7) While the authors have added some quantitative values and descriptive detail, the manuscript still lacks a critical comparison of their findings with existing literature. This weakens the impact of the study and limits the reader's ability to place the results in a broader context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92958.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #4 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The revised manuscript from Chen et al. implements many of the changes requested by the 3 reviewers of the initial submission. These changes are well-described in the corresponding Response to Reviews document. Of course, not every request from the reviewers was addressed, and the following major concerns remain:</p><p>(1) The authors argue that MCAK binds to the same region as EB proteins, which they refer to as the &quot;EB cap&quot;. Reviewers asked for experiments that would increase the size of the EB cap to create &quot;comets&quot; (e.g. by increasing the microtubule growth rate); the prediction is that the MCAK signal should increase in size as well. The authors declined to pursue these experiments. As a result, the EB signals and MCAK signals are diffraction-limited spots, as opposed to the predicted exponential decay signals characteristic of EB comets. The various diffraction-limited spots are then aligned with the diffraction-limited signal of the microtubule end. These alignments and sub-pixel comparisons are technically challenging. The revised manuscript does not go far enough to provide compelling evidence that all technical challenges were overcome. Thus, while the authors can safely conclude that MCAK, EBs, and the microtubule end do occupy the same diffraction-limited spot, more precise conclusions are not supported.</p><p>(2) The reviewers criticized the initial manuscript for neglecting key references, particularly Kinoshita et al., Science 2001. Indeed, I cannot fathom writing a manuscript about MCAK and XMAP215 without putting a citation to such a landmark paper front and center. The authors have responded by including more discussion of the relevant literature (and citing Kinoshita et al.). However, the revised manuscript is often still cursory in giving credit where credit is due, contextualizing the new data, and generally engaging with the scholarship on MCAK.</p><p>(3) The data presented does not include a simple measurement of the impact of MCAK on the catastrophe frequency of microtubules. The authors explain this absence by pointing out that their movies are short (5 min) and high frame rate (10 fps). While I understand that such imaging parameters are necessary to capture single molecule end-binding events, I do not understand why a separate set of experiments could not be performed. This type of &quot;positive control&quot; is often missing, as pointed out by the 3 reviewers.</p><p>(4) Salt conditions, protein concentrations, and other key experimental parameters are not varied, even when varying them would provide excellent tests of the authors' hypotheses.</p><p>In summary, the revised manuscript is improved in many ways, but the interested reader should look carefully at the previous reviews and compare the measurements presented here with those of other labs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92958.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tsinghua University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Yin-Long</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tsinghua University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Jian-Feng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tsinghua University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tsinghua University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) Is the direct binding of MCAK to the microtubule cap important for its in vivo function?</p><p>a.The authors claim that their &quot;study provides mechanistic insights into understanding the end-binding mechanism of MCAK&quot;. I respectfully disagree. My concern is that the paper offers limited insights into the physiological significance of direct end-binding for MCAK activity, even in vitro. The authors estimate that in the absence of other proteins in vitro, ~95% of MCAK molecules arrive at the tip by direct binding in the presence of ~ physiological ATP concentration (1 mM). In cells, however, the major end-binding pathway may be mediated by EB, with the direct binding pathway contributing little to none. This is a reasonable concern because the apparent dissociation constant measured by the authors shows that MCAK binding to microtubules in the presence of ATP is very weak (69 uM). This concern should be addressed by (1) calculating relative contributions of direct and EB-dependent pathways based on the affinities measured in this and other published papers and estimated intracellular concentrations. Although there are many unknowns about these interactions in cells, a modeling-based analysis may be revealing. (2) the recapitulation of these pathways using purifying proteins in vitro is also feasible. Ideally, some direct evidence should be provided, e.g. based on MCAK function-separating mutants (GDP-Pi tubulin binding vs. catalytic activity at the curled protofilaments) that contribution from the direct binding of MCAK to microtubule cap in EB presence is significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments.</p><p>(1) We think that the end-binding affinity of MCAK makes a significant contribution for its cellular functions. To elucidate this concept, we now use a simple model shown in Supplementary Appendix-2 (see pages 49-51, lines 1246-1316). In this model, we simplified MCAK and EB1 binding to microtubule ends by considering only these two proteins while neglecting other factors (e.g. XMAP215). Specifically, we considered two scenarios: one in which both proteins freely diffuse in the cytoplasm and another where MCAK is localized to specific cellular structures, such as the centrosome or centromere. Based on the modeling results, we argue that MCAK's functional impact at microtubule ends derives both from its intrinsic end-binding capacity and its ability to strengthen the EB1-mediated end association pathway.</p><p>(2) We agree with the reviewer that MCAK exhibiting a lower end-binding affinity (69 µM) is indeed intriguing, as one might intuitively expect a stronger affinity, e.g. in the nanomolar range. Several factors may contribute to this observation. First, this could be partly due to the in vitro system employed, which may not perfectly replicate in vivo conditions, especially when considering cellular processes quantitatively. Variations in medium composition can significantly influence the binding state. For example, reducing salt concentration leads to a marked increase in MCAK’s binding affinity (Helenius et al., 2006; Maurer et al., 2011; McHugh et al., 2019). Additionally, while numerous binding events with short durations were detected, we excluded transient interactions from our analysis to facilitate quantification. This likely leads to an underestimation of the on-rate and, consequently, the binding affinity. Moreover, to minimize the interference of purification tags (His-tag), we ensured their complete removal during protein sample preparation. Previous studies reported that retaining the His-tag of MAPs affects the binding affinity to microtubules (Maurer et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009). Finally, a low affinity is not necessarily unexpected. Considering the microtubule end as a receptor with multiple binding sites for MCAK, the overall binding affinity is in the nanomolar range (260 nM). This does not necessarily contradict MCAK being a microtubule dynamics regulator as only a few MCAK molecules may suffice to induce microtubule catastrophe (as discussed on page 13, lines 408-441).</p><p>(3) Ideally, we would search for mutants that specifically interfere with the binding of GDP-Pi-tubulin or the curled protofilaments. However, the mutant we tested significantly impacts the overall affinity of MCAK to microtubules (both end and lattice), making it challenging to isolate and discuss the function of MCAK with respect to the binding to GDP-Pi-tubulin alone. Additionally, we also think that the GDP-Pi-tubulin in the EB cap and the tubulin in the curved protofilaments may share structural similarities. For instance, the tubulin dimers in both states may be less compact compared to those in the lattice, which could explain why MCAK recognizes both simultaneously (Manka and Moores, 2018). However, this remains a conjecture, as there is currently no direct evidence to support it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. As mentioned in the Discussion, preferential MCAK binding to tubulins near the MT tip may enhance MCAK targeting of terminal tubulins AFTER the MCAK has been &quot;delivered&quot; to the distal cap via the EB-dependent mechanism. This is a different targeting mechanism than the direct MCAK-binding. However, the measured binding affinity between MCAK and GMPCPP tubulins is so weak (69 uM), that this effect is also unlikely to have any impact because the binding events between MCAK and microtubule should be extremely rare. Without hard evidence, the arguments for this enhancement are very speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to the comment No. 1. Additionally, we have revised our discussion to discuss the end-binding affinity of MCAK as well as its physiological relevance (please see page 13, lines 408-441; and see Supplementary Appendix-2 in pages 49-51, lines 1246-1316).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors do not provide sufficient justification and explanation for their investigation of the effects of different nucleotides in MCAK binding affinity. A clear summary of the nucleotide-dependent function of MCAK (introduction with references to prior affinity measurements and corresponding MCAK affinities), the justifications for this investigation, and what has been learned from using different nucleotides (discussion) should be provided. My take on these results is that by far the strongest effect on microtubule wall and tip binding is achieved by adding any adenosine, whereas differences between different nucleotides are relatively minor. Was this expected? What can be learned from the apparent similarity between ATP and AMPPNP effects in some assays (Fig 1E, 4C, etc) but not others (Fig 1D,F, etc)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have revised the manuscript accordingly, and below are the main points of our response</p><p>(1) The experiment investigating the effects of different nucleotides on MCAK binding affinity was inspired by the previous studies demonstrating that kinesin-13 interactions with microtubules are highly dependent on their adenosine-bound states. For example, kinesin-13s tightly bind microtubules and prefer to form protofilament curls or rings with tubulin in the AMPPNP state, whereas kinesin-13s are considered to move along the microtubule lattice via one-dimensional diffusion in the ADP·Pi state (Asenjo et al., 2013; Benoit et al., 2018; Friel and Howard, 2011; Helenius et al., 2006). Based on these observations, we wondered whether MCAK's adenosine-bound states might similarly affect its binding preference for growing microtubule ends. We have made the motivation clear in the revised manuscript (please see page 7, lines 199-209).</p><p>(2) Our main finding regarding the effects of nucleotides is that MCAK shows differential end-binding affinity and preference based on its nucleotide state. First, MCAK shows the greatest preference for growing microtubule ends in the ATP state, supporting the idea that diffusive MCAK (MCAK·ATP) can directly bind to growing microtubule ends. Second, MCAK·ATP also demonstrates a binding preference for GTPγS microtubules and the ends of GMPCPP microtubules. The similar trends in binding preference suggest that the affinity for GDP·Pi-tubulin and GTP-tubulin likely underpins MCAK’s preference for growing microtubule ends. To clarify these points, we have added further discussions in the manuscript (please see page 8, lines 230-233; page9, lines 258-270 and pages 13-14, lines 443-458).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is not clear why the authors decided to use these specific mutant MCAK proteins to advance their arguments about the importance of direct tip binding. Both mutants are enzymatically inactive. Both show roughly similar tip interactions, with some (minor) differences. Without a clear understanding of what these mutants represent, the provided interpretations of the corresponding results are not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In the revised manuscript, we no longer draw conclusions about the importance of end-binding based on the mutant data. Instead, we think that the mutant data provide insights into the structural basis of the end-binding preference. Therefore, we have rewritten the results in this section to more accurately reflect these findings (please see page 10, lines 295-327).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) GMPCPP microtubules are used in the current study to represent normal dynamic microtubule ends, based on some published studies. However, there is no consensus in the field regarding the structure of growing vs. GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule ends, which additionally may be sensitive to specific experimental conditions (buffers, temperature, age of microtubules, etc). To strengthen the authors' argument, Taxol-stabilized microtubules should be used as a control to test if the effects are specific. Additionally, the authors should consider the possibility that stronger MCAK binding to the ends of different types of microtubules may reflect MCAK-dependent depolymerization events on a very small scale (several tubulin rows). These nano-scale changes to tubulins and the microtubule end may lead to the accumulation of small tubulin-MCAK aggregates, as is seen with other MAPs and slowly depolymerizing microtubules. These effects for MCAK may also depend on specific nucleotides, further complicating the interpretation. This possibility should be addressed because it provides a different interpretation than presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the two points raised here, our thoughts are as following</p><p>(1) The end of GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules differs from that of growing microtubules, with the most obvious known difference being the absence of the region enriched in GDP-Pi-tubulin. We consider the end of GMPCPP microtubules as an analogue of the distal tip of growing microtubules, based on two key features: (1) curled protofilaments and (2) GMPCPP-tubulin, a close analogue of GTP-tubulin. Notably, both features are present at the ends of both GMPCPP-stabilized and growing microtubules. Moreover, we agree with the suggestion to use taxol-stabilized microtubules as a control. This would eliminate the second feature (absence of GTP-tubulin), allowing us to isolate the effect of the first feature. Therefore, we conducted this experiment, and our data showed that MCAK exhibits only a mild binding preference for the ends of taxol-stabilized microtubules, which is much less pronounced than for the ends of GMPCPP microtubules. This observation supports the idea that GMPCPP-stabilized ends closely resemble the growing ends of microtubules.</p><p>(2) The reviewer suggested that stronger MCAK binding to the ends of different types of microtubules might reflect MCAK-dependent depolymerization events on a very small scale. This is an insightful possibility, which we had overlooked in the original manuscript. Fortunately, we performed the experiments at the single-molecule concentrations. Upon reviewing the raw data, we found that under ATP conditions, the binding events of MCAK were not cumulative (see Fig. X1 below) and showed no evidence of local accumulation of MCAK-tubulin aggregates.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The representative kymograph showing GFP-MCAK binding at the ends and lattice of GMPCPP microtubules in the presence of 1 mM ATP (10 nM GFP-MCAK), which corresponded to Figure 5A.</title><p>The arrow: the end-binding of MCAK.

The video recordings of microtubules under these conditions are already available to the authors, so it should not be difficult to provide these quantifications. They may reveal that microtubule ends are different (or not) under the examined conditions. It would also help to increase the overall credibility of this study by providing data that are easy to compare between different labs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have provided data on the growth rates, which are similar across the different nucleotide states (Fig. s1). However, due to the short duration of our recordings (usually 5 minutes, but with a high frame rate, 10 fps), we did not observe many catastrophe events, which prevented us from quantifying catastrophe frequency using the current dataset. Since we measured the binding kinetics of MCAK during the growing phase of microtubules, the similar growth rates and microtubule end morphologies suggest that the microtubule ends are comparable across the different conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>a.

In addition, we also measured the fluorescence intensity of both MCAK<sup>sN+M</sup> and MCAK. MCAK<sup>sN+M</sup> is a monomeric mutant that contains the neck domain and motor domain (Wang et al., 2012).

MCAK is a prominent microtubule depolymerase whose molecular mechanisms of action have been extensively studied by a number of labs over the last ~twenty years. Here, the authors use single-molecule approaches to investigate the precise localization of MCAK on growing microtubules and conclude that MCAK preferentially binds to a GDP-Pi-tubulin portion of the microtubule end. The conclusions are speculative and not well substantiated by the data, making the impact of the study in its current form rather limited. Specifically, greater effort should be made to define the region of MCAK binding on microtubule ends, as well as its structural characteristics. Given that MCAK has been previously shown to effectively tip-track growing microtubule ends through an established interaction with EB proteins, the physiological relevance of the present study is unclear. Finally, the manuscript does not cite or properly discuss a number of relevant literature references, the results of which should be directly compared and contrasted to those presented here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. As these suggestions are more thoroughly expressed in the following comments for authors, we will provide the responses in the corresponding sections, as shown below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Significant concerns:</p><p>(1) Establishing the precise localization of MCAK wrt microtubule end is highly non-trivial. More details should be provided, including substantial supplementary data. In particular, the authors claim ~6 nm accuracy in microtubule end positioning - this should be substantiated by data showing individual overlaid microtubule end intensity profiles as well as fits with standard deviations etc. Furthermore, to conclude that MCAK binds behind XMAP215, the authors should look at the localization of the two proteins simultaneously, on the same microtubule end. Notably, EB binding profiles are well known to exponentially decay along the microtubule lattice - this is not very apparent from the presented data. If MCAK's autonomous binding pattern matches that of EB, we should be seeing an exponentially-decaying localization for MCAK as well? However, averaged MCAK signals seem to only be fitted to Gaussian. Note that the EB binding region (i.e. position and size of the EB comet) can be substantially modulated by increasing the microtubule growth rate - this can be easily accomplished by increasing tubulin concentrations or the addition of XMAP215 (e.g. see Maurer et al. Cur Bio 2014). Thus to establish that MCAK on its own binds the same region as EB, experiments that directly modulate the size and the position of this region should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>(1) We thank the reviewer for this comment. Regarding the accuracy in microtubule end positioning, we now provide more details, and please see pages 18-19, lines 625-645 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>(2) Regarding the relative localization of XMAP215 and MCAK, we performed additional experiments to record their colocalizations simultaneously, on the same microtubule end. Our results showed that MCAK predominantly binds behind XMAP215, with 14.5% appearing within the XMAP215’s binding region. Please see Fig. 2.D-E and lines 184-197 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>(3) Regarding the exponential decay of the EB1 signal along microtubules, we observed that the position probability distribution measured in the present study follows a Gaussian distribution, and the expected exponential decay was not apparent. Since the exponential decay is thought to result from the time delay between tubulin polymerization and GTP hydrolysis, slower polymerization is expected to reduce this latency (Maurer et al., 2014). In our experiments, the growth rate was relatively low (~0.7 mm/min), much slower than the rate observed in cells, where the comet-shaped EB1 signal is most pronounced. The previous study has shown that the exponential decay of EB1 is more pronounced at growth rates exceeding 3 mm/min in vitro (Maurer et al., 2014). Therefore, we think that the relatively slow growth may account for the observed non-exponential decay distribution of the EB1 signals. The same reason may also explain the distribution of MCAK.</p><p>(4) We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that altering microtubule growth rate is a valid and effective approach to regulate the EB cap length. However, the conclusion that MCAK binds to the EB region is supported by three lines of evidence: (1) the localization of MCAK at the ends of microtubules, (2) new experimental data showing that MCAK binds to the proximal end of the XMAP215 site, and (3) the tendency of MCAK to bind GTPγS microtubules, similar to EB1. Based on these findings, we did not pursue additional experiments to modify the length of the EB cap.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Even if MCAK indeed binds behind XMAP215, there is no evidence that this region is defined by the GDP-Pi nucleotide state; it could still be curved protofilaments. GTPyS is an analogue of GTP - to what extent GTPyS microtubules exactly mimic the GDP-Pi-tubulin state remains controversial. Furthermore, nucleotide sensing for EB is thought to be achieved through its binding at the interface of four tubulin dimers. However MCAK's binding site is distinct, and it has been shown to recognize intradimer tubulin curvature. Thus it is not clear how MCAK would sense the nucleotide state. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that the morphology of the growing microtubule end can be highly variable, and that curved protofilaments may be protruding off the growing ends for tens of nanometers or more, previously observed both by EM as well as by fluorescence (e.g. Mcintosh, Moores, Chretien, Odde, Gardner, Akhmanova, Hancock, Zanic labs). Thus, to establish that MCAK indeed localizes along the closed lattice, EM approaches should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we conducted additional experiments that demonstrate MCAK indeed binds behind XMAP215, supporting the conclusion that MCAK interacts with the EB cap (please see Fig. 2 in the revised manuscript). Second, our argument that MCAK preferentially binds to GDP-Pi tubulin is based on two observations: (1) the binding regions of MCAK overlap with those of EB1, and (2) MCAK preferentially binds to GTPγS microtubules, which are considered a close analogue of GDP-Pi tubulin. Third, understanding the structural basis of how MCAK senses the nucleotide state of tubulin is beyond the scope of the present study. However, inspired by the reviewer’s suggestion, we looked into the structure of the MCAK-tubulin complex. The L2 loop of MCAK makes direct contact with the interdimer interface (Trofimova et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017), which could provide a structural basis for recognizing the changes induced by GTP hydrolysis. While this remains a hypothesis, it is certainly a promising direction for future research. Forth, we agree with the reviewer that an EM approach would be ideal for establishing that MCAK localizes along the closed lattice. However, this is not the focus of the current study. Instead, we argue that MCAK binds to the EB cap, where at least some lateral interactions are likely to have formed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The physiological relevance of the study is rather questionable: MCAK has been previously established to be able to both diffuse along the microtubule lattice (e.g. Helenius et al.) as well as hitchhike on EBs (Gouveia et al.). Given the established localization of EBs to growing microtubule ends in cells, and apparently higher affinity of MCAK for EB vs. the microtubule end itself (although direct comparisons with the literature have not been reported here), the relevance of MCAK's autonomous binding to dynamic microtubule ends is dubious.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising the importance of physiological relevance. Please refer to our response to the comment No.1 of reviewer 1. Briefly, we think that the end-binding affinity of MCAK makes a significant contribution for its cellular functions. To elucidate this concept, we now use a simple model shown in Supplementary Appendix-2 (see pages 49-51, lines 1246-1316). In this model, we simplified MCAK and EB1 binding to microtubule ends by considering only these two proteins while neglecting other factors (e.g. XMAP215). Specifically, we considered two scenarios: one in which both proteins freely diffuse in the cytoplasm and another where MCAK is localized to specific cellular structures, such as the centrosome or centromere. Based on the modeling results, we argue that MCAK's functional impact at microtubule ends derives both from its intrinsic end-binding capacity and its ability to strengthen the EB1-mediated end association pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Finally, the study seriously lacks discussion of and comparison with the existing literature on this topic. There are major omissions in citing relevant literature, such as e.g. landmark study by Kinoshita et al. Science 2001. Several findings reported here directly contradict previous findings in the literature. Direct comparison with e.g. Gouveia et al findings, Helenius et al. findings, and others need to be included. For example, Gouveia et al reported that EB is necessary for MCAK plus-end-tracking in vitro (please see Figure 1 of their manuscript). The authors should discuss how they reconcile the differences in their findings when compared to this earlier study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have updated the text description and included comparative discussions with other relevant studies in the Discussion section. Specifically, we added comparisons with the research on XMAP215 in page 14, lines 459-472 (Barr and Gergely, 2008; Kinoshita et al., 2001; Tournebize et al., 2000). Additionally, we have compared our findings with those of Gouveia et al. and Helenius et al. regarding MCAK's preference for binding microtubule ends in page 6, lines 145-157 and page 13, 408-441, respectively (Gouveia et al., 2010; Helenius et al., 2006).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional specific comments:</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>Gouveia et al. (Figure 1) reported that MCAK does not autonomously preferentially localize to growing tips. Specifically, Gouveia et al. found equal association rates of MCAK to both the lattice and the tip in the presence of EB3delT, an EB3 construct that does not directly interact with MCAK. How can these findings be reconciled with the results presented here?</p></disp-quote><p>We are uncertain why there was no observed difference in the on-rates to the lattice and the end in the study by Gouveia et al. Even when considering only the known affinity of MCAK for curved protofilaments at the distal tip of growing microtubules, we would still expect to observe an end-binding preference. After carefully comparing the experimental conditions, we nevertheless identified some differences. First, we used a 160 nm tip size to calculate the on-rate (k<sub>on</sub>), whereas Gouveia et al. used a 450 nm tip. Using a longer tip size would naturally lead to a smaller(k<sub>on</sub>) value. Note that we chose 160 nm for several reasons: (i) a previous cryo-electron tomography study has elucidated that the sheet structures of dynamic microtubule ends have an average length of around 180 nm (Guesdon et al., 2016); (ii) Analysis of fluorescence signals at dynamic microtubule ends has demonstrated that the taper length at the microtubule end is less than 180 nm (Maurer et al., 2014); (iii) in the present study, we estimated that the length of MCAK's end-binding region is approximately 160 nm. Second, in Gouveia et al., single-molecule binding events were recorded in the presence of 75 nM EB3ΔT, which could potentially create a crowded environment at the tip, reducing MCAK binding. Third, as mentioned in our response to Reviewer 1, we took great care to minimize the interference from purification tags (e.g., His-tag) by ensuring their complete removal during protein preparation. Previous studies reported that retaining the His-tag of MAPs led to a significant increase in binding for microtubules (Maurer et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009). We believe that some of the factors mentioned above, or their combined effects, may account for the differences in these two observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1C shows the decay of tubulin signal over several hundred nm - should show individual traces?

In Fig. 1, using normalized values allows for the simultaneous representation of microtubule and protein signals on a unified graph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do the results in 1D-G compare with the previous literature? Particularly comparison of on-rates between this study and the Gouveia et al? Assuming 1 um = 1625 dimers, it appears that in the presence of EB3, the on-rate of MCAK to the tips reported in Gouveia et al. is an order of magnitude higher than reported here in the absence of EB3 (4.3 x 10E-4 vs. 2 x 10E-5). If so, and given the robust presence of EB proteins at growing microtubule ends in cells, this would invalidate the potential physiological relevance of the current study. Note that the dwell times measured in Gouveia et al. are also longer than those measured here.</p></disp-quote><p>Note that in Gouveia et al, the concentration of mCherry-EB3 was 75 nM, about 187.5 times higher than that of MCAK (0.4 nM).

Cur Bio 2013, based on the methods of Demchouk et al. 2011). Such analysis should be performed here as well, if we are to conclude that nucleotide state alone, as opposed to the end morphology, specifies MCAK's tip localization.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree that it provides a valid optical microscopy-based approach for estimating microtubule end morphology. However, this method did not establish a direct correlation between microtubule end morphology and tubulin nucleotide status. Therefore, we think that refining the measurement of microtubule end morphology will not necessarily provide more information to the understanding of tubulin nucleotide status at MCAK binding sites. Based on the available data in the present study, there are two main pieces of evidence supporting the idea that MCAK can sense tubulin nucleotide status: (1) the binding regions of MCAK and EB overlap significantly, and (2) MCAK shows a clear preference for binding to GTPγS microtubules, similar to EB1 (we provide a new control to support this, Fig. s4). Of course, we do not consider this to be a perfect set of evidence. As the reviewer has pointed out here and in other suggestions, future work should aim to further distinguish the nucleotide status of tubulin in the dynamic versus non-dynamic regions at the ends of microtubules, and to investigate the structural basis by which MCAK recognizes tubulin nucleotide status.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EB comet profile should be clearly reproduced.

Under this condition, microtubule dynamics remained unchanged, and the morphology of the microtubule ends was comparable across different conditions (with EB1, MCAK or XMAP215). Additionally, in the revised manuscript, we present a new experiment in which we recorded the localization of both MCAK and XMAP215 on the same microtubule. The results support the conclusion regarding their relative localization: most MCAK is found at the proximal end of the XMAP215 binding region, while approximately 15% of MCAK is located within the XMAP215 binding region.

In our pilot experiments, we performed titration experiments to determine the appropriate concentrations of MCAK and XMAP215, respectively. We selected 50 nM for XMAP215, as it clearly enhances the growth rate and exhibits a mild promoting effect on catastrophe—two key effects of XMAP215 reported in previous studies (Brouhard et al., 2008; Farmer et al., 2021). Reducing the XMAP215 concentration eliminates the catastrophe-promoting effect, while increasing it would not much enhance the growth rate. For MCAK, we chose 20 nM, as it effectively promotes catastrophe; increasing the concentration beyond this point leads to no microtubule growth, at least in the MCAK-only condition. If there’s no microtubule growth, it would be difficult to quantify the parameters of microtubule dynamics, hindering a clear comparison of the combined versus individual effects. Therefore, we think that the concentrations used in this study are appropriate and representative. In the revised manuscript, we make this point clearer (see pages 11 and lines 329-342).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the writing could be improved for overall clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this.

The authors seem to have omitted the literature on MCAK in the past 10-15 years. The novelty is limited due to what has previously been done on the question. Previous work showed MCAK targets to microtubule plus-ends in cells through association with EB proteins and Kif18b (work from Wordeman, Medema, Walczak, Welburn, Akhmanova) but none of their work is cited.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Some of the referenced work has already been cited in our manuscript, such as studies on the interaction between MCAK and EB1. However, other relevant literature had not been properly cited. In the revised manuscript, we have added further discussion on this topic in the context of existing findings. Please refer to pages 3-4, lines 68-85, and pages 13, lines 425-441.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not obvious in the paper that these in vitro studies only reveal microtubule end targeting, rather than plus end targeting. MCAK diffuses on the lattice to both ends and its conformation and association with the lattice and ends has also been addressed by other groups-not cited here. I want to particularly highlight the work from Friel's lab where they identified a CDK phosphomimetic mutant close to helix4 which reduces the end preference of MCAK. This residue is very close to the one mutated in this study and is highly relevant because it is a site that is phosphorylated in vivo. This study and the mutant produced here suggest a charge-based recognition of the end of microtubules.</p><p>Here the authors analyze this MCAK recognition of the lattice and microtubule ends, with different nucleotide states of MCAK and in the presence of different nucleotide states for the microtubule lattice. The main conclusion is that MCAK affinity for microtubules varies in the presence of different nucleotides (ATP and analogs) which was partially known already. How different nucleotide states of the microtubule lattice influence MCAK binding is novel. This information will be interesting to researchers working on the mechanism of motors and microtubules. However, there are some issues with some experiments. In the paper, the authors say they measure MCAK residency of growing end microtubules, but in the kymographs, the microtubules don't appear dynamic - in addition, in Figure 1A, MCAK is at microtubule ends and does not cause depolymerization. I would have expected to see depolymerization of the microtubule after MCAK targeting. The MCAK mutants are not well characterized. Do they still have ATPase activity? Are they folded? Can the authors also highlight T537 and discuss this?</p><p>Finally, a few experiments are done with MCAK and XMAP215, after the authors say they have demonstrated the binding sites overlap. The data supporting this statement were not obvious and the conclusions that the effect of the two molecules are additive would argue against competing binding sites. Overall, while there are some interesting quantitative measurements of MCAK on microtubules - in particular in relation to the nucleotide state of the microtubule lattice - the insights into end-recognition are modest and do not address or discuss how it might happen in cells. Often the number of events is not recorded. Histograms with large SEM bars are presented, so it is hard to get a good idea of data distribution and robustness. Figures lack annotations. This compromises therefore their quantifications and conclusions. The discussion was hard to follow and needs streamlining, as well as putting their work in the context of what is known from other groups who produced work on this in the past few years.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. Regarding the physiological relevance of the end-binding of MCAK itself, please refer to our response to the point No.1 of reviewer 1. Moreover, as we feel that other suggestions are more thoroughly expressed in the following comments for authors, we will provide the responses in the corresponding sections, as shown below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Why, on dynamic microtubules, is MCAK at microtubule plus ends and does not cause a catastrophe?</p></disp-quote><p>At this concentration (10 nM MCAK with 16 mM tubulin in Fig. 1; 1 nM MCAK with 12 mM tubulin in Fig. 2), MCAK has little effect on microtubule dynamics in our experiments. Using TIRFM, we were able to observe individual MCAK binding events. Based on these observations, we think that in the current experimental condition, a single binding event of MCAK is insufficient to induce microtubule catastrophe; rather, it likely requires cumulative changes resulting from multiple binding events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the MCAK mutants still have ATPase activity?</p></disp-quote><p>The ATPase activities of MCAK<sup>K525A</sup> and MCAK<sup>V298S</sup> are both reduced to about 1/3 of the wild-type (Fig. s6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The intensities of GFP are not all the same on the microtubule lattice (eg 1A).

We measured the fluorescence intensity of each binding event. A probability distribution of these intensities was then constructed and fitted with a Gaussian function. A binding event was considered to correspond to a single molecule if its intensity fell within μ±2σ of the distribution. The details of the single-molecule screening process are provided in the revised manuscript (see page 17, lines 574-583).</p><p>In addition, we also measured the fluorescence intensity of both MCAK<sup>sN+M</sup> and MCAK. MCAK<sup>sN+M</sup> is a monomeric mutant that contains the neck domain and motor domain (Wang et al., 2012). The average intensity of MCAK<sup>sN+M</sup> is 196 A.U., about 65 % of that of MCAK (300 A.U.), suggesting that MCAK is a dimer (see Fig. s1). Moreover, we think that some of the dim signals may result from stochastic background noise, while others likely represent transient bindings of MCAK. The exposure time in our experiments was approximately 0.05 seconds; if the binding duration were shorter than this, the signal would be lower. It is important to note that in this study, we specifically selected binding events lasting at least 2 consecutive frames, meaning transient binding events were not included. This point has been clarified in the Methods section (see page 17, lines 568-569 and lines 574-583).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors provide a kymograph of an MT growing, in the presence of MCAK+AMPPNP?
