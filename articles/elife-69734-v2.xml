adults. The tumors are characterized by reciprocal chromosomal translocations that generate chimeric fusion oncogenes, the most common of which is EWSR1-FLI1. Survival is extremely poor for patients with metastatic or relapsed disease, and no molecularly targeted therapy for this disease currently exists. The absence of a reliable genetic animal model of Ewing sarcoma has impaired investigation of tumor cell/microenvironmental interactions in vivo. We have developed a new genetic model of Ewing sarcoma based on Cre-inducible expression of human <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> in wild-type zebrafish, which causes rapid onset of SRBCTs at high penetrance. The tumors express canonical EWSR1-FLI1 target genes and stain for known Ewing sarcoma markers including CD99. Growth of tumors is associated with activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, which we link to dysregulated extracellular matrix metabolism in general and heparan sulfate proteoglycan catabolism in particular. Targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycans with the specific heparan sulfate antagonist Surfen reduces ERK1/2 signaling and decreases tumorigenicity of Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo. These results highlight the important role of the extracellular matrix in Ewing sarcoma tumor growth and the potential of agents targeting proteoglycan metabolism as novel therapies for this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Ewing sarcoma</kwd><kwd>proteoglycans</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>Surfen</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54CA231649-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amatruda</surname><given-names>James F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>1 Million 4 Anna</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amatruda</surname><given-names>James F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A zebrafish genetic model of Ewing sarcoma, a pediatric bone cancer, showed how molecules in the normal tissue can support tumor cells, and identified a therapeutic compound that slows tumor growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive sarcoma of bone and soft tissue with a peak incidence in adolescents and young adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gaspar et al., 2015</xref>). Diagnosis relies on histologic and molecular analysis of biopsy specimens or surgically resected tumor tissue. Histologic examination of the tumor typically reveals sheets of small, round, blue cells with a prominent nucleus and scant cytoplasm. Approximately 20â25% of patients present with metastases at diagnosis that are often resistant to intensive therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gaspar et al., 2015</xref>). Standard multimodal therapy for patients with small round blue cell tumor (SRBCT) includes surgical resection and/or local radiotherapy as well as intensive multiagent chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GrÃ¼newald et al., 2018</xref>). Ewing sarcoma family tumors are characterized by the presence of reciprocal chromosomal translocations that fuse a member of the FET family of RNA-binding proteins (encoded by FUS, EWSR1, and TAF15), with different members of the ETS (E26-specific) family of transcription factors. The most common oncofusion found in 85% of cases is <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Delattre et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GrÃ¼newald et al., 2018</xref>). These chimeric fusion oncoproteins act as aberrant transcription factors deregulating hundreds of genes (e.g., genes involved in cell-cycle regulation, cell migration, and proliferation) by binding DNA enriched with GGAA motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gangwal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Guillon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). These and other studies, made on patient-derived tumor tissue and cell lines, have provided great insight into the molecular mechanisms of fusion protein function. However, in the absence of a representative in vivo model, other questions, including the cell of origin of Ewing sarcoma, mechanisms of tumor initiation, and the relationships between tumor and host cells, remain a subject of constant debate.</p><p>ERK1 and ERK2 are key effectors in the RasâRafâMEKâERK signal transduction cascade. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is required for the activation and subsequent phosphorylation of hundreds of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates including transcription factors regulating cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meloche and PouyssÃ©gur, 2007</xref>). ERK1/2 activity is required for transformation of NIH-3T3 cells by EWSR1-FLI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Silvany et al., 2000</xref>). In therapy-naive Ewing sarcoma samples, combined expression of pAKT, pmTOR, and pERK predicted worse progression-free and overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van de Luijtgaarden et al., 2013</xref>). ERK is a downstream target of insulin-like growth factor signaling, however the prognostic impact of IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptor expression in Ewing sarcoma is controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scotlandi et al., 2011</xref>). These findings raise the question of precisely which mechanisms drive ERK1/2 signaling in Ewing sarcoma, including the possible role of the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in determining tumor cell growth, survival, and response to treatment. The tumor microenvironment is composed of various cell types embedded in an altered extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM is a three-dimensional network of extracellular proteins, collagen, glycoproteins, and signaling molecules that provide structural and biochemical support to surrounding cells, as well as playing an essential role in signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Proteoglycans are key molecular effectors of the cell surface and pericellular microenvironment with essential roles in signal transduction and regulating cell adhesion, migration, and differentiation. Signaling between cells is modulated by proteoglycan activity at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Elfenbein and Simons, 2010</xref>). They have an ability to interact with both ligands and receptors that could directly affect cancer growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Edwards, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Iozzo and Sanderson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Multhaupt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mythreye and Blobe, 2009</xref>). Importantly, heparan sulfate proteoglycans play an essential role in differentiation and migration of both neural crest and mesenchymal cells â both of them are considered as potential cell of origin of Ewing sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Henderson and Copp, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Long and Huttner, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Papy-Garcia and Albanese, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yaylaci et al., 2016</xref>). To date, however, little is known about the role of proteoglycans and activation of ERK1/2 signaling in Ewing sarcoma development.</p><p>A genetic animal model of Ewing sarcoma family of tumors would thus be highly valuable as a complement to existing xenograft models in both mouse and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">El-Naggar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">GrÃ¼newald et al., 2018</xref>) for exploration of cooperating genetic factors for tumor development and for testing the role of the complex microenvironment in tumor progression. However, multiple attempts to create genetically engineered mouse models of Ewing sarcoma have not yielded a tractable model, likely due to the developmental toxicity of heterotopic expression of the oncofusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Minas et al., 2017</xref>). Previously, we demonstrated that transposon-mediated expression of human <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> drives SRBCT formation in zebrafish from 6 to 19 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leacock et al., 2012</xref>). While serving as proof of principle that <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> is tumorigenic in fish, the model had some limitations, including low penetrance, requirement for tp53 deficiency, and a low incidence of other tumor types such as leukemias.</p><p>Here, we describe a Cre-inducible invasive model of Ewing Sarcoma in zebrafish that reproducibly develops tumors in wild-type backgrounds. We characterize tumors and show that they recapitulate the main aspects of the human disease. Using this model, we show that tumor growth is associated with the activation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and that EWSR1-FLI1 upregulates expression of proteins involved in extracellular matrix reorganization and heparan sulfate proteoglycan catabolism. We demonstrate that surfen, a heparan sulfate antagonist, effectively reduces proteoglycan-mediated activation of ERK1/2 signaling in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and zebrafish models, leading to decreased proliferation of Ewing sarcoma tumor cells in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cre-inducible expression of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> drives SRBCT development in zebrafish</title><p>We reasoned that the low penetrance of tumors and requirement for loss of tp53 function in our original zebrafish Ewing sarcoma model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leacock et al., 2012</xref>) might be due to developmental toxicity of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic>, similar to what was described in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Minas et al., 2017</xref>). This is especially true since microinjection is performed into single-cell-stage embryos, allowing integration of transposons into cell populations early in development. We therefore tested several strategies, beginning with expression of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> under ubiquitous and tissue-specific promoters in wild-type zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All constructs incorporated eGFP (Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein) linked to <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> via a viral 2A linkage, to allow fluorescent labeling of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic>-expressing cells via an unfused eGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Provost et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leacock et al., 2012</xref>), constitutive expression of eGFP-2A-<italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> under the <italic>beta-actin</italic> promoter in wild-type fish caused high embryonic lethality and low incidence of tumor formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We obtained similar results with other ubiquitous promoters including <italic>cmv</italic> and ubiquitin (<italic>ubi</italic>).

Injection of <italic>RSG-EWSR1-FLI1</italic> transposon and <italic>Tol2</italic> transposase, along with mRNA encoding Cre, allows for a short delay in expression of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic>, as the <italic>Cre</italic> mRNA must be translated before recombination can occur.

To estimate the frequency of tumor development using this approach, injected fish were sorted for eGFP at 14 days post-fertilization (dpf) and a cohort of 77 fish was monitored up to 4 months. To control for promoter leakiness, we injected embryos with <italic>ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1</italic> in the presence of GFP RNA (142 fish). Uninjected embryos were used as an additional negative control (150 fish). We found that 34% of eGFP-positive fish developed tumors with onset during the first 3â4 weeks post-fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) exhibiting SRBCT histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). No tumors were observed in either control group. Among the fish developing tumors, 42% developed a single tumor, while 58% of fish had two or more tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic>-driven tumors arose most frequently in the dorsal regions of the fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

To test these possibilities, we performed treatment of Ewing sarcoma cell lines with the small molecule surfen (<italic>bis</italic>-2-methyl-4-amino-quinolyl-6-carbamide). Surfen is a sulfated heparan sulfate antagonist with a high affinity to all sulfated GAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schuksz et al., 2008</xref>). Surfen blocks sulfation and degradation of GAG chains in vitro and affects growth factor binding and proteoglycan-mediated signal transduction through certain cell surface growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schuksz et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>First, we tested whether surfen can block proteoglycan-mediated activation of ERK1/2 signaling in the TC32 and EWS502 Ewing sarcoma cell lines. To reduce the basal level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation we performed pretreatment of cells with serum-free media for 4 hr, and then replaced serum-free media with the full-media in the presence of 1% DMSO or 2.5, 5, or 10 Î¼M surfen. After 30 min of treatment, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting. Samples were normalized to the value of total ERK1/2. As expected, the introduction of serum led to the activation of ERK1/2 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6, B</xref>). Addition of 5 or 10 Î¼M surfen strongly significantly inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). Thus, blocking proteoglycan metabolism impairs ERK1/2 signaling in Ewing sarcoma cells.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Surfen treatment impairs ERK1/2 signaling and growth of Ewing sarcoma cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblot analysis of pERK1/2, ERK1/2, and tubulin levels in TC32 and EWS502 cells treated with surfen or DMSO.

To determine the experimental concentration of trametinib, we treated embryos at 24 hpf with 1, 10, or 20 Î¼M trametinib, as well as 0.2 Î¼M, 1 Î¼M surfen, or 0.25% DMSO for 96 hr. We found that survival rate of embryos treated with 1 and 10 Î¼M trametinib was not significantly different from survival rate of embryos treated with 0.2 Î¼M surfen or 0.05% DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we tested whether treatment of embryos with 1 Î¼M trametinib and 0.2 Î¼M surfen have effects on ERK phosphorylation. We treated WT embryos at 24 hpf with 1 Î¼M trametinib, 0.2 Î¼M surfen or 0.05% DMSO for 24 hr. Embryos were used for western blot analysis. We found that trametinib strongly decreased the total level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, surfen did not affect the total level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in normal fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), likely reflecting the fact that not all MAPK signaling is controlled by proteoglycans. To look specifically at cells expressing <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> we generated fish mosaically expressing <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic>, sorted embryos at 24 hpf based on eGFP expression, and treated them with 0.2 Î¼M surfen, 1 Î¼M trametinib, or 0.05% DMSO. After 24 hr of treatment we fixed embryos in 4% PFA and performed immunofluorescent staining for eGFP and pERK1/2. Consistent with our previous data, we found that cells expressing EWSR1-FLI1 are positive for pERK1/2, however treatment of embryos with 0.2 Î¼M surfen or 1 Î¼M trametinib abrogates ERK1/2 phosphorylation in EWSR1-FLI1-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To compare the effect of MEK inhibitor trametinib and surfen on outgrowth formation we generated fish mosaically expressing <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> and sorted them based on the presence of eGFP-positive outgrowths at 24 hpf. Prior the treatment we documented the eGFP fluorescence in all outgrowths. We treated fish with outgrowths with 0.2 Î¼M surfen, 1 Î¼M trametinib, or 0.05% DMSO and analyzed the size of the outgrowth 24 hr later. We found that treatment of outgrowths with 1 Î¼M trametinib or 0.2 Î¼M surfen has comparable effects on outgrowth formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the effect of surfen, we took advantage of the changes in fin morphology driven by the EWSR1-FLI oncofusion during the first 3 days of zebrafish development. We noticed that <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> expression is reproducibly associated with distortion of the normally straight appearance of the dorsal fin border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). To quantify this effect we calculated the coefficient of curvature (Ccurv), which measures the degree of deviation of the border from a straight line; more irregular fins are characterized by higher Ccurv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2B, C</xref>). We hypothesized that treatment of fish with drugs targeting <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic>-related pathways would result in the rescue of the fin phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Applying this metric, surfen did not affect the fin shape of control fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2D</xref>). <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> expression strongly increased the Ccurv, and surfen treatment of fish expressing <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> resulted in significant rescue of the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we aimed to investigate how surfen affects established tumors in our genetic model of Ewing sarcoma. We generated fish mosaically expressing <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> and sorted animals with <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic>-induced, eGFP-positive tumors 2 months later. We split tumor-bearing animals into two balanced groups for treatment with surfen (<italic>N</italic> = 4) or DMSO (<italic>N</italic> = 4) (see Methods for treatment scheme). Each group had tumors similar in size and location. Prior the treatment we documented the eGFP expression in all tumors. We found that surfen significantly reduced the tumor size by 30% during the first 15 days while tumors treated with DMSO showed increase in tumor size by 46% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7âfigure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Based on that we conclude that surfen is effective both preventing the outgrowth formation in embryonic model of Ewing sarcoma and tumor progression in older fish.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that surfen may affect Ewing sarcoma growth via modulation of ERK1/2 signaling. However, it is possible that the growth-suppressive effects of surfen are due to surfenâs effects on other signaling pathways affected by heparan sulfate proteoglycans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although Ewing sarcoma was first described over 100 years ago, there are few if any molecularly targeted therapies for patients with metastatic or relapsed disease. Fewer than 30% of patients presenting with metastases survive for 5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riggi et al., 2021</xref>). While great progress has been made using cells, xenografts and PDX models, the development of complementary Ewing sarcoma animal models remains crucial for the understanding of disease biology in the complex developmental microenvironment. The importance of tumor microenvironment and communication between cancerous and host cells has become evident as essential for tumor formation and invasion. A better understanding of such mechanisms will support the development of new approaches, targeting not just cancer cells, but the environment around them.</p><p>Previous attempts by multiple groups to generate a mouse model of Ewing sarcoma were complicated by the high embryonic toxicity of the driver oncofusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Minas et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this experience, we have tested a panel of ubiquitous and tissue-specific promoters to drive <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> expression in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We found that in most cases, expression of the oncogene causes cellular apoptosis, embryonic lethality, or developmental defects. Cre-inducible expression of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> under <italic>cmv</italic> and <italic>b-actin</italic> ubiquitous promoters did not result in a high incidence of tumor development. This result supports the importance of the level and timing of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> expression for efficient modelling of tumorigenesis. Despite the fact that cmv, b-actin, and ubi promoters drive ubiquitous gene expression they have slightly different efficiency, tissue tropism and timing of expression. However, we discovered that Cre-inducible expression of human <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> under the ubiquitin promoter was associated with less oncofusion toxicity in zebrafish larva. The pattern of Cre-induced <italic>eGFP-2A-EWSR1-FLI1</italic> expression was consistently different from Cre-induced eGFP expression driven by the same ubiquitin promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> can be tolerated by certain cell types while being toxic for others.</p><p>Human Ewing sarcoma can occur in any part of the body in bone or soft tissue. It most commonly involves the pelvis and proximal long bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riggi et al., 2021</xref>). In our model, based on mosaic integration of human <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> into the zebrafish genome, formation of tumors was observed in association with fish skeleton at the regions proximal to the base of pectoral, anal, and caudal fins, and at supraneurals. Fifty-eight percent of fish had more than one tumor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed the formation of ectopic fins driven by <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>) suggesting that <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> may potentially redirect the differentiation program of transformed cells. This model presents several advances over our previously reported zebrafish mosaic model of Ewing sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leacock et al., 2012</xref>). In that model, on a wild-type background only 0.6% of fish developed tumors during the 15 months, and tp53 deficiency was required for more penetrant tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leacock et al., 2012</xref>). We found that 40% of affected fish developed leukemia-like tumors rather than sarcomas. In our new Cre-inducible mosaic model, 34% of fish developed tumors and only 1 fish out of 77 developed a leukemia-like SRBCT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings highlight that the level and spatiotemporal distribution of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> expression plays an importaint role in efficient tumor generation.</p><p>To characterize tumors, we performed IHC staining for markers commonly used in diagnosis of human Ewing sarcoma. Staining of zebrafish tumors with antibodies against FLI1 showed that cells have different expression level of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), consistent with recent reports of cell-to-cell heterogeneity which affects proliferative and migratory potential of Ewing sarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Franzetti et al., 2017</xref>). While silencing of transgene expression in individual cells may occur, the fact that e<italic>GFP</italic> and <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> are expressed from a single mRNA transcript, and e<italic>GFP</italic> expression is widely retained throughout the tumor, makes this possibility less likely. Staining for CD99 and PAS are widely used for Ewing sarcoma diagnosis in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muhammad et al., 2012</xref>). CD99 is a cell surface transmembrane protein highly expressed in all Ewingâs sarcomas. Zebrafish tumor cells were positive for CD99 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, consistent with human data zebrafish tumors were positive for PAS which stains glycogen and polysaccharides enriched in Ewing sarcoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We showed that the expression of <italic>nr0b1</italic> in tumor tissue is strongly upregulated resembling the human phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kinsey et al., 2006</xref>). Altogether, zebrafish tumors are positive for known Ewing sarcoma markers recapitulating the main features of the human disease.</p><p>Previous studies established that 91% of human tumors had proliferating populations of cells positive for the proliferation marker, KI67. A high proliferation index was predictive of poor overall survival independent of tumor site, tumor volume, or metastasis at diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brownhill et al., 2014</xref>). We identified increased proliferation in <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic>-driven outgrowths in the earliest stages of tumor formation. In a wide variety of cancers, the ERK1/2 signaling pathway is known to control cell proliferation. Moreover, it was shown that ERK1 and ERK2 are constitutively activated in NIH-3T3 cells expressing <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> as well as in several human Ewingâs sarcoma tumor-derived cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Silvany et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with these data, we identified activated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic>-expressing outgrowths and tumors in the in vivo zebrafish model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In summary, tumorigenesis in fish is associated with activation of ERK1/2 signaling.</p><p>To study the mechanisms underlying the activation of ERK1/2 triggered by <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> we performed LCâMS/MS analysis. We discovered that that <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> affects expression of proteins involved in ECM reorganization and proteoglycan catabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, C and D</xref>). It is known that tumors leverage ECM remodeling to create a microenvironment that promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis. These tumor-driven changes support tumor growth, migration, and invasion. Our data show that expression of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> is associated with the strong production of collagens col1a1b, col1a2, col2a1a, col9a1b, col9a2, and col28a2a both in embryos and in advanced tumors (data not shown), suggesting the importance of specific matrix for tumor development. We found a strong upregulation of proteins involved in proteoglycan catabolism in human Ewing sarcoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Interestingly, the upregulation of heparanase, the enzyme involved in cleavage of the side chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, was reported in Ewing sarcoma tumors correlating with poor prognosis in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shafat et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, Ewing sarcoma oncogenesis is associated with dysregulation of proteoglycan turnover.</p><p>Proteoglycans are important components of extracellular matrix regulating Wnt, Hedgehog, TGF-Î², FGFR, and other signaling pathways. Proteoglycans stabilize ligandâreceptor interactions, creating potentiated ternary signaling complexes that regulate the signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and growth factor sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Elfenbein and Simons, 2010</xref>). For example, binding of FGF to its signaling receptor requires prior binding to the heparan sulfate side chains of the proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mythreye and Blobe, 2009</xref>). Thus, dysregulation of proteoglycan catabolism can result in aberrations in signal transduction from cell surface receptors.</p><p>To block the aberrantly activated proteoglycan-mediated pathways in Ewing sarcoma we targeted the binding of GAG chains with the ligands and signal molecules. Surfen (<italic>bis</italic>-2-methyl-4-amino-quinolyl-6-carbamide) binds to heparan sulfate and other GAGs blocking the sulfation and degradation of GAG chains in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schuksz et al., 2008</xref>). Surfen also affects responses dependent on heparan sulfate such as growth factor binding and activation of downstream signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schuksz et al., 2008</xref>). To target proteoglycan-mediated activation of ERK1/2 signaling we treated TC32 and EWS502 cells with surfen. Surfen impaired Ewing sarcoma cell proliferation at all doses tested, with the strongest effects at 5 and 10 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Concomitant with the effect on proliferation, ERK1/2 phosphorylation was downregulated at these doses of surfen, indicating that Ewing sarcoma cell lines are very sensitive to surfen-mediated blockage of cell surface receptor signaling.</p><p>To test whether surfen is effective in vivo in the zebrafish model we treated fish with outgrowths and established tumors via aqueous exposure to surfen or DMSO. Surfen demonstrated remarkable inhibition of outgrowth development and tumor progression in genetic zebrafish model of Ewing sarcoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). Thus, surfen is effective against human Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro and against tumor growth in the zebrafish model in vivo. Surfen was originally developed for use in humans to facilitate depot insulin deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Umber et al., 1938</xref>), and has been tested as an agent against glioblastoma tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Logun et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, targeting glycosaminoglycan metabolism may represent a new therapeutic opportunity for Ewing sarcoma. We quantified the effect of surfen in vivo using the fin coefficient of curvature Ccurv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). As a complement to studies using tumor cell outgrowths, this flexible and quantifiable assay has great potential for high-throughput screening to identify additional drugs targeting proteoglycan-mediated signaling in Ewing sarcoma.</p><p>Overall, here we present a new inducible zebrafish model of Ewing sarcoma. The advantage of the model is the opportunity to study tumorigenesis in vivo, in a complex developmental background. The system further allows study of tumor cell behavior using high-resolution imaging and is effective for high-throughput drug screening. Our findings suggest that the temporal expression of <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> is crucial for tumor development, supporting the existence of a specific cell or lineage of origin for Ewing sarcoma. Our new <italic>EWSR1-FLI1</italic> zebrafish model of Ewing sarcoma emphasizes the role of proteoglycans mediating ERK1/2 signaling and growth of tumor cells. Further investigation of the interactions between Ewing sarcoma and the tumor microenvironment in vivo can provide critical insights that may lead to new therapies of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry</title><p><italic>Danio rerio</italic> were maintained according to industry standards in an AALAAC-accredited facility.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Three experts with have reviewed this manuscript and have made a number of suggestions which should be addressed. It was felt that the study may be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, pending the following essential revisions:</p><p>1) The comparison of the zebrafish tumours to human disease, should be enhanced. For example, protein levels in human samples should be compared to protein levels in the fish model, particularly since mRNA levels may not correspond to proteins. Alternatively, RNA levels in the fish could be compared to RNA levels in human cases.</p><p>2) The studies related to Surfen should be improved. Figure 7 does not adequately demonstrate response of the fish tumour cells to Surfen and the experimental design does not consider transient versus sustained response. As a suggestion to improve these studies, the authors could identify tumours in 30-day old injectants, document GFP fluorescence with Image J or similar and soak the fish just below the MTD of surfen and document the response of individual tumours by loss of GFP fluorescence over time compared to a series of control injectants soaked in vehicle. These experiments should also consider other models (such as PDXs) as well as normal cells.</p><p>3) The role of Ras-MAPK-ERK should be explored to a greater extent. Experiments may include a pathway analysis in the zebrafish tumours, as well as the use of a MEK inhibitor to determine whether tumour formation is mitigated.</p><p>4) The value of the curved fin model (above measuring tumour formation directly) should be better defined.</p><p>5) Experimental detail regarding the zebrafish studies should be added throughout the manuscript. This includes details such as the number of animals used as well as whether single or pooled tumours were used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The current manuscript describes a model of Ewing sarcoma wherein the cre-inducible expression of human EWSR1-FLI1 in wild type zebrafish causes the rapid onset of small round blue cell tumors (SRBCTs). The tumors appear to resemble human tumors, expressing CD99 as well as elevated ERK1/2 signaling. Proteomics indicated that progression was associated with dysregulated extracellular matrix metabolism in general and heparan sulfate catabolism in particular. Accordingly, targeting heparan sulfate proteoglycans with Surfen reduced ERK1/2 signaling and tumour cell growth in vitro and in the zebrafish model. Overall, this study reveals a model that may be used to better understand the evolution of sarcoma. However, greater comparisons may be needed in order for this model to be used as a model of human disease.</p><p>This model represents an improvement upon previous zebrafish sarcoma models and the data suggest that the methods employed yield tumors that resemble human disease.</p><p>The comparison to human disease, and perhaps PDX models, should be enhanced. For example, CD99 staining should be improved and protein levels in human samples should be compared to the fish model, particularly since mRNA levels may not correspond to proteins.</p><p>The Surfen studies should be extended to examine the effects on normal cells as well as PDX models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors should comment why they think the ubi promoter is more successful at generating viable transgenic lines that the cmv or Î² actin promoters.</p><p>2. Timing of onset of tumor development is not clearly described in the text but can be ascertained from Figure 1C. The majority of tumors appear to develop at 30 days with smaller numbers appearing at later time points. Detailing this in the Results section would be helpful.</p><p>3. The authors compare mass spec data in zebrafish to human RNASeq data without providing any of the primary data. The identifications of the proteins/gene transcripts need to be properly mapped with accompanying p-values of significance.</p><p>4. It is unclear why the authors make the direct connection between the proliferative phenotype seen in their zebrafish model and the Ras-MAPK-ERK pathway. Was there evidence of upregulation of this pathway by the proteomic analysis conducted in Figure 2? Did this pathway come up as part of the GSEA? These primary data are not presented in the manuscript.</p><p>5. While evidence of pERK expression is subsequently shown by IHC in zebrafish tumors, whether this is a molecular driver is not evaluated. The authors should consider a therapeutic intervention trial with an ERK inhibitor.</p><p>6. Is pERK inhibited in vivo in the zebrafish, as was seen in vitro?</p><p>7. Straightening of the curvature of the zebrafish fins found to occur following expression of EWS-FLI1 is a surrogate marker of anti-tumor effect and should be described as such in the Discussion. While this may be a helpful preclinical readout, so too is evidence of inhibition of tumor outgrowths, which is more direct. The authors should highlight the advantage of employing the curvature phenotype over the reduced tumor outgrowth.</p><p>8. Are the surfen effects sustained or transient? This is a key factor for consideration of therapeutic benefit. If long term studies have not been conducted/planned, the authors should at minimum comment on this issue in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 1C: Did these fish develop other types of tumors? Or was SRBCT the only tumor type caused by ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1? More than half of the fish develop more than one tumor, suggesting that EWSR1-FLI1 is a very potent oncogene with a short latency that requires relatively few collaborating mutations.</p><p>2. Figure 1C: Was an attempt made to breed any of the tumor bearing fish? Presumably if the Cre acted in a developing germ cell, then the germ cell would constitutively express EWSR1-FLI. This might block embryologic development. In the event that EWSR1-FLI appeared to be embryologic lethal, did the authors attempt to inject the ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1 construct without Cre? Presumably they would develop stable lines that transmitted and expressed the red fluorescent ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1 construct. These fish could be bred and Cre RNA injected into the one cell fertilized eggs. This might yield stable lines with the ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1 construct integrated at uniform sites for study of tumor onset after Cre mRNA injection.</p><p>3. Figure 2E: Are the Western blots from one tumor each or a mixture of multiple tumors?</p><p>4. Figure 2F: The authors performed LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry analysis to obtain a set of 194 proteins commonly upregulated in zebrafish tumors compared to surrounding untransformed tissue, which were converted into 194 gene signatures for GSEA using a human Ewing sarcoma RNA-seq dataset. Why not perform RNA-seq analysis in zebrafish tumors for this GSEA analysis? Or examine protein expression by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry analysis in human Ewing sarcoma lines after shRNA or CRISPR-I knockdown of EWSR1-FLI. In other words, compare protein levels with protein levels or RNA levels with RNA levels by the GSEA approach?</p><p>Alternatively, the authors could compare their findings to published RNA-seq results in human Ewing sarcoma without implying that protein expression always recapitulates RNA expression.</p><p>5. Figure 2F: Were the zebrafish tumor cells sorted for GFP expression prior to LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry? How cleanly could the tumor tissue be dissected away from normal tissue? How many samples were used for each analysis? How many replicates?</p><p>6. Figure 2F: Did the authors also examine genes that are downregulated in the EWSR1-FLI1 expressing tumors compared to control tissue? The downregulation is particularly interesting as later in the manuscript, the authors stated that &quot;Downregulated proteins comprised 65% and 73% of differentially expressed proteins at 24hpf and 48hpf, respectively, suggesting that EWSR1-FLI1 was acting mostly as a transcriptional repressor rather than an activator (Figure 5B).&quot;</p><p>7. Figure 3A: The authors stated that &quot;The timeline demonstrates that GFP driven by the ubi promoter is expressed broadly, including throughout the muscle (Figure 3A, middle panel). However, zebrafish expressing eGFP-2A-EWSR1-FLI under the ubi promoter have a distinct distribution pattern of GFP-positive cells (Figure 3A upper panel), predominantly on the fish dorsum, tail and fins (Figure 3A upper panel).&quot; However, Figure 3B shows clearly that nearly 50% of embryos from injection with ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1 + Cre_RNA died by 24hpf. It's very likely that embryos with broader expression pattern died from the toxicity of the transgenes, hence resulted in the &quot;distinct distribution pattern of GFP-positive cells&quot; after the survival selection. I suggest showing the survival curves in Figure 3B before Figure 3A.</p><p>8. Figure 3D: How many samples were used for each data point? How many replicates? Was the RT-PCR performed from whole mount embryos? Or from isolated GFP-enriched tissues? Which stage?</p><p>9. Figure 3D: Why didn't the authors perform RNAseq instead of qRT-PCR. Then they would establish EWSR1-FLI levels as well as changes in the expression levels of the other zebrafish genes.</p><p>10. Figure 3E: At which developmental stage were the samples taken for the WB? Why is the endogenous FLI not detected in the control cells in first three lanes? Apparently this antibody binds to the zebrafish FLI, based on the western blot in Figure 2E. Why not strip this blot and reprobe with anti-GFP antibody. Or make two identical blots and probe one with anti-FLI and one with anti-GFP. This is how one normally documents the expression of a GFP fusion gene. How many samples were used for each analysis? How many replicates?</p><p>11. Figure 4A: What does this panel show? Basically some cells are in mitosis and express ph3 and some cells express EWSR1-FLI. This panel can be omitted.</p><p>12. Figure 4C: This panel shows phospho-ERK and pH3 expression in control and EWSR1-FLI outgrowths. And the outgrowths express GFP fused to the EWSR1-FLI protein. It is unclear how this panel can be said to show that &quot;activation of ERK signalling is an early event in EWSR1-FLI driven aberrations.&quot; Since ERK signalling is shown in the control, I don't see how this panel supports this conclusion. This panel can be omitted.</p><p>13. Figure 5: Compares LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry in EWSR1-FLI injected embryos with control injected embryos and shows the proteins that are upregulated and downregulated. This is the correct comparison and is very informative. Why not perform the LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry on human EWSR1-FLI expressing Ewing sarcoma cells compared to shRNA knockdown for the GSEA in Figure 2F, as was done in this figure and look at proteins that are up and down-regulated?</p><p>14. Figure 7A: What are the left panel photos? Transmited light? Autofluorescence? Are these the same fish shown at different time points? Or different fish? If the same fish, why did the GFP-EF1 decrease so much at 48 hours? What do the arrows show? Is there an extra arrow in the &quot;+Surfen, 24h&quot; left panel? The current data presentation in this figure is confusing and insufficient to support the authors' statement that &quot;surfen inhibited outgrowth development in the zebrafish embryo model of Ewing sarcoma.&quot; How about pERK and pH3? This figure and figure legend need to be clarified to make the point they are trying to make with this study.</p><p>15. Figure 7C: Here the authors invented a fin morphology analysis to evaluate the in vivo effect of surfen. However, this novel analysis is poorly characterized and poorly described. Why does surfen lead to smoother edges of the fins?? There is no evidence that the fin curvature is tightly associated with heparin sulfate inhibition, ERK1/2 signaling or Ewing sarcoma cell growth. Please explain.</p><p>16. There are two supplementary videos, which are not cited at all in the manuscript?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69734.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Three experts with have reviewed this manuscript and have made a number of suggestions which should be addressed.

Previously, we showed that observed small round blue cell tumors were positive for human Ewing sarcoma markers such as EWSR1-FLI1, CD99, PAS, NR0B1 (Figure 2A, B, C, D). To enhance the comparison of zebrafish tumors to human disease we aimed to evaluate the expression of nkx2.2a gene in zebrafish tumors. NKX2.2 is an immunohistochemical marker that has been reported to be sensitive and specific for Ewing sarcoma in human (McCuiston and Bishop, 2018). Because there are no available antibodies for zebrafish nkx2.2a we optimized the RNAscope approach to evaluate RNA expression of nkx2.2a. The advantage of the embryonic zebrafish model is the possibility to apply the whole mount in-situ hybridization to determine the gene expression in whole organism. We generated fish mosaically expressing EWSR1-FLI1 and sorted animals with EWSR1-FLI1- induced tumors at 24hpf. Embryos were fixed in 4% PFA and used for double RNAscope staining for nkx2.2a (529751-C2 RNAscope Probe â Dr-nkx2.2a-C2) and eGFP (538851 RNAscope Probe â EGFP-O4). Normally nkx2.2a is expressed in the spinal cord (Figure 3F, control). We found that consistent with human data the EWSR1-FLI1- expressing cells in tumors were also positive for nkx2.2a (Figure 3F, EWSR1-FLI).</p><p>To improve staining for the second Ewing sarcoma marker, CD99 we applied IHC technique on advanced zebrafish tumors presented in distinct locations (Figure 2-figure supplement 1C). Our data showed all tumors located in trunk (Figure 2-figure supplement 1C, tumor 1),, caudal fin (Figure 2-figure supplement 1C, tumor 2) and head (Figure 2-figure supplement 1C, tumor 3) express CD99.</p><p>To better characterize zebrafish tumors, we performed the proteomics analysis of zebrafish tumors located on dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins (Figure 2F). We agree with the reviewer, that mRNA levels not always correspond to protein levels. However, it was shown that differentially expressed mRNAs correlate significantly with their protein products (Koussounadis et al., 2015). Based on that research, we identified a list of differentially expressed proteins in all three tumors and compared them to human tumor microarray data (Figure 2F). Our data show significant enrichment of zebrafish differentially expressed proteins in human Ewing sarcoma microarray dataset (NES: 1.501, FWER:0.029), but not in the rhabdomyosarcoma dataset (-1.476, FWER:0.024). To further address the reviewerâs point of comparing protein to protein levels we used a publicly available list of proteins significantly upregulated in human mesenchymal cells after the expression of EWSR1-FLI1 oncofusion considering that expression of the oncofusion in normal human cells mimics best the transformation process (Tanabe et al., 2018) (Table_oncotarget-09-14428-s009). We used that list of significantly upregulated proteins to run the GSEA to evaluate the enrichment of those hits in our zebrafish tumor dataset (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B). We found that the list of proteins was significantly upregulated in zebrafish tumors (NES: 1.540, FWER p-Value: 0.048) confirming similarity between zebrafish and human disease (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B).</p><p>Taken together, we showed that zebrafish tumors are positive for routinely used human Ewing sarcoma markers such as EWSR1-FLI1, nkx2.2a, CD99, PAS (Figure 2, Figure 2-figure supplement 1). We characterized tumors (Figure 1C, Figure 1-figure supplement 3, Supplemental File 1) and showed that they recapitulate key aspects of human disease (Figure 2, Figure 2-figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The studies related to Surfen should be improved. Figure 7 does not adequately demonstrate response of the fish tumour cells to Surfen and the experimental design does not consider transient versus sustained response. As a suggestion to improve these studies, the authors could identify tumours in 30-day old injectants, document GFP fluorescence with Image J or similar and soak the fish just below the MTD of surfen and document the response of individual tumours by loss of GFP fluorescence over time compared to a series of control injectants soaked in vehicle. These experiments should also consider other models (such as PDXs) as well as normal cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have performed the proposed experiment(updated Figure 7B, Figure 7-figure supplement 3 A, B). We generated fish mosaically expressing EWSR1-FLI1 and sorted animals with EWSR1-FLI1- induced tumors 2 months later. We selected animals with eGFP-positive tumors and split them into two balanced groups for treatment with surfen and DMSO. Each group had tumors similar in size and location (Figure 7-figure supplement 3 A, B). Prior the treatment we documented the eGFP fluorescence in all tumors. The scheme of treatment of zebrafish tumors included 6 days with 0.2uM surfen, 3 days with 0.8uM surfen, 3 days drug holiday with no treatment, and 3 days of with 0.8uM surfen. The control group was treated with DMSO. The total duration of the experiment was 15 days. We found that surfen significantly reduced the tumor size by 30% during the first 15 days of experiment while tumors treated with DMSO showed increase in tumor size by 46% (updated Figure 7B, Figure 7-figure supplement 3 A, B). Based on this result we conclude that surfen is effective both preventing the outgrowth formation in the embryonic model of Ewing sarcoma and tumor progression in older fish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The role of Ras-MAPK-ERK should be explored to a greater extent. Experiments may include a pathway analysis in the zebrafish tumours, as well as the use of a MEK inhibitor to determine whether tumour formation is mitigated.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we performed ERK1/ERK2 pathway analysis in zebrafish tumors. We used gene set enrichment analysis to determine the enrichment of genes associated with ERK1/2 pathway (GOBP_ERK1_AND_ERK2_CASCADE) in zebrafish tumors. We found that the gene set was significantly enriched in zebrafish tumor proteomic dataset (NES: 1.3867193, FWER p-Value: 0.03) (Updated Figure 4D). The data were also confirmed by IHC staining and western blot analysis for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Figure 4E, F).</p><p>To enhance the experiment, we determined whether surfen and MEK inhibitor trametinib have a comparable effect on outgrowth formation (Figure 7-figure supplement 1). To determine the experimental concentration of trametinib, we treated embryos at 24hpf with 1uM,10uM, 20uM of trametinib, as well as 0.2uM, 1uM surfen or DMSO for 96 hours. We found that survival rate of embryos treated with 1 and 10 Î¼m of trametinib was not significantly different from survival rate of embryos treated with 0.2 Î¼m surfen or DMSO (Figure 7-figure supplement 1A). Next, we looked whether treatment of embryos with 1uM trametinib has effect on ERK phosphorylation. We treated WT embryos at 24hpf with 1uM trametinib, 0.2 Î¼m surfen or DMSO for 24hours. Embryos were used for WB analysis. We found that trametinib strongly decreased the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 7-figure supplement 1B). In contrast, surfen did not affect the total level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in normal fish (Figure 7-figure supplement 1B). To look specifically at cells expressing EWSR1-FLI1 we generated fish mosaically expressing EWSR1-FLI1, sorted embryos at 24hpf based on eGFP expression, and treated them with 0.2uM surfen, 1uM trametinib or DMSO. After 24h of treatment we fixed embryos in 4%PFA and performed immunofluorescent staining for eGFP and pERK1/2. Consistent with our previous data, we found that cells expressing EWSR1-FLI1 were positive for pERK1/2 (Figure 7-figure supplement 1C, DMSO), however treatment of embryos with both 0.2uM surfen or 1uM trametinib decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in EWSR1-FLI positive cells (Figure 7-figure supplement 1C).</p><p>Finally, to compare the effect of MEK inhibitor trametinib to surfen on outgrowth formation we generated fish mosaically expressing EWSR1-FLI1 and sorted them based on the presence of eGFP positive outgrowth at 24hpf. Prior the treatment we documented the eGFP fluorescence in all outgrowths. We treated fish with outgrowth with 0.2uM surfen, 1uM trametinib or DMSO for 24h and analyzed the size of outgrowth (Figure 7-figure supplement 1D). We found that treatment of fish with both 1uM trametinib and 0.2 uM surfen resulted in significant decrease in outgrowth size. (Figure 7-figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The value of the curved fin model (above measuring tumour formation directly) should be better defined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text to further explain the utility of the assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Experimental detail regarding the zebrafish studies should be added throughout the manuscript.

Timing of onset of tumor development is not clearly described in the text but can be ascertained from Figure 1C. The majority of tumors appear to develop at 30 days with smaller numbers appearing at later time points.

The authors compare mass spec data in zebrafish to human RNASeq data without providing any of the primary data.

It is unclear why the authors make the direct connection between the proliferative phenotype seen in their zebrafish model and the Ras-MAPK-ERK pathway. Was there evidence of upregulation of this pathway by the proteomic analysis conducted in Figure 2? Did this pathway come up as part of the GSEA? These primary data are not presented in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we performed ERK1/ERK2 pathway analysis in zebrafish tumors. We used gene set enrichment analysis to determine the enrichment of genes associated with ERK1/2 pathway (GOBP_ERK1_AND_ERK2_CASCADE) in zebrafish tumors. We found that the gene set was significantly enriched in zebrafish tumor proteomic dataset (NES: 1.3867193, FWER p-Value: 0.03) (Updated Figure 4D). The data were also confirmed by IHC staining and western blot analysis for phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Figure 4E, F).</p><p>To enhance the experiment, we determined whether surfen and MEK inhibitor trametinib have comparable effect on outgrowth formation (Figure 7-figure supplement 1). To determine the experimental concentration of trametinib, we treated embryos at 24hpf with 1uM,10uM, 20uM of trametinib, as well as 0.2uM, 1uM surfen or DMSO for 96 hours. We found that survival rate of embryos treated with 1 and 10 Î¼m of trametinib was not significantly different from survival rate of embryos treated with 0.2 Î¼m surfen or DMSO (Figure 7-figure supplement 1A). Next, we looked whether treatment of embryos with 1uM trametinib has effect on ERK phosphorylation. We treated WT embryos at 24hpf with 1uM trametinib, 0.2 Î¼m surfen or DMSO for 24hours. Embryos were used for WB analysis. We found that trametinib strongly decreased the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Figure 7-figure supplement 1B). In contrast, surfen did not affect the total level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in normal fish (Figure 7-figure supplement 1B). To look specifically at cells expressing EWSR1-FLI1 we generated fish mosaically expressing EWSR1-FLI1, sorted embryos at 24hpf based on eGFP expression, and treated them with 0.2uM surfen, 1uM trametinib or DMSO. After 24h of treatment we fixed embryos in 4%PFA and performed immunofluorescent staining for eGFP and pERK1/2. Consistent with our previous data, we found that cells expressing EWSR1-FLI1 were positive for pERK1/2 (Figure 7-figure supplement 1C, DMSO), however treatment of embryos with both 0.2uM surfen or 1uM trametinib decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in EWSR1-FLI positive cells (Figure 7-figure supplement 1C).</p><p>Finally, to compare the effect of MEK inhibitor trametinib to surfen on outgrowth formation we generated fish mosaically expressing EWSR1-FLI1 and sorted them based on the presence of eGFP positive outgrowth at 24hpf. Prior the treatment we documented the eGFP fluorescence in all outgrowths. We treated fish with outgrowth with 0.2uM surfen, 1uM trametinib or DMSO for 24h and analyzed the size of outgrowth (Figure 7-figure supplement 1D). We found that treatment of fish with both 1uM trametinib and 0.2uM surfen resulted in significant decrease in outgrowth size. (Figure 7-figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. While evidence of pERK expression is subsequently shown by IHC in zebrafish tumors, whether this is a molecular driver is not evaluated. The authors should consider a therapeutic intervention trial with an ERK inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>Required data can be found in Figure 7-figure supplement 1. (see section âSurfen inhibits EWSR1-FLI1 mediated growth in zebrafish modelâ.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Is pERK inhibited in vivo in the zebrafish, as was seen in vitro?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, that experiment is addressed in (Figure 7-figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Straightening of the curvature of the zebrafish fins found to occur following expression of EWS-FLI1 is a surrogate marker of anti-tumor effect and should be described as such in the Discussion. While this may be a helpful preclinical readout, so too is evidence of inhibition of tumor outgrowths, which is more direct. The authors should highlight the advantage of employing the curvature phenotype over the reduced tumor outgrowth.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Are the surfen effects sustained or transient? This is a key factor for consideration of therapeutic benefit. If long term studies have not been conducted/planned, the authors should at minimum comment on this issue in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the proposed experiment (updated Figure 7B, Figure 7-figure supplement 3 A, B). We generated fish mosaically expressing EWSR1-FLI1 and sorted animals with EWSR1-FLI1- induced tumors 2 months later. We selected animals with eGFP positive tumors and split them into two balanced groups for treatment with surfen and DMSO. Each group had tumors similar in size and location (Figure 7-figure supplement 3 A, B). Prior the treatment we documented the eGFP fluorescence in all tumors. The scheme of treatment of zebrafish tumors included 6 days with 0.2uM surfen, 3 days with 0.8uM surfen, 3 days drug holiday with no treatment, and 3 days of with 0.8uM surfen. The control group was treated with DMSO. The total duration of the experiment was 15 days. We found that surfen significantly reduced the tumor size by 30% during the first 15 days of experiment while tumors treated with DMSO showed increase in tumor size by 46% (updated Figure 7B, Figure 7-figure supplement 3 A, B). Based on this result we conclude that surfen is effective both preventing the outgrowth formation in the embryonic model of Ewing sarcoma and tumor progression in older fish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Figure 1C: Did these fish develop other types of tumors? Or was SRBCT the only tumor type caused by ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1? More than half of the fish develop more than one tumor, suggesting that EWSR1-FLI1 is a very potent oncogene with a short latency that requires relatively few collaborating mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with that comment. In our new Cre-inducible mosaic model of Ewing sarcoma 34% of fish developed SRBCT tumors. Only 1 fish out of 77 developed a leukemia-like SRBCT (see. Section âCre-inducible expression of EWSR1-FLI1 drives SRBCT development in zebrafishâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1C: Was an attempt made to breed any of the tumor bearing fish? Presumably if the Cre acted in a developing germ cell, then the germ cell would constitutively express EWSR1-FLI. This might block embryologic development. In the event that EWSR1-FLI appeared to be embryologic lethal, did the authors attempt to inject the ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1 construct without Cre? Presumably they would develop stable lines that transmitted and expressed the red fluorescent ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1 construct. These fish could be bred and Cre RNA injected into the one cell fertilized eggs. This might yield stable lines with the ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1 construct integrated at uniform sites for study of tumor onset after Cre mRNA injection.</p></disp-quote><p>We have created a stable line expressing Ubi:RSG-EF1 and used it for tissue-specific expression of the oncofusion.

Figure 2F: The authors performed LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry analysis to obtain a set of 194 proteins commonly upregulated in zebrafish tumors compared to surrounding untransformed tissue, which were converted into 194 gene signatures for GSEA using a human Ewing sarcoma RNA-seq dataset. Why not perform RNA-seq analysis in zebrafish tumors for this GSEA analysis? Or examine protein expression by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry analysis in human Ewing sarcoma lines after shRNA or CRISPR-I knockdown of EWSR1-FLI. In other words, compare protein levels with protein levels or RNA levels with RNA levels by the GSEA approach?</p></disp-quote><p>To address that comment we used publicly available list of proteins significantly upregulated in human mesenchymal cells after the expression of EWSR1-FLI1 oncofusion considering that expression of the oncofusion in normal human cells mimics best the transformation process (Tanabe at al 2018, oncotarget-09-14428-s009). We used that list of differentially upregulated proteins to run the GSEA to evaluate the enrichment of those hits in our zebrafish tumors dataset (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B). We found that the list of proteins was significantly upregulated in zebrafish tumors (NES: 1.54, FWER p-Value: 0.048) confirming similarity between zebrafish and human disease (Figure 2-figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, the authors could compare their findings to published RNA-seq results in human Ewing sarcoma without implying that protein expression always recapitulates RNA expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with that comment. It was shown that differentially expressed mRNAs correlate significantly with their protein products (Antonis Koussounadis 2015). Based on that research, we identified a list of differentially expressed proteins in all three tumors and compared them to human tumor microarray data (Figure 2F). Our data show significant enrichment of zebrafish differentially expressed proteins in human Ewing sarcoma microarray dataset (NES 1.501, FWER:0.029), but not rhabdomyosarcoma dataset (NES:-1.476, FWER:0.024).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 2F: Were the zebrafish tumor cells sorted for GFP expression prior to LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry? How cleanly could the tumor tissue be dissected away from normal tissue? How many samples were used for each analysis? How many replicates?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not sort the tumor cells based on GFP expression assuming that could affect stability of proteins involved in ECM. We expected to have minor contamination with normal cells. We performed the analysis of 3 different tumors and 3 normal tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 2F: Did the authors also examine genes that are downregulated in the EWSR1-FLI1 expressing tumors compared to control tissue? The downregulation is particularly interesting as later in the manuscript, the authors stated that &quot;Downregulated proteins comprised 65% and 73% of differentially expressed proteins at 24hpf and 48hpf, respectively, suggesting that EWSR1-FLI1 was acting mostly as a transcriptional repressor rather than an activator (Figure 5B).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that repressed genes are particularly interesting in that research. We found that downregulated proteins were involved in several types of metabolism. We are going to focus on that finding in future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 3A: The authors stated that &quot;The timeline demonstrates that GFP driven by the ubi promoter is expressed broadly, including throughout the muscle (Figure 3A, middle panel). However, zebrafish expressing eGFP-2A-EWSR1-FLI under the ubi promoter have a distinct distribution pattern of GFP-positive cells (Figure 3A upper panel), predominantly on the fish dorsum, tail and fins (Figure 3A upper panel).&quot; However, Figure 3B shows clearly that nearly 50% of embryos from injection with ubi:RSG-EWSR1-FLI1 + Cre_RNA died by 24hpf. It's very likely that embryos with broader expression pattern died from the toxicity of the transgenes, hence resulted in the &quot;distinct distribution pattern of GFP-positive cells&quot; after the survival selection. I suggest showing the survival curves in Figure 3B before Figure 3A.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the order of figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Figure 3E: At which developmental stage were the samples taken for the WB? Why is the endogenous FLI not detected in the control cells in first three lanes? Apparently this antibody binds to the zebrafish FLI, based on the western blot in Figure 2E. Why not strip this blot and reprobe with anti-GFP antibody. Or make two identical blots and probe one with anti-FLI and one with anti-GFP. This is how one normally documents the expression of a GFP fusion gene. How many samples were used for each analysis? How many replicates?</p></disp-quote><p>Embryos for western blot were taken at 24hpf. Each sample had 10 embryos. We agree that antibody could recognize the endogenous FLI1 which has different size and could be easily distinguished from EWSR1-FLI1 as a separate band on the gel. We also confirmed that result by Q-PCR using the set of primers recognizing specifically human EWSR1-FLI1. We did not perform western-blot for eGFP because eGFP-2A-EF1 does not represent a fusion protein, but two separate proteins. The western blot analysis was performed at least 3 times for each experiment in 3 replicates (see methods for details).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

Figure 4C: This panel shows phospho-ERK and pH3 expression in control and EWSR1-FLI outgrowths. And the outgrowths express GFP fused to the EWSR1-FLI protein.

This panel can be omitted.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not agree with the reviewerâs comment. It is an important finding to show that EWSR1-FLI1 expression is associated with activation of ERK1/2 signaling in both embryonic model and advanced zebrafish tumors. ERK1/2 is an important regulator of cell proliferation driving signaling from cell surface receptors. The figure demonstrates that ERK is activated in tumor outgrowths specifically associated with expression of EWSR1-FLI1. There is of course some natural ERK signaling in other parts of the embryo, including the control, for example in what are likely blood cells in the trunk. However, we do not observe ERK activation in the fin in control embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Figure 5: Compares LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry in EWSR1-FLI injected embryos with control injected embryos and shows the proteins that are upregulated and downregulated. This is the correct comparison and is very informative. Why not perform the LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry on human EWSR1-FLI expressing Ewing sarcoma cells compared to shRNA knockdown for the GSEA in Figure 2F, as was done in this figure and look at proteins that are up and down-regulated?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that could be an interesting experiment to perform to identify direct EWSR1-FLI effectors in mature tumors.

The current data presentation in this figure is confusing and insufficient to support the authors' statement that &quot;surfen inhibited outgrowth development in the zebrafish embryo model of Ewing sarcoma.&quot; How about pERK and pH3?
