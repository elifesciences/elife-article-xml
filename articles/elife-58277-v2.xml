During the infection, Legionella injects more than 300 effector proteins into host cells. Among them are enzymes involved in altering the host-ubiquitination system. Here, we identified two <bold><underline>L</underline></bold>egionella<bold><underline>OT</underline></bold>U (ovarian tumor)-like deubiquitinases (LOT-DUBs; LotB [Lpg1621/Ceg23] and LotC [Lpg2529]). The crystal structure of the LotC catalytic core (LotC<sub>14-310</sub>) was determined at 2.4 Å. Unlike the classical OTU-family, the LOT-family shows an extended helical lobe between the Cys-loop and the variable loop, which defines them as a unique class of OTU-DUBs. LotB has an additional ubiquitin-binding site (S1’), which enables the specific cleavage of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. By contrast, LotC only contains the S1 site and cleaves different species of ubiquitin chains. MS analysis of LotB and LotC identified different categories of host-interacting proteins and substrates. Together, our results provide new structural insights into bacterial OTU-DUBs and indicate distinct roles in host–pathogen interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group

modification, regulates various cellular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yau and Rape, 2016</xref>). A representative example of the ubiquitin-mediated cellular process is the ubiquitin-proteasome system, where misfolded proteins get ubiquitinated, degraded by the proteasome, and, finally, recycled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dikic, 2017</xref>). For larger cellular waste, such as cellular components (endoplasmic reticulum [ER], mitochondria, etc.), protein aggregates, or intracellular bacteria, ubiquitination works together with the autophagy machinery, which includes the sequestration of ubiquitinated components and their transfer into the lysosome for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pohl and Dikic, 2019</xref>). To maintain homeostasis in the cell, ubiquitination events are tightly regulated by a reverse process called deubiquitination, where ubiquitin molecules are specifically cleaved from the target substrates and subsequently recycled by deubiquitinating enzymes (deubiquitinases [DUBs]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clague et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To date, about 100 different DUBs have been identified in human. They are categorized into seven different classes based on their structure and mechanism of action, and these include USP, JAMM (MPN), OTU, MJD (Josepin), UCH, and the recently discovered MINDY and ZUFSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul Rehman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clague et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haahr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hermanns et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hewings et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kwasna et al., 2018</xref>). Six of them belong to the cysteine protease family (USP, OTU, MJD [Josepin], UCH, MINDY, and ZUFSP), while JAMM (MPN) belongs to the zinc-containing metalloproteases. Among them, the OTU-family is distinguished from other DUBs, as they exhibit linkage specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mevissen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mevissen and Komander, 2017</xref>). For example, Cezanne specifically cleaves Lys11-linked polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bremm et al., 2010</xref>) and OTUB1 preferentially cleaves Lys48-linked chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Edelmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), while OTULIN exclusively cleaves M1-linked (linear) chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Keusekotten et al., 2013</xref>). Extensive biochemical and structural studies have provided general mechanisms of the diverse linkage specificity within the structurally similar OTU-family. In general, the selectivity is achieved by the specific orientation of the S1 site, which accepts proximal ubiquitin and the S1’ site that binds primed ubiquitin of ubiquitin chains. Besides, the presence or the absence of additional ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs), sequence variations on ubiquitinated substrates, or S2-binding site that binds to the third ubiquitin within the chains can also affect the specificity of OTU-family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Considering the importance of ubiquitin-mediated cellular pathways, it is not surprising that pathogens are armed with various weapons to hijack the host-ubiquitination system. For instance, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> encodes HECT type E3 ligase SopA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fiskin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> contains LubX and LegU1, which are similar to U-box- and F-box-containing E3 ligases, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ensminger and Isberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kubori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quaile et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, bacterial pathogens possess atypical ubiquitin ligases that do not belong to any of the known E3 ligases, such as IpaH family (Shigella) or SidC/SdCA (Legionella) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wasilko et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, the SidE family (SdeA, SdeB, SdeC, and SidC) of Legionella has been shown to mediate unconventional phosphoribosyl (PR) serine ubiquitination mechanism, which is also tightly regulated by the meta-effector SidJ or PR-ubiquitin-specific DUBs (DupA and DupB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhogaraju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Black et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kalayil et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shin et al., 2020</xref>). Pathogenic bacteria encode not only ubiquitin ligases but also DUBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hermanns and Hofmann, 2019</xref>). The most studied bacterial DUBs are CE-clan proteases, based on the MEROPS database classification, which cleave either ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO1 or NEDD8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pruneda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rawlings et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to CE-clan DUBs, bacteria and viruses encode OTU-like DUBs. Several structures from viral-OTUs revealed that they have a unique structure compared to those of known OTU family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akutsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capodagli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">James et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lombardi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van Kasteren et al., 2013</xref>). OTUs from nairovirus Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Dugbe virus (DUGV) have an additional β-hairpin in their S1-binding site. While viral OTUs have been studied extensively, only three bacterial OTU-like DUBs have been identified to date. ChlaOTU from <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> contains an OTU-domain that cleaves both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furtado et al., 2013</xref>). LotA (Lpg2248; Lem21), <bold><underline>L</underline></bold>egionella <bold><underline>OT</underline></bold>U (LOT)-like DUB, contains two OTU-like domains with two catalytic Cys residues (C13 and C303), both of which are required for cleaving ubiquitin chains from an LCV (Legionella-containing vacuole) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kubori et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, LotA showed K6-linkage preference that is solely dependent on its first OTU domain (Cys13). Recently, another OTU-like DUB from Legionella (Lpg1621, Ceg23) has been identified as K63 chain-specific OTU-DUB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite these findings, little is known about the structure and molecular details of bacterial OTU-like DUBs. Here, we describe two novel OTU-like DUBs in Legionella – LotB (Lpg1621; Ceg23) and LotC (Lpg2529). Structural analysis of the LOT-DUBs provides insights into how bacterial OTU-DUBs are distinguished from the known OTU members. Furthermore, we also identified the specific host-substrates or interacting proteins of LotB and LotC by mass-spectrometry (MS) analysis using catalytically inactive variants. Collectively, our findings provide valuable structural insights into bacterial DUBs and their roles in host–pathogen interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of two novel OTU-like DUBs from Legionella effector proteins</title><p>To identify putative DUBs amongst the Legionella effector proteins, we analyzed effector proteins from <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (Lpg genes). Based on the type IV Icm/Dot complex secretion signal (&gt;2.0), 305 effector proteins were selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burstein et al., 2016</xref>). Using pairwise sequence-structure comparison based on hidden Markov models (HMMs, HHpred suite) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>), we revealed four previously uncharacterized proteins as putative DUBs. These proteins all contain catalytic domains of known DUBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Lpg1621(Ceg23) and Lpg2529 are found as members of the OTU-family, whereas Lpg2411 and Lpg2907 belong to the UCH and CE-clan, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). An in vitro di-ubiquitin cleavage assay with di-Ub panel (eight different linkage-specific Ub<sub>2</sub> chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">El Oualid et al., 2010</xref>]) showed that the OTU-like DUBs (Lpg1621 and Lpg2529) are capable of cleaving Ub<sub>2</sub> chains with different specificity, while other candidates (Lpg2411 and Lpg2907) did not show catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The OTU family DUBs have been shown to have linkage specificity against certain polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mevissen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>). To address whether Lpg1621 and Lpg2529 follow this fundamental rule, we performed a time-course in vitro DUB assay with di-Ub panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>). Consistent with the recent evidence, Lpg1621 exclusively processed the K63-linked Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2020</xref>), while Lpg2529 showed activity against K6-, K11-, K33-, K48-, and K63- linked Ub<sub>2</sub>.

protease family, which requires the presence of a catalytic triad for their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>). Based on the sequence analysis, we identified the conserved catalytic triad for both LotB (D27, C29, and H270) and LotC (D17, C24, and H304). Mutations on either cysteine or histidine completely abolished the catalytic activity of both DUBs, suggesting that both LotB and LotC follow the general catalytic mechanism of the OTU-family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref>). Next, we sought to find whether LotB and LotC require additional ubiquitin-binding sites (S1’ or S2). To elicit this information, we used two different types of ubiquitin activity-based probes (ABPs). The propargyl-di-ubiquitin-ABP (Prg-ABP) contains a highly reactive propargyl group at the C-terminus of ubiquitin chains, which can target S1 and S2 pocket (third-generation probes) and form a covalent bond with the catalytic cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ekkebus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Flierman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sommer et al., 2013</xref>). The vinyl methyl ester-ubiquitin-ABP (VME-ABP) contains VME, which replaces the isopeptide bond between two ubiquitin moieties in chains, which can detect S1 and S1’ pocket (second-generation probe), and also forms a covalent bond with the catalytic cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borodovsky et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mulder et al., 2014</xref>). Both LotB and LotC showed clear shifts with all Prg-ABPs (mono-, K48-, and K63- linked), with different reactivity. LotB only partially shifted after 30 min, as evident by the amount of unreacted species, while LotC rapidly reacted with Prg-ABP and was completely conjugated after 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>). These results suggest that both LotB and LotC have a primary ubiquitin-binding S1 site, where the propargyl group can be located in close proximity to the catalytic cysteine. In contrast with Prg-ABP, only LotB reacted with K63-Ub<sub>2</sub>-VME-ABP, which is consistent with the di-Ub panel assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c–f</xref>), where LotB showed specificity toward the K63-linkage. The VME-ABP results suggest that there is an additional S1’ ubiquitin-binding site on LotB, which helps to properly locate the K63-linked-VME group on the catalytic site proximal to the catalytic cysteine. LotC lacks this S1’ site, causing the VME group between two ubiquitin moieties to be unable to reach the catalytic cysteine. Next, we asked whether both LotB and LotC can interact with other ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO1/2/3, NEDD8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f and g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). Interestingly, LotB showed modification with both NEDD8-Prg and ubiquitin-Prg after a 30 min reaction, while LotC was modified only with ubiquitin. This suggests that LotB binds to both ubiquitin and NEDD8 through the conserved Ile44-mediated hydrophobic interactions, while LotC interacts with ubiquitin through specific residues present only in ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Biochemical properties of LotB and LotC.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Predicted catalytic residues on LotB and LotC.

To determine the minimal OTU domain for biochemical and structural studies, we designed several constructs and tested their activity against the di-Ub panel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). While LotC retained its activity with the predicted OTU domain (7–310), LotB lost its activity after deletion of 50 amino acids (300–350) located at the C-terminus, beyond the predicted OTU domain (11–283). Based on the LotB structure (PDB:6KS5, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2020</xref>), we assumed that this additional helical region might be required for the another ubiquitin-binding site (S1’) to accept the distal ubiquitin moiety from K63 Ub<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). To understand the detailed mechanism of the linkage specificity of LotB and LotC at the molecular level, we determined the crystal structure of the catalytic domain of LotC (LotC<sub>14-310</sub>) at 2.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, PDB ID: 6YK8). A structural comparison of both LotB and LotC with other OTU-DUBs predicted by HHpred revealed that both Lot-DUBs have the unique structural features in the S1 ubiquitin-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Whereas the overall fold of the catalytic core of LotB and LotC resembles that of other OTU-DUBs, both showed apparent differences in the helical arm region, which has been shown to serve as an S1-binding site and interact with ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>). The structure and sequence alignment with other OTUs clearly showed that both LotB and LotC contain a relatively long insertion between the Cys-loop and the variable loop, compared to other OTU members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). The typical length of the helical lobe of the known OTUs is ranging from 50 to 60 amino acids (except the Otubain family, which contains 110–120 amino acids). In comparison, the helical lobes in LotB and LotC contain 183 and 210 amino acids, respectively. Based on this observation, we wondered whether LotA, another LOT-DUB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kubori et al., 2018</xref>), also contains this extended insertion in the same region. Based on the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues of the two OTU domains on LotA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hermanns and Hofmann, 2019</xref>), we analyzed the sequence and found that both OTU domains of LotA contain the extended insertion between the Cys loop and the variable loop (179 and 178 amino acids, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>).

To address this, we performed ubiquitin docking into both LotB and LotC, followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 600 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–d</xref>). The final models showed that ubiquitin indeed makes contacts with the additional helical regions of both LotB and LotC. In LotB, Phe143 and Met144 form hydrophobic interactions with ubiquitin (Phe45 and Ala46). In addition to these interactions, we found another hydrophobic patch in LotB (Ile238, Val247, Ala248, Ile264, and Ala266) to interact with ubiquitin (Leu71 and Leu73). For LotC, we identified several hydrophobic interactions of the extended helical region (Tyr119 and Tyr149) with ubiquitin (Ile44). During the simulation, the C-terminus of ubiquitin (Arg72 and Arg74) formed transient electrostatic interactions with LotC (Glu153 and Glu245). To validate the interactions observed in the simulations, we introduced several mutations to the binding interface of both LotB and LotC, and performed a ubiquitin-cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>). Consistent with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2020</xref>), mutations of both F143 and M144 decreased the catalytic activity of LotB. Interestingly, mutations of the newly identified hydrophobic patch (I238 and A266) also reduced the catalytic activity. For LotC, the mutations in the hydrophobic patch (Y119 and Y149) affected its catalytic activity. Remarkably, a single mutation on E153 completely abolished the catalytic activity, which indicates that the electrostatic interactions are essential for the correct docking of the ubiquitin C-terminus into the catalytic pocket of LotC. This observation also explains the result observed in ubiquitin-like protein ABP assays with LotC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). The NEDD8, which has an alanine instead of Arg72 in ubiquitin, showed no modification toward LotC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

First, to enrich the interacting partners, catalytically inactive LotB or LotC were expressed in cells and immuno-precipitated from cell lysates. Ubiquitin (UBB) is strongly enriched with both catalytically inactive LotB and LotC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). MS analysis revealed that LotB mainly interacts with membrane protein complexes (COPB1, ATP5B, ATP5H, COX5A, and SEC61B). We also found the interaction of LotB with some ER-resident proteins (Calnexin [CANX], DDOST, STT3A). By contrast, most of the enriched proteins from the inactive LotC pull-down were non-membrane-bound organelle- and ribosome-related proteins (RPS8, RPLP2, RPS27, RPLP1, and RPL13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and b). To further understand this, we sought to find the cellular localization of both DUBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and d</xref>). Consistent with the recent publication, LotB specifically co-localized with the ER marker protein Calnexin, but not with other organelle markers (TOMM20 and GM130 for mitochondria and Golgi, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), and the OTU domain itself failed to localize on the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). By contrast, we could not find a specific cellular localization of LotC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Next, to gain more insights into the functional roles of LotB and LotC, we decided to explore combinatorial ubiquitination events with other ubiquitin-related Legionella effector proteins. To do this, we co-transfected the cells with one of the Lot-DUBs and previously known Legionella E3 ligases (SidC or SdcA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wasilko et al., 2018</xref>). We chose these two ligases because their cellular substrates are poorly studied. TMT-labeled samples from cells expressing either SidC or SdcA alone, or together with a catalytically inactive mutant of LotB or LotC, were prepared (four combinations; SidC-LotB, SidC-LotC, SdcA-LotC, or SdcA-LotC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a–d</xref>). Interestingly, we identified a distinct sub-class of substrates. Overall, a smaller number of proteins were enriched with LotB compared to LotC. We reasoned that LotB specifically interacts with proteins modified with K63-linked ubiquitin chains, while LotC interacts with different types of ubiquitin chains. Intriguingly, we found a significant number of ribosome-structural proteins in LotC:SdcA combination, which were not enriched in the SidC background. Even though, our interactome study provided us useful information on putative host-interacting partners of LotB and LotC, it is still possible that only one of these proteins is genuine interactor and others are enriched through the complex formation. To avoid this question and to identify host-specific substrates of LotB or LotC under Legionella-infected condition, we developed new MS approaches. HEK293T cells were transfected with CD32 to facilitate the infection and subsequently infected with Legionella. The infected lysates were then subjected to GST pull-down with wild-type and catalytic dead mutant of LotB or LotC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). The catalytic mutant of both LotB and LotC efficiently enriched ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b and d</xref>). Interestingly, several Legionella proteins were enriched from both DUBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and e</xref>). The LotB-C29S pulled-down some essential Legionella proteins such as atpD;ATP synthase, lpg2812;sporulation protein, lpg0841;Toluene ABC transporter, and SdhA;succinate dehydrogenase. In contrast, the LotC-C24S enriched two Legionella ribosomal proteins (rplT and rpsM) and a DNA recombinase (recA). It will be interesting to study the ubiquitination level on these Legionella proteins during infection. As expected, many of the host proteins are also enriched in these experiments. To validate whether these proteins are genuine substrate of LotB or LotC, ubiquitination level of selected substrates was analyzed by in vitro deubiquitination assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g and h</xref>). The ubiquitination level of all six substrates from different subcellular localization (RYK, Rab13, and PCYT1A for LotB, VAT1, HMOX1, and PPP2R1A for LotC) was reduced upon treatment of purified LotB or LotC, suggesting that the enriched proteins from catalytic dead mutants are putative substrates of LotB or LotC. Further studies on how the ubiquitination level of these proteins is regulated by LotB or LotC will unveil physiological roles of both LotB and LotC during Legionella infection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Host-interacting proteins and cellular localization of LotB and LotC.</title><p>(<bold>a, c</bold>) Proteomic analysis of interacting partners of LotB and LotC.

Unlike classical OTU-DUBs, the LOT-DUBs possess extended helical insertions between the catalytic Cys-loop and the variable loop. Molecular dynamic simulations, in combination with biochemical studies, showed that the helical insertions interact with ubiquitin. As this insertion is unique for LOTs and not found in other known OTU-family members, LOT-DUBs define a new sub-class of the OTU-DUB family. We have also shown that LotB and LotC have preferences for certain ubiquitin chains and have a distinct cellular localization. Moreover, host-protein interactome studies revealed that LotB and LotC have different sets of host-interacting proteins. Together, these findings establish guidance on screening more DUBs in other pathogenic bacteria or viruses and characterizing their physiological roles during infection.</p><p>We also showed that the two LOTs have different ubiquitin-binding modes that enable them to cleave specific ubiquitin chains. With ubiquitin ABPs (Prg- and VME-probes), we showed that LotB contains an additional ubiquitin-binding site (S1’) and is specific to K63-linked ubiquitin chains. In contrast, LotC cleaves various types of ubiquitin chains. Interestingly, we observed a modification of LotB with NEDD8-Prg ABP. Further studies on neddylated proteins with LotB will give us more insights into the dual-activity of LotB. In contrast, we could not see the modification between NEDD8-ABP and LotC. We reasoned that the Arg72 on ubiquitin, which is replaced by alanine in NEDD8, is essential to locate the C-terminus of ubiquitin to the catalytic site. Indeed, in molecular dynamic simulations of LotC with ubiquitin, we found Arg72 from transient interactions with Glu153 of LotC. Further structural analysis will shed light on how different ubiquitin chains bind to LotB or LotC through the different binding modes.</p><p>DUBs from bacteria and viruses have been shown to alter the host immune system. For example, papain-like proteases (PLPro) from coronaviruses, such as middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or SARS-CoV-2, have dual DUB and de-ISGylation activities and antagonized type I interferon (IFN-I) response, which is the primary defense system against viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis and Gack, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devaraj et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frieman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadler and Williams, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, we identified OTUD4 as an interacting partner of LotB. OTUD4 has been shown to deubiquitinate K63-linked chains of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) and to downregulate NF-kB-dependent inflammation. While the recent study on LotB showed no detectable inhibition of NF-kB reporter expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2020</xref>), further studies are awaited to show the cross-talk between LotB and the host ubiquitination system.</p><p><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> has been shown to possess multiple genes altering the host ubiquitination system. However, little is known about functional cross-talk between ubiquitin ligases and DUBs. To understand the combinatorial effects of Legionella ubiquitin ligases and DUBs, we analyzed the interactome of LotB/LotC with host proteins in the presence or absence of Legionella ligases (SidC and SdcA). We could see apparent differences in the number of enriched proteins in different combinations. A significant number of ribosomal proteins were enriched with LotC in the background of SdcA, but not from SidC background, which has 71% sequence similarity to SdcA. This finding suggests distinct physiological roles of SdcA and SidC, and a putative relationship between LotC and SdcA on regulating translation processes. Since LotC processes different types of ubiquitin chains and is mainly localized to the cytosol, the catalytically dead version of LotC can be used as a standard tool for identifying specific substrates of other known Legionella ligases. We could also nicely enrich ubiquitinated substrates of LotB and LotC from Legionella-infected cell lysates. Both DUBs enriched several Legionella proteins together with various of host proteins. It would be interesting to understand how all these ubiquitin machineries work together and alter the host-ubiquitination system at different time points of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>All proteins used in this study were expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>).

Given that the C-terminus of ubiquitin should interact with the catalytic residue of the OTUs, we used the local docking approach in which we placed the C-terminal end of ubiquitin (Gly76) near the catalytic residues in both ligases (Cys29 and His270 for LotB and Cys16 and His296 for LotC). We then started the docking by optimizing the rigid-body orientation and side-chain conformation sampling. The program requires two protein structures as inputs, which were prepared by running the refinement protocol before the docking step. We performed the local docking approach and generated 100 independent structures for each complex. The complexes in this way were subject to local refinement to remove remaining small clashes. The complexes were then clustered based on the distance matrix of Cα atoms between the ligase and ubiquitin using the KMeans method. The representatives of two major clusters in each case were selected based on the interface score (I_sc), which represents the energy of the interactions across the interface of two proteins.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Claudio A P Joazeiro (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes a biochemical analysis of LotC and LotB, two OTU domain DUBs found in <italic>Legionella</italic>. The work includes a determination of the substrate specificity of the DUBs on ubiquitin conjugates, as well as a structural analysis of LotB and LotC. The paper also examines interaction partners for Lot proteins, as well as their subcellular localization. The interaction partners for the DUBs provides a resource for the community.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers feel that the work is potentially appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, they feel that additional work is needed to strengthen various aspects of the paper.</p><p>1) Given that LotB is already known to be an OTU DUB, careful and appropriate descriptions of what is known and what is new would strengthen the paper. In addition, it would be helpful to spend more time presenting the unique features of LotC relative to LotA/B. Are there new mutations that would be easy to make and test that would lead to some validation of the unique features of LotC? Perhaps you already have such data. In this regard, it would be interesting to compare a simple docking of Ub to the molecular dynamics simulation.</p><p>2) The reviewers feel that the interaction proteomics is less well developed than it might be. Recognizing that it may be difficult to develop novel biological insights in the current situation, the reviewers feel that more effort in organizing the data would improve the paper substantially. Many of the interactors are in complexes and so potentially only one protein within the complex is a substrate. So the description and interpretation of the data should also be more precise. The reviewers feel that some additional form of orthogonal validation would really help. Is it possible to try to validate at least s small number of the potential interactions? A second possibility is to take perhaps a small number of potential high value targets (like Rabs, given that they are known to be ubiquitylated in the context of <italic>Legionella</italic> infection), and see if their ubiquitylation is reduced by LotB/C expression using a simple western blot assay. Other likely ubiquitylated proteins could also potentially be tested in a similar way. In addition, the interaction with the ribosome is interesting but given its abundance, raises the question of whether it could be a false positive. Can this interaction be validated better? Organizing the hits into protein complexes and presenting the data as a &quot;complexome&quot; might help.</p><p>3) The interaction data is provided only for the inactive Lot proteins. If available, this data should also be provided for the WT protein. Also, the localization data is provided for the WT protein, so in order to be parallel with the proteomics, it would also be important to have the mutant protein localization data as well.</p><p>Because some of the comments of the reviewers may facilitate an understanding of the desired revisions, I have provided all of the comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:Legionella pneumophila</italic>, a Gram-negative bacterium, is an important human pathogen. Its pathogenic mechanism relies on the secretion of effector proteins into the host cell to modify innate immunity and metabolism. There is therefore great interest in identifying and characterizing such bacterial effectors. Here, Dikic and colleagues present a multi-disciplinary study of two novel <italic>Legionella</italic> effectors that act as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that interfere with the host ubiquitin signaling.Using a well-conceived bioinformatics approach to fish for candidate DUBs among 305 predicted secreted <italic>Legionella</italic> proteins, the authors found two novel DUBs belonging to the OTU family, which they named LotB and LotC. OTU-family DUBs are unique in that they can act in a ubiquitin linkage-specific manner. Indeed, results of a di-ubiquitin cleavage assay suggested that LotB acted more effectively towards Ub K63 linkages (and to a weaker extent towards K48 and K6 linkages), whereas LotC did not show linkage specificity. To elucidate the ubiquitin specificity and catalytic mechanism of these DUBs the authors used a combination of activity-based probes, structure-function studies, and crystallographic structural determination. A main feature that has emerged is that the Ub K63 linkage specificity of LotB relies on an additional ubiquitin-binding site (S1'). The authors also performed initial studies aimed at understanding the functional role of LotB and LotC in the host cell. LotB appears to localize predominantly to the ER membrane and its interactome indeed revealed primarily membrane proteins. On the other hand, LotC appears to have a broad subcellular distribution and did not exhibit preference towards membrane interactors. Interestingly, co-expression of the DUBs with selected <italic>Legionella</italic>-secreted E3 ligases uncovered further interactors. Among those, the combination of LotC and SdcA revealed the interaction with a number of ribosomal proteins. In conclusion, this manuscript integrates data obtained using a wide variety of experimental approaches to characterize the specificity, mechanism, structure and potential biological functions of two novel effector proteins of an important bacterial pathogen. The work will be of broad interest and merits publication.</p><p>The only major weakness of the work is the writing. First, there are many errors throughout the text (&quot;<italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> that causes Legionaries' disease&quot;; &quot;host-protein interactome studies revealed that LotB and LotC have different sets of host-interacting proteins to LotB and LotC&quot;; etc). Second, communicating the manuscript's beautiful messages to a general audience would benefit enormously from a major revision to improve on explanations (e.g., S1' is not defined anywhere) and clarity overall.</p><p>Although the findings open several future directions outside the scope of the manuscript (e.g., what is the LotB membrane-targeting mechanism?) it would be exciting to see some of the functional studies developed further. For example, what are functional consequences of the ribosome interactions found? Does expression of a ubiquitin K63R mutant interfere with LotB (but not LotC) interactions?</p><p>The legends are fairly undescriptive and incomplete. For example, in Figure 5E-F, what is the basis for classification of the different protein groups? I was particularly confused by the presence of proteins such as CNOT1, HNRNPs, PCNA, PSMCs, PSMDs, SMN1, etc., listed under &quot;Orgenelle&quot; in Figure 5E. And what is the light green box in Figure 5E?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper describes a molecular analysis of LotB and LotC DUBs from Legionelle, and defines these enzymes as well as the previously characterized LotA DUB as unique OTU-like DUBs. The paper combines a lot of biochemical analysis of substrate specificity with structural biology to elucidate mechanisms underlying the interesting substrate specificities of the enzymes. LotB appears quite specific for K63 linkages whereas LotC is a bit more promiscuous and cleaves multiple chain types. Lot enzymes were found to have unique structural features in their S1 binding site compared with other OTU-class DUBs which may explain their specificity, in part. The authors used molecular dynamics to identify potential ubiquitin S1 binding site residues and tested candidate residues in vitro using chain cleavage assays. These studies verified a subset of residues as being important.</p><p>Finally, the authors perform a series of exploratory studies to understand potential biological functions of LotB and LotC. The authors demonstrate that LotB is associated with ER and appears to interact with proteins that are often associated with ER, including some membrane proteins. In contrast, LotC doesn't seem to have a specific subcellular localization and interacts preferentially with soluble proteins or protein complexes. They performed analogous experiments with over expression of <italic>Legionella</italic> E3s, identifying additional candidate substrates.</p><p>Overall, the paper covers a lot of ground. The structural and biochemical studies are very complete. The target identification studies are a good start, but the study doesn't have much in the way of validation currently. However, this work provides many new leads for potential biological functions of the DUBs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript concerns the characterization of two <italic>Legionella</italic> OUT-like deubiquitinases LotB and LotC. The authors use a combination of activity based suicide probes and endpoint assays using di-ubiquitin to define the UBL selectivity and ubiquitin chain specificity of these enzymes. A crystal structure of the catalytic domain of LotC is presented and compared with the already existing PDB structure of LotB. The authors identify extended insertions in the catalytic domain that based on molecular dynamics simulations contribute to the mode of ubiquitin binding. The authors then conduct a series of differential proteomic interactome studies using catalytically inactive mutants as baits. Some of these experiments are conducted in the presence of overexpressed <italic>Legionella</italic> ubiquitin E3 ligases. Interacting proteins are not further validated but presented as likely substrates of these enzymes.</p><p>Whilst this is in principle an interesting topic, the study at this stage does not provide substantial fundamental new insights or present clear conceptual advances in the mechanistic understanding of DUBs in general or in the role of these particular DUBs in the context of a <italic>Legionella</italic> infection.</p><p>1) LotB (as the authors also state) was recently (in January 2020) described in a manuscript by Ma et al. (Ma et al., 2020) that included a crystal structure identifying LotB as OTU-related and also described its of K63-ubiquitin chain selectivity. Related LotA was already characterised as a DUB in 2018 (Kubori et al., 2018). Given that this study does not undertake a full blown phylogenetic/bioinformatics analysis of the family, the title seems somewhat misleading. This manuscript is not the first to describe the &quot;novel class of OTU deubiquitinases&quot;. The biochemical characterization of the enzymatic activity is quite basic and the cell biology of the enzymes is not explored except for an attempt at subcellular localization which identifies LotB as an ER-localised protein.</p><p>2) Interactors are not necessarily substrates – Whilst the title alludes to substrate ubiquitination, and the Introduction states &quot;we…identified the specific host-substrates of LotB and LotC&quot;, the experiments are not directed to identify the substrates – i.e. proteins that may be less ubiquitinated in the presence of the <italic>Legionella</italic> DUBs. This would have required a different approach, for example isolating ubiquitylated proteins or peptides in the first place.</p><p>The interactome datasets may of course identify interesting binding partners that may well include both regulators and substrates. However no orthologous validation experiments have been conducted to verify firstly the interaction and secondly assess the putative enzyme-substrate relationship. The figures focus on the comparison of interactors that are enriched in &quot;mutant over empty&quot; – presumably an empty plasmid – rather than drawing a comparison between wild-type and inactive mutants. Importantly, there is a priori no evidence that catalytically inactive DUBs would act as true substrate traps – they may misfold or mislocalise and for that reason associate non-specifically with a different subset of proteins. Thus in the absence of further work, the information value of these datasets is unclear.</p><p>The introduction of some <italic>Legionella</italic> E3 ligases in the experimental set-up does alter the interactome data but this could be due to an overall change in the ubiquitin landscape upon the overexpression of those E3s. In other words, overexpression of any other E3 may also impinge on the interactome associated with the <italic>Legionella</italic> DUBs. This does not necessarily imply a coordination of activities in the host. The overall rationale of those experiments is not clear – the <italic>Legionella</italic> E3 ligases do not necessarily modify host proteins that are then targeted by <italic>Legionella</italic> DUBs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58277.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers feel that the work is potentially appropriate for publication in eLife, they feel that additional work is needed to strengthen various aspects of the paper.</p><p>1) Given that LotB is already known to be an OTU DUB, careful and appropriate descriptions of what is known and what is new would strengthen the paper.

We agree that the structure and the chain specificity of Lpg1621 (Ceg23) was published in January 2020 while we were studying both LotB (Lpg1621;Ceg23) and LotC. We also agree that Kubori et al., introduced the name <italic>Legionella</italic> OTU deubiquitinase (LOT) for the first time in 2018 (Kubori et al., 2018). However, while both manuscripts described Lpg1621(Ceg23) and LotA as OTU-related deubiquitinases, there was no clear description of <italic>Legionella</italic> OTU-deubiquitinase as unique DUB family. In this manuscript, we named Lpg1621(Ceg23) as LotB and Lpg2529 as LotC to be consistent with LotA and put all of them as unique OTU subfamily based on their structures. We spotted that all three <italic>Legionella</italic> OTU-deubiquitinases (LotA, LotB and LotC) are having an extra insertion between Cys-loop and variable loop and suggested this insertion as unique feature of <italic>Legionella</italic> OTU-deubiquitinase family.</p><p>The ubiquitin docking MD simulation is presented in Figure 4, based on this we found key mutations on LotC (E245R, M248R, Y119R, Y149R, E153R, Figure 4B, D, F) that result in the failure of K48-Ub2 cleavage. Importantly, this mutation analysis also proved that the interaction between ubiquitin and LotC is mainly mediated by the ionic interaction between R72/74 of ubiquitin and E153 of LotC. This result also explains the reason why LotC would not interact with Nedd8 which lack the R72 at the C-terminal tail (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). We also identified two additional single mutants (I238R, A266R) which impaired the K63-Ub2 cleavage activity of LotB. These mutants lead us to identify additional hydrophobic interaction residues that were not described previously (Ma et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reviewers feel that the interaction proteomics is less well developed than it might be.

As reviewers concerned, interacting proteins identified from LotB or LotC be false positives due to the overexpression of both enzymes and there were indeed many proteins from complexes. To avoid such confusion, we have now clearly mentioned the possibility of false-positive hits in the manuscript and we also removed Figure 5E, F which was also the specific concerns from reviewer #1. In addition, we are now providing new MS data for substrates identification and validation in entire new figure (Figure 6). We developed new MS approaches to identify host-specific substrates of LotB or LotC under <italic>Legionella</italic> infected condition. HEK293T cells were infected with <italic>Legionella</italic> and the infected lysates were then subjected to GST pull-down with wild-type and catalytic dead mutant of LotB or LotC (Figure 6A). Interestingly, the catalytic mutant of both LotB and LotC efficiently enriched ubiquitinated proteins (Figure 6B, C). As reviewers recommended, we chose some of the hits, which have potential values from this new MS list and they are further validated by in vitro deubiquitination assay (Figure 6G, H). For Lot B, we choose three proteins, which contain critical cellular function, including receptor like tyrosine kinase (RYK), Rab13, and phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase A (PCYT1A). For Lot C, we also choose three proteins based on the MS scores and the potential function, including vesicle amine transport 1 (VAT1), heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), and protein phosphatase 2 scaffold subunit alpha (PPP2R1A). These substrates of LotB and Lot C shed the new light on <italic>Legionella</italic> pathogenesis, but still need to be further investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The interaction data is provided only for the inactive Lot proteins.

We agree that exploring some of the functional consequences of interacting partner of LotB and LotC are exciting questions. Since all reviewers were concerned about possible misleading of our interactome data, we decided to develop new MS approach to find substrates of LotB or LotC (Figure 6). We prepared <italic>Legionella</italic> infected lysates to induce and follow the changes in ubiquitination system under infection condition and pull-downed the ubiquitinated proteins by catalytic dead version of both LotB and LotC. With this new approach, we could nicely enrich ubiquitinated substrates (Figure 6A-E) and validated some of them by in vitro ubiquitination assay (Figure 6G, H). As we also described in the Discussion, there are many interesting open questions to be followed based on our MS results. For instance, we found several <italic>Legionella</italic> proteins as putative substrates of LotB and LotC. It will be important to initiate follow-up studies on how host or <italic>Legionella</italic> E3 ubiquitinates those substrates and how LotB and LotC revert these modifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The legends are fairly undescriptive and incomplete.

Since reviewer concerned that the catalytically inactive mutant may not trap substrates, we checked the level of ubiquitinated proteins from both wild-type and mutants (Figure 6A). As shown, catalytically inactive LotB and LotC enriched more ubiquitinated proteins from Legionella infected cells (Figure 6B, C). To avoid another concern that this enrichment is the result of mis-fold or mis-localization of DUBs, we validated 6 substrates and performed the in vitro deubiquitination assay (Figure 6F-H). Together, we have now provided list of putative substrates for both LotB and LotC with orthogonal validation data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
