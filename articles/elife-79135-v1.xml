disorder by propagating pathological firing patterns to the forebrain. Here, we examined the function of the cerebello-thalamic pathways in a model of DYT25 dystonia. DYT25 (<italic>Gnal<sup>+/−</sup></italic>) mice carry a heterozygous knockout mutation of the <italic>Gnal</italic> gene, which notably disrupts striatal function, and systemic or striatal administration of oxotremorine to these mice triggers dystonic symptoms. Our results reveal an increased cerebello-thalamic excitability in the presymptomatic state. Following the first dystonic episode, <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice in the asymptomatic state exhibit a further increase of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical excitability, which is maintained after θ-burst stimulations of the cerebellum. When administered in the symptomatic state induced by a cholinergic activation, these stimulations decreased the cerebello-thalamic excitability and reduced dystonic symptoms. In agreement with dystonia being a multiregional circuit disorder, our results suggest that the increased cerebello-thalamic excitability constitutes an early endophenotype, and that the cerebellum is a gateway for corrective therapies via the depression of cerebello-thalamic pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd><italic>Gnal</italic></kwd><kwd>motor cortex</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>dystonia</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE37-0003 Amedyst</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hervé</surname><given-names>Denis</given-names></name><name><surname>Popa</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE37-0009 Mopla</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Léna</surname><given-names>Clément</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM-EQU202103012770</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Léna</surname><given-names>Clément</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-CE37-0007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Popa</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Labex Memolife</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Léna</surname><given-names>Clément</given-names></name><name><surname>Popa</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a mouse model of DYT25 dystonia with disruption of striatal neurotransmission by <italic>Gnal</italic> mutation, the cerebello-thalamic excitability is increased following symptom expression and θ-burst cerebellar stimulations during cholinergic-induced dystonia depress the cerebello-thalamic transmission and reduce the motor symptom severity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dystonia is a class of neurological disease whose symptomatology is characterized by involuntary movements and abnormal postures, caused by the co-contraction of antagonistic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berardelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albanese et al., 2013</xref>). The wide clinical spectrum of dystonia, whether in causes or clinical manifestations, has hampered so far the identification of a common pathophysiological mechanism underlying the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balint et al., 2018</xref>). If early studies have primarily highlighted the role of the basal ganglia in the onset of the disease, more recent studies have revealed strong dysfunctions in the motor cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum in dystonic patients, questioning which structural impairments are primary or secondary causes of dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Simonyan, 2018</xref>). Indeed, lesions in the basal ganglia or in the cerebellum do not systematically induce a dystonic phenotype, and the onset of the disease is usually delayed following the lesions. Moreover, if the basal ganglia and cerebellum have been considered as therapeutic targets, approaches targeting these structures yielded inconsistent outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oyama and Hattori, 2021</xref>). These specificities led to the emergence of a new working hypothesis, that dystonia is a circuit disorder that has a diversity of triggering mechanisms but requires the interactions between several nodes of the motor network to reach a symptomatic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lehéricy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Prudente et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In line with the circuit disorder theory, studies of genetic forms of the disease have identified endophenotypes in the form of nonmotor symptoms, such as altered temporal discrimination threshold in nonmanifesting mutation carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hutchinson et al., 2013</xref>), causing an inability of individuals to consider two subsequent stimuli as asynchronous if those are presented in a short amount of time. Such endophenotypes indicate an altered sensorimotor processing, which after amplification over time or through environmental interactions would lead to motor dysfunction. Anomalies in synaptic plasticity in the cortex and striatum have also been linked to dystonia in genetic forms of dystonia in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calabresi et al., 2016</xref>). Cerebellar dysfunction preexisting to symptoms has also been observed in such models: nonmanifesting DYT6 mice exhibit an aberrant electrophysiological activity in the cerebellar cortex and nuclei, which is further disrupted in manifesting animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van der Heijden et al., 2021</xref>). The functional connectivity in motor circuit may play an important role in the expression of symptoms. Indeed, DYT1 mutation carriers exhibit cerebello-thalamic disruptions, and the penetrance of DYT1 dystonia, as well as the severity of symptoms, is regulated by the structural integrity of cerebello-thalamo-cortical tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Argyelan et al., 2009</xref>). This observation has been reproduced in a mouse model of DYT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Uluğ et al., 2011</xref>), as well as a defect in cortico-striatal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu-Taeger et al., 2020</xref>), supporting the possibility of an inter-dependence of cerebello-thalamic and striatal dysfunctions. Thus, animal models of genetic forms of dystonia support the idea of a circuit disorder, but also offer an opportunity to investigate the network alterations at the level of the cerebellum, basal ganglia, motor cortex, and their reciprocal connections.</p><p>DYT25 is a recently identified genetic form of primary torsion dystonia, characterized as an autosomal-dominant adult-onset disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). It is caused by loss-of-function mutations of the <italic>Gnal</italic> gene encoding Gα(olf), a G-protein stimulating adenylate cyclase activity, mainly expressed in the olfactory bulb and striatum, with a sparse expression in Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belluscio et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vemula et al., 2013</xref>). The genetic alterations discovered in DYT25 dystonic patients can be mimicked by heterozygous knockout mutation of the <italic>Gnal</italic> gene (<italic>Gnal</italic><sup>+/−</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelosi et al., 2017</xref>). In this model, cAMP production is reduced in the striatum, disrupting striatal functions, but the mice are devoid of dystonic symptoms in early adulthood. In agreement with a role of increased striatal cholinergic activity in dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pisani et al., 2007</xref>), dystonic symptoms are induced by injections of a muscarinic cholinergic agonist (oxotremorine M) administered either systemically or in the striatum, but not in the cerebellum, and were prevented by the muscarinic antagonist, trihexyphenidyl, a drug alleviating symptoms in many dystonic patients. This indicates that an increase in striatal cholinergic tone is critical to the onset of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelosi et al., 2017</xref>). This is consistent with a primary involvement of <italic>Gnal</italic> in striatal neurotransmission, despite its sparse expression in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhuang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Corvol et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hervé et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corvol et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vemula et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Regardless of the heterogeneity in the function and expression of the genes involved in DYT1 and DYT25, these types of dystonia share many similarities. Strikingly, in animal models, similar alterations in cortico-striatal plasticity were observed in DYT1 and DYT25, suggesting common pathophysiological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martella et al., 2021</xref>). While the alteration of cerebellum or cerebello-thalamic tracts has been linked to the expression of DYT1 in patients and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Argyelan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Uluğ et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fremont et al., 2017</xref>), studies of DYT25 have remained focused on striatal alterations. However, an involvement of cerebello-thalamic tracts in the pathophysiology of DYT25 remains an open question. Moreover, cerebellar stimulations have been shown to be beneficial in idiopathic cervical dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bradnam et al., 2016</xref>), and genetic mouse models of dystonia allow a finer dissection of the effects induced by this type of approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van der Heijden et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast to the DYT1 mouse, the DYT25 mouse model has the additional advantage of being pharmacologically inducible, allowing the study of the network’s state in the presymptomatic and symptomatic states.</p><p>In this study, we therefore investigated the functional connectivity and plasticity of cerebello-thalamic tracts in the <italic>Gnal</italic> mouse model. We performed optogenetic stimulations in the cerebellar dentate nucleus (DN) and recorded activity in the ventrolateral thalamus (VAL, which projects to the motor cortex), centrolateral thalamus (CL, which projects to the striatum), primary motor cortex (M1), and dorsolateral striatum (DLS). We investigated the state of this network in the presymptomatic condition, symptomatic state, and asymptomatic state after the induction of the disease. Finally, in line with the therapeutic benefit of cerebellar stimulations in patients, we tested the effect of optogenetic θ-frequency stimulations of the DN on the plasticity of cerebello-thalamo-cortical tracts and on motor symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Young adult <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice do not exhibit constitutive locomotor impairments</title><p>3–7-month-old <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice have been described as asymptomatic, without dystonic phenotype in control conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelosi et al., 2017</xref>).

After the first dystonic episode triggered by a cholinergic agonist, mutant animals, once returned to an asymptomatic state, exhibit further functional alterations of the cerebello-thalamic pathways, with a marked increase in cerebello-thalamic excitability and loss of potentiation of these functional connections by cerebellar θ-burst stimulations, which are also reflected downstream in the motor cortex and striatum. Finally, cerebellar θ-burst stimulations in the symptomatic state induce a functional depression of the cerebello-thalamic pathway absent from control mice, and this effect is accompanied by a reduction of the motor symptoms. This shows that in <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice before the first dystonia episode the cerebello-thalamic tract exhibits an increased excitability that is amplified after the first episode and can thus be seen as a functional endophenotype.

DYT25 is known to be an adult-onset dystonia, with an age at onset ranging from 7 to 63 years (average of about 30 years), and, although the onset occurs mainly in the neck (about 80%), dystonia can affect various body parts, with generalization in 10% of the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vemula et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dufke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ziegan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saunders-Pullman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carecchio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dos Santos et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the immunohistochemistry study in rats of Gα(olf), the protein encoded by <italic>Gnal</italic>, reveals labeling in the olfactory bulb, striatum, substantia nigra, and cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vemula et al., 2013</xref>). In the striatum, Gα(olf) is closely associated with the G protein subunits, Gγ7 and Gβ2, and the type 5 adenylyl cyclase (AC5) to form a multi-molecular complex critical for cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hervé, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xie et al., 2015</xref>) and mutations of Gγ7 and AC5 cause motor disorders, including dystonia, in animals and humans. Homozygous Gγ7 knockout mice, which have a severe impairment of Gα(olf) signaling in the striatum, display age-dependent dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sasaki et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, loss-of-function mutations of ADCY5, the human gene encoding AC5, are responsible for chorea with dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carapito et al., 2015</xref>), whereas gain-of-function mutations cause dyskinesia with facial myokymia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the disruption of the striatal transduction pathway involving Gα(olf) likely plays a central role in the development of dystonia.</p><p>In the mouse striatum, expression of Gα(olf) highly increases between postnatal day 7 (P7) and P14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iwamoto et al., 2004</xref>), a period during which motor skills of pups are developing intensely. Moreover, while juvenile rats (P14) displayed intense staining in cell bodies of striatal cholinergic neurons and medium spiny neurons, adult rats displayed a more diffused staining in the striatum, with a weaker staining in cholinergic neurons. Similarly, juvenile rats displayed a staining of the soma and dendrites of Purkinje cells, while it was restricted to their soma in adult rats. These shifts in expression suggest that Gα(olf) plays a role in shaping neuronal networks and that the mutation of <italic>Gnal</italic> may cause an abnormal neuronal circuit development.

They indeed provide a model of the presymptomatic stage of dystonia. Identifying presymptomatic alterations may provide insights into the mechanism by which the network activity will shift toward the pathological state (mediational endophenotypes), although these alterations may simply be a side effect of the mutation unrelated to the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hutchinson et al., 2013</xref>). In humans, several physiological markers were proposed as endophenotypes of primary dystonia. The tactile temporal discrimination threshold (TDT) is increased in different types of isolated dystonia, nonmanifesting DYT1-mutation carriers, and unaffected relatives of both familial and sporadic adult-onset dystonia patients, and the somatotopic representation of fingers in the S1 cortex was disorganized on both sides in unilaterally affected dystonic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meunier et al., 2001</xref>). Inter-hemispheric inhibition, as assessed by dual-site paired-pulse TMS, is reduced in asymptomatic individuals but with a family history of dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bäumer et al., 2016</xref>). A critical issue is that these subclinical physiological alterations may not be specific to dystonia: for example, TDT was found abnormal in Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conte et al., 2016</xref>) and psychogenic dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morgante et al., 2011</xref>). Some neuroimaging studies also demonstrated a pattern of hypermetabolism of the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and supplementary motor area linked with DYT1 and DYT6 dystonia even in nonmanifesting gene carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eidelberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trost et al., 2002</xref>). While cerebello-thalamic fiber tract integrity in these dystonias is diversely affected in all gene carriers, nonmanifesting subjects exhibit a combination of rather preserved cerebello-thalamic tract and reduced downstream thalamus-motor cortex tract, suggesting that symptom manifestation due to disrupted cerebello-thalamic communication may be prevented by reduced thalamo-cortical interactions, as seen in nonmanifesting carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Argyelan et al., 2009</xref>). Although our data did not reveal significant increases in neuronal activity in naive <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice that would compare to the hypermetabolism found in DYT1 or DYT6 patients, we found an anomalously high responsiveness of thalamus VAL neurons to cerebellar stimulations; since we found no difference in DN responsiveness to optogenetic modulations between genotypes, it is likely that this difference results at least in part from an increased synaptic transmission or postsynaptic excitability. The origin of this alteration is unclear but could result from structural defects or homeostatic regulations (i.e., compensatory mechanisms) of the cerebello-thalamic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cerebello-thalamic network after dystonia induction in <italic>Gnal</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice</title><p>Oxotremorine injections affected both control and <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, but induced dystonic postures in the mutant mice.

This contrasts with the observations from murine models of DYT1, DYT12, DYT6 dystonia or from dystonic <italic>dt</italic> rats, where increased irregularity of neuronal discharge is observed in the cerebellar nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">LeDoux and Lorden, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fremont et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fremont et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">van der Heijden et al., 2021</xref>), as also seen in dystonia caused by cerebellar infusion with kainate (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pizoli et al., 2002</xref>).

These studies rather point toward a reduction of the entrainment of the cerebellum over downstream regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brighina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Filip et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DeSimone et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Porcacchia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Panyakaew et al., 2020</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kita et al., 2021</xref>). So far, the significance of these alterations is unclear: while a reduction of CBI was found in focal hand dystonia, it was either reduced or normal in cervical dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brighina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Porcacchia et al., 2019</xref>). In a rodent model of DYT12 dystonia, the cerebello-thalamic tract propagates pathological activities toward the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that a decreased cerebello-thalamic functionality could exert a protective effect. Abnormal involvement of the cerebellum in the motor circuits has also been linked to the presence of tremor in dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DeSimone et al., 2019</xref>), for which accumulating evidence correlates this feature with cerebellar dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antelmi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martino et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, dynamic causal modeling of brain activity from patients with dystonic tremor suggests a central contribution of the cerebellum and cerebello-thalamic pathway in this form of tremor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nieuwhof et al., 2022</xref>). Overall, the functional state of cerebello-thalamic pathway may thus depend on the type of dystonia. Our results suggest that in a type of dystonia with a primary striatal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelosi et al., 2017</xref>) the hyperexcitability of the cerebello-thalamic tract could reveal an increased susceptibility to dystonia, already present in presymptomatic <italic>Gnal</italic><bold><sup>+/-</sup></bold> mice and further potentiated after the first dystonic episode; a decrease in functional connectivity could however correspond to a long-term adaptation of the cerebello-forebrain pathways, which did not take place in the timescale of our experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Effects of θ-burst stimulations in <italic>Gnal</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice</title><p>Our results showed a differential sensitivity of the ascending cerebello-thalamic pathways to θ-burst stimulations of the DN in <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and WT mice.

Transcranial cerebellar stimulations are thought to recruit Purkinje cells and thus affect the cerebellar nuclei, but the site where these transcranial protocols elicit plastic changes is not established. Interestingly, daily sessions of θ-burst protocols have been found to mildly improve the condition of dystonic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bradnam et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, deep brain (high frequency) stimulations in patients indicate an improvement of dystonia, and notably tremor, when performed in the cerebello-thalamic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cury et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coenen et al., 2020</xref>).

Finally, repeated sessions of θ-burst stimulation might potentiate the effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meunier et al., 2015</xref>). In light of our results and consistent with the ‘protective’ effect of depressed cerebello-thalamo-cortical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Argyelan et al., 2009</xref>), the depression of the cerebello-thalamic pathway could thus be a mechanism by which cerebellar manipulations improve the condition of patients.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>Gnal</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice display an abnormal striatal plasticity</title><p>We observed short-latency responses in the DLS following stimulations of CL-projecting DN neurons, consistent with the disynaptic cerebello-striatal connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bostan et al., 2013</xref>) primarily relayed through the intralaminar thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ichinohe et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gornati et al., 2018</xref>) and targeting both interneurons and medium spiny neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, we found that DN θ-stimulations induce a potentiation of the response of fast-spiking striatal neurons in control mice.

Interestingly, the striatal inputs from the CL have been shown to shift the cortico-striatal plasticity in favor of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2014</xref>); therefore, the increased excitability of the DN-CL pathway after the first dystonic episode could participate to maintain potentiated cortico-striatal synapses. However, the cortico-striatal plasticity is controlled by many parameters, including notably the striatal acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deffains and Bergman, 2015</xref>), which is altered in dystonia. Further work clarifying the control of cortico-striatal plasticity by thalamic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mendes et al., 2020</xref>) is needed to understand how the cerebello-thalamo-striatal projections contribute to the impairments of cortico-striatal plasticity in dystonia.</p><p>In conclusion, our study investigates an original dystonia model that mimics the genetic alterations discovered in patients suffering from the recently identified DYT25 dystonia and demonstrates the benefits of a model with a pharmacological switch between presymptomatic, symptomatic, and asymptomatic states.

Furthermore, our results suggest that identifying cerebellar stimulation patterns that maximize the depression of the cerebello-thalamic pathway in patients could help improve therapeutic interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the European Community Council Directives. <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice were mated with C57BL/6J mice in order to obtain male and female <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and WT littermates. Animals (males and females <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and WT aged 3–7 months old) were kept at a constant room temperature and humidity on 12 hr light/dark cycle and with ad libitum access to water and food. All the motor control experiments were performed in males and females, and recordings were performed in freely moving mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Open-field activity</title><p>Mice were placed in a circular arena made of polyvinyl chloride with 38 cm diameter and 15 cm height (Noldus, Netherlands) and video-recorded from above. Each mouse was placed in the open field for 5 min with the experimenter out of its view. The center of gravity of the mice was tracked using an algorithm programmed in Python 3.5 and the OpenCV 4 library. Each frame obtained from the open field’s videos was analyzed according to the following process: open-field area was selected and extracted in order to be transformed into a grayscale image. A binary threshold was then applied to this grayscale image to differentiate the mouse from the white background. To reduce the noise induced by the recording cable or by particles potentially present in the open field, a bilateral filter and a Gaussian blur were sequentially applied since those components are supposed to have a higher spatial frequency compared to the mouse. Finally, the OpenCV implementation of the Canny algorithm was applied to detect the contours of the mouse; the position of the mouse was computed as the mouse’s center of mass. The distance traveled by the mouse between two consecutive frames was calculated as the variation of the position of the mouse center point multiplied by a scale factor to allow the conversion from pixel unit to centimeters. The total distance traveled was obtained by summing the previously calculated distances throughout the entire open-field session. The speed was computed as the variation of position of center points on two consecutive frames divided by the time between these frames (the inverse of the number of frames per second). This speed was then averaged by creating sliding windows of 1 s. After each session, fecal boles were removed and the floor was wiped clean with a damp cloth and dried after the passing of each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Horizontal bar test</title><p>Motor coordination and balance were estimated with the horizontal bar test, which consists of a linear horizontal bar extended between two supports (length: 90 cm; diameter: 1.5 cm; height: 40 cm from a padded surface). The mouse is placed on one of the sides of the bar and released when all four paws gripped it. The mouse must cross the bar from one side to the other, and latencies to cross the bar are measured in a single trial session with a 3 min cutoff period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Vertical pole test</title><p>Motor coordination was estimated with the vertical pole test. The vertical pole (51 cm in length and 1.5 cm in diameter) was wrapped with white masking tape to provide a firm grip. Mice were placed heads up near the top of the pole and released when all four paws gripped the pole. The bottom section of the pole was fixated to its home-cage with the bedding present but without littermates. When placed on the pole, animals naturally tilt downward and climb down the length of the pole to reach their home cage. The time taken before going down to the home-cage with all four paws was recorded. A 20 s habituation was performed before placing mice at the top of the pole. The test was given in a single trial session with a 3 min cutoff period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Gait test</title><p>Motor coordination was also evaluated by analyzing gait patterns. Mouse footprints were used to estimate foot opening angles and hind base width, reflecting the extent of muscle loosening. The mice crossed an illuminated alley, 70 cm in length, 8 cm in width, and 16 cm in height, before entering a dark box at the end. Their hind paws were coated with nontoxic, water-soluble ink, and the alley floor was covered with sheets of white paper. To obtain clearly visible footprints, at least three trials were conducted. The footprints were then scanned and examined with the Dvrtk software (Jean-Luc Vonesch, IGBMC). The stride length was measured with hind base width formed by the distance between the right and left hind paws. The footprint pattern generated was scored for five parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simon et al., 2004</xref>). Step length, the average distance of forward movement between alternate steps, is defined as the distance of travel divided by the number of steps. Sigma, describing the regularity of step length, is defined as the standard variation of all right-right and left-left step distance. Gait width, the average lateral distance between opposite left and right steps, is determined by measuring the perpendicular distance of a given step to a line connecting its opposite preceding and succeeding steps. Alternation coefficient, describing the uniformity of step alternation, is calculated by the mean of the absolute value of 0.5 minus the ratio of right-left distance to right-right step distance for every left-right step pair. Linearity, average change in angle between consecutive right-right steps is calculated by drawing a line perpendicular to direction of travel, starting at first right footprint. After determining angle between this perpendicular line and each subsequent right footprint, differences in angle were estimated between each consecutive step pair, and the average of absolute values of all angles was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Grid test</title><p>The grid test is performed to measure the animal strength. It consists of placing the animal on a grid that tilts from a horizontal position of 0–180°. The time elapsed until the animal drops is recorded. The time limit for this experiment is 30 s. In those cases where the mice climbed up to the top of the grid, a maximum latency of 30 s was applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fixed-speed rotarod</title><p>Motor coordination, postural stability, and fatigue were estimated with the rotarod (mouse rotarod, Ugo Basile). The mice were placed on top of the plastic roller facing away from the experimenter’s view and tested at constant speeds (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 rpm). Latencies before falling were measured for up to 3 min in a single trial session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Surgery</title><p>Two surgeries were performed. During the first surgery, AAV2/1.hSyn.ChR2(H134R)-eYFP.WPRE.hGH (700 nl) was injected into the dentate nucleus of cerebellum (DN) of the <italic>Gnal</italic><sup>+/‐</sup> and WT mice (−6 mm AP, ±2.3 mm ML, −2.4 mm depth from dura). After 3 weeks, implantation surgery was performed. For both surgeries, the mice were anesthetized either with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine or a mixture of isoflurane and O<sub>2</sub> (3% for induction, 1.7% for maintenance). Injections with buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.) were performed to control pain, and core temperature (37°C) was kept with a heating pad. The mice were fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf Instruments, USA). After a local midline lidocaine injection s.c. (2%, 1 ml), a medial incision was performed, exposing the skull. Small craniotomies were drilled above the recording sites and above the optic fiber location (above the virus injection site), and then the electrodes were stereotaxically lowered inside the brain. This procedure allowed us, in one experimental set, to record in the left motor cortex (M1) (AP +2 mm and –2 mm ML from the Bregma, DV = −0.5 mm depth from the dura), ventrolateral thalamus (VAL) (–1.34 mm AP, ML = −1.00 mm, and DV = −3.4 mm depth from the dura), and centrolateral thalamus (CL) (AP at –1.58 mm, ML = −0.8 mm, DV = −3.00 mm depth from the dura). On a second experimental set, we recorded in the left dorsomedial striatum (DLS, −6 mm AP,±2.3 mm ML, −2.4 mm depth from dura) and dentate nucleus of cerebellum (DN, −6 mm AP, ±2.3 mm ML, −2.4 mm depth from dura). The mice were implanted with bundles of extracellular electrodes for each recording site. The ground wire was placed on the surface of cerebellum. Super Bond cement (Dental Adhesive Resin Cement, Sun Medical CO, Japan) was applied on the surface of the skull to strengthen the connection between the bone and the cement. The cannulas and ground wire were then fixed with dental cement (Pi-Ku-Plast HP 36, Bredent GmbH, Germany). The bundles of eight electrodes were made in-house by folding and twisting the nichrome wire with a 0.005-inch diameter (Kanthal RO-800) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Menardy et al., 2019</xref>). The bundles were placed inside guide cannulas (8–10 mm length and 0.16–0.18 mm inner diameter, Coopers Needle Works Limited, UK) glued (Loctite universal glue) to an electrode interface board (EIB-16; Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT) with one wire for each channel and four channels for each brain region (M1, CL, VAL), extending 0.5 mm below the tube tip. Wires were then fixed to the EIB with gold pins (Neuralynx), and then the EIB was secured in place by dental cement. A gold solution (cyanure-free gold solution, Sifco, France) was used for gold plating, and the impedance of each electrode was set to 200–500 kΩ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Manipulations of cerebellar output</title><p>Because the cerebellar nuclei send projections in the contralateral thalamus that then connects with the M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Teune et al., 2000</xref>), optogenetic stimulations were performed in the contralateral cerebellar DN (left M1 and right DN). Light‐induced excitation of the cerebellar‐projection neurons was elicited by using an LED driver (Mightex Systems) through optical fibers radiating blue light (470 nm) unilaterally implanted into the deep cerebellar nuclei (light intensity of 1.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). Optogenetic stimulations of the DN were either 100 ms, 0.25 Hz, or θ-burst stimulation, 20 ms, 8.33 Hz, applied for 2 × 40 s with a 2 min pause in between and were performed before and after triggering the dystonic attacks by an oxotremorine methiodide (oxotremorine M) intraperitoneal injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>The recordings began after at least 3 days of recovery and were performed on awake freely moving mice using a 16-channel acquisition system with a sampling rate of 25 kHz (Tucker-Davis Technology System 3, Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL). We performed 60 min baseline recording in an open field, followed by a 60 min recording after a saline injection. <italic>Gnal<sup>+/-</sup></italic> and WT mice were then injected intraperitoneally with oxotremorine methiodide (0.1 mg/kg, Sigma-Aldrich), dissolved in saline (NaCl 0.9 g/l), and recorded another 60 min with the same protocol as for saline. Optogenetic stimuli were applied to the DN at low-frequency stimuli of 100 ms, 1.5 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, and 0.25 Hz. After 48–72 hr, a second session with θ-burst stimulations was performed. The mice were recorded 60 min after the saline injection and then 60 min after the oxotremorine M1 injection using the same protocol as in baseline day except that after 30 min two θ-burst sessions of 40 s each with 2 min pause in between were applied (a total of 600 pulses for each condition). The stimulations induced small twitches but no major motor effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Histological verification of the site of optical fiber in DN and verification of the position of the electrodes</title><p>The animals were sacrificed with a single dose of pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, i.p.). Electrolytic lesions were performed to check the position of electrodes, mice were perfused with paraformaldehyde, and the brains were removed and kept in paraformaldehyde (4%). After slicing (using a vibratome at 90 μm thickness), all sites of the recordings were verified by superposing the atlas (Allen Brain Atlas) on slices, with the closest anatomical landmarks from our lesions used as reference points. Injections in the CL usually encompassed the neighboring structures (lateral mediodorsal thalamus, medial posterior thalamus), which have little if any projection to the dorsolateral striatum, but touched also the anterior part of the parafascicular thalamus that may contribute in part to the cerebello-thalamo-striatal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xiao et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>Video recordings monitored the motor behavior of <italic>Gnal</italic><sup>+/‐</sup> and WT mice in the open field. Dystonia severity was estimated using a previously published abnormal movement scoring scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jinnah et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calderon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pelosi et al., 2017</xref>) for every 10-min-long blocks of the recording after the oxotremorine M injection was given. The assessment was blinded for mouse genotype and was done by two members of the team. The scale uses the following scores: 0 = normal motor behavior; 1 = no impairment, but slightly slowed movements; 2 = mild impairment: occasional abnormal postures and movements; ambulation with slow walk; 3 = moderate impairment: frequent abnormal postures and movements with limited ambulation; 4 = severe impairment: sustained abnormal postures without any ambulation or upright position. In addition, the total time of active wakefulness from the total time of recording (active wake percentages, AW%) was assessed for both states, pre- and post-oxotremorine and pre- and post θ-burst stimulation. Active wake was considered as the state when the mouse is exploring the open field by walking in any direction and is expressed as a percentage of the total time of the recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Georgescu et al., 2018</xref>). We evaluated the impact of θ-burst DN stimulation on the onset of dystonic‐like symptoms in saline‐ and oxotremorine‐treated <italic>Gnal</italic><sup>+/‐</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Electrophysiological analysis</title><p>Spike sorting was completed using homemade MATLAB scripts (MathWorks, Natick, MA) based on <italic>k-means</italic> clustering on PCA of the spike waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Paz et al., 2006</xref>). In order to evaluate the activity of the same cells in similar conditions during experiments, we investigated the change of the firing rate probability in the thalamus and M1 motor cortex during cerebellar DN 100 ms stimulations after saline or oxotremorine M administration was done and analyses in one continuous session. The average increase in firing rate during the stimulation was determined by computing the peristimulus time histogram (bin: 10 ms) of the spikes around the stimulation; the spike count in the histogram was divided by the duration of the stimulation and the number of stimulations administered to yield a firing rate. The acceleration of discharge due to the stimulation was taken as the average spike count during the stimulation subtracted by the baseline (taken as the 300 ms that preceded the stimulation onset). The response to stimulation was only analyzed in cells where at least one bin during the stimulation was four times larger than the standard deviation of the baseline values. To isolate in the responses the part corresponding to the direct excitation (in the same neuron for DN recordings, after one synapse in the thalamus, and after two synapses in the cortex and striatum), we also measured the discharge in 10-ms-long windows: 0–10 ms after illumination onset in the DN, 4–14 ms after illumination onset in the thalamus, and 7–17 ms in the cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistics</title><p>Figures represent the averages ± standard error of the mean (SEM). We used nonparametric tests: Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney statistics (depending on whether the measures were paired or unpaired). For factorial analysis, we used repeated-measures ANOVA. The statistical values were computed in Python using the modules SciPy (version 1.5.4), statsmodels (version 0.12.2), and scikit_posthocs (version 0.6.1). Boxplots are composed of a box that extends from the first quartile to the third quartile of the data, with a line at the median. The whiskers extend from the box by 1.5× the interquartile range, and data values falling outside the range of the whiskers are represented individually.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Funding acquisition, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Information on Gnal<sup>+/-</sup> mice are all provided in the Materials and Methods section.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Functional abnormalities in the cerebello-thalamic pathways in an animal model of dystonia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Freek Hoebeek, PhD (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further at this time.</p><p>The Reviewers and Editors agreed that investigating a role for cerebello-thalamic function within the context of dystonia was interesting and exciting, and they all appreciated use of optogenetic approaches in a mouse model of dystonia to begin to address this question in a mechanistic way. Unfortunately, the Reviewers agreed that substantial additional experiments would be required. These were expected to take more than a few months, with uncertain outcome. Therefore, we are unable to proceed toward publication. However, due to the overall enthusiasm for the work that was shared by the Reviewers and Editors, should you be able to address the concerns raised by the reviewers, we are open to the possibility of receiving a new submission in the future.</p><p>The points of concern were:</p><p>1. Further analysis/ verification to tighten the links between the LCN-CL<sup>-</sup>striatum was requested by all three reviewers and was seen as fundamental.</p><p>2. Further analysis of apparent gender differences was requested by two reviewers.</p><p>3. The relatively small effect of the theta burst stimulation tempered the enthusiasm for its putative therapeutic relevance.</p><p>4. There were issues with writing and presentation that were raised by all three Reviewers. It was generally thought that a tightening of the language may help clarify some of the missing mechanistic links.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors investigated how the cerebellar output from lateral nuclei affects neuronal firing in the ventrolateral (VL) and centrolateral (CL) nuclei of the thalamus and the primary motor cortex (M1) in wildtype and Gnal+/- mice. Using standard optogenetics the authors stimulate neurons in the lateral cerebellar nuclei (LCN) with theta frequency and record the changes in electrophysiology and behavior. They do so before and after the administration of oxotremorine, which in Gnal+/- induces dystonic behavior. Since systemic administration of this muscarinic cholinergic agonist, as well as its application to the basal ganglia but not to the cerebellum, induces dystonic events, the authors investigated whether cerebellar manipulation could influence the thalamo-cortical motor system.</p><p>Although this manuscript taps into a research questions that is of importance for a broad scope of neuroscience research fields (cerebellar, thalamo-cortical, striatal, dystonic, developmental disorders, etc), in its current form this manuscript is in my opinion not ready for publication, because mechanistically the gain of the current manuscript seems limited. However, with the standardized methodology more insights can be provided on the biological principles underlying the cerebellar impact on the other parts of the dystonic motor system.</p><p>My comments all concern the need for more recordings or anatomical analysis:</p><p>1) Throughout the dystonia research a lot of emphasis has been put on the striatum – this forms the basis of the current paper. However, even though (in my opinion) technically possible, the authors did not record from the striatum. This makes that one of the primary output regions of the CL thalamus is not investigated. Yet, the authors did record in the primary output region of the VL, being the primary motor cortex (M1). The manuscript would gain a lot of insight if the comparison between the major outputs of VL and CL (M1 and striatum, respectively) would be investigated. Moreover, such additional recordings could also provide some clues as to why the difference between WT and Gnal+/- in responses to LCN stimulation before vs after theta stimulation is not significant, whereas this is significant for VL and M1 (Figure 3D). I would have expected that the plasticity of the cerebello-thalamic circuit is particularly effective on the most direct connection between the cerebellum, being the CL<sup>-</sup>-&gt;striatum tract.</p><p>2) The authors report the effect of theta stimulation of LCN on thalamic and M1 spiking patterns as well as behavior, but not on cerebellar spiking patterns. This is of major importance, since it may be that the LCN spiking pattern is altered by local theta stimulation. Any change in cerebellar spiking could have an effect on thalamic and cortical activity, as well as on behavior. In a similar fashion the authors should investigate the impact of oxotremorine on spiking patterns of LCN in their experimental setting.</p><p>3) The authors show that the responses in VL and CL thalamic neurons upon 2 trains of theta frequency stimulation in the LCN stimulation are different. In a rather isolated report, Aumann et al., 2000 (Neurosci lett) reported that high frequency stimulation of cerebello-thalamic axons induced long-term potentiation of these synapses. A histological examination of the tissue of the current study could also provide clues as to whether the potentiation and depression have a synaptic base or are rather intrinsic. Moreover, these additional readouts provide valuable clues about whether the alterations in cerebello-thalamic functioning may be partially due to structural alterations. Hereto the authors could choose to use the tissue transfected with AAV2.1, or use classical neurochemical tracers (such as used by Teune et al., 2000, Brain Res).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Margarint et al. provide an interesting study of the role of cerebello-thalamic projections on modulating a striatal mouse model of dystonia. Understanding how key motor areas, such as the basal ganglia and cerebellum, interact to produce disease-related motor dysfunction is an important area of inquiry and the present study addresses the problem head-on. There are several areas, however, by which the study could be improved. A major concern is that the language used in the manuscript is unclear in many instances and obfuscates the findings and the experimental design. In addition, there is an interchangeable use of qualitative (mild, strong, major etc) and quantitative (significant) descriptors of the included results which sometimes makes evaluation of the data difficult, particularly as one is reading through the Results section.</p><p>Overall, it is not entirely clear from the introduction what the main motivation of the study actually is. However, later on in the Discussion, the authors state &quot;If cerebellar dysfunction may disrupt basal ganglia function, the reverse has received little attention so far&quot;. I would suggest moving this to the introduction, and further building out the idea from the outset.</p><p>From a technical perspective, there needs to be a resolution of the male and female difference seen in the behavior and whether that difference is meaningful to the physiology data that are reported. The starting point may be to increase the (n) in Figure 1 experiments. If the motor differences persist in an adequately powered experiment, then having sufficient cells to evaluate the electrophysiologic differences between males and females would be a necessary step to undertake.</p><p>The authors ought to include histology verifying the DN-VAL/CL projections that are assumed to underlie the optogenetic modification of the oxotremorine phenotype in the Gnal animals. (please see specific comments for further details).</p><p>152-162: Given the extensive connectivity of the cerebellar nuclei to subcortical structures, histology showing whether synapses from AAV injected neurons are present in VAL and CL would be important to include.</p><p>Figure 2C: Please provide much higher power images for the lesion sites.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Authors presented an interesting paper on the cerebello-thalamal dysfunction in an animal model of dystonia (DYT25) and theta burst stimulation at the cerebellar nuclei could alleviate the dystonic symptoms, which might have potential clinical implications. While this manuscript is interesting, there are numbers of concerns:</p><p>1. There are gender differences in disease phenotype at baseline (Figure 1); however, it is not clear whether the gender difference also affects cerebello-thalamal physiology, responses to oxotremorine, and responses to cerebellar stimulation. Gender differences may need to be investigated throughout the manuscript.</p><p>2. Thalamic CL has the most obvious physiological changes in both WT and mutant mouse line upon oxotremorine administration. However, cerebellar stimulation is at the dentate nucleus. Does dentate nucleus have direct connectivity to CL?</p><p>3. As author mentioned, oxotremorine mostly acts upon striatum to induce dystonia in this mouse model based on the previous work, how does the altered striatal activity drive cerebello-thalamal abnormal activity to cause dystonia? The hypothesis needs to be clearly stated and directly tested. And what is the structural and expression pattern of GNAL throughout the brain. Is there any DCN or CL expression?</p><p>4. The main clinical implication for the manuscript is theta burst stimulation can reduce dystonic movement (Figure 4B). However, the degree of reduction is very minor (perhaps 10% only).

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The points of concern were:</p><p>1. Further analysis/ verification to tighten the links between the LCN-CL<sup>-</sup>striatum was requested by all three reviewers and was seen as fundamental.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed new experiments in order to address these requests. We have obtained specific infection of the DN-CL pathway by using a retrograde AAV expressing ChR2 injected in CL. (ADdgene <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.addgene.org/26973/">pAAV-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP</ext-link> ref 26973). We then proceeded to record extracellular activity from DN and dorsolateral striatum (DLS) during optogenetic stimulations of the DN. First, the presence of infected neurons in the contralateral DN from retrograde injections from CL demonstrated that anatomical projections exist from the deep cerebellar nuclei to the CL. Following stimulations of the DN, we observed short latency excitatory responses in DLS coherent with a di-synaptic projection from the dentate nucleus. We not only observed these responses but also examined how they were changed by theta-burst stimulations. Interestingly, we found that the response in fast-spiking neurons was primarily affected. These new results are presented in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Further analysis of apparent gender differences was requested by two reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional behavioral experiments in order to evaluate possible gender differences in WT or Gnal+/- mice. The results of the tests (Vertical pole test, Horizontal bar test, Grid Test, Fixed speed rotarod, Gait test, Average speed, and distance travelled during an openfield session) are shown in Figure 1. Overall, both genders performed similarly on the different motor assessments, in both genotypes. We found one exception for the horizontal bar, where WT females performed better than males. We postulate that in our hands, the horizontal bar test might involve other components affecting the motor performance, such as anxiety or motivation, but could not impute our differences directly to gender due to the difference only being present in WT females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The relatively small effect of the theta burst stimulation tempered the enthusiasm for its putative therapeutic relevance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the amplitude of the effect remains modest. Yet, the scale of improvement in most intervention in patients (Oyama and Hattori, 2021) remains in the same order of magnitude (except for tremor symptoms), and cerebellar theta stimulations using rTMS result in a clinical improvement of 15% of dystonia symptoms (Koch et al., 2014; Bradnam et al., 2016), which may improve the quality of life score in comparable amounts with botulinium toxin injections (Bradnam et al., 2016). Finally, the benefit was observed after a single session in our model, while in patients this may not be sufficient to produce beneficial effect (Linssen et al., 2015; Meunier et al., 2015). However, in our model, dystonia is induced by pharmacological injections which also have side effects that might build-up upon repeated sessions. Using old (&gt;1 yr) animals (which develop spontaneous dystonia symptoms but are harder to get and could thus not be used in our study) might be more relevant to test the effect of repeated stimulation sessions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There were issues with writing and presentation that were raised by all three Reviewers. It was generally thought that a tightening of the language may help clarify some of the missing mechanistic links.</p></disp-quote><p>We extensively revised the whole manuscript for improved clarity. In particular, we now refer to the altered cerebello-thalamic excitability as a potential endophenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors investigated how the cerebellar output from lateral nuclei affects neuronal firing in the ventrolateral (VL) and centrolateral (CL) nuclei of the thalamus and the primary motor cortex (M1) in wildtype and Gnal+/- mice. Using standard optogenetics the authors stimulate neurons in the lateral cerebellar nuclei (LCN) with theta frequency and record the changes in electrophysiology and behavior. They do so before and after the administration of oxotremorine, which in Gnal+/- induces dystonic behavior. Since systemic administration of this muscarinic cholinergic agonist, as well as its application to the basal ganglia but not to the cerebellum, induces dystonic events, the authors investigated whether cerebellar manipulation could influence the thalamo-cortical motor system.</p><p>Although this manuscript taps into a research questions that is of importance for a broad scope of neuroscience research fields (cerebellar, thalamo-cortical, striatal, dystonic, developmental disorders, etc), in its current form this manuscript is in my opinion not ready for publication, because mechanistically the gain of the current manuscript seems limited. However, with the standardized methodology more insights can be provided on the biological principles underlying the cerebellar impact on the other parts of the dystonic motor system.</p><p>My comments all concern the need for more recordings or anatomical analysis:</p><p>1) Throughout the dystonia research a lot of emphasis has been put on the striatum – this forms the basis of the current paper. However, even though (in my opinion) technically possible, the authors did not record from the striatum. This makes that one of the primary output regions of the CL thalamus is not investigated. Yet, the authors did record in the primary output region of the VL, being the primary motor cortex (M1). The manuscript would gain a lot of insight if the comparison between the major outputs of VL and CL (M1 and striatum, respectively) would be investigated. Moreover, such additional recordings could also provide some clues as to why the difference between WT and Gnal+/- in responses to LCN stimulation before vs after theta stimulation is not significant, whereas this is significant for VL and M1 (Figure 3D). I would have expected that the plasticity of the cerebello-thalamic circuit is particularly effective on the most direct connection between the cerebellum, being the CL<sup>-</sup>-&gt;striatum tract.</p></disp-quote><p>The CL remains a structure difficult to target in vivo due to its small mediolateral extension in the mouse. Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have further investigated the DN-CL<sup>-</sup>Striatum pathway, we directly targeted the DN-CL pathway by optogenetic stimulations of DN neurons retrogradely infected from the CL area, and recording the neuronal responses in the striatum. We found indeed in these experiments some cells in the striatum which are excited by the DN with a short latency, although the increase in discharge remained modest. Then we investigated the impact of theta-burst stimulation and found that it differentially evoked responses changes in the striatum (mostly for fast spiking striatal neurons) in WT vs Gnal+/- mice. Overall, the changes in the striatal activity evoked by theta-burst stimulations are congruent with those found in the CL. These results are presented in a novel Figure 4. We feel however that it remains difficult to compare the amplitude of plasticity in the DN-CL<sup>-</sup>striatum vs DN-VAL-M1, given the signal/noise ratio of its measure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors report the effect of theta stimulation of LCN on thalamic and M1 spiking patterns as well as behavior, but not on cerebellar spiking patterns. This is of major importance, since it may be that the LCN spiking pattern is altered by local theta stimulation. Any change in cerebellar spiking could have an effect on thalamic and cortical activity, as well as on behavior. In a similar fashion the authors should investigate the impact of oxotremorine on spiking patterns of LCN in their experimental setting.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed theta-burst optogenetic stimulations of the DN and recorded from those cells. We observe during theta-burst stimulations in WT mice, an entrainment of DN neurons to the frequency of stimulation, but a return to a baseline FR at the end of the theta protocol. Hence, the theta burst stimulations do not induce a lasting change in the firing pattern of DN neurons nor change in response to the optogenetic stimulations. These results are presented in figure 4B-D and Supplementary Figure 3.</p><p>Oxotremorine produces a drop in DN neurons firing rate in both WT and Gnal+/-</p><p>(Supplementary Figure 4). It is likely that this drop in firing rate in DN neurons is partially due to the diminution of locomotor activity induced by the cholinergic shock. Notably, we did not observe a strong increase in DN firing irregularity; this differs substantially from other rodent model of dystonia possibly since these other models have an induction of the symptoms caused by cerebellar anomalies, while in Gnal+/- mice, oxotremorine injection in the striatum suffices to trigger dystonia. This is discussed in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors show that the responses in VL and CL thalamic neurons upon 2 trains of theta frequency stimulation in the LCN stimulation are different. In a rather isolated report, Aumann et al., 2000 (Neurosci lett) reported that high frequency stimulation of cerebello-thalamic axons induced long-term potentiation of these synapses. A histological examination of the tissue of the current study could also provide clues as to whether the potentiation and depression have a synaptic base or are rather intrinsic. Moreover, these additional readouts provide valuable clues about whether the alterations in cerebello-thalamic functioning may be partially due to structural alterations. Hereto the authors could choose to use the tissue transfected with AAV2.1, or use classical neurochemical tracers (such as used by Teune et al., 2000, Brain Res).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Unfortunately, our approach failed to provide an accurate assessment of the density or size of the axonal varicosities, which would document the anatomical counterpart to our findings. We have added a reference to Aumann’s work in the text. We agree that our study prompts further examination of the plasticity since we could not more determine whether the potentiation results from an increased cerebello-thalamic synaptic transmission or an increased excitability of the post-synaptic thalamic neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Margarint et al. provide an interesting study of the role of cerebello-thalamic projections on modulating a striatal mouse model of dystonia. Understanding how key motor areas, such as the basal ganglia and cerebellum, interact to produce disease-related motor dysfunction is an important area of inquiry and the present study addresses the problem head-on. There are several areas, however, by which the study could be improved. A major concern is that the language used in the manuscript is unclear in many instances and obfuscates the findings and the experimental design. In addition, there is an interchangeable use of qualitative (mild, strong, major etc) and quantitative (significant) descriptors of the included results which sometimes makes evaluation of the data difficult, particularly as one is reading through the Results section.</p><p>Overall, it is not entirely clear from the introduction what the main motivation of the study actually is. However, later on in the Discussion, the authors state &quot;If cerebellar dysfunction may disrupt basal ganglia function, the reverse has received little attention so far&quot;. I would suggest moving this to the introduction, and further building out the idea from the outset.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising our attention on these multiple problems. The manuscript has therefore been extensively rewritten.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From a technical perspective, there needs to be a resolution of the male and female difference seen in the behavior and whether that difference is meaningful to the physiology data that are reported. The starting point may be to increase the (n) in Figure 1 experiments. If the motor differences persist in an adequately powered experiment, then having sufficient cells to evaluate the electrophysiologic differences between males and females would be a necessary step to undertake.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional experiments allowed us to verify that, with a sufficient number of mice, male and female do not exhibit difference on behavioral tests, except for the horizontal bar test, but even in that case, the mutation of GNAL did not affect the behavior of males or females. There was therefore no indication of a differential sensitivity to the GNAL mutation between genders.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors ought to include histology verifying the DN-VAL/CL projections that are assumed to underlie the optogenetic modification of the oxotremorine phenotype in the Gnal animals. (please see specific comments for further details).</p></disp-quote><p>This is addressed in the new figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>152-162: Given the extensive connectivity of the cerebellar nuclei to subcortical structures, histology showing whether synapses from AAV injected neurons are present in VAL and CL would be important to include.</p></disp-quote><p>The presence of synapses in VAL and CL has been widely documented (a few references have been added, notably (Gornati et al., 2018)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C: Please provide much higher power images for the lesion sites.</p></disp-quote><p>Histological images are provided in Supplementary figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Authors presented an interesting paper on the cerebello-thalamal dysfunction in an animal model of dystonia (DYT25) and theta burst stimulation at the cerebellar nuclei could alleviate the dystonic symptoms, which might have potential clinical implications. While this manuscript is interesting, there are numbers of concerns:</p><p>1. There are gender differences in disease phenotype at baseline (Figure 1); however, it is not clear whether the gender difference also affects cerebello-thalamal physiology, responses to oxotremorine, and responses to cerebellar stimulation. Gender differences may need to be investigated throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by another reviewer, the number of male/female mice used on the previous version of the manuscript was limited; this has prompted a new series of animals which showed no differential sensitivity of male and female Gnal+/- mice to the mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Thalamic CL has the most obvious physiological changes in both WT and mutant mouse line upon oxotremorine administration. However, cerebellar stimulation is at the dentate nucleus. Does dentate nucleus have direct connectivity to CL?</p></disp-quote><p>The anatomical and physiological direct connections have been demonstrated previously (Ichinoe et al. 2000, Chen 2014). Furthermore, in a new set of experiments we combined retrograde infections from the CL to express ChR2 in the DN, with illumination of the DN and recording in the dorso-lateral striatum. We observed short-latency responses in some DLS neurons, consistent with functional di-synaptic DN-CL<sup>-</sup>DLS pathway. This is more clearly explained in the text and references to the existing literature have been completed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. As author mentioned, oxotremorine mostly acts upon striatum to induce dystonia in this mouse model based on the previous work, how does the altered striatal activity drive cerebello-thalamal abnormal activity to cause dystonia? The hypothesis needs to be clearly stated and directly tested. And what is the structural and expression pattern of GNAL throughout the brain. Is there any DCN or CL expression?</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the introduction to improve the motivation of our study. Reference to the characterization of the GNAL expression has been added (Belluscio et al., 1998; Vemula et al., 2013). GNAL expression is strongly expressed in the striatum (and involved in striatal transmission). It is also expressed in the cerebellar Purkinje cell, but we are not aware of studies demonstrating its function in these cells. In several rodent models of dystonia, the cerebellar nuclei neurons express an anomalously irregular firing in the cerebellar nuclei which has been proposed to cause the dystonic attack via a transmission to the striatum (Chen et al. 2014). We added recordings in the DN, which do not show increased irregularity of the DN neurons in Gnal+/- mice. Therefore, we do not believe that the cerebellum causes the dystonic movements, but instead that the changes in the cerebello-thalamic excitability reflects maladaptive reaction to the anomalies of the basal-ganglia output.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The main clinical implication for the manuscript is theta burst stimulation can reduce dystonic movement (Figure 4B). However, the degree of reduction is very minor (perhaps 10% only). Therefore, the clinical utility is in question and whether this could be used in the future clinical trial is unknown.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the amplitude of the effect is moderate; yet similar values have been obtained in patients and still represent an improvement of life quality. Moreover, we only used a single session of stimulations, and repeated treatments have been shown in patients to increase the size effect (although it is still unclear if the mechanisms involved in our DN stimulations and in clinical transcranial stimulations are similar).
