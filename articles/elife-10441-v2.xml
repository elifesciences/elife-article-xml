understood. Amines are also potent odors, with some activating olfactory trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Here, we report that teleost TAARs evolved a new way to recognize amines in a non-classical orientation. Chemical screens de-orphaned eleven zebrafish TAARs, with agonists including serotonin, histamine, tryptamine, 2-phenylethylamine, putrescine, and agmatine. Receptors from different clades contact ligands through aspartates on transmembrane α-helices III (canonical Asp<sup>3.32</sup>) or V (non-canonical Asp<sup>5.42</sup>), and diamine receptors contain both aspartates. Non-classical monoamine recognition evolved in two steps: an ancestral TAAR acquired Asp<sup>5.42</sup>, gaining diamine sensitivity, and subsequently lost Asp<sup>3.32</sup>. Through this transformation, the fish olfactory system dramatically expanded its capacity to detect amines, ecologically significant aquatic odors. The evolution of a second, alternative solution for amine detection by olfactory receptors highlights the tremendous structural versatility intrinsic to GPCRs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10441.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10441.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10441.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many organisms make molecules called biogenic amines. These molecules, which include the human hormones adrenaline and histamine, have important roles in regulating the biology and behaviour of many animals. Some biogenic amines bind to receptor proteins called GPCRs on the surface of cells. Many drugs can affect the activity of GPCRs, so understanding how different GPCRs work is an important goal of the pharmaceutical industry. Like all proteins, GPCRs are made of chains of molecules called amino acids. The GPCRs that can detect biogenic amines use a particular amino acid named Asp<sup>3.32</sup>, and when this amino acid is mutated, these GPCRs become unable to bind to their target amine.</p><p>Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are a type of GPCR that are found in many animals to detect odors. Most TAARs in mammals contain the Asp<sup>3.32</sup> residue, and recognize amine odors. However, many fish TAARs do not contain Asp<sup>3.32</sup>, and it was not clear what molecules these fish receptors detect.</p><p>Here Li et al. find that these fish TAARs also recognize amines, and use a different amino acid called Asp<sup>5.42</sup>. Also, some TAARs contain both Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and Asp<sup>5.42</sup>, and recognize chemicals with two amines named diamines. Some diamines that bind to TAARs are foul smelling odors; for example, cadaverine and putrescine are repulsive smells emitted by decomposing flesh. In total, the experiments identified amines that can bind to eleven zebrafish TAARs that previously had no odor partner.</p><p>Li et al. propose that some fish TAARs lost the Asp<sup>3.32</sup> during the course of evolution to leave the Asp<sup>5.42</sup> as the main interaction site for amines. This change dramatically altered how these TAARs interact with amines, which probably expanded the number of different amines that fish can detect. These findings open up new ways to study how the fish brain processes information about its surroundings.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10441.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10441.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>G Protein-Coupled Receptor</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>ligand recognition</kwd><kwd>molecular evolution</kwd><kwd>odorant receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DC013289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liberles</surname><given-names>Stephen D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fish trace amine-associated receptors evolved a novel structural motif that enables the detection of chemically diverse amine odors in a non-canonical 'inverted' orientation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biogenic amines are key intercellular signaling molecules that regulate physiology and behavior. In vertebrates, biogenic amines include adrenaline, serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, and dopamine, and these biogenic amines can be detected by G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) expressed on the plasma membrane of target cells. The biochemical and structural basis for biogenic amine recognition by GPCRs is well understood and involves an essential salt bridge between the ligand amino group and a highly conserved aspartic acid on the third transmembrane α-helix of the receptor (Asp<sup>3.32</sup>; Ballesteros-Weinstein indexing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Katritch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shi and Javitch, 2002</xref>). Mutation of Asp<sup>3.32</sup> in adrenaline, serotonin, acetylcholine, histamine, and dopamine receptors eliminates amine recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shi and Javitch, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Surgand et al., 2006</xref>), and GPCRs that recognize amines through another motif have not been identified.</p><p>Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are a family of vertebrate GPCRs distantly related to biogenic amine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liberles, 2015</xref>). There are 15 TAARs in mouse, 6 in human, and 112 in zebrafish, and in these or related species, all TAARs except TAAR1 function as olfactory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Horowitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hussain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liberles and Buck, 2006</xref>). All human TAARs (6/6), most mouse TAARs (13/15), and some zebrafish TAARs (27/112) retain Asp<sup>3.32</sup>, suggesting that many TAARs would recognize amines. High throughput chemical screens yielded ligands for TAAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borowsky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunzow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Revel et al., 2011</xref>) and many olfactory TAARs that retain Asp<sup>3.32</sup>, including TAAR3, TAAR4, TAAR5, TAAR7s, TAAR8s, TAAR9, and TAAR13c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liberles and Buck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ferrero et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hussain et al., 2013</xref>). Each of these receptors detects different amines, some of which evoke innate olfactory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hussain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dewan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ferrero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li and Liberles, 2015</xref>). In mouse, TAAR4 detects the aversive carnivore odor 2-phenylethylamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ferrero et al., 2011</xref>), while TAAR5 detects the attractive and sexually dimorphic mouse odor trimethylamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liberles and Buck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2013</xref>).

One clade of TAARs (including TAAR1, TAAR3, and TAAR4) detects primary amines derived by amino acid decarboxylation, while a second clade (including TAAR5, TAAR7s, TAAR8s, and TAAR9) prefers tertiary amines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ferrero et al., 2012</xref>). Structural models and mutagenesis studies of TAAR1, TAAR7e, and TAAR7f predicted that ligand binding occurs in the membrane plane, Asp<sup>3.32</sup> forms a salt bridge to the ligand amino group, and other transmembrane residues provide a scaffold that supports ligand binding and enables selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ferrero et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Reese et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A third TAAR clade (clade III TAARs) arose in fish, and includes the majority (87/112) of zebrafish TAARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hussain et al., 2009</xref>). Most clade III TAARs lack Asp<sup>3.32</sup> (85/87), and it has been proposed that these receptors may not detect amines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hussain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liberles, 2014</xref>). However, ligands have not been identified for any of these receptors. More generally, ligands are known for only one zebrafish TAAR, TAAR13c, which retains Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and detects the carrion odor cadaverine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hussain et al., 2013</xref>). Structure-activity analysis revealed that TAAR13c preferentially recognizes odd-chained, medium-sized diamines, and likely contains two distinct cation recognition sites within the ligand-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hussain et al., 2013</xref>). However, the structural basis for diamine recognition by TAAR13c was unknown.</p><p>Here, we find that TAAR13c recognizes cadaverine through two remote transmembrane aspartic acids, Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and Asp<sup>5.42</sup>. A TAAR13c variant with a charge-neutralizing mutation at Asp<sup>5.42</sup> has an altered ligand preference for monoamines rather than diamines. We propose that Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and Asp<sup>5.42</sup> together form a general di-cation recognition motif, and note this motif to be present in several zebrafish, mouse, and human TAARs. Surprisingly, Asp<sup>5.42</sup> is retained in 84 out of 85 zebrafish TAARs that lack Asp<sup>3.32</sup>, raising the possibility that these receptors recognize amines positioned in a non-canonical inverted orientation with the amino group pointing towards transmembrane α-helix V. Using a high throughput chemical screening approach, we identified ligands for eleven additional zebrafish TAARs, and found that different receptors detect amines through salt bridge contacts at Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and/or Asp<sup>5.42</sup>. TAAR10a, TAAR10b, TAAR12h, and TAAR12i are Asp<sup>3.32</sup>-containing clade I TAARs that detect serotonin, tryptamine, 2-phenylethylamine, and 3-methoxytyramine, while TAAR16c, TAAR16e, and TAAR16f are Asp<sup>5.42</sup>-containing clade III TAARs that detect <italic>N</italic>-methylpiperidine, <italic>N,N</italic>-dimethylcyclohexylamine, and isoamylamine. TAAR13a, TAAR13d, TAAR13e, and TAAR14d have both Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and Asp<sup>5.42</sup>, and recognize the di-cationic molecules putrescine, histamine, and agmatine.</p><p>Based on these findings, we propose that a large clade of olfactory GPCRs evolved a novel way to detect amines that involves a non-classical salt bridge to transmembrane α-helix V. Furthermore, new TAAR ligands include several biogenic amines for which other receptors were identified, including serotonin, histamine, and 2-phenylethylamine. These findings illustrate that different members of the GPCR superfamily can evolve divergent ligand binding pockets for recognition of the same agonist.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two remote amine recognition sites in the cadaverine receptor</title><p>To gain structural insights into diamine recognition by the cadaverine receptor TAAR13c, we generated a TAAR13c homology model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) based on the X-ray crystal structure of agonist-bound β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor (Protein Data Bank Entry 4LDE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ring et al., 2013</xref>). The β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor is the closest homolog (33% amino acid identity) of TAAR13c for which an active-state structure is currently available. The homology model of TAAR13c indicated a canonical fold of seven transmembrane α-helices with ligand bound at the core. Using the homology model, we performed computational docking of cadaverine to the orthosteric binding site. One cadaverine amino group of the docked ligand was located near Asp112<sup>3.32</sup>, which corresponds to the highly conserved amine-contact site in biogenic amine receptors. The other cadaverine amino group was positioned at the opposing end of the ligand-binding pocket, 3 Å away from another aspartate, Asp202<sup>5.42</sup>. The second amino group was also within 5 Å of side chains from Thr203<sup>5.43</sup> and Ser276<sup>6.55</sup>, Leu192 and Phe194 on extracellular loop 2, and the backbone of Ser199<sup>5.39</sup> (additional nearby residues are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on its proximity and charge, Asp202<sup>5.42</sup> was deemed a prime candidate to function as a counterion that forms a salt bridge to the second cadaverine amino group.

As previously published with this paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hussain et al., 2013</xref>), cadaverine robustly activated TAAR13c, with a half maximal response occurring at ~10 μM.

Thus, charge-neutralizing mutation of Asp<sup>5.42</sup> transformed TAAR13c from a diamine receptor into a monoamine receptor. The altered ligand-binding preference of the TAAR13c<sup>D202A</sup> mutant suggests that Asp<sup>5.42</sup> contributes directly to the ligand-binding pocket, and homology modeling of TAAR13c<sup>D202A</sup> bound to 3-methoxytyramine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) supports a direct interaction between this site and ligand.

In mouse and rat, two TAAR7s have conservative changes of Asp<sup>3.32</sup> to Glu<sup>3.32</sup>; the effect of this substitution is unknown as ligands have not been found for Glu<sup>3.32</sup>-containing TAARs. A small number of mammalian TAARs have an aspartate at position 5.43 including two in humans (TAAR6, TAAR8), mice (TAAR6, TAAR8b), and rats (TAAR6, TAAR8a). Sequence alignments indicate that Asp<sup>5.43</sup> of these receptors corresponds to Asp<sup>5.42</sup> of TAAR13c, and Asp<sup>5.43</sup> may be similarly positioned in the agonist-binding pocket. These mammalian TAARs are candidates to function as diamine receptors; however, ligands have not been identified for these receptors, perhaps due to difficulties in achieving their functional expression in heterologous cells. Mice lack a TAAR13c ortholog, yet a role for other TAARs in diamine recognition is supported by the finding that mice lacking all olfactory TAARs fail to avoid cadaverine odor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dewan et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the zebrafish TAAR repertoire surprisingly revealed that in contrast to mammalian TAARs and biogenic amine receptors, the vast majority of zebrafish TAARs (91/112) have an aspartate at position 5.42.

Extensive gene duplication and mutation expanded and diversified clade III TAARs, leading to a large clade of olfactory receptors with non-canonical amine-detection properties.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10441.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10441.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-10441-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig6s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10441.016</object-id><label>Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Re-engineering the amine contact site of HTR6.</title><p>HEK-293 cells were co-transfected with <italic>Cre-Seap</italic> and plasmids encoding HTR6 or an HTR6 double mutant (D<sup>3.32</sup>A; A<sup>5.42</sup>D), incubated with ligands (0, 10 or 100 μM), and assayed for phosphatase activity (mean ± sem, n = 3, *p &lt;. 05, **p &lt;. 01 based on one-way ANOVA analysis and Dunnett’s test to compare controls and ligand-activated responses).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10441.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10441.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-10441-fig6-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Sensory receptors define the capacity of an organism to perceive its external environment. Olfactory and taste receptor families can rapidly evolve, with dramatic species-specific variations in repertoire size and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nei et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shi and Zhang, 2007</xref>). In some lineages, receptor families can be reduced or die out, such as vomeronasal receptors in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang and Webb, 2003</xref>) or sweet receptors in carnivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>), while in other lineages new receptor families can be born, such as formyl peptide receptors in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liberles et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rivière et al., 2009</xref>). Functional evolution of chemoreceptor families often involves a pattern of gene duplication and subsequent mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ferrero et al., 2012</xref>), although isolated functional transformations can also occur, such as taste receptor re-purposing in hummingbirds that led to a novel receptor for sugars found in nectar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baldwin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Fish are aquatic animals, and efficient detection of water-soluble odors such as amines is important for their ecological niche. Zebrafish generally use the same families of olfactory receptors as other vertebrates, including odorant receptors, vomeronasal receptors, and TAARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kermen et al., 2013</xref>). The TAAR repertoire in mice and humans is relatively small, representing 1–2% of all main olfactory receptors. However, zebrafish have comparable numbers of TAARs (112) and odorant receptors (143), and expansion of the teleost TAAR family suggests a relatively expanded role for TAARs in fish chemosensation. However, prior to this study, ligands were known for only one fish TAAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hussain, et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the vast majority of zebrafish TAARs lack the canonical amine recognition motif, and the classes of ligands they might detect were unknown. Here, we show that almost all zebrafish TAARs (111/112) contain either a canonical amine-detection site on transmembrane α-helix III (Asp<sup>3.32</sup>), a non-canonical amine-detection site on transmembrane α-helix V (Asp<sup>5.42</sup>), or both. Thus, teleost TAARs likely represent a very large family of diverse amine receptors.</p><p>Several zebrafish TAAR ligands are biogenic amines produced during tissue decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shalaby, 1996</xref>). Cadaverine, histamine, agmatine, putrescine, tryptamine, 2-phenylethylamine, and isoamylamine are derived in one step from the natural amino acids lysine, histidine, arginine, ornithine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and leucine by microbe-mediated decarboxylation. Levels of each of these amines are measured in commercially sold fish as indicators of food quality and freshness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shalaby, 1996</xref>); for example, excessive histamine in consumed fish causes human scombroid poisoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morrow et al., 1991</xref>). While some of these biogenic amines are aversive to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dewan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ferrero et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wisman and Shrira, 2015</xref>), they are reported to evoke variable behaviors in different fish species. For example, agmatine, putrescine, and cadaverine increase feeding-associated pecking behavior in goldfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rolen, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hara, 2006</xref>) while cadaverine and putrescine evoke avoidance behavior in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hussain et al., 2013</xref>). Future studies are needed to examine the roles of each TAAR and its ligands in fish behavior.</p><p>The evolution of divergent solutions to the problem of amine detection by GPCRs reveals the extensive landscape of change possible within the GPCR superfamily. Here, we propose a two-step model for the functional evolution of clade III TAARs that is based on phylogenetic analysis, ligand identification studies, structural modeling, and mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). First, an ancestral clade I TAAR gained Asp<sup>5.42</sup>, and thus the ability to recognize di-cationic chemicals like diamines. Ligands were identified for five zebrafish TAARs that retain Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and Asp<sup>5.42</sup>, and both aspartates are important for ligand recognition in each receptor. Second, a diamine receptor lost Asp<sup>3.32</sup>, leading to clade III TAARs that display non-classical monoamine recognition through a transmembrane α-helix V salt bridge to Asp<sup>5.42</sup>.</p><p>Flipping the amine orientation dramatically changes GPCR-ligand contacts, and presumably allows clade III TAARs to sample a distinct repertoire of structurally divergent amine odors. Once the new amine recognition motif was established, clade III TAARs dramatically expanded through a pattern of gene duplication and subsequent mutation. It seems likely that the massive expansion of this olfactory receptor clade increased the capacity of the fish olfactory system to detect amines, which are water-soluble and ecologically important stimuli for aquatic animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning of receptor genes</title><p>Zebrafish <italic>Taar</italic> genes were cloned from zebrafish genomic DNA (AB strain), and inserted into a modified pcDNA3.1<sup>-</sup> (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) vector containing a 5’ DNA extension encoding the first 20 amino acids of bovine rhodopsin followed by a cloning linker (GCGGCCGCC).

The manuscript has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor (Jeremy Nathans), and three expert reviewers, and their assessments, together with my own (Reviewing Editor), form the basis of this letter. I am including the three reviews (lightly edited) at the end of this letter, as there are some specific and useful suggestions in them that will not be repeated in the summary here.</p><p>All of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work. The reviewers and I also think that a few additional (and incisive) tests of the model for ligand recognition, using site-directed mutagenesis and functional testing, would greatly strengthen the paper.

They conducted a screening to de-orphan zebrafish TAARs, a major olfactory receptor family in this species, using an established cAMP-mediated reporter gene assay to measure activation in the receptors. They cloned 63 TAARs, about half of the TAARs in the species, and tested against a panel of odorants almost exclusively focusing on amines. They successfully identified active ligands for nine (14%) TAARs, and substantially increased the number of fish TAARs that match with ligands.</p><p>The authors conducted nice structure-function analyses focusing on two Asp sites in transmembrane 3 and 5 in combination with structural modeling, and showed that these sites are critical for amine recognition by the tested receptors. Curiously, while the TM3 site is conserved in non-olfactory GPCRs responding to amines, the TM5 site is unique to TAARs. TAAR13 members responding to diamines contain both Asp residues. The authors propose that this new TM5 Asp site expanded the ability to detect amines in fish evolution.</p><p>The experiments were rigorously conducted and data analyses were technically solid. However, my concern is that the authors have stretched to discuss evolution of fish TAARs based on the function of a relatively small number of receptors from only one species, which inevitably requires too many assumptions.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) Despite the authors' screening effort with &gt;60 cloned TAARs, the vast majority of the receptors remain orphan. I wonder if the authors did not test with the right chemicals, or the heterologous expression system used in this study was not efficient (or both). I am concerned if preferred ligands of many class III TAARs are non-amines that the authors did not include for the screening, which would change how to explain Class III evolution. On the other hand, the authors could miss ligands for many TAARs because of difficulty in functional expression in the heterologous system.</p><p>2) While I agree with the authors that the de-orphaned receptors would respond to the tested ligand in vivo, what is not clear is how many other receptors would respond to these chemicals, and whether the identified TAARs represent high-affinity receptors for the ligands. These are relevant issues when discussing how evolution shapes specific residues of TAARs.</p><p>3) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Asp<sup>5.42</sup> is widely conserved in clade III TAARs” you state that &quot;TAAR13s represent an evolutionary bridge between clade I and clade III TAARs in zebrafish.&quot; It is unclear what &quot;evolutionary bridge&quot; means. Among the fish species the authors show, TAAR13s are unique to zebrafish, raising the concern how TAAR13 members represent as a bridge.</p><p>4) I think it is equally possible that the Asp<sup>3.32</sup>/Asp<sup>5.42</sup> receptor represents the ancestral gene, which would change the order of the proposed TAAR evolution. I'm not sure there's a way to distinguish between these two alternatives (and certainly not with the available data) but the authors need to at least consider different possibilities.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic>This is an interesting study that seeks to understand the molecular interactions underlying ligand recognition of the trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). The TAARs are activated by primary, secondary and tertiary amines and are encoded by a small multigene family in mammals, with most of the family members expressed in olfactory sensory neurons. This particular study takes advantage of an expansion of the TAAR repertoire in zebrafish to investigate the ligand-receptor interactions underlying these receptors' chemical specificities.</p><p>The study commences with a homology model of TAAR13c, a receptor that recognizes the diamine cadaverine. Modeling TAAR13c based on the crystal structure of the β<sub>2</sub> adrenergic receptor, the authors predict direct ionic interactions of the ligand's amino groups with the negatively charged D112 (3.32) in TM3 a D202 (5.42). The interaction of the positively charged amino group with the aspartate in TM5 differentiates this diamine receptor from most other biogenic amine receptors, whose ligands typically contain a single amino group that is coordinated by the aspartate in TM3. The authors then go through a very nice series of experiments to demonstrate the necessity of D202 for activation by cadaverine (D202A mutant), presumably via coordination of one of the positively-charged amino groups since 3-methoxytyramine can activate D202A at high concentrations. These results support the hypothesis that the canonical Asp<sup>3.32</sup> coordinates the amino groups of monoamine ligands, whereas diamines such as cadaverine can only be accommodated by a second aspartate residue in TM5 (5.42).</p><p>Through a phylogenetic analysis of vertebrate TAARs, the authors identify various TAAR receptor containing Asp<sup>3.32</sup>, Asp<sup>5.42</sup>, or both. Interestingly, clade III of the zebrafish TAARs, which represent a large expansion of the family, contain only Asp<sup>5.42</sup>. In support of their model of ligand binding, only receptors possessing both aspartate residues are activated by diamine ligands. Surprisingly, a representative clade III receptor, TAAR16c) can be activated by N-methylpiperidine, a monoamine ligand, and structurally-related compounds. These observations suggest that clade III TAARs bind monoamine ligands in an inverted orientation. The authors propose a model of TAAR evolution in which diamine receptors arose from canonical monoamine receptors via addition of Asp<sup>5.42</sup>, with &quot;inverted&quot; monoamine receptors arising via mutation of Asp<sup>3.32</sup>.</p><p>Overall, I find this to be a fascinating story describing the molecular principles of ligand binding in non-canonical biogenic amine receptors with an attractive model of how the TAARs acquire their chemical specificities. I have only a few suggestions that I feel will make an excellent paper even stronger.</p><p>First, the description of the homology modeling is a bit too superficial. Additional details should be provided beyond the two highlighted residues (Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and Asp<sup>5.42</sup>). In addition, it will be important to show the docking of the cadaverine and 3-methoxytyramine in models of both the wild type and mutant receptors.

The authors might also consider the effects of substitutions of hydrophobic amino acids at D202 that could possibly interact with 1-amino pentane (one positive charge removed from the ligand).</p><p>The authors need to show more information from homology modeling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic>To reveal a ligand-binding mode of the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family expressed in the olfactory neurons in fish, Qian et al. identified ligands for previously orphan zebrafish TAARs and mutated either or both of two conserved acidic amino acids (Asp or Glu) in transmembrane domains (TMs) that were predicted to be involved in binding amino groups of ligands based on the knowledge of canonical monoamine receptors. The results of functional analysis together with phylogenetic analysis suggest that the role of Asp in TM3 in recognizing amino groups in canonical monoamine receptors has been taken over by the Asp in TM5 in many of fish TAARs. The functional assays were thoroughly done and the data are convincing.</p><p>1) In the Abstract, it is not easy to understand the meaning of 'an unusual 'inverted' orientation'. I do not think you can say it is 'unusual' because it could be said this is usual. In addition, the word 'inverted' may also lead to misunderstanding because it is not clear what is 'right orientation' and what is 'inverted'. Of course, as you read the manuscript, we can understand, but these words are not appropriate to be used in Abstract and thus should be reworded.</p><p>2) Despite what the phylogenetic tree suggests, I am not sure what is the experimental evidence to conclude that clade I TAARs in fish first gained Asp in TM5 and then lost Asp in TM3 for clade III TAARs. Also I do not understand why the Asp in TM5 version of TAARs is evolutionally advantageous in fish. Please provide careful discussion.</p><p>3) To further strengthen the conclusion, you can mutate Asp in TM5 of clade III TAARs (16c or 16f) and introduce Asp back in TM3 and see whether these receptors acquire a ligand binding ability like that of a canonical monoamine receptor type. Also you can mutate Asp in TM3 of 10a or 12h, and in a canonical monoamine receptor, and introduce Asp in TM5, and see whether they bind different ligands like those for the 16c and 16f family.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10441.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work.

First, we provide additional description of the TAAR13c homology model in the main text and methods, and also add an additional supplementary figure that illustrates other predicted ligand-receptor contact sites in the model. Based on this information, it should be evident why Asp<sup>5.42</sup> was such a prime candidate for subsequent analysis. Second, we provide a homology model for the interaction between 3-methoxytyramine and the TAAR13c D202A<sup>5.42</sup> mutant. These findings strongly support a direct contribution of Asp<sup>5.42</sup> to the ligand-binding pocket. Third, we provide additional homology models for TAAR16c (a clade III TAAR) and TAAR10a (a clade I TAAR). In these models, the ligand position in the clade III TAAR is dramatically re-oriented (or inverted) with respect to the ligand position in clade I TAARs or canonical biogenic amine receptors, as the amino group is now directed towards transmembrane α-helix 5.</p><p><italic>Second, the authors could make a stronger case for coordination of cadaverine's second amino group by Asp<sup>5.42</sup> by studying additional mutations at this position.

For example, it would be exciting if the D202K or D202R mutant recognized amino acids in place of diamines. To test this idea, we generated several D202 mutants: D202K, D202R, D202I, D202L, and D202M, in addition to the D202A mutant originally described. Unfortunately, we were unable to identify ligands for any of the new mutants among our collection of amines and amino acids. These mutants did fail to detect cadaverine, suggesting that the receptors are disrupted in some way. It is possible that there is a potential ligand that we simply lack in our chemical collection. Alternatively, it is possible that these mutations severely impair protein folding, expression, or G protein coupling, and thus prevent functional analysis. While we agree that it would have been interesting to extend these functional studies with a panel of D202 mutants, we feel that the altered ligand specificity of the D202A mutant (together with modeling data) provides compelling evidence that D202 contributes directly to the ligand-binding pocket.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p><italic>&quot;To further strengthen the conclusion, you can mutate Asp in TM5 of clade III TAARs (16c or 16f) and introduce Asp back in TM3 and see whether these receptors acquire a ligand binding ability as that of a canonical monoamine receptor type.

Ligand-identification studies revealed that the HTR6 double mutant no longer recognized serotonin, but instead recognized a different amine, ethanolamine. Thus, this double mutation transformed the ligand recognition properties of HTR6, just as the reviewer predicted. We also generated other mutations suggested, but did not identify additional ligand-receptor interactions.</p><p><italic>Full reviews:</italic>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>Specific points:1) Despite the authors' screening effort with &gt;60 cloned TAARs, the vast majority of the receptors remain orphan.

On the other hand, the authors could miss ligands for many TAARs because of difficulty in functional expression in the heterologous system.</italic></p><p>Heterologous expression of chemosensory receptors has presented major technical difficulties in the field, so while many TAARs remain orphan receptors, we consider identifying the first ligands for 11 TAARs (including the first ligands for any clade III TAARs) an advance. We find that three different clade III TAARs recognize amines (we added new data for a third TAAR in the revision). Importantly, the amine is an essential moiety recognized by TAAR16c and TAAR16f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Removal of the amine group abolishes responses, indicating that amine recognition is absolutely required for agonism of these TAARs. Moreover, we identified a key amine contact site (Asp<sup>5.42</sup>) that based on modeling and mutagenesis studies is critical for ligand recognition in TAAR13c, TAAR16c, and TAAR16f, and in new data, is sufficient to confer amine recognition upon a mutant HTR6 receptor. This amine contact site is preserved in the vast majority of fish TAARs, and based on all of the data presented; we consider it reasonable to propose that these Asp<sup>5.42</sup>-containing TAARs also detect amines.</p><p><italic>2) While I agree with the authors that the de-orphaned receptors would respond to the tested ligand in vivo, what is not clear is how many other receptors would respond to these chemicals, and whether the identified TAARs represent high-affinity receptors for the ligands. These are relevant issues when discussing how evolution shapes specific residues of TAARs.</italic></p><p>The affinities of several newly de-orphaned TAARs reported here are comparable or better than other olfactory receptors de-orphaned in 293 cells. The best studied mammalian TAARs- TAAR4 and TAAR5- display half maximal responses (EC<sub>50s</sub>) at ligand concentrations of 1-3 μM (2-phenylethylamine) and 300 nM (trimethylamine) respectively. The in vivo relevance for ligand-receptor interactions with this level of affinity is highlighted by studies of TAAR4 and TAAR5 knockout mice, which lose behavioral responses to these odors. The EC<sub>50s</sub> for several receptor-ligand interactions reported here are comparable to TAAR4 and TAAR5, including TAAR10a (~500 nM serotonin), TAAR12h (~300 nM 2-phenylethylamine), TAAR13d (1 μM putrescine), and TAAR13e (1 μM agmatine). So compared with other olfactory receptors, we consider these to be relatively high affinity interactions. It is certainly possible that other receptors contribute to representations of these odors in vivo, and future studies will examine the roles of particular receptors in neuronal and behavioral responses to these cues.</p><p><italic>3) In the third paragraph of the subsection “Asp<sup>5.42</sup> is widely conserved in clade III TAARs” you state that &quot;TAAR13s represent an evolutionary bridge between clade I and clade III TAARs in zebrafish.&quot; It is unclear what &quot;evolutionary bridge&quot; means.

In several fish species examined, TAARs containing both Asp<sup>5.42</sup> and Asp<sup>3.32</sup> reside between clade I TAARs and clade III TAARs on the phylogenetic tree. Based on these findings, we propose that clade III TAARs derived from clade I TAARs by first gaining Asp<sup>5.42</sup> and then losing Asp<sup>3.32</sup>. Since TAARs lacking both Asp<sup>5.42</sup> and Asp<sup>3.32</sup> were not observed at similar locations in the phylogeny, we find no evidence to support the alternative model that clade I TAARs first lost Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and then gained Asp<sup>5.42</sup>.</p><p><italic>4) I think it is equally possible that the Asp<sup>3.32</sup>/Asp<sup>5.42</sup> receptor represents the ancestral gene, which would change the order of the proposed TAAR evolution.

I do not think you can say it is 'unusual' because it could be said this is usual. In addition, the word 'inverted' may also lead to misunderstanding because it is not clear what is 'right orientation' and what is 'inverted'. Of course, as you read the manuscript, we can understand, but these words are not appropriate to be used in Abstract and thus should be reworded.</italic></p><p>We removed the phrase 'unusual inverted orientation' in the Abstract and another location in the text.</p><p><italic>2) Although the phylogenetic tree suggests, I am not sure what is the experimental evidence to conclude that clade I TAARs in fish first gained Asp in TM5 and then losing Asp in TM3 for clade III TAARs. Also I do not understand why the Asp in TM5 version of TAARs is evolutionally advantageous in fish. Please provide careful discussion.</italic></p><p>We discuss the evolutionary advantage in the last paragraph of the conclusion, and added an additional experiment suggested by the reviewer (see below) to strengthen this conclusion. Flipping the amine orientation dramatically changes GPCR-ligand contacts, and presumably offers an evolutionary advantage because it allowed clade III TAARs to sample a distinct repertoire of structurally divergent amine odors. Once the new amine recognition motif was established, this evolutionary innovation was repeatedly harvested as clade III TAARs dramatically expanded through a pattern of gene duplication and subsequent mutation. It seems likely that the massive expansion of this olfactory receptor clade increased the capacity of the fish olfactory system to detect amines, which are water-soluble and ecologically important stimuli for aquatic animals.</p><p>The progression of Asp<sup>5.42</sup> gain then Asp<sup>3.32</sup> loss is a parsimonious interpretation of the phylogenetic evidence. TAARs containing both Asp<sup>5.42</sup> and Asp<sup>3.32</sup> reside between clade I TAARs and clade III TAARs on the phylogenetic tree. Since TAARs lacking both Asp<sup>5.42</sup> and Asp<sup>3.32</sup> were not observed at similar locations in the phylogeny, we find no evidence to support the alternative model that clade I TAARs first lost Asp<sup>3.32</sup> and then gained Asp<sup>5.42</sup>. Furthermore, there is strong phylogenetic evidence in the literature that TAARs derived from biogenic amine receptors, and that the ancestral TAAR, like other biogenic amine receptors, contained Asp<sup>3.32</sup> but not Asp<sup>5.42</sup>.</p><p><italic>3) To further strengthen the conclusion, you can mutate Asp in TM5 of clade III TAARs (16c or 16f) and introduce Asp back in TM3 and see whether these receptors acquire a ligand binding ability as that of a canonical monoamine receptor type. Also you can mutate Asp in TM3 of 10a or 12h, and in a canonical monoamine receptor, and introduce Asp in TM5, and see whether they bind different ligands like those for the 16c and 16f family.</italic></p><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have performed these experiments, and include these new findings in the manuscript. We generated a double mutant of serotonin receptor 6 (HTR6) in which the canonical amine recognition site at Asp<sup>3.32</sup> was neutralized and a non-canonical amine recognition site at Asp<sup>5.42</sup> was introduced. Ligand-identification studies revealed that the HTR6 double mutant no longer recognized serotonin, but instead recognized a different amine, ethanolamine. Thus, this double mutation transformed the ligand recognition properties of HTR6, just as the reviewer predicted. We also generated other mutations suggested, but did not identify additional ligand-receptor interactions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
