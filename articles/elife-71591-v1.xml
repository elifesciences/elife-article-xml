Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) provides an advantageous solution and a number of protocols have been developed for this purpose. However, these methods usually follow different steps of liver development in vitro, which is time consuming and requires complex culture conditions. In addition, HLCs lack the full repertoire of functionalities characterising primary hepatocytes. Here, we explore the interest of forward programming to generate hepatocytes from hPSCs and to bypass these limitations. This approach relies on the overexpression of three hepatocyte nuclear factors (<italic>HNF1A</italic>, <italic>HNF6,</italic> and <italic>FOXA3</italic>) in combination with different nuclear receptors expressed in the adult liver using the OPTi-OX platform. Forward programming allows for the rapid production of hepatocytes (FoP-Heps) with functional characteristics using a simplified process. We also uncovered that the overexpression of nuclear receptors such as RORc can enhance specific functionalities of FoP-Heps thereby validating its role in lipid/glucose metabolism. Together, our results show that forward programming could offer a versatile alternative to direct differentiation for generating hepatocytes in vitro.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>forward programming</kwd><kwd>hepatocytes</kwd><kwd>pluripotent stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New-Chol</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomaz</surname><given-names>Rute A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vallier</surname><given-names>Ludovic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019326</institution-id><institution>UK Regenerative Medicine Platform</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomaz</surname><given-names>Rute A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomaz</surname><given-names>Rute A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021773</institution-id><institution>Wellcome - MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wurmser</surname><given-names>Annabelle</given-names></name><name><surname>Wurmser</surname><given-names>Annabelle</given-names></name><name><surname>Wurmser</surname><given-names>Annabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005370</institution-id><institution>Gates Cambridge Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wesley</surname><given-names>Brandon T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morell</surname><given-names>Carola M</given-names></name><name><surname>Morell</surname><given-names>Carola M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>bit.bio</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bachinger</surname><given-names>Fabian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Forward programming of human pluripotent stem cells with a combination of four transcription factors allows the production of functional hepatocytes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocytes are the main cell type of the liver, comprising 80% of its volume and performing a vast array of vital functions including lipid metabolism, storage of macronutrients, secretion of plasma proteins, and xenobiotic detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Si-Tayeb et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trefts et al., 2017</xref>). Diseases affecting these functions are life-threatening and end-stage forms require liver transplantation. However, only a limited number of patients can benefit from this therapy due to scarcity of donors and the side effects of immunosuppression. Cell-based therapy using primary hepatocytes has already been found to be an attractive therapeutic alternative to whole organ transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhawan et al., 2020</xref>). However, primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) are in short supply as they can only be obtained from suboptimal livers unsuitable for transplantation. Furthermore, they display a short life, absence of proliferation, and rapid loss of functionality in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitry et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, the development of new platforms for drug development and toxicology screens is greatly affected by the lack of robust sources of hepatocytes. For all these reasons, alternative sources of hepatocytes are urgently needed. Producing hepatocytes from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) using directed differentiation protocols has been shown to be an advantageous alternative to PHHs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Palakkan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szkolnicka and Hay, 2016</xref>). These protocols commonly follow key stages of liver development in vitro and allow the production of hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) which exhibit key hepatic functions including Albumin secretion, lipid metabolism, glycogen storage, and urea cycle activity. However, HLCs systematically present an immature/foetal-like phenotype lacking the full repertoire of functions of mature hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baxter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grandy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yiangou et al., 2018</xref>). The development of fully functional hepatocytes in vitro is challenging due to the lack of detailed knowledge concerning the molecular mechanisms driving functional maturation in vivo. Maturation is a process that occurs progressively , and mimicking this timeline and the associated combination of metabolic changes, exposure to oxygen, nutrition, and microbiome constitutes a major challenge for direct differentiation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). As an alternative, overexpression of transcription factors (TFs) has been explored as a way to improve functionality of in vitro generated hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nakamori et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, transdifferentiation of somatic cells into liver cells has been achieved by overexpression of liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs) in mouse and human fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rombaut et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, these LETFs comprise the HNF1, HNF3 (FOXA), HNF4, and HNF6 (ONECUT) families all of which play key roles in coordinating liver development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordillo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schrem et al., 2002</xref>). However, direct cell conversion from somatic cell types has a low efficiency/yield due to the strong epigenetic restrictions present in fully differentiated cells. Furthermore, somatic cells have restricted capacity of proliferation which limits large-scale production of hepatocytes without the use of oncogenic manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). Forward programming by direct overexpression of TFs in hPSCs could bypass these limitations. Indeed, the epigenetic state of hPSCs is more permissive to direct cellular conversion, while their capacity of proliferation is far more superior to somatic cells. Accordingly, this approach has been successfully used to generate neurons, skeletal myocytes, and oligodendrocytes by taking advantage of the OPTi-OX system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pawlowski et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we decided to exploit the same platform to produce hepatocytes by forward programming. We first tested different combinations of LETFs and identified a cocktail of three factors sufficient to drive the conversion into hepatocytes. We then performed transcriptomic and epigenetic comparisons between HLCs and PHHs to identify additional TFs which could further increase the functional maturation of hepatocytes. This comparison revealed that a number of nuclear receptors are expressed in adult hepatocytes and thus are likely to be inducers of functionality and maturation in vivo. A selection of these factors was combined with LETFs and we identified that the 4TFs HNF1A-HNF6-FOXA3-RORc were the most efficient cocktail to generate hepatocytes by forward programming (FoP-Heps) displaying features of mature hepatocytes including CYP3A4 activity, protein secretion, and hepatotoxic response. Thus, forward programming offers an alternative to direct differentiation, bypassing the need for complex culture conditions and lengthy timelines. Moreover, FoP-Heps display a level of functionally relevant for regenerative medicine, as well as disease modelling or drug screening.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LETFs allow forward programming into cells with hepatocyte identity</title><p>The first step to develop a forward programming method consists in identifying a cocktail of TFs which can recreate the transcriptional network characterising the target cell type. However, this step is challenging for hepatocytes as liver development is not initiated by a single and specific master regulator, and the factors driving functional maturation of hepatocytes remain to be fully uncovered. To bypass these limitations, we decided to focus on the LETFs which are known to control the induction of the hepatic program during foetal development and have been tested in somatic cell conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rombaut et al., 2021</xref>). The coding sequence of four LETFs (<italic>HNF4A</italic>, <italic>HNF1A</italic>, <italic>HNF6,</italic> and <italic>FOXA3</italic>) was cloned into the OPTi-OX system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the resulting inducible cassette was targeted into the AAVS1 gene safe harbour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pawlowski et al., 2017</xref>). After selection, individual sublines were picked, expanded, and genotyped before further characterisation. Addition of doxycycline (dox) for 24 hr was sufficient to induce homogenous and robust expression of each LETF in the selected human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) confirming the efficacy of the OPTi-OX system in inducing transgene expression. Importantly, this induction was not associated with differentiation into liver cells (data not shown) suggesting that LETFs alone are not sufficient to impose an hepatocytic identity. Thus, we decided to screen culture conditions which could sustain both the survival and differentiation of hepatocytes (data not shown) and found that after the initial 24 hr in E6 medium, the cells acquired a hepatocyte-like morphology when cultured in Hepatozyme complete medium for 14 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the resulting cells expressed hepatocyte markers such as Albumin (<italic>ALB</italic>), Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (A1AT or <italic>SERPINA1</italic>), and Alpha-Fetoprotein (<italic>AFP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and displayed CYP3A4 activity levels comparable to HLCs generated by direct differentiation, albeit several fold lower than PHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Next, we asked whether all the four LETFs were necessary to achieve this hepatocyte-like phenotype. For that, we removed each factor to generate hESCs sublines expressing combinations of three factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Robust and homogeneous expression at the protein level was again confirmed after 24 hr of dox induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Induction of each combination of three LETFs in culture conditions identified above showed that <italic>HNF1A</italic>, <italic>HNF6,</italic> or <italic>FOXA3</italic> were necessary to generate cells expressing hepatocytes markers such as <italic>ALB,</italic> albeit with heterogeneity at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>). <italic>HNF4A</italic> overexpression seemed to be dispensable as cells generated by overexpression of the three remaining LETFs (<italic>HNF1A</italic>, <italic>HNF6</italic>, <italic>FOXA3</italic>) acquired a cobblestone-like morphology, and expressed high levels of <italic>ALB</italic>, <italic>SERPINA1,</italic> and <italic>AFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Strikingly, hepatocytes generated using these 3TFs (3TF FoP-Heps) achieved the highest levels of CYP3A4 activity suggesting overexpression of <italic>HNF4A</italic> itself is unnecessary to acquire the hepatocyte characteristics screened, as its expression might be induced by one of the three LETFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Altogether, these results showed that overexpression of <italic>HNF1A</italic>, <italic>HNF6,</italic> and <italic>FOXA3</italic> is sufficient to forward program hPSCs towards HLCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Forward programming of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into hepatocytes with four and three liver-enriched transcription factors (LETFs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the two sequentially targeted loci.

However, identifying these factors proved to be challenging as there is little information about the mechanisms driving functional maturation of hepatocytes, especially following birth when adult hepatic functions are established. To bypass this limitation, we decided to compare the transcriptome profile of adult PHHs to the transcriptome of HLCs generated from hPSCs by direct differentiation. Indeed, HLCs represent a foetal state which has been broadly characterised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baxter et al., 2015</xref>), while 3TFs FoP-Heps are likely to be less relevant for natural development. For this comparison, we used a state-of-the-art protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hannan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Touboul et al., 2010</xref>) which has been used for modelling liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rashid et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Segeritz et al., 2018</xref>) and as proof of concept for cell-based therapy applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yusa et al., 2011</xref>). This protocol starts by the production of endoderm cells expressing <italic>SOX17,</italic> followed by the specification of foregut expressing <italic>HHEX</italic>, after which cells transit through a hepatoblast-like state marked by <italic>TBX3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, LETFs were expressed during this differentiation protocol at levels comparable to PHHs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>) confirming that these first steps follow a natural path of development. The resulting progenitors undergo a final stage of differentiation into HLCs expressing functional markers such as <italic>ALB</italic> and <italic>SERPINA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A,D</xref>). Despite displaying key hepatic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baxter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grandy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yiangou et al., 2018</xref>), HLCs represent a âfoetalâ state as shown by the expression of <italic>AFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A,D</xref>) or by the limited activity/expression of <italic>CYP3A4</italic>, <italic>CYP2A6,</italic> or <italic>CYP2C9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) performed on HLCs generated from either human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) or hESCs, and from freshly harvested PHHs (fPHHs) or cultured in vitro as monolayer (pPHHs) reinforced these observations. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the most variable 500 genes showed a clear distinction between the three cell types, with HLCs clustering in-between undifferentiated hiPSCs and PHHs confirming their intermediate state of differentiation (PC1: 52%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In order to further explore the differences between HLCs and PHHs, we combined differential gene expression (DGE) and gene ontology (GO) analyses to identify genes and biological functions specific to each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Genes uniquely expressed in PHHs (cluster 1) were associated with adult liver functions such as response to xenobiotic and xenobiotic metabolism, inflammatory response, and complement activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Genes expressed in both HLCs and PHHs (Heps; cluster 3) were involved in liver development, fatty acid metabolism, or broad cellular functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Of note, genes specifically upregulated in HLCs (cluster 2) were associated with extracellular matrix organisation and varied developmental functions which could originate from their in vitro environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). We then decided to focus specifically on TFs using a previously curated list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lambert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>) and identified 36 TFs highly expressed in PHHs vs. HLCs (p&lt;0.05, log2 fold change &gt;2). Interestingly, reactome pathway analysis grouped these TFs into two main pathways: the NFI family and a cohort of eight nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Nuclear receptors are known to be involved in key liver functions including the metabolism of lipids and glucose, bile acid clearance, xenobiotic sensing, and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rudraiah et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we hypothesise that nuclear receptors could be the most promising candidates to improve hepatocyte functionality in our culture system. Taken together these observations show that the immature state of HLCs is associated with the absence of several nuclear receptors thereby suggesting that these factors could be necessary to drive functional maturation of hepatocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) display transcriptomic differences associated with their state of maturation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of Albumin (yellow) and HNF4A (red) in HLCs differentiated for 30 days.

Indeed, we hypothesised that nuclear receptors binding regulatory regions in PHHs could have a key function in maturation and thus we aimed to identify the most important factors by screening underlying motifs in such regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed on histone marks including H3K27ac (active regulatory regions), H3K4me1 (active or primed regulatory regions), and H3K27me3 (silenced genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). These marks were profiled in HLCs derived from both hiPSCs and hESCs, and PHHs while undifferentiated hiPSCs were used as control. As expected, PCAs showed a marked divergence between the epigenetic profile of HLCs and hiPSCs independently of the mark analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, HLCs and PHHs clustered in close proximity suggesting that these cell types share an important part of their epigenetic profile despite their transcriptomic differences. The profiles of H3K27ac and H3K27me3 showed the highest variance between HLCs/PHHs and hiPSCs, confirming the importance of these marks for establishing cellular identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We then performed differential peak calling on H3K27ac to identify regulatory regions uniquely enriched and active in PHHs vs. HLCs (âPHH-specificâ), and vice versa (âHLC-specificâ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We also profiled H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 in either PHH or HLC-specific regions. This analysis revealed that H3K4me1 was absent at âPHH-specificâ regions in HLCs and seems to be broadly replaced by spread of H3K27me3 deposition instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, discrete portions of regulatory regions lacked H3K27ac in genes downregulated in HLCs (see for example <italic>CYP3A4</italic> and <italic>UGT1A</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Ontology of genes associated with each set of regions highlighted several adult liver metabolic processes in the âPHH-specificâ set such as steroid, lipid, and xenobiotic metabolism, and range of neural functions for âHLC-uniqueâ regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), in agreement with the transcriptomic analyses. Overall, these results suggested that a subset of genes involved in adult liver functions lack H3K4me1 priming as well as full H3K27ac deposition in HLCs. These regions lacking H3K27ac in HLCs appeared to display repressive marks such as H3K27me3. In addition, HLCs displayed active histone marks in regions including genes which are not associated with liver differentiation confirming that cells generated from hPSCs also present an epigenetic signature specific to their in vitro state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Taken together these observations suggested that HLCs and PHHs broadly share the same epigenetic identity when compared to hiPSCs. However, the activation of a limited and specific set of regulatory regions is missing in HLCs, which could explain the absence of expression of adult liver genes and lack of functional maturation. To identify the nuclear receptors potentially involved in regulating these regions, we performed motif enrichment analysis in the âPHH-specificâ regions marked by H3K27ac. Interestingly, this analysis identified a significant enrichment for the androgen (AR) and estrogen (ERÎ±) response elements, as well as RORc motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which were among the top differentially expressed nuclear receptors in our transcriptomic analyses. We then decided to further investigate the importance of these nuclear receptors throughout development using mouse RNA-seq datasets obtained at different stages of liver organogenesis E12.5, E16.5, P0, 8-week and 10-week adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, the expression of these three nuclear receptors was found to be upregulated specifically in the adult liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Altogether, these observations suggested that the nuclear receptors AR, ERÎ±, and RORc could play a role in establishing or maintaining a transcriptional network characterising mature hepatocytes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Epigenetic status of regulatory regions differs between states of maturation in hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principal component analysis (PCA) of the global enrichment profile of H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K27me3 across two replicates of undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), human embryonic stem cell (hESC), and hiPSC-derived HLCs, and PHHs.

We generated Opti-OX hiPSC with the 3TFs or the 3TFs + RORc FoP system, validated the upregulation of these factors after 24 hr of dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) and then induced differentiation following the protocol established above.

In particular, <italic>ALB</italic> transcript further increased by day 30, suggesting that this cell background might require additional time to achieve maturation.

Overall, these results showed that overexpression of specific nuclear receptors was compatible with the generation of FoP-hepatocytes. In particular, overexpression of RORc could improve the functionality of hepatocytes generated by overexpression of three LETFs confirming the role of this nuclear receptor in hepatocyte maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>4TF FoP-Heps display functional characteristics in vitro</title><p>Next, we sought to further characterise the functionality of the 4TF (HNF1A, HNF6, FOXA3, and RORc) FoP-Heps derived from either hESC (eFoP-Heps) or hiPSCs (iFoP-Heps) in comparison with HLCs generated by the direct differentiation and PHHs. CYP3A4 activity was significantly higher in 4TF FoP-Heps forward programmed after 20 days than those achieved by HLCs after 30 days of directed differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, we analysed the expression of markers associated with hepatic metabolic functions such as phase I (cytochrome P450 enzymes) and phase II (UGTs) biotransformation, gluconeogenesis (<italic>G6PC</italic> and <italic>PCK1</italic>), and lipid (<italic>PPARÎ±</italic>, <italic>PPARÎ³</italic>, <italic>FASN,</italic> and <italic>APOA1</italic>) and bile acid (<italic>NR1H4</italic>) metabolism. FoP-Heps expressed a range of these functional markers confirming the acquisition of hepatic functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Overall, the levels of expression achieved by forward programming were equivalent to those achieved by direct differentiation with the exception of gluconeogenesis genes which were increased in FoP-Heps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, expression of gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism genes was comparable between FoP-Heps and PHHs. However, induction of cytochrome P450 genes remains challenging, indicating that the acquisition of this specific hepatic function could need further refinement of our protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>,). Of note, in FoP-Heps, the 4TFs remained expressed at physiological levels at the end of our protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we sought to further characterise the transcriptome of day 20 4TF FoP-Heps by RNA-seq by comparing the transcriptome of eFoP-Heps with undifferentiated hiPSCs, HLCs (derived from direct differentiation of hESC and hiPSCs), adult PHHs, as well as foetal liver cells. As suggested by the marker expression pattern identified by qPCR, the transcriptome of eFoP-Heps closely clustered with HLCs derived from both hESCs and hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, both eFoP-Heps and HLCs clustered separately from foetal liver cells, indicating that despite these cells not acquiring a fully mature phenotype, these also donât fully resemble a foetal liver stage. We further interrogated the ontology of genes differentially expressed between eFoP and the different groups of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, genes that gain expression in eFoP-Heps compared to undifferentiated hiPSCs are strongly associated with several liver functions such as hormone metabolism, lipid localisation and transport, blood coagulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), further confirming that cells generated by forward programming acquire a hepatocyte identity. Indeed, eFoP-Heps, as well as hiPSC-derived HLCs, expressed a range of adult liver genes that were found to be highly expressed in adult PHHs as identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>, including genes that were not expressed in the foetal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition to expressing mature hepatocyte markers, both eFoP-Heps and iFoP-Heps were also able to uptake low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from the culture medium confirming their capacity to transport lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In order to further explore their capacity to metabolise lipids, FoP-Heps were grown in 3D for 5 (D20) or 10 (D30) days as we recently observed that 3D culture conditions facilitate lipid accumulation in HLCs (Carola M Morell, personal communication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tilson et al., 2021</xref>). We first confirmed that FoP-Heps grown in 3D retained the expression of hepatocyte markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>SERPINA1</italic> or <italic>UGT1A6</italic> expression increased in these conditions suggesting an increase in functional maturation promoted by 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We then tested the capacity of both eFoP and iFoP-Heps to respond to fatty acids by treating these cells with both oleic acid (OA) and palmitic acid (PA) which are known to induce steatosis and lipotoxicity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ricchi et al., 2009</xref>). In line with their known effect on hepatocytes, OA treatment induced a strong accumulation of lipids as shown by BODIPY staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) while PA treatment induced a reduction in cell viability consistent with lipotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, FoP-Heps appear to react to fatty acids similarly to their primary counterpart. Finally, we explored the interest of FoP-Heps for modelling the hepatotoxic effect of paracetamol/acetaminophen (APAP). For that, Fop-Heps were grown in the presence of an APAP dose known to induce liver failure. This treatment resulted in up to 50% reduction in cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) suggesting that FoP-Heps could be used for cytotoxic studies. In summary, these results showed that 4TF FoP-Heps derived from either hESC or hiPSCs display characteristics of functional hepatocytes such as expression of genes involved in drug, lipid, glucose and bile acid metabolism, capacity to uptake LDL and fatty acids from the culture medium, as well as response to hepatotoxic factors, demonstrating their potential interest for modelling liver disease in vitro and toxicology screening.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>4TF FoP-Heps are transcriptionally equivalent to hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CYP3A4 activity levels in eFoP-Heps at day 20 (n=6) and day 30 (n=6), iFoP-Heps at day 0 (n=6) and day 30 (n=3), against direct differentiation HLCs (n=6) and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) (n=4).

The success of this approach depends on the selection of TFs, combining factors controlling early liver development and regulators of adult hepatic functions. Nonetheless, most forward programming methods rely on a master regulator to convert hPSCs into a specific cell type. As an example, neurons and muscle cells can be generated by the simple overexpression of NGN2 and MYOD, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pawlowski et al., 2017</xref>). Our results show that production of hepatocytes requires a more complex process involving three TFs but also a culture media supporting primary hepatocytes. Furthermore, our best LETFs combination did not include HNF4A, which is known to be a key regulator of hepatocyte function in the adult liver. On the contrary, removing HNF4A significantly improved the identity of the hepatocytes generated. Similar observations were recently reported for the direct reprogramming of human umbilical vein endothelial cells into bipotent hepatocyte progenitor cells where HNF4A was found to be detrimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inada et al., 2020</xref>). HNF4A is essential not only in adult liver but also during development, especially in the establishment of the liver bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gordillo et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, HNF4A might also have a role in preserving foetal liver cells such as hepatoblasts and its overexpression during forward programming could block the acquisition of an adult hepatocytic identity. This example illustrates the challenges to identify factors which are uniquely expressed in the adult liver.</p><p>Importantly, FoP-Heps generated by LETF overexpression acquired an hepatocytic identity with reduced adult functions, suggesting that this cocktail of TFs might only convert hiPSCs into foetal-like cells. Thus, we decided to add factors which could direct functional maturation of the liver. This latest category of factors was identified by performing a transcriptomic and epigenetic comparison of PHHs and HLC generated by direct differentiation. The focus on HLCs was based on their well-characterised foetal state and also the broad experience with the cells. These analyses identified a subset of nuclear receptors that were exclusively expressed in the adult liver thereby confirming the relevance of our approach. Of particular interest, RORc, ERÎ±, and AR were identified as key candidates for controlling functional maturation in hepatocytes. Importantly, nuclear receptors are well known to control diverse liver functions including lipid and glucose homeostasis, bile acid clearance, xenobiotic sensing, and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rudraiah et al., 2016</xref>). Both steroid hormonal receptors ERÎ± and AR have been shown to have roles in the regulation of energy homeostasis in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shen and Shi, 2021</xref>). Moreover, ERÎ± is involved in cholesterol clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>) and has also been associated with liver regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kao et al., 2018</xref>) and bilirubin metabolism through CYP2A6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kao et al., 2017</xref>). RORc is a nuclear receptor expressed in peripheral tissues including liver, muscle, and adipose tissue and has been proposed to function as an intermediary between the circadian clock and glucose/lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cook et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, <italic>RORy</italic>-deficient mice exhibit insulin sensitivity and reduced expression of gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolic markers, and a subset of phase I enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis and phase II enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takeda et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takeda et al., 2014b</xref>). Based on these previous reports, we propose that the overexpression of RORc and other nuclear receptors could improve specific functions in FoP-Heps by activating a subset of target genes in the hepatic context induced by the LETFs overexpression. Importantly, hepatocyte functionality is spatially different across the liver lobule, being influenced by the gradient of oxygen, nutrients, and signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trefts et al., 2017</xref>). This hepatic zonation drives different metabolic processes in regards to glucose, lipids, iron, or even xenobiotics, which are under the control of different transcriptomic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Halpern et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we expect that different combinations of nuclear factors in the background induced by LETFs overexpression could enable the production of hepatocytes with a distinct repertoire of functions.</p><p>FoP-Heps generated with the overexpression of the 4TFs (HNF1A, HNF6, FOXA3, and RORc) displayed functional features of adult hepatocytes including Albumin and A1AT secretion, basal CYP3A4 activity, expression of phase I/phase II enzymes, gluconeogenesis and lipid metabolism markers, capacity to uptake LDL and fatty acids, as well as response to toxic compounds. Nonetheless, <italic>CYP3A4</italic> expression remains limited and this gene remains difficult to induce in vitro. Thus, additional TFs could be necessary to generate FoP-Heps exhibiting the full spectrum of functional activities displayed by PHHs. Similarly, culture conditions could be further improved to support key hepatic functions. Indeed, the basal medium used in our protocol does not prevent dedifferentiation of PHHs and thus might not be compatible with the production of fully functional cells by forward programming. Nonetheless, the forward programming method established here presents several advantages over conventional directed differentiation protocols. This is a robust two-step method which bypasses the need for multi-step differentiations which are often associated with batch-to-batch variability. Furthermore, forward programming is faster, generating functional cells in 20 days, as opposed to 30â35 days for direct differentiation. Finally, the yield of cells seems favourable and compatible with large-scale production. Indeed, we observed that forward programming was associated with a six- to eight fold increase in cell number during differentiation while the yield of direct differentiation is lower (data not shown). Moreover, the phenotype achieved is stable even in the absence of dox which allows this method to be applicable in cell therapy and drug discovery (data not shown).</p><p>Taken together, our results describe the first method for generating hepatocytes using forward programming. This approach represents the first step towards the high-throughput and large-scale production of specialised hepatocytes displaying a spectrum of functions relevant for different applications in disease modelling and drug screening.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>hPSC culture</title><p>The human ESC H9 (WiCell) and IPSC A1ATD<sup>R/R</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yusa et al., 2011</xref>) lines were used in this project.

Coverage files were generated using deeptools bamCoverage, with a bin size of 10 bp and normalised as RPKM for visualisation in IGV and heatmap representation with deeptools. In order to plot PCA, average scores were calculated over 1000 bp bins. For peak calling, BAM files were converted to SAM and peaks called using homer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). Both replicates were used for peak calling against input with disabled local filtering invoking the following flags for H3K27ac: -region -L 0. In order to identify regulatory regions specifically active in PHH or HLCs, differentially bound peaks were determined using PHH datasets as target against all HLCs datasets as background, and vice versa, with a fold enrichment over background of 4. A list of genes annotated for each peak dataset can be found in, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1 fig3sdata2">Figure 3âsource data 1 and 2</xref>. For motif enrichment, peak calling was performed on nucleosome-free regions by invoking the flags -L 1 -nfr, in order to determine the âdipsâ within H3K27ac-rich regions. These sets of regions were overlapped with the differentially bound peaks as above, in order to perform PHH or HLC-specific motif enrichment. Peak annotation and GO enrichment were determined with the clusterProfiler R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Undifferentiated hiPSCs ChIP-seq reads aligned to the same genome assembly were downloaded from ENCODE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012</xref>) and treated as above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad 9.0.0 and specific tests are indicated in the figure legends.

This manuscript by Tomaz et al. reports a new method to generate Hepatic Like Cells (HLC) from iPSCs and ESCs. The authors identify a combination of four factors (HNF1A, HNF6, FOXA3, and RORc) that when overexpressed in iPSCs or ESCs induce their programming to HLC. After evaluating functionality, the authors conclude that the forward programmed cells show increased functionality when compared to classic iPSC-derived HLCs. Though the manuscript is well written, involves a large amount of work, and confers a great advance to the field of regenerative medicine, there are several important points to be addressed:</p><p>1. Differentiation stability and long-term functionality of iPSC-derived cells are crucial when considering any therapeutic use. In this work, the forward programmed HLCs seem to decline in activity markers (CYP3A4, ALB) over time (see Figure 1 and Fig 4F). This questions whether the programming effect of those 4 factors is reversible. The functionality of 4F forward programmed cells should be assessed beyond day 30 and the functionality should be compared with classical direct programmed HLCs at that timepoint.</p><p>2. Are the 4F forward programmed cells functional in vivo?</p><p>3. The importance of the findings in this work very much depends on how do the forward programmed hepatic cells (eFoPs and iFoPS) compare to the classic direct reprogrammed HLC (HLCs) and the primary hepatocytes (PHHs). Therefore, those controls (HLCs and PHHs) should be included in all the experiments. i.e Figure 1D-J; Figure 4A-G, Suppl Fig6 should contain HLC and mature hepatocytes as controls.</p><p>4. How do the transcriptome of the 3F (HNF1A, HNF6, FOXA2) forward programmed cells and 4F (HNF1A, HNF6, FOXA2, RORc) forward programmed cells compare to the HLCs and PHHs? How does it compare to Foetal hepatocytes?</p><p>5. Figure 2 shows there are plenty of pathways differentially activated in PHH when compared to HLCs, which is reflected in plenty of genes including key transcription factors being differentially expressed (Fig.2G). It is not clear why the authors focus their interest exclusively on nuclear receptors. This should be discussed.</p><p>6. Figure 5 is redundant to Figure 4. Since this is just another iPSC line, it should either be merged with figure 5 or included as a supplementary figure.</p><p>7. Quantification of IF should be done for all the images presented.</p><p>8. The statistical analyses are not clear, labelling for p-values should be consistent (either value or *, but consistent in all the graphs). It is unclear at times what groups have been compared in each graph. Comparisons should be clearly indicated (line indicating the 2 groups compared as in Figure 2B). HLC and PHHs should be always included as controls in all the graphs.</p><p>9. Fig6a - eFOPS and iFOPS day 30 should be included</p><p>10. Fig6B - CYP3A4 gene and ALB should be included here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The major strength of the manuscript is the platform on which it is built, namely the system for forward programming and the in house strength of the Vallier group in hepatocyte differentiation. The discovery that three transcription factors, HNF1A, HNF6 and FOXA3, can induce forward programming towards the hepatocyte fate is notable. Equally notable is that HNF4A was dispensable raising questions on the precise phase of HNF4A action during normal development and maturation of hepatocytes. This is interesting and maps to similar questions during in vivo development.</p><p>In the informatic analyses I did not quite follow the logic of scrutinising variance by restricting the data to the 500 most variable genes rather than an unbiased scrutiny of the whole dataset. Similarly, the conclusion about H3K27ac modifications being more discriminatory than the H3K27me3 differences was unclear to me. As suggested in my recommendations, I don't think this really matters-the main rationale for studying H3K27ac modifications could be made clearer; namely to arrive at motifs in active regulatory element with potential binding factors that influence hepatocyte maturation. That alone provides a strong case.</p><p>While the initial findings on the three TFs are very interesting, I am less convinced about the additional role of RORc from the data presented. Some results between ESC and IPSC derived cells were discordant, differences in effect were apparent between the two later time-points of culture, and some statistical analyses seemed insignificant but accompanied by positive text statements. The main 'take home' message for me was that the resultant cells possess hepatocyte-like qualities but still fall far short of primary adult hepatocytes in terms of their primary function for xenobiotic metabolism. This is not really criticism as that goal is a massive one that will require multiple stepwise breakthroughs. In this regard, while I feel that the Results text needs moderation and perhaps reconsideration in places, the Discussion is very nicely balanced.</p><p>I have made my comments in order, rather than priority.</p><p>1. Introduction: 'after birth when it takes nearly 12 months for the liver to become functional'; this should be changed. The liver is unequivocally functional from early embryogenesis. No liver equals embryonic lethality.</p><p>2. In figure 1G-J the '-' sign gets lost on the x-axis. I suggest 'no' would be clearer.</p><p>3. Line 127: I think this should be changed. Measuring mRNA for ALB, SERPINA1, AFP and luciferase based CYP3A4 activity is useful screening but not assessing functional characteristics of hepatocytes in anything like their totality. HNF4A is proven to be a fundamental regulator of the hepatocyte phenotype. While it might be dispensable for some aspects, and may lower the handful of parameters selected, that does not equate to 'functional characteristics of hepatocytes'. I also think the conclusion (line 129) should be forward programming 'towards' rather than 'into' based on the very limited screening analyses undertaken to this point.</p><p>4. Figure 1, supplement 2B: it is striking how heterogeneous the albumin detection is (compared to A1AT or AFP)? Compared to the DAPI it is in only a fairly small minority of the cells. I would comment on this. It is not a criticism; we notice the same in vivo. We tend to treat 'hepatocytes' as one population with the potential the varying degrees of differentiation when actually I think they represent quite different subpopulations over and above what we know about zonation.</p><p>5. Line 137, I would describe this as 'following birth'. 'Adult' function is not established in the 'neonatal' period (by definition).</p><p>6. Line 141: I am not sure what is intended by 'are likely to be less relevant for natural development'?</p><p>7. Line 158: I don't understand the logic of scrutinising variance by restricting the choice to the 500 most variable genes. Isn't the point to scrutinise variance within the whole dataset? Restriction to the 500 most variable means the downstream analyses and individual GO terms end up based on remarkably few genes (which should be compiled as supplementary tables). What do the data look like without this arbitrary cut-off? Why 500?</p><p>8. Line 192-5. Why is H3K27ac providing the 'strongest distinction' (not a particularly scientific phrase? Variance?) and 'most informative'. There looks to be as much segregation of the PHH replicates on the H3K27me3 plot? I.e. cell identity is as much determined by what is actively repressed as what is actively 'switched on'.</p><p>9. Fig. 3 supplement 1C. I am not sure the terms are particularly 'developmental'; more seem to relate to neural function?</p><p>10. Fig. 3C right hands labels are cropped; I am not sure what message these panels are trying to convey? The text also becomes hard to follow in line 208-the H3K27ac regions can also harbour K27me3 marks? Line 211-212: I don't see evidence to support the statement, 'taken together these observations suggested that HLCs and PHHs broadly share the same epigenetic identity'-compared to what? In line 214, an association is taken as proof of causality. It potentially explains why these genes are not expressed. This whole section could do with reconsideration. I would favour a re-write with a far simpler focus: we wanted to identify the regulatory regions responsible for the differential gene expression so we could identify the underlying motifs and nuclear receptors/TFs that might bind to them.</p><p>11. Nuclear receptors for sex steroids: were the PHH samples from males or females (given the presence of AR and ER motifs)? Do the authors have a comment on the detection of HNF4A (dispensable) but not HNF1A, HNF6 or FOXA3 in the heatmap in Fig 3 supplement 1E? And might the upregulation of AR and ER in mice at 8 and 10 weeks simply reflect post-pubertal status rather than hepatocyte maturity?</p><p>12. Figure 4, supplement 1B: I disagree with the authors a little here. AR clearly has a cytoplasmic distribution in addition to potential nuclear detection (it is hard to say given the potential for piled up cells and signal overlying the nucleus that is not actually nuclear; in any case the nature of the AR panel is obviously different compared to the other nuclear receptors). This implies strongly that its ligand, either testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, is absent from the conditions in which case one wouldn't anticipate much functional effect even if AR was important in hepatocytes. Have the authors tried adding the relevant sex steroid to the culture conditions and repeating the immunocytochemistry? For AR it would induce comprehensive nuclear localisation. I disagree about the statement about potentially bypassing the need for ligand. The conformational change induced by ligand binding is highly relevant to DNA binding and gene activation. Just because the relevant receptor may (or may not) be in the nucleus doesn't allow confident statements on activity.</p><p>13. Consistency of the data and interpretation / risk of over-interpretation. RORc on albumin. I think the statement made in line 241-2, needs toning down. There isn't a statistical difference? Day 30 ALB mRNA levels are directly equivalent between 3TFs and 3TFs+RORc (Fig. 4D). Arguably (presuming gain settings are the same in panel B), while there are the same number of cells with robust detection of albumin there are more cells with faint detection in the presence of RORc. Likewise, I don't think much can be said about AFP levels being lower given the overlap in range and lack of statistical significance.</p><p>14. Consistency of the data and interpretation / risk of over-interpretation. Developing the second cell line: in the text the authors say that RORc overexpression increased expression of AFP and SERPINA1-this is not evident at Day 30 for transcript (D) or protein (E) and is non-significant for albumin for all except the day 20 mRNA analysis. Presumably day 30 is the most mature stage of culture (Fig . 5D and E)? Moreover, in the IPSC analysis RORc is quoted as decreasing AFP transcript detection (Fig. 4D, albeit non-significant), whereas in the second line studied, AFP transcript detection is actually increased by RORc (Figure 5D)-this discrepancy needs explaining as it might legitimately raise concerns that the detected differences are not meaningful.</p><p>15. How do the authors explain the lack of effect from the ligand for RORc (Fig. 4G)?</p><p>16. Figure 6A. Rather than being a side-by-side analysis, the CYP3A4 analysis (Fig. 6A) looks like it re-uses the preceding eFoP (Fig. 4A) and iFoP data (Fig. 5F) (the position of the balls and the SD bars look the same?). However, the HLC v PHH data look different from those in Figure 2B when the P value for their difference was only 0.0190. Here, P is 0.0002 for eFoP v. HLC? Given the massively higher activity in PHH, this suggests the HLCs in Figure 6 are suboptimal compared to those in Figure 2. For robustness, these comparative experiments ought to be done side-by-side. For me, the main message is that I agree with the authors that the considerable 'ask' remains unmet for CYP expression compared to PHH.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Valier's lab is one of the pioneering labs in endoderm differentiation and generation of hepatocyte- and cholangiocyte-like cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and has always performed and published high-quality research. This paper is no different in that respect. The authors worked meticulously and systematically to find the right combination of transcription factors involved in the liver development for forward programming of hPSCs. Comparing the transcriptome profile of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), they identified a number of nuclear receptors known to play a role in liver metabolic activity. To further improve the functionality of forward programmed HLCs, the authors tested the induction of three nuclear receptors in combination with three liver-enriched transcription factors. Notably, overexpression of RORc was found to reduced alpha-fetoprotein secretion as a foetal marker and improved Albumin protein production and CYP3A4 metabolic activity.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are supported mainly by data, as forward programming can be considered a less complicated and more cost-effective alternative methodology than stepwise differentiation of hPSCs into HLCs using recombinant growth factors. However, it would be helpful to clarify the following points to draw a better conclusion:</p><p>1) Since the study aimed to generate HLCs with improved functionalities, comparing the level of HNF6, FOXA3 and HNF1 between generated forward programmed HLCs (FoP-Heps) and PHHs, considering that doxycycline (dox) induction was maintained throughout the differentiation.</p><p>2) The authors indicated that culture medium supplemented with 1mg/ml dox for the protocol duration (page 19, line 443). If tested, it would be helpful to share the consequence of dox exclusion after cells acquired hepatic phenotype. Would the FoP-Heps dedifferentiate and lose hepatic phenotype earlier than usual? If yes, then it would be helpful to elaborate on the potential implication for using the FoP-Heps in disease modelling and drug screening in the discussion.</p><p>3) While gene expression analysis for both FoP-Heps and HLCs were included for some genes (Figure 6 and Figure 6 Supplement 1), comparison of key hepatic functions such as secretion of ALB, AFP and Alpha1-Antitrypsin and CYP3A4 metabolic functionality are missing. The addition of these data would help to make a direct comparison between HLCs and FoP-Heps functionality.</p><p>4) It is unclear how long 2D-cultured FoP-Heps maintain their hepatic phenotype and function in culture.</p><p>The forward programming is an intriguing idea, and I would like to congratulate the authors for performing and presenting the data at such a high standard which is not surprising considering the high calibre of the Principal Investigator.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71591.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The primary revision that is essential is testing the functionality of the induced hepatocytes, specifically, compared to classically induced hepatocytes.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Directed (classical) differentiation methods to obtain iPSC-derived HLC are time-consuming and lack the full repertoire of functionalities of hepatocytes.

Indeed FoP-Heps display higher levels of CYP3A4 activity at day 20 and these appear to reduce by day 30. However, hepatocyte marker expression in FoP-Heps did not appear to decreased from day 20 to day 30, apart from AFP (Figure 4D). We have previously characterised direct differentiation HLCs after long term cultures and found that conventional 2D culture systems were not compatible with maintaining HLCs functionality beyond day 45, resulting in cell detachment, potentiality due to lack of an appropriate matrix. Instead, it was found that 3D systems, such as the collagen-based RATF system, were appropriate to preserve an hepatic phenotype and further increase functionality up to 75 days (Gieseck et al, 2014).</p><p>In the current study, we have developed a forward programming method to generate hepatocytes using conventional 2D cultures which we believe limits their applicability and longterm functionality. We have differentiated FoP-Heps up to day 40 and observed that these still retain CYP3A4 activity, as well as HLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), but the cell attachment tends to deteriorate with longer times in culture (not shown). Here, we aimed to develop a versatile and faster alternative to generate hepatocytes in vitro and have chosen to characterised the generated cells in their optimal time frame (day 20). Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that should this method be further validated for therapeutic use, improvements should be made to extend their lifespan and usability, potentially adapting extra cellular matrix to meet the requirements for proper hepatocyte attachment and/or 3D system.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>CYP3A4 Activity in long-term cultures.</title><p>hiPSCs expressing the 4TF combination were induced to differentiate for up to 40 days, with CYP3A4 activity measure at days 20, 30 and 40 (left panel).

Are the 4F forward programmed cells functional in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>Assessing in vivo functionality is key to define the potential of forward programmed cells. Indeed, we have deployed our resources into addressed this question during the course of the revision by performing in vivo injections of eFoPs and iFoPs using a healthy mouse model. Initially, we performed injections in kidney capsule but this approach showed no hAlbumin detection on mice serum by up to 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). Subsequently, we performed injections directly into the liver capsule which was found to provide a more appropriate niche, as hAlbumin expression could indeed be detected in mice serum at 3 or 4 weeks post-injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>), although at variable levels. However, hAlbumin was not detected consistently in all mice injected highlighting that the use of a healthy mouse model was inappropriate for sufficient and robust integration of the forward programmed cells into the liver. Using a liver injury model would provide a more suitable environment, however the time frame required to establish these models or to establish appropriate collaborations would fall beyond the appropriate time for this revision, and thus we propose to pursue these experiments as a follow-up study with suitable mouse models.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Human Albumin secretion in mice sera.</title><p>eFoP (hESC-derived) or iFoP (hIPSC-derived) cells differentiated up to 20 days were dissociated into small clusters, and 1 million cells mixed with growth-factor reduced Matrigel and injected (per mouse) into the kidney or liver capsules of healthy mice.

How does it compare to Foetal hepatocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed RNA-sequencing analysis on newly generated datasets of eFoP (4TFs) and foetal liver samples, in order to characterise what we identified as cells generated with the best combination of TFs identified in our study (4TFs). This data has been incorporated into a new Figure 5 and Figure 5 â supplement 2. From these analysis, eFoP cells seem to be distinct from foetal liver cells, as well as adult PHHs. eFoP were found to cluster in close proximity to HLCs derived from hESC and hiPSCs, and thus reinforce these to be an equivalent cell population generated with an alternative method. Interestingly, eFoP express adult liver genes similarly to HLCs, including genes not yet expressed in foetal liver cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 2 shows there are plenty of pathways differentially activated in PHH when compared to HLCs, which is reflected in plenty of genes including key transcription factors being differentially expressed (Fig.2G).

This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, several pathways are lacking activation in HLCs when compared to PHHs and our differential gene expression analysis identified 36 TFs highly expressed in PHHs vs HLCs (p &lt; 0.05, log2 fold change &gt; 2). It is possible that many of the TFs identified in this study play a key role in hepatocyte maturation. However, it is known that nuclear receptors are involved in key liver functions including the metabolism of lipid and glucose levels, bile acid clearance, xenobiotic sensing and regeneration (Rudraiah et al., 2016). Given that the approach that we used to test the role of TFs in hepatocyte maturation involved gene targeting, generation of cell lines, and differentiation, all of which are lengthy processes, we decided to narrow down the list of candidate TFs for our study to nuclear receptors, since based on literature there was a high chance that these would could improve hepatocyte metabolism.

Both proteins have been reported to be expressed in both genders in rodents and humans. In addition, their expression is age-dependent in rodents, being expressed at higher levels post-puberty (Shen and Shi, 2015). Indeed, we cannot establish causality between expression or AR and ERa and hepatic maturation, but the observation that these are specifically expressed in adult / postpubertal livers, versus foetal stage livers, was interesting as it reiterates that these markers seem to be âadult-specificâ, as suggested by our PHH /HLCs RNA-seq comparisons. The PHH samples used in the ChIP-sequencing analyses were derived from a male donor. In our PHH qPCR expression data which is limited to 3 male and 1 female donor, we could not identify a clear difference in expression levels of these markers associated with the gender of the donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>).</p><p>The identification of <italic>HNF4A</italic> specifically in mouse liver RNA-seq was due to this heatmap specifically representing transcription factors that are categorised as nuclear receptors, and hence <italic>FOXA3, HNF6, HNF1A</italic> would not be expected to appear in this analysis in particular as they are not categorised as such.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Expression of nuclear receptors in PHHs.</title><p>mRNA levels of <italic>AR</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic> (ERa) genes in primary human hepatocytes from 4 donors including 1 female (F) and 3 males (M1, M2, M3).

Figure 4, supplement 1B: I disagree with the authors a little here. AR clearly has a cytoplasmic distribution in addition to potential nuclear detection (it is hard to say given the potential for piled up cells and signal overlying the nucleus that is not actually nuclear; in any case the nature of the AR panel is obviously different compared to the other nuclear receptors). This implies strongly that its ligand, either testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, is absent from the conditions in which case one wouldn't anticipate much functional effect even if AR was important in hepatocytes. Have the authors tried adding the relevant sex steroid to the culture conditions and repeating the immunocytochemistry? For AR it would induce comprehensive nuclear localisation. I disagree about the statement about potentially bypassing the need for ligand. The conformational change induced by ligand binding is highly relevant to DNA binding and gene activation. Just because the relevant receptor may (or may not) be in the nucleus doesn't allow confident statements on activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewerâs comment that we cannot assume that the overexpression system used bypasses the need for a ligand. Indeed, we acknowledge that the pattern of staining of AR is clearly different from the other nuclear receptors RORc and ERa which are uniquely nuclear. Adding the ligand to the culture conditions would potentially induce comprehensive translocation to the nucleus. However, from the immunofluorescence results it appears that AR is present in both nucleus and cytoplasm in our overexpressing cell line without ligand, and thus we would expect to have some level transcriptional activity. We present here a different biological replicate of this staining with a closer field that better represents the dual localisation of this protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>).

Day 30 ALB mRNA levels are directly equivalent between 3TFs and 3TFs+RORc (Fig. 4D). Arguably (presuming gain settings are the same in panel B), while there are the same number of cells with robust detection of albumin there are more cells with faint detection in the presence of RORc.

Developing the second cell line: in the text the authors say that RORc overexpression increased expression of AFP and SERPINA1-this is not evident at Day 30 for transcript (D) or protein (E) and is non-significant for albumin for all except the day 20 mRNA analysis. Presumably day 30 is the most mature stage of culture (Fig . 5D and E)? Moreover, in the IPSC analysis RORc is quoted as decreasing AFP transcript detection (Fig. 4D, albeit non-significant), whereas in the second line studied, AFP transcript detection is actually increased by RORc (Figure 5D)-this discrepancy needs explaining as it might legitimately raise concerns that the detected differences are not meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to describe this data accurately.

Figure 6A. Rather than being a side-by-side analysis, the CYP3A4 analysis (Fig. 6A) looks like it re-uses the preceding eFoP (Fig. 4A) and iFoP data (Fig. 5F) (the position of the balls and the SD bars look the same?). However, the HLC v PHH data look different from those in Figure 2B when the P value for their difference was only 0.0190. Here, P is 0.0002 for eFoP v. HLC? Given the massively higher activity in PHH, this suggests the HLCs in Figure 6 are suboptimal compared to those in Figure 2.

This paper is no different in that respect. The authors worked meticulously and systematically to find the right combination of transcription factors involved in the liver development for forward programming of hPSCs. Comparing the transcriptome profile of primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), they identified a number of nuclear receptors known to play a role in liver metabolic activity. To further improve the functionality of forward programmed HLCs, the authors tested the induction of three nuclear receptors in combination with three liver-enriched transcription factors. Notably, overexpression of RORc was found to reduced alpha-fetoprotein secretion as a foetal marker and improved Albumin protein production and CYP3A4 metabolic activity.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are supported mainly by data, as forward programming can be considered a less complicated and more cost-effective alternative methodology than stepwise differentiation of hPSCs into HLCs using recombinant growth factors. However, it would be helpful to clarify the following points to draw a better conclusion:</p><p>1) Since the study aimed to generate HLCs with improved functionalities, comparing the level of HNF6, FOXA3 and HNF1 between generated forward programmed HLCs (FoP-Heps) and PHHs, considering that doxycycline (dox) induction was maintained throughout the differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the expression data for <italic>HNF1A</italic>, <italic>FOXA3</italic> and <italic>HNF6</italic> in the new Figure 5 â supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors indicated that culture medium supplemented with 1mg/ml dox for the protocol duration (page 19, line 443).

If yes, then it would be helpful to elaborate on the potential implication for using the FoP-Heps in disease modelling and drug screening in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs comment and agree it would be important to validate whether doxycycline is required for the whole duration of the differentiation or only required for the initial induction of transcription factors.

This suggests that actually dox is only necessary for initial induction of the transgenes and to initiate cell commitment, which will likely lead to the expression of the endogenous transcription factors. We consider this finding very relevant for the applicability of this method into clinic as it shows the phenotype is stable even in the absence of long-term doxycycline treatment.
