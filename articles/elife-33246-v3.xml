It has alternately been argued that NAD in mammalian mitochondria arises from import of cytosolic nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), or NAD itself. We provide evidence that murine and human mitochondria take up intact NAD. Isolated mitochondria preparations cannot make NAD from NAM, and while NAD is synthesized from NMN, it does not localize to the mitochondrial matrix or effectively support oxidative phosphorylation. Treating cells with nicotinamide riboside that is isotopically labeled on the nicotinamide and ribose moieties results in the appearance of doubly labeled NAD within mitochondria. Analogous experiments with doubly labeled nicotinic acid riboside (labeling cytosolic NAD without labeling NMN) demonstrate that NAD(H) is the imported species. Our results challenge the long-held view that the mitochondrial inner membrane is impermeable to pyridine nucleotides and suggest the existence of an unrecognized mammalian NAD (or NADH) transporter.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NAD</kwd><kwd>NADH</kwd><kwd>nicotinamide</kwd><kwd>niacin</kwd><kwd>mononucleotide</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK098656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baur</surname><given-names>Joseph A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG043483</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baur</surname><given-names>Joseph A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K12DGM081259</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davila</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names><suffix>Jr.</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stable isotope labeling reveals that NAD crosses the inner membrane of mammalian mitochondria via an unknown transporter.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential reduction-oxidation (redox) cofactor as well as a cosubstrate for a growing list of enzymes. Within the mitochondria, NAD accepts electrons from a variety of sources and transfers them to complex I of the electron transport chain, ultimately resulting in the generation of ATP. In addition, NAD serves as a cosubstrate for mitochondrial sirtuins and NAD glycohydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dölle et al., 2013</xref>). Mitochondrial NAD levels vary in a circadian fashion and can directly influence fuel selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Peek et al., 2013</xref>), as well as determine cell survival under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). Despite these observations, the mechanisms responsible for generating and maintaining the mitochondrial NAD pool remain incompletely understood.</p><p>NAD can be synthesized de novo from tryptophan or via the Preiss-Handler pathway from nicotinic acid, but recycling of the nicotinamide generated by continuous enzymatic cleavage of NAD within the body requires the NAD salvage pathway. This consists of two enzymes: Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), which produces nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) in what is considered the rate-limiting step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Revollo et al., 2004</xref>), and Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs), which convert NMN to NAD. Three isoforms of NMNAT have been reported, with NMNAT1 localized to the nucleus, NMNAT2 to the Golgi apparatus and neuronal axons, and NMNAT3 to the mitochondria, providing the first evidence that mitochondria contain some of the machinery to maintain their own NAD pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2005</xref>). Nampt is primarily nuclear and cytosolic, however, a small portion co-purifies with mitochondria from liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, it was suggested that mitochondria contain a complete NAD salvage pathway and might recycle their own nicotinamide or take it up from the cytosol. Subsequently, Pittelli and colleagues failed to detect Nampt in mitochondria purified from HeLa cells and presented immunofluorescence evidence that it was excluded from the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pittelli et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, it was proposed that cytosolic NMN is taken up into mitochondria and converted to NAD via NMNAT3 to generate the mitochondrial NAD pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nikiforov et al., 2011</xref>). However, Felici et al reported that the full-length transcript for NMNAT3 is not expressed in HEK293 cells, nor in a variety of mammalian tissues, and that instead the endogenous gene produces two splice variants, one of which produces a cytosolic protein, and the other of which produces a mitochondrial protein involved in NAD cleavage rather than synthesis (FKSG76) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felici et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, mice lacking NMNAT3 were reported to have defects primarily in erythrocytes, which lack mitochondria, and to have normal NAD levels in heart, muscle, and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hikosaka et al., 2014</xref>) and normal mitochondrial NAD content in multiple tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>). Felici et al went on to show that providing intact NAD, but not any metabolic precursor, restores the mitochondrial NAD pool in cells where it was depleted by overexpression of FKSG76. They concluded that mitochondria do not synthesize NAD at all, but rather take it up intact from the cytosol, which in turn, can take up NAD from the extracellular space. This interpretation is at odds with recent findings which show that NAD and NMN must first undergo extracellular degradation to nicotinamide, nicotinic acid, or nicotinamide riboside in order to be taken up into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felici et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ratajczak et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, while yeast and plant mitochondria are known to contain NAD transporters, no mammalian counterparts have been described. Thus, the source of mitochondrial NAD remains to be firmly established.</p><p>Here we present evidence that mitochondria directly import NAD. Consistent with previous reports of NMNAT activity in mitochondrial lysates, we find that isolated mitochondria can synthesize NAD from NMN, but not from nicotinamide. However, the majority of this activity is dependent on NMNAT1, which is not mitochondrial, and results in the production of NAD outside of the organelles, rather than filling of the matrix. Using intact myotubes, we demonstrate that isotopically labeled nicotinamide riboside, which is converted to NMN by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004</xref>), contributes directly to the mitochondrial NAD pool without shuttling through an intermediary step as nicotinamide. Substituting labeled nicotinic acid riboside, which generates NAD via cytosolic NAD synthase (bypassing NMN), also results in labeling of mitochondrial NAD, suggesting that fully formed NAD, rather than NMN, is transported.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Isolated mitochondria synthesize NAD from NMN, but not from nicotinamide</title><p>We initially tested whether NAD levels would increase over time in isolated mitochondria incubated with NAD precursors. In the absence of exogenous metabolizable substrates (state 1, as defined by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chance and Williams, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nicholls and Ferguson, 1992</xref>]), warming mitochondria isolated from murine skeletal muscle resulted in a rapid loss of NAD(H) content (data not shown). With the addition of substrate (pyruvate/malate, state 2) and ADP (state 3), the rate of NAD loss was progressively slowed, and co-incubation with NMN, but not nicotinamide or nicotinic acid was found to maintain NAD levels near the starting value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To discern whether increased NAD content in the presence of NMN truly reflected new synthesis, rather than slowed degradation, we held mitochondria in state 2 for 30 min to establish a reduced NAD content, then added ADP (state 3) with or without NMN. Supplementation with NMN restored mitochondrial NAD content in a time and concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–d</xref>). Synthesis of NAD from NMN also appears to be at least partially dependent on membrane potential or ATP production, as addition of the uncoupler FCCP or the complex I inhibitor rotenone significantly attenuated the rate of NAD appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Consistently, addition of ATP instead of ADP was sufficient to promote NAD synthesis, suggesting that residual ATP present in the mitochondria after isolation was insufficient to support the NMNAT reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33246.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mitochondria synthesize NAD from nicotinamide mononucleotide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mitochondria isolated from murine skeletal muscle were maintained for 30 min at 37°C with shaking in respiratory state 3 (MirO5 respiration buffer containing 10 mM Pyruvate, 5 mM Malate, 12.5 mM ADP) supplemented with 0.5 mM NAM, NA, or NMN.

This was true whether or not exogenous phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP, the second substrate for the Nampt reaction) was supplied. Because the localization of Nampt to mitochondria was described in organelles derived from the liver, we also repeated this experiment with liver-derived mitochondria. Similar to muscle-derived mitochondria, liver-derived organelles synthesized NAD readily from NMN, but were incapable of utilizing nicotinamide to a measureable degree, whether or not PRPP was provided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). To further investigate the involvement of NAD salvage enzymes, we employed specific inhibitors of Nampt (FK866) and NMNAT (Gallotannin). As expected, Gallotannin reduced NAD synthesis from NMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), although the incomplete effect was puzzling, given that NMNAT3 is the most Gallotannin-sensitive isoform and is expected to be completely inhibited at this dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, addition of FK866 had no effect, arguing against the possibility that NMN breaks down to nicotinamide prior to incorporation into NAD.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33246.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Isolated mitochondria do not produce NAD from nicotinamide.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mitochondria isolated from murine skeletal muscle were held in respiratory state 2 for 30 min at 37°C with shaking before addition of ADP (state 3) and incubation for 60 min in the absence or presence of the precursors NMN, NAM, PRPP, or NAM and PRPP (0.5 mM).

Despite increasing NAD, NMN treatment did not lead to recovery of state three respiration in isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This suggested two possible interpretations: 1) that another form of mitochondrial damage unrelated to NAD content limited respiration, or 2) that the newly synthesized NAD was not localized in the matrix where it would be able to participate in mitochondrial metabolism. To test the latter possibility, we pelleted mitochondria after NMN treatment and compared the NAD contents of the pellet and supernatant to the whole mixture. Surprisingly, the increase in NAD was almost exclusively outside of the organelles, with no rescue of matrix NAD content after NMN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). We next considered the possibility that mitochondria are sparingly permeable to NAD directly. While low concentrations of NAD failed to have a major impact on matrix NAD content, high (5–10 mM) external NAD led to an appreciable increase. Notably, this concentration is far in excess of whole cell or tissue NAD concentration (~300–1000 μM), but is only slightly above our estimates for NAD concentration in the mitochondrial matrix (3–4 mM, based on the approximation that 1 mg of mitochondrial protein corresponds to ~1 µL of matrix volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2003</xref>]). Thus, high external concentrations may be required to create a gradient that favors import. Consistent with these findings, 10 mM external NAD prevented the loss of matrix NAD content over time in mitochondria held in state 2, and significantly slowed the decline in respiratory capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–d</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33246.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>NAD synthesized from NMN by isolated mitochondria remains outside of the organelles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) State three coupled mitochondrial oxygen consumption.

Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is taken up by cells and converted to NMN by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ratajczak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bieganowski and Brenner, 2004</xref>). We treated intact C2C12 myotubes with NR that had been isotopically labeled on both the nicotinamide ring and the ribose moieties, such that its incorporation into NMN and subsequent conversion to NAD would result in retention of both heavy isotopes, whereas degradation of NR by polynucleotide phosphorylase or enzymatic consumption of NAD to generate nicotinamide would separate the labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We detected a high proportion of doubly labeled NMN and NAD in mitochondria isolated from the myotubes, unequivocally demonstrating that cytosolic NMN contributes to mitochondrial NAD without an intermediated step involving degradation to nicotinamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>). The slightly more rapid appearance of doubly-labeled NAD in intact whole cell lysates as compared to isolated mitochondria is suggestive that at least some NAD synthesis is occurring outside of the organelles. Since NRK is not present in mitochondria, NMN must be produced in the cytosol, but these data do not allow us to distinguish whether mitochondrial NAD arises from conversion of imported NMN or from direct uptake of cytosolic NAD.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33246.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Nicotinamide riboside is incorporated intact into mitochondrial NAD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Isotopically-labeled nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinic acid (NAR) was synthesized to contain a C-13 on the pyridine carboxyl group and a deuterium on the ribose moiety (NAR labeling shown).

The final step in conversion of NAR to NAD requires the cytosolic enzyme NAD synthase (NADS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Thus, NAD synthesis from this precursor should occur only in the cytosol, and should leave NMN unlabeled. In contrast to this expectation, we found that feeding labeled NAR resulted in nearly equivalent labeling of the total and mitochondrial pools of both NAD and NMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–b</xref>). We considered several possibilities to explain the observed NMN labeling: (1) The labeled NAR could have been contaminated with labeled NR, resulting in direct production of both NAMN and NMN, (2) Given the much higher concentration of NAD in cells, non-enzymatic degradation of a small amount of labeled NAD during extraction could account for a substantial portion of the NMN signal, and (3) NMN could be generated from NAD through enzymatic processes such as reverse flux through NMNATs or degradation of NADH by the mitochondrial Nudix hydrolase Nudt13 and oxidation of the resulting NMNH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelraheim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Long et al., 2017</xref>). To be sure the parent NAR contained no detectable NR contamination we tested it against NR standards; a spike of as little as 0.01 nM NR into 1 µM M NAR was robustly detected, whereas no signal was present in the NAR alone, thereby excluding the first possibility that labeled NMN arose from contaminating NR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Notably, our data also suggest that nicotinic acid-containing nucleotides are not able to enter the mitochondria at all. While NAR was almost undetected by our techniques, we observed a dramatic exclusion of NAMN and NAAD from the mitochondrial fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Next we examined the possibility that nonenzymatic degradation of NAD might contribute to the NMN signal.

In the first, we used a CRISPR-based system to target each of the three NMNAT isoforms with two independent guide RNAs in C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All cell lines differentiated into myotubes with no apparent differences in size or structure at the end of the week-long differentiation protocol. Loss of NMNAT1 protein expression was verified by western blot, while we were unable to reliably detect NMNAT2 or NMNAT3 using available antibodies. However, reduction of mRNA expression and loss of wild type DNA sequence at the target sites were observed in the cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and data not shown). Myotube NAD content was significantly reduced in the two lines targeting NMNAT1, as compared to controls or lines targeting the other isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). There were no significant differences in mitochondrial NAD content in freshly isolated organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, ice). However, organelles from the NMNAT1-targeted lines showed increased susceptibility to NAD depletion by holding in state 2, and limited ability to synthesize NAD from NMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), supporting the model that the majority of NMNAT activity in mitochondrial preparations arises from contaminating NMNAT1, rather than matrix-localized NMNAT3. This conclusion was further supported by proteinase K treatment of mitochondrial preparations. Limited digestion removes proteins in the supernatant or on the outer mitochondrial membrane, while leaving matrix proteins intact. Accordingly, proteinase K reduced conversion of NMN to NAD without affecting respiratory capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition to reduced NAD concentration, myotubes with NMNAT1 targeted had dramatically increased NMN content in whole-cell lysates, consistent with a major role for this isoform in NAD synthesis from NMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Rescuing NMNAT1-targeted cells with human NMNAT1, which does not contain the targeted sequence, attenuated the increase in NMN concentration, and enhanced NAD synthesis from NMN by isolated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, targeting NMNAT2 or NMNAT3 did not lead to obvious changes in pyridine nucleotide distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). As hoped, treatment of NMNAT1 targeted cells with NAR led to a large discrepancy in the fractional labeling detected for the total NMN and NAD pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). This is consistent with dilution of any NMN signal that resulted from NAD hydrolysis into the larger pool of unlabeled NMN, but also consistent with the possibility that flux through NMNAT1 contributed to some labeling of NMN in wild type cells. In either case, the higher labeling of NAD as compared to NMN allowed us to resolve the source of mitochondrial nucleotides. The fractional labeling of mitochondrial pyridine nucleotide pools clearly approached that of NAD and far exceeded that of (whole cell) NMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f,g</xref>). This labeling pattern can only be explained if NAD is taken up directly by mitochondria in NMNAT1-targeted cells. Thus, our findings indicate that mitochondrial pyridine nucleotides originate from imported NAD (or NADH), rather than import of cytosolic NMN.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33246.008</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Labeling of mitochondrial NAD tracks that of total NAD, but not of total NMN.</title><p>For all panels, data representing whole cells are depicted as solid bars, whereas data from isolated mitochondria are shown with a stippled pattern.

This proposal is consistent with earlier work by Grunicke and coworkers showing that <sup>14</sup>C-labeled nicotinamide incubated with isolated mitochondria is incorporated into both NMN and NAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kun et al., 1975</xref>). However, it is possible that an exchange reaction catalyzed by NAD glycohydrolases (or sirtuins), rather than net biosynthesis could have been responsible for the labeling observed in these experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behr et al., 1981</xref>). Moreover, we were not able to observe net NAD synthesis when isolated mitochondria were supplied with nicotinamide, with or without exogenous PRPP. Importantly, we cannot exclude that PRPP might need to be generated within the mitochondrial matrix, or that mitochondrial Nampt activity might be present in certain cell types or under certain stresses. However, the present data do not support the ability of mitochondria to synthesize NAD autonomously from nicotinamide, and we note that neither Nampt nor PRPP synthetase has been reported as a mitochondrial protein in the recently updated MitoCarta2.0 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calvo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The mitochondrial localization of NMNAT3 strongly suggests that the organelles might be capable of taking up and using NMN from the cytosol when required. In agreement with previous studies detecting NMNAT activity in mitochondrial lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barile et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">VanLinden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yahata et al., 2009</xref>), we demonstrate that isolated mitochondria synthesize NAD from NMN. However, the use of intact organelles in our experiments allowed us to discern that the vast majority of, if not all NAD generated from NMN by isolated mitochondria ends up outside the matrix. Moreover, the bulk of this activity is lost when mitochondria are isolated from myotubes lacking the nuclear isoform NMNAT1, suggesting that it arises from small amounts of contamination in the mitochondrial preparations. Since NMNAT1 has been localized exclusively to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>), our observations most likely reflect nuclear contamination rather than association of NMNAT1 with the mitochondrial outer membrane. It is tempting to speculate that this might also account for the observation of Felici et al. that their mitochondrial lysates contained NMNAT activity that was not attributable to any transcript of the <italic>Nmnat3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felici et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, our data on isolated mitochondria do not provide direct evidence for the ability of NMN import to contribute to mitochondrial NAD.</p><p>While mammalian mitochondria are generally considered to be impermeable to pyridine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stein and Imai, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chappell, 1968</xref>), at least two studies have previously reported evidence for uptake of NAD. Rustin et al. reported that direct addition of NAD restored mitochondrial NAD levels and respiration rate in digitonin-permeabilized human cells that had reduced NAD content due to extended culture without medium changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rustin et al., 1996</xref>), although it is not clear that a rapid breakdown and resynthesis could be completely excluded in these experiments. Felici et al. reported evidence that in HEK293 cells, brain, skeletal muscle, and kidney, the full length transcript described for NMNAT3 does not exist, and that instead, two splice variants are detectable, encoding a cytosolic protein and the mitochondrial protein FKSG76, neither of which is translated at detectable levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felici et al., 2013</xref>). This observation is underscored by the lack of obvious phenotypes in most tissues of mice lacking the NMNAT3 gene, with the exception of erythrocytes, which have cytosolic NMNAT3 and no mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hikosaka et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of FKSG76 depletes NAD from the mitochondria of intact cells. These depleted mitochondrial NAD levels can be rescued by exogenous NAD, but not by any precursor, leading the authors to propose that intact NAD crosses the plasma membrane and subsequently enters the mitochondria directly. Notably, the NAD precursors provided by Felici et al. should all be incorporated into the nucleocytosolic pool of NAD, and thus would be available to replenish mitochondrial NAD via direct transport. The lack of rescue of FKSG76-depleted mitochondrial NAD levels after precursor treatment therefore implies that either import of precursors or NAD synthesis from them is too slow to compete with the degradation mechanism, whereas direct NAD influx is rapid, or that other aspects of NAD synthesis are impaired in these cells. In addition, it has been reported by Nikiforov et al. that pyridine nucleotides are not transported across cell membranes efficiently and are instead broken down to the corresponding nucleosides or further before being taken up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nikiforov et al., 2011</xref>). This model is distinctly at odds with the finding of Felici et al. that extracellular NAD but not nicotinamide riboside is able to restore mitochondrial NAD in cells overexpressing FKSG76.</p><p>Our studies using isotopically labeled NR and NAR unequivocally demonstrate that the mitochondrial NAD pool can be established through direct import of NAD (or NADH). Using doubly labeled NR resulted in nearly equivalent labeling of NMN and NAD in whole cell lysates or mitochondria. The existence of doubly labeled NAD within the mitochondria in this experiment proves that mitochondrial NAD synthesis does not require nicotinamide import (as this would only carry a single label), but does not distinguish whether NMN or NAD was transported. To accomplish this, we differentially labeled NAD and NMN by providing doubly labeled NAR. NAR is converted to NAD in the cytosol via NAMN and NAAD, and therefore should not label the NMN pool. Our initial experiment was compromised by hydrolysis of a minority of the NAD to NMN during extraction, but when this technical hurdle was overcome, either by CRISPR targeting of NMNAT1 to enlarge the NMN pool or by directly injecting methanolic extracts into the LC-MS to avoid hydrolysis, the expected pattern of NAD labeling without NMN labeling was obtained. Under these conditions, the mitochondrial pool of NAD was also labeled, demonstrating that it originated from imported cytosolic NAD, rather than NMN. Although it remains technically possible that cytosolic NADH could be converted to NMNH by Nudix hydrolase activity, then rapidly imported and converted to mitochondrial NADH without equilibrating with NMN, we were unable to detect labeling of NMNH in NAR-treated myotubes, and thus view this as a remote possibility.</p><p>Therefore, our results indicate that mammalian mitochondria contain an NAD or NADH transporter. While we are not the first to suggest that mitochondria can take up NAD(H), the identity of the putative transporter in mammalian mitochondria has never been elucidated and its existence continues to be debated. A number of proteins have been identified that allow NAD to cross membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruzzone et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Verderio et al., 2001</xref>), but none of these have been shown to act in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haferkamp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Palmieri, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haitina et al., 2006</xref>). The known member of the mitochondrial solute carrier family that transports NAD, SLC25A17, has been localized exclusively to peroxisomes, where it functions to exchange NAD, FAD and free CoA for adenosine 3′,5′-diphosphate, FMN and AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Palmieri, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrimi et al., 2012</xref>).

Surprisingly, this led to a slower proliferation, a significant reduction oxidative respiration and a dramatic loss of cellular ATP, which was attributed to a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">VanLinden et al., 2015</xref>). These results were interpreted to suggest that a mitochondrial NAD transporter is unlikely to exist in human cells. Nonetheless, our findings support the ability of mammalian mitochondria to import NAD and suggest that the toxicity of AtNDT2 may be more related to its specific kinetics or regulation than to a generalizable effect of NAD transport. Importantly, our findings do not exclude the possibility that NMN import and synthesis via NMNAT3 also contribute to the mitochondrial NAD pool. Indeed, Cambronne et al. recently employed a fluorescent biosensor to demonstrate that mitochondrial NAD levels are sensitive to depletion of either NMNAT3 (mitochondrial) or NMNAT2 (Golgi/cytosolic), implying that both NMN and NAD import contribute to the mitochondrial NAD pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cambronne et al., 2016</xref>). This observation suggests that a mitochondrial transporter for NMN may also await discovery. Alternatively, it is possible that NMNAT3 could function primarily to reverse NAD(H) hydrolysis or could work in combination with enzymes such as Nudt13 that generate NMN(H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelraheim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show that mammalian mitochondria are capable of directly importing NAD (or NADH). This finding strongly suggests the existence of an undiscovered transporter in mammalian mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell line (Mus musculus)</td><td valign="bottom">C2C12;

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, Davila et al. provide evidence in support of the existence of a mammalian mitochondrial NAD (or NADH) transporter. This evidence is a combination of biochemical experiments, cell-based and purified mitochondria-based isotope-labeling experiments and includes the use of a couple of genetic loss-of-function models. The evidence is quite compelling in the systems that they employ. In that regard, this is a valuable contribution to the literature and is worth publishing.</p><p>There are few experiments that need to be conducted.</p><p>1) Why does NMN in the presence of ADP (state 3) increase NAD levels? State 2 is sufficient to develop the proton-motive force (pmf). If anything the addition of ADP slightly decreases pmf.</p><p>2) I am a bit unclear about NMNAT1 localization. The investigators argue it is in the isolated mitochondria preps. Do they envision that NMNAT1 is tethered to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Can they redo their assays with Proteinase K digestion that degrades exposed proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane?</p><p>3) NMNAT1 CRISPR KO needs the appropriate control NMNAT1 cDNA rescue.</p><p>4) Can the authors provide data from human cells to support their claims? If not, please speculate upon conservation within the Discussion.</p><p>In summary, all reviewers were very favorable and kindly ask for the 4 points raised to be addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33246.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are few experiments that need to be conducted.</p><p>1) Why does NMN in the presence of ADP (state 3) increase NAD levels?

The reaction catalyzed by NMNATs is a condensation between NMN and ATP. Since our data suggest that the NMNAT reaction is occurring outside of the matrix, even any residual ATP trapped in the isolated organelles would not be available in state 2. However, the addition of ADP drastically increases the concentrations of all adenine nucleotides and allows the adenine nucleotide exchanger to transport ATP outside of the matrix. In support of this model, we find that adding ATP directly is sufficient to support NAD synthesis without the organelles ever actually entering state 3.

Can they redo their assays with Proteinase K digestion that degrades exposed proteins on the outer mitochondrial membrane?</p></disp-quote><p>Given that several groups have localized NMNAT1 only to the nucleus and not to the mitochondria by tagging/immunofluorescence (Zhang et al., 2012; Berger et al., 2005), we view it as most likely that the presence of the enzyme in our preps reflects nuclear contamination, rather than tethering to the outer membrane. As suggested, we repeated the assays with Proteinase K digestion. Proteinase K reduced the ability of mito preps to convert NMN to NAD without impairing respiratory capacity, consistent with the model that NMNAT1 is located outside of the matrix. These data have been added as Figure 6—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) NMNAT1 CRISPR KO needs the appropriate control NMNAT1 cDNA rescue.</p></disp-quote><p>The lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 strategy that we used to knock NMNAT1 in C2C12 murine myocytes can result in stable expression of the Cas9 and guide RNA. Thus, we sought to rescue the knockout cells by overexpressing the human NMNAT1 cDNA which should be resistant to the mouse-specific NMNAT1 gRNA. Human NMNAT1 cDNA significantly attenuated the increase in NMN concentration in cells lacking murine NMNAT1 and enhanced the ability of mitochondrial preps to synthesize NAD from NMN. These data have been added as Figure 6—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Can the authors provide data from human cells to support their claims? If not, please speculate upon conservation within the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the isotopic labeling experiments using human HEK293 and HL-60 cell lines. The cells were labeled with double-labeled nicotinic acid riboside (NAR) for four hours and metabolites were extracted from whole cells or mitochondrial lysates. In both cases, this strategy resulted in the appearance of doubly labeled NAD within the mitochondria, similar to the results in murine C2C12s. Unfortunately, both of the human cell lines had extremely low NMN levels that did not allow us to provide confident measurements of labeled fraction or concentration. However, given the very low abundance of NMN and knowing that NAR is not expected to generate NMN, these results again support the conclusion that NAD generated in the cytosol is taken up into mitochondria. These results have been added to Figure 7 (new panel D).</p></body></sub-article></article>
