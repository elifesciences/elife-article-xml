Here, we report that the EPAC-PKCε module has a critical role in a presynaptic form of long-term potentiation in the cerebellum and motor behavior in mice. Presynaptic cAMP−EPAC−PKCε signaling cascade induces a previously unidentified threonine phosphorylation of RIM1α, and thereby initiates the assembly of the Rab3A−RIM1α−Munc13-1 tripartite complex that facilitates docking and release of synaptic vesicles. Granule cell-specific blocking of EPAC−PKCε signaling abolishes presynaptic long-term potentiation at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapses and impairs basic performance and learning of cerebellar motor behavior. These results unveil a functional relevance of presynaptic plasticity that is regulated through a novel signaling cascade, thereby enriching the spectrum of cerebellar learning mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>Purkinje cell</kwd><kwd>protein kinase A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

has historically been viewed as a motor coordination center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito, 2005</xref>). Recent evidence implicates that the cerebellum is also involved in a variety of learning-dependent high-level behaviors, including motor precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wagner and Luo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>) as well as cognitive and emotional functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmahmann et al., 2019</xref>). The unique capability of the cerebellum to govern fine-tuned motor and cognitive skills at a high temporal resolution critically depends on delicate coordination of multiple forms of plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>). Indeed, recent studies indicate that, in addition to the renowned postsynaptic long-term depression (LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito, 2005</xref>) and long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schonewille et al., 2010</xref>), other forms of synaptic or non-synaptic plasticity may also contribute to cerebellar motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raymond and Medina, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>). Relatively speaking, the molecular underpinnings of presynaptic plasticity in the cerebellar cortex are less understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), although early studies have shown that presynaptic Ca influx, Ca-sensitive adenylate cyclase, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production are required for presynaptic LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrne and Kandel, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Storm et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, the function of presynaptic plasticity on cerebellar motor learning remains to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Guen and De Zeeuw, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>), although it was suggested that adenylyl cyclase-dependent LTP participates in rotarod learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Storm et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In particular, the function of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) on transmission release has been the subject of debate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lonart et al., 2003</xref> found that RIM1α-Ser413 is phosphorylated by PKA, which is required for presynaptic LTP. However, the mice with dysfunctional RIM1α-Ser413 mutation exhibit normal presynaptic LTP in the cerebellum and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaeser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang and Calakos, 2010</xref>), questioning the role of RIM1α-Ser413 and PKA in presynaptic LTP. Thus, how RIM1α is activated during presynaptic plasticity needs to be revisited.</p><p>In this study, we identified a new presynaptic signaling module that comprises EPAC (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) and PKCε (epsilon isozyme of protein kinase C). This signaling module controls threonine phosphorylation of RIM1α, initiates the assembly of a Rab3A-RIM1α-Munc13-1 tripartite complex, and thereby facilitates docking and release of synaptic vesicles at parallel fiber (PF) to Purkinje cell (PC) synapses, which is in line with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martín et al., 2020</xref>) showing β-adrenergic receptors/EPAC signaling modulates PF release using EPAC2 knockout mice. Importantly, presynaptic ablation of either EPAC or PKCε is sufficient to inhibit presynaptic LTP and impair motor performance and motor learning. These data unveil a new signaling cascade governing presynaptic LTP and demonstrate that presynaptic plasticity is essential to cerebellar motor learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EPAC induces PKCε-dependent threonine phosphorylation of RIM1α</title><p>In order to study the function of EPACs at synapses, a series of centrifugations were employed to prepare cerebellar synaptosomes containing a number of synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that most of EPAC1 and EPAC2 overlapped with vesicle glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which is enriched at PF terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hioki et al., 2003</xref>). Of the total synaptosomes, PF synapses (vGluT1<sup>+</sup>EAAT4<sup>+</sup>) and climbing fiber (CF) synapses (vGluT2<sup>+</sup>EAAT4<sup>+</sup>) constituted 88.8% and 7.5% of the total, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) performed using synaptosomes showed that both EPAC1 and EPAC2 were precipitated by the RIM1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating the ability of EPAC to interact with RIM1. To specify the action of EPAC, RIM1 was extracted from the synaptosomes by anti-RIM1 antibody-based co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that pan-phospho-threonine (p-Thr) antibodies detected only a weak signal in control synaptosomes, but a strong band in synaptosomes treated with 8-pCPT, a specific activator of EPAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, the level of pan-phospho-serine (p-Ser) remained unchanged after 8-pCPT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results were confirmed by co-transfecting HA-RIM1α with Flag-EPAC1 or Flag-EPAC2 in HEK cells, where both types of EPAC as well as RIM1α were preferentially distributed along cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Again, HA-RIM1α was precipitated with the HA antibody to characterize p-Ser and p-Thr of RIM1α.

Hence, forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, and ESI-09, an inhibitor of EPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017</xref>), were administered to synaptosomes, after which RIM1 p-Thr was measured. RIM1 p-Thr was vastly increased by forskolin alone, but not following co-application of both forskolin and ESI-09 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that cAMP leads to EPAC-dependent threonine phosphorylation of RIM1. We continued to examine the consequences on RIM1 phosphorylation in EPAC1 and EPAC2 double-knockout (<italic>Rapgef3/4-</italic>dKO; <italic>Rapgef3</italic> and <italic>Rapgef4</italic> are genes coding for EPAC1 and EPAC2, respectively) mice. The reason for this strategy is that EPAC1 and EPAC2 share highly conserved cAMP-binding domains, and have significant cross-talk and redundant roles in many physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>). Using synaptosomes purified from <italic>Rapgef3/4-</italic>dKO mice, we found that RIM1 p-Thr was significantly reduced, whereas RIM1 p-Ser was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Meanwhile, knockout of <italic>Rapgef3/4</italic> did not change the expression of RIM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The difference of RIM1 p-Thr in the <italic>Rapgef3/4-</italic>dKO mice was not accompanied by major structural difference, as EPAC deficiency did not interfere with lobule thickness or number of PC spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Together, these data strongly indicate that EPAC is necessary and sufficient to induce threonine phosphorylation of RIM1.</p><p>EPAC by itself lacks the kinase activity that is required for phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kawasaki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>), leading to a question how EPAC mediates the phosphorylation of RIM1. We hypothesized that EPAC might act on RIM1 through the Rap1-PLCε-PKCε module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), which is shown to be activated by EPAC in neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmidt et al., 2001</xref>), dorsal root ganglion neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hucho et al., 2005</xref>), as well as heart cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Oestreich et al., 2009</xref>). Our hypothesis was corroborated by several lines of evidence. First, when Flag-EPAC1 and Flag-EPAC2 were expressed in HEK cells, the phosphorylation at PKCε-S729 was significantly increased by either EPAC1 or EPAC2 expression, whereas the phosphorylation at PKCα-S657 or PKCα-T638 was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Second, PKCε overlapped with vGluT1 in cerebellar synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), suggesting the presence of PKCε at PF synapses. Western blots showed that phosphorylation at PKCε-S729, but not at PKCα-S657 or PKCα-T638, was increased in cerebellar synaptosomes treated with 8-pCPT, whereas control buffer had no impact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Third, phosphorylation at PKCε-S729 in the synaptosomes was significantly reduced by EPAC ablation (<italic>Rapgef3/4-</italic>dKO versus WT), whereas phosphorylation at PKCα-S657 or PKCα-T638 was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These data indicate that EPAC is able to regulate PKCε activity. We next investigated whether PKCε can phosphorylate RIM1α. HA-RIM1α and His-PKCε were co-transfected into HEK cells and co-IP experiments showed that PKCε can bind to RIM1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). In addition, RIM1α p-Thr was significantly increased in cells transfected with PKCε compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). To confirm in vitro findings, we generated mice with <italic>Prkce</italic> (the gene coding for PKCε) deletion specifically in cerebellar granule cells (<italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO) by crossing <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) with <italic>Prkce</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–F</xref>), and <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mice showed normal lobule thickness and number of spines of PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3G–H</xref>). Subsequently, RIM1 phosphorylation was examined in cerebellar synaptosomes derived from <italic>Prkce</italic><sup>f/f</sup> and <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mice. Similar to the findings in <italic>Rapgef3/4-</italic>dKO mice, RIM1 p-Thr was significantly reduced, whereas both RIM1 p-Ser and total RIM1 were unchanged in <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). These data indicate that PKCε is able to regulate RIM1 p-Thr phosphorylation.</p><p>Finally, several lines of evidence demonstrated the causal relationship between EPAC and PKCε on the phosphorylation of RIM1α. First, we applied 8-pCPT alone or with εV1-2 (a selective PKCε inhibitor) to WT synaptosomes. The addition of εV1-2 to the synaptosomes strongly attenuated RIM1 p-Thr induced by 8-pCPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). In contrast, RIM1 p-Thr was not affected by co-application of Gӧ6976, a PKCα/β inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Second, we administered phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of all PKC isoforms, alone or along with εV1-2 or Gӧ6976, so as to inhibit PKCε or PKCα/β, respectively. εV1-2, but not Gӧ6976, significantly suppressed RIM1α p-Thr in the synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). Third, RIM1 phosphorylation was examined in <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO synaptosomes, which were treated with either control saline or 8-pCPT. In this scenario, neither p-Thr nor p-Ser of RIM1 was changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Overall, these data strongly indicate that EPAC can trigger RIM1α p-Thr phosphorylation and that this activation requires PKCε.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>EPAC-PKCε module is critical to vesicle docking and presynaptic release through acting on the Rab3A-RIM1α-Munc13-1 complex</title><p>Our finding that the EPAC-PKCε module regulates RIM1 activity through phosphorylation leads to an interesting question: whether the EPAC-PKCε module functions on synaptic formation and function through acting on RIM1, which is known to be critical to organization of the presynaptic active zone and neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schoch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaeser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Persoon et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To address this question, we first visualized PF-PC synapses using transmission electron microscopy (EM), in which PF boutons were identified by their presence of synaptic vesicles as well as their asymmetric synaptic contacts with PC spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

A decrease in mEPSC frequency may be due to a reduction in release probability (Pr). To determine if Pr is affected following deletion of presynaptic EPAC and PKCε, we used a repeated stimulation protocol to estimate the readily releasable pool (RRP) as well as Pr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thanawala and Regehr, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2019</xref>).

Furthermore, we examined the evoked PF-PC EPSCs with different stimulation intensities (3–15 μA) in control and mutant mice.

These recordings, together with the EM experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), indicate that EPAC-PKCε module is important to presynaptic transmitter release at PF-PC synapses.</p><p>We continued to explore how exactly the EPAC-PKCε module modulates synaptic release. An essential process during neurotransmitter release is that Rab3A, RIM1α and Munc13-1 form a tripartite complex and act in concert to dock synaptic vesicles to a release-competent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dulubova et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we investigated whether the EPAC-PKCε module acts on the Rab3A-RIM1α-Munc13-1 complex. By measuring the ratios of IP/input in co-IP assay of synaptosome extracts, we found that both Munc13-1 and Rab3A had significantly weaker binding ability with RIM1α in both <italic>Rapgef3/4-</italic>dKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) and <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) synaptosomes, as compared to WT and <italic>Prkce</italic><sup>f/f</sup> respectively. In contrast, neither EPAC nor PKCε ablation changed the expression levels of Rab3A and Munc13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). These data indicate that the deficiency of either EPAC or PKCε impairs protein interactions in the Rab3A-RIM1α-Munc13-1 complex.</p><p>In another set of experiments, we studied whether the EPAC-PKCε module is sufficient to boost protein interactions in the Rab3A-RIM1α-Munc13-1 complex. First, we treated WT synaptosomes with 8-pCPT and εV1-2, and measured the amount of Munc13-1 and Rab3A precipitated with RIM1. The quantification showed a significant increment of precipitated Munc13-1 and Rab3A when synaptosomes were incubated with 8-pCPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Second, we measured the amounts of precipitated Munc13-1 and Rab3A in WT synaptosomes treated with FR236924, a selective activator of PKCε. We found that precipitations of Munc13-1 and Rab3A were both increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These data indicate that either EPAC or PKCε is sufficient to promote the formation of the tripartite complex. In parallel experiments, PKCε inhibitor εV1-2 prevented the increase of precipitated Munc13-1 and Rab3A induced by 8-pCPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), while FR236924 failed to induce more precipitations of Munc13-1 and Rab3A in <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).

Next, we wondered which downstream effector, EPAC or PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>), is responsible for cAMP-induced potentiation. The role of PKA in presynaptic LTP has been contradicted by the studies showing that presynaptic LTP is intact when serine phosphorylation of RIM1 by PKA is interrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaeser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang and Calakos, 2010</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lonart et al., 2003</xref>).

These findings inspired us to investigate whether perhaps the EPAC-PKCε module mediates cAMP-triggered EPSC potentiation.</p><p>We made whole-cell recordings from PCs and evoked PF-EPSCs every 30 s in <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, <italic>Rapgef3;Rapgef4-</italic>cKO and <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mice. In <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> control mice, external application of forskolin produced a long-lasting elevation in PF-EPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), with a peak potentiation of 366 ± 25% (at 48–50 min; n=15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, simultaneous ablation of EPAC1 and EPAC2 at presynaptic sites prominently affected the synaptic potentiation induced by forskolin application (162 ± 18% at 48–50 min; n=12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Next, we incubated <italic>Rapgef3;Rapgef4-</italic>cKO PCs along with PKA antagonist KT5720 (3 μM) and again examined forskolin-induced EPSC potentiation. In this case, we found that combined blockade of EPAC and PKA completely eliminated the action of forskolin on EPSC potentiation (106 ± 4% at 48–50 min; n=12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). We continued to examine the effect of PKCε on cAMP-triggered EPSC potentiation using <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mice. Similar to <italic>Rapgef3;Rapgef4-</italic>cKO mice, the forskolin-induced potentiation in <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO PCs was significantly attenuated (198 ± 5% at 48–50 min; n=12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Again, the remaining potentiation was further blocked by the addition of KT5720 (101 ± 3% at 48–50 min; n=12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). The inhibitory effect of KT5720 on forskolin-induced potentiation was also examined by applying it alone in <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> PCs. We found that KT5720 inhibited the potentiation by 15%, a smaller effect than that of EPAC or PKCε ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that EPAC, PKCε and PKA all mediate cAMP-induced potentiation of transmitter release. In parallel with the observation of EPSC amplitude, PPF was monitored during the whole cell recordings. Forskolin application led to a significant reduction in PPF ratio of PF-EPSCs in <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, this reduction was significantly less when presynaptic of both types of EPAC as well as PKCε were ablated and KT5720 was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results highlight that EPAC and PKCε function synergically on the synaptic release at PF-PC synapses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>cAMP-triggered PF facilitation is dependent on EPAC and PKCε.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The facilitation of PF-EPSCs by forskolin (FSK) (20 μM) in <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, <italic>Rapgef3;Rapgef4-</italic>cKO and <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mice.

Via its presynaptic actions, the EPAC-PKCε module contributes to adaptation of compensatory eye movements, a motor learning task that depends on the vestibulo-cerebellum.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Threonine phosphorylation of RIM1α by the EPAC-PKCε module</title><p>Our finding that the EPAC-PKCε module can phosphorylate RIM1α raises a simple but fascinating mechanistic concept that the phosphorylation level of RIM1α determines presynaptic release. RIM1α specifically interacts with a number of presynaptic proteins, such as Munc13-1, liprin-α and ELKS, so as to form a scaffold complex regulating homeostatic release of synaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sudhof, 2004</xref>). RIM1α can be phosphorylated at two serine residues by PKA and CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lonart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2003</xref>), which promotes its interaction with 14-3-3 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2003</xref>). The current work advances on this concept by showing that RIM1α can also be phosphorylated at its threonine sites by PKCε. Moreover, our data demonstrate the functional implication consequence of threonine phosphorylation of RIM1α at PF-PC synapses: it promotes the assembly of the Rab3A-RIM1α-Munc13-1 complex and is essential for the induction of presynaptic PF-PC LTP, suggesting that a fast switch between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of RIM1α may regulate presynaptic potentials during dynamic synaptic events. This new mechanistic concept is in line with the notion that synaptic vesicle proteins, such as RIM1α, often exhibit stimulation-dependent changes in phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kohansal-Nodehi et al., 2016</xref>). It remains to be elucidated how threonine and serine phosphorylations of RIM1α may exert distinct downstream effects. For instance, one could speculate that the threonine loci of RIM1α lead to more prominent conformational changes, allowing RIM1α to bind to active zone proteins. Here, we simultaneously deleted EPAC1 and EPAC2 in the granule cells, leaving the question open whether one might dominate the modulation of Rim1α phosphorylation. Similarly, it would be of interest to investigate the role of Rap1, the presynaptically expressed substrate of EPAC a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2012</xref>), on RIM1α phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Distinct roles of EPAC and PKA at synapses</title><p>cAMP-mediated signaling pathways that are mediated by EPAC and PKA regulate a multitude of physiological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>).

Indeed, the specific domains endow EPAC and PKA with different and even opposite functions.

Some studies indicate that presynaptic potentiation depends predominantly on PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Linden and Ahn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lev-Ram et al., 2002</xref>), whereas others advocate a more critical role for EPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaneko and Takahashi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martín et al., 2020</xref>). Our results highlight that ablation of either EPAC or PKCε by itself is not sufficient to block forskolin-induced synaptic potentiation, but that supplementing this with a blockage of PKA causes a complete blockage. These results demonstrate that EPAC and PKA can conjunctively regulate synaptic potentiation. Even so, our results clarify that the impact of EPAC on cAMP-induced EPSC potentiation is dominant, as it has the strongest contribution to the forskolin-induced increase of EPSC amplitude. Alternatively, PKA warrants a minimum level of potentiation that may be required under particular circumstances when EPAC is not active.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The EPAC-PKCε module regulates synaptic release and is required for presynaptic LTP</title><p>Our EM analysis shows that the number of docked vesicles at the PF terminals of <italic>Rapgef3/4-</italic>dKO and <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mutants is reduced, whereas the general structure of PF-PC synapses is unchanged. As the ablation of either EPAC or PKCε attenuated protein interactions in the Rab3A-RIM1α-Munc13-1 complex, which is required for the docking and priming of presynaptic vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schoch et al., 2002</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sudhof, 2004</xref><italic>;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferrero et al., 2013</xref>), the reduction in docked vesicles in <italic>Rapgef3/4-</italic>dKO and <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mice can be readily explained. In parallel with our observations at the ultrastructural level, we found that mice with presynaptic deletion of EPAC and PKCε displayed obvious defects in synaptic release at the electrophysiological level. Although early studies have shown that EPAC1 and EPAC2 are involved in synaptic release in the hippocampus and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>), which was further strengthened by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martín et al., 2020</xref>, our finding that PKCε acts as the downstream effector of EPAC and regulates presynaptic release is novel. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that presynaptic PKCε is required for presynaptic LTP at PF-PC synapses. These findings expand the repertoire of forms of PC plasticity that are driven by cAMP signaling.</p><p>The role of the cAMP-PKA cascade in presynaptic LTP has been extensively debated. Early studies claimed that PKA and RIM1α serine phosphorylation are critical for the induction of presynaptic LTP at PF-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lonart et al., 2003</xref>). However, this conclusion was challenged by follow-up studies, demonstrating that RIM1α-S413A mutant mice exhibit normal presynaptic LTP in both cerebellum and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaeser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang and Calakos, 2010</xref>). In our opinion, a couple of caveats must be considered regarding the function of PKA in presynaptic LTP. First, cAMP analogs (Rp-8-CPT-cAMP-S and Sp-8CPT-cAMP-S) used in two studies advocating that PKA mediates presynaptic PF-PC LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lonart et al., 2003</xref>) are able to regulate Rap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roscioni et al., 2009</xref>), which is a direct substrate of EPAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Rooij et al., 1998</xref>). Therefore, these cAMP analogs may also act through the EPAC-PKCε module. Second, KT5720 at 10 μm, a concentration used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lonart et al., 2003</xref>, can alter a range of protein kinases, including phosphorylase kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, PKBα, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, as well as AMP-activated protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brushia and Walsh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murray, 2008</xref>). Thus, KT5720 at this concentration has numerous side-effects next to its ability to inhibit PKA. In contrast, our results derived from cell-specific mouse lines consistently converge on the concept that presynaptic PF-PC LTP depends on the EPAC-PKCε module. More specifically, our data demonstrate that repetitive 8 Hz PF stimulation increases the level of cAMP and consequently activates EPAC and PKCε, which in turn induces threonine phosphorylation of RIM1α, suggesting a phospho-switch machinery that can tune presynaptic PF-PC LTP.</p><p>Our finding that the EPAC-PKCε module is a central component for synaptic release and presynaptic LTP may not stand on its own. In fact, EPAC is involved in cellular processes like cell adhesion, cell-cell junction formation, exocytosis and secretion, cell differentiation, as well as cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>), while PKCε is necessary for sperm exocytosis in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lucchesi et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these lines of evidence suggest that the EPAC-PKCε module might be a widespread mechanism controlling not only synaptic release in nerve cells, but also granule secretion in endocrine or proliferating cells. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017</xref> showed that EPAC may regulate GluA3 conductance in PCs, suggesting that postsynaptic EPAC or PKCε may regulate the conductance of AMPA receptor subunits, and thereby postsynaptic LTP or LTD at PF-PC synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of presynaptic LTP in motor behavior</title><p>Many studies have explored the potential functional role of postsynaptic plasticity at PC synapses, in particular that of PF-PC LTP and PF-PC LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raymond and Medina, 2018</xref>). The picture emerging from these studies is that postsynaptic PF-PC LTP and PF-PC LTD play an important role in forms of learning that are mediated by the so-called upbound and downbound modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>). Whereas VOR adaptation is mainly mediated by upbound microzones in the vestibulo-cerebellum that increase the simple spike frequency during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Voges et al., 2017</xref>), eyeblink conditioning is predominantly regulated by downbound microzones in lobule simplex that decrease simple spikes during learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">ten Brinke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, what is the role of presynaptic LTP at PF-PC synapses? Even though it has been suggested more than a decade ago that the functional role of presynaptic plasticity at PF-PC synapses during learning can be expected to align with that of postsynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Guen and De Zeeuw, 2010</xref>), evidence has been largely lacking.</p><p>Here, we found that <italic>Rapgef3;Rapgef4-</italic>cKO and <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mice, which showed reduced PF-PC transmission and lack presynaptic LTP, exhibit deficits in basic motor performance, in the form of an affected OKR and VOR, as well as in gain-decrease and phase reversal learning of their VOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, presynaptic ablation of EPACs or PKCε results in altered gain and phase values of their OKR and VOR. Interestingly, the impairments in OKR and VOR caused by deletion of EPAC1/EPAC2 or PKCε in granule cells were similar to those caused by global deletion of EPAC. This finding raises the possibility that presynaptic EPAC is in fact more critical for basic motor performance than postsynaptic EPAC. This possibility is compatible with previous work showing that mice with a PC-specific deletion of GluA3, which leads to a lack of postsynaptic LTP mediated by EPAC, have hardly any significant deficit in basic motor performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gutierrez-Castellanos et al., 2017</xref>). By the same argument, the contribution of presynaptic LTP to phase reversal learning might be more in line with that of postsynaptic PF-PC LTP in that <italic>Rapgef3;Rapgef4-</italic>cKO and <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mice showed similar deficits as PC-specific GluA3 knockouts. The prediction that the impact of presynaptic plasticity at PF-PC synapses during learning operates in a synergistic fashion with that of postsynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Guen and De Zeeuw, 2010</xref>), does in this respect hold. Two caveats should be considered in the present studies. First, <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>-induced deletion of EPAC or PKCε might affect the function of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), which are involved in cerebellar ataxias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kreko-Pierce et al., 2020</xref>). However, we believe that the EPAC-PKCε module regulates VOR learning through presynaptic plasticity mechanism at PF-PC synapses rather than UBCs, in line with the observations in other granule-cell-specific mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Galliano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schonewille et al., 2021</xref>). Second, presynaptic PF-PC LTP was performed in the cerebellar vermis in the present work, whereas VOR learning generally requires PC activity in the flocculus. Unfortunately, we found that PC-EPSCs in the flocculus were not suitable to record PC plasticity because they were unstable.</p><p>Although we observed only a difference in phase at the end of VOR phase reversal training, it should be noted that the gain was different on multiple days in both <italic>Rapgef3;Rapgef4-</italic>cKO and <italic>Prkce-</italic>cKO mice compared to their controls. VOR phase reversal training subjects to multiple days of changing training stimuli to test different aspects of adaptation. The first aim is to decrease the gain, followed by an increase in phase. Once the phase has increased above 120<sup>o</sup>, the gain will increase again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wulff et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the initial decrease of gain followed by the late-stage increase presumably underlies the absence of differences in gain between control and mutant groups in days 4 and 5. This does not imply that presynaptic LTP is more essential for the phase than the gain, as VOR gain decrease is affected during the first day of training.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Original breeding pairs of <italic>Rapgef3/4-</italic>dKO and <italic>Atoh1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice were obtained from Youmin Lu (Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China) and Wei Mo (Xiamen University, Xiamen, China), respectively. <italic>Rapgef3</italic><sup>f/f</sup>, <italic>Rapgef4</italic><sup>f/f</sup> and <italic>Prkce</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice were made by us with the assistance of GemPharmatech (Soochow, Jiangsu, China) and Nanjing Biomedical Research Institute (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China).

After recovery for 30 min at 37 °C, slices were placed in a submerged chamber that was perfused at 2 ml/min with aCSF supplemented with GABAzine (10 μM) during recordings.</p><p>PCs were visualized under an upright microscope (BX51, Olympus) equipped with a 40×water-immersion objective and infrared differential interference contrast enhancement. Whole-cell recordings were made on PCs from lobules IV-V with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Currents were digitized at 10 kHz and filtered at 3 kHz. Patch electrodes (3–5 MΩ) were filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM) 135 Cs-methanesulfonate, 10 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, and 0.4 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP (pH 7.3, OSM 290). PCs were held at –70 mV to prevent spontaneous spikes that might escape clamp. For PF stimulation, standard patch pipettes were filled with aCSF and placed in middle third of molecular layer. Presynaptic PF-PC LTP was induced by stimulating PF input 120 times at 8 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaeser et al., 2008</xref>). Postsynaptic PF-PC LTP was obtained when PFs were stimulated at 1 Hz for 5 min in parallel with current-clamp of recording PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). PF-LTD was induced by a conjunction of 5 PF-pulses at 100 Hz and a 100 ms long depolarization of PC to 0 mV, which was repeated 30 times with an interval of 2 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). mEPSCs were recorded in whole-cell configuration in the presence of tetrodotoxin (0.5 μM) and an offline analysis was conducted using a sliding template algorithm (ClampFit 10, Molecular Device) according to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). To estimate RRP and Pr, a repeated 100 Hz train stimulation protocol was used to evoke 50 EPSCs. RRP was calculated by linear interpolating the linear portion of the cumulative EPSC amplitude plot to virtual stimulus 0. Pr was calculated as the normalized 1st EPSC during the train stimulations divided by RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thanawala and Regehr, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2019</xref>). A temperature controller was used to elevate aCSF temperature in the recording chamber (TC-344C; Warner Instruments, Holliston, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Compensatory eye movement test</title><p>Mice (P60) were surgically prepared for head-restrained recordings of compensatory eye movements. A pedestal was attached to the skull after shaving and opening the skin overlaying it, using Optibond primer and adhesive (Kerr, Bioggio, Switzerland) and under isoflurane anesthesia in O2 (induction with 4% and maintained at 1.5% concentration). Mice were administered xylocaine and an injection with bupivacaine hydrochloride (2.5 mg/ml, bupivacaine actavis) to locally block sensation. The pedestal consisted of a brass holder (7×4 mm base plate) with a neodymium magnet (4×4 × 2 mm) and a screw hole for fixation. After a recovery period of at least 3 days, mice were placed in a mouse holder, using the magnet and a screw to fix the pedestal to a custom-made restrainer, and the mouse was placed with the head in the center on a turntable (diameter 60 cm) in the experimental setup. A drum (diameter 63 cm) surrounded the mouse during the experiment. The recording camera was calibrated by moving the camera left–right by 20° peak to peak at different light levels. Compensatory eye movement performance was examined by recording the OKR, VOR, and VVOR using a sinusoidal rotation of the drum in light (OKR), rotation of the table in the dark (VOR), or rotation of the table (VVOR) in the light. These reflexes were evoked by rotating the table and/or drum at 0.1–1 Hz (20–8 cycles, each recorded twice) with a fixed 5° amplitude. In order to evaluate motor learning, a mismatch between visual and vestibular input was used to adapt the VOR. The ability to perform VOR phase reversal was tested using a 5 day paradigm, consisting of six 5 minute training sessions every day with VOR recordings before, between, and after the training sessions. On the first day during training, the visual and vestibular stimuli rotated in phase at 0.6 Hz and at the same amplitude, inducing a decrease of gain. On the subsequent days, the drum amplitude was increased relative to the table and induced the phase reversal of the VOR, resulting in a compensatory eye movement in the same direction as the head rotation instead of the normal compensatory opposite direction (all days vestibular 5° rotation, visual day 2: 5°; day 3, 7.5°; days 4–5, 10°). Between recording sessions, mice were kept in the dark to avoid unlearning of the adapted responses.</p><p>Eye movements were recorded with a video-based eye-tracking system (hard- and software, ETL-200; ISCAN systems, Burlington, MA). Recordings were always taken from the left eye. The eye was illuminated during the experiments using two table-fixed infrared emitters (output 600 mW, dispersion angle 7°, peak wavelength 880 nm) and a third emitter that was mounted to the camera, aligned horizontally with the optical axis of the camera, which produced the tracked corneal reflection. Pupil size and corrected (with corneal reflection) vertical and horizontal pupil positions were determined by the ISCAN system, filtered (CyberAmp; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA), digitized (CED, Cambridge, UK) and stored for offline analysis. All eye movement signals were calibrated, differentiated to obtain velocity signals, and high-pass–filtered to eliminate fast phases, and then cycles were averaged. Gain—the ratio of eye movement amplitude to stimulus amplitude—and phase values—time difference between eye and stimulus expressed in degrees—of eye movements were calculated using custom-made MATLAB routines (The MathWorks, Natick, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Experimenters who performed experiments and analyses were blinded to the genotypes until all data were integrated. Data were analyzed using Igor Pro 6.0 (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), Graphpad Prism (San Diego, CA), SPSS 16.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL), and MATLAB. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, which were based on our previous studies. All data sets were tested for the assumptions of normality of distribution. No data were excluded except electrophysiological recordings with ≥15% variance in series resistance, input resistance, or holding current. Standard deviations for control were calculated from the average of all control data. Statistical differences were determined using unpaired or paired two-sided Student’s <italic>t</italic> test for two-group comparison, or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons, or repeated measures ANOVA for repeated measures. The accepted level of significance was p&lt;0.05. ‘<italic>n’</italic> represents the number of preparations or cells.

plasticity contribute to learning and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, Wang and colleagues show that presynaptic long-term potentiation at the parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse is required for one form of motor learning, and involves a previously-unknown signaling cascade, where EPAC activation leads to PKCε-dependent threonine phosphorylation of RIM1α. The evidence is compelling and convincing.

My primary concern is the manner in which the authors choose to refer to previous studies, which seem designed to highlight the novelty of their work rather than provide context and information for the reader. For example, Line 44 &quot;However, the molecular underpinnings of presynaptic plasticity in the cerebellar cortex are merely starting to be explored (Wang et al., 2021a)&quot; is a baffling statement, given that the molecules involved in presynaptic LTP at this synapse have been described since the 1990s in studies like Salin et al., 1996 (cited by the authors), and Storm et al. 1998 (uncited).</p><p>Line 45: &quot;whether presynaptic plasticity plays a role in cerebellar motor learning remains to be elucidated&quot;. Again, Storm et al. 1998 showed impaired rotarod performance and learning in AC1 knockout mice. The genetic manipulations in the current study are far cleaner than Storm et al., and the physiology and behavior are more convincing, but they should not minimize the impact of past studies.</p><p>The introduction and beginning of the results provide no context for the authors' decision to study EPAC. I can only assume that the results of Martin et al. 2020 provided a compelling rationale for this study, and think it should be included in the introduction.</p><p>2. Figure 1C: The statement that ENACs bind to RIM would be more convincing if the authors provide a negative control showing that the assay does not detect another presynaptic protein that does not interact with RIM does not appear in the pulldown. That said, interactions between ENAC and RIM have been reported before, and those studies could be cited.</p><p>3. Figure 2E, F: I have multiple concerns with this data. First, the RRP is calculated from EPSC trains collected evoked by only 40 stimuli. 40 stimuli are insufficient to reach a steady state at PF-PC synapses, which is evident in the example EPSC traces. Without reaching a steady state, it is impossible to estimate the resupply rate. Thus the RRP measurements are not accurate. Second: Without an accurate measure of the RRP, the initial release probability cannot be determined. Finally, although Line 166 states that the RRP was significantly reduced in the mutant mice, that data is not presented in the text of the figure. Instead, the figure shows the &quot;cumulative EPSC&quot;, which is highly dependent on the number of presynaptic terminals that were stimulated. The average RRP sizes, measured by back extrapolation, actually appear to be very similar across genotypes. The authors should not make claims about release probability or RRP unless they repeat these experiments with longer stimulus trains that reach steady state amplitudes, and the RRP is normalized to the size of the initial EPSC in each experiment.</p><p>4. Line 240: &quot;However, it remains unclear which downstream effector, EPAC or PKA (Cheng et al., 2008), is responsible for cAMP-induced potentiation.&quot; Martin et al. 2020 present compelling evidence that presynaptic LTP is driven by EPAC at the PF-PC synapse. This study is cited obliquely, and should not be ignored to enhance the novelty of the current study. For example, Line 433 understates the relevance of Martin to the current study: &quot;EPAC1 and EPAC2 have been shown to be involved in synaptic release in the hippocampus and cerebellum&quot;.</p><p>5. The rationale for proceeding immediately to EPAC1/2 DKOs was not clear, leaving the reader to guess the reason? Are EPAC1/2 redundant in the EPAC-Rim1 pathway, or does one isoform dominate in potentiating this synapse? Could the authors make it clear why all experiments were done with DKOs?</p><p>6. Figure 4: What concentration of KT5720 was used to inhibit PKA? The authors note on Line 441 that previous studies used 10 microM, a concentration that produces off-target effects, but I cannot find the concentration the authors used. From their experiments, the authors conclude that the EPAC-PKC module is dominant in driving forskolin-induced potentiation. However, an obvious experiment would have been to apply KT to the control animals (Math1-Cre). This would rule out the possibility that PKA is activated somewhere within the EPAC-PKC, and plays a major role in potentiation.</p><p>7. The authors hypothesize that PLC is involved in this pathway (line 93 and Figure 1). They might use the discussion to highlight which aspects of their signaling pathway remain to be experimentally verified in presynaptic LTP.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The introduction part should elaborate more on the rationale behind the selection of EPAC to conduct the study of presynaptic plasticity.</p><p>The activities of EPAC and PKCε required for presynaptic LTP are shown. However, the change of the basal synaptic properties due to the knockdown of two proteins is not shown, such as the input-output relation of evoked EPSC in the PF-PC synapse. Therefore, studying the protein during the normal condition may be of interest.</p><p>The visual diagram (Figure 1G) of the authors' hypothesis on a process describing EPAC-mediated phosphorylation of RIM1 is a bit difficult to follow. Arrows may be indicated with more comprehensible signs/ words.</p><p>Following the compensatory eye movement training, the deficit is more prominent in phase than gain. Mutants catch up the gain at the end of 5 days of training but not the phase. The authors may explain how the presynaptic LTP is more essential to phase in the discussion. In addition, the reason to choose VOR phase reversal learning other than OKR learning or VOR gain-up learning may be related to this discussion.</p><p>In the discussion part, some more thoughts and scientific predictions of the limited role of EPAC and PKCε on postsynaptic plasticity should be stated.</p><p>Overall, specific claims made by the authors were straightforward and supported by an ample amount of experimental results. This study has widened the spectrum of understanding of the molecular complexity of cerebellar motor learning by demonstrating the active contribution of presynaptic plasticity and its related signaling cascade.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The conclusions often overstate the findings of the data. The language can be toned-down a without diminishing the importance of these findings.</p><p>In the present form, I don't think the cumulative EPSC analysis is informative. The authors should repeat the analysis using the Elmqvist and Quastel (EQ) method (see Thanawala and Regher, 2016). This method is more reliable at low Pr and can provide (when combined with the Train method) a high and low bracket of possible Pr and RRP values. Ideally, the authors would redo these experiments with a higher stimulus frequency. It would also be helpful to show a simple PPR value for each genotype. This can be done without additional experiments.</p><p>Slice conditions in LTP/LTD experiments (age, location, temperature, Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration) do not match in vivo conditions. These differences and potential changes in synaptic plasticity should be discussed.</p><p>Is it possible to provide an estimate of what percent of synaptosomes arise from parallel fibers versus mossy fibers (which also express VGLUT1) based on the relative number of each synapse? This would help the interpretation of the synaptosome data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80875.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) 1.

In particular, the sentences and references that the reviewer indicated have been modified and added, respectively. “Relatively speaking, the molecular underpinnings of presynaptic plasticity in the cerebellar cortex are less understood (Wang et al., 2021a), though early studies have shown that presynaptic Ca influx, Ca-sensitive adenylate cyclase, and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production are required for presynaptic LTP (Byrne and Kandel, 1996; Salin et al., 1996; Storm et al., 1998)” (Line 45).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 45: &quot;whether presynaptic plasticity plays a role in cerebellar motor learning remains to be elucidated&quot;.

We actually started this project in 2014, and finished part of current data and submitted the manuscript entitled “EPAC-PKCε Module Induces Threonine Phosphorylation of RIM1 and Presynaptic Long-Term Potentiation” to Neuron on August 2018. In that cover letter of Neuron submission, we wrote “To our knowledge, the present work provides compelling evidence to answer two major neuroscientific questions: (1) Compared to postsynaptic plasticity, the molecular underpinnings for the plastic changes at presynaptic side are poorly understood. It is shown that presynaptic LTP requires cAMP and scaffold protein RIM1α. However, to what extent these two processes are related and through which binding partners and/or enzymatic processes remains to be elucidated (Le Guen and De Zeeuw, Funct. Neurol., 2010); (2) Lonart et al. (Cell, 2003) found that RIM1α-Ser413 is phosphorylated by PKA, which is required for presynaptic LTP. However, mice with a Ser413 mutation exhibit normal presynaptic LTP in the cerebellum and the hippocampus (Kaeser et al., PNAS, 2008; Yang and Calakos, J Neurosci, 2010), questioning the central roles of RIM1α-Ser413 and PKA in presynaptic LTP and how phosphorylation of RIM1α comes about… Here, we show that, upon cAMP activation, EPAC (a cAMP target protein) induces PKCε-dependent threonine phosphorylation of RIM1α and that presynaptic parallel fiber-Purkinje cell LTP depends on an EPAC-PKCε module.” Therefore to be frank, our decision to study EPAC in PCs was based on the prevailing scientific questions.</p><p>Although three reviewers agreed to the conceptual advance and found it interesting, they finally rejected the submission with two major reasons: (1) the knockout was not cell specific (EPAC1 and EPAC2 double knockout was used in that submission); (2) there was no behavioral study.

Figure 2E, F: I have multiple concerns with this data. First, the RRP is calculated from EPSC trains collected evoked by only 40 stimuli. 40 stimuli are insufficient to reach a steady state at PF-PC synapses, which is evident in the example EPSC traces. Without reaching a steady state, it is impossible to estimate the resupply rate. Thus the RRP measurements are not accurate. Second: Without an accurate measure of the RRP, the initial release probability cannot be determined. Finally, although Line 166 states that the RRP was significantly reduced in the mutant mice, that data is not presented in the text of the figure. Instead, the figure shows the &quot;cumulative EPSC&quot;, which is highly dependent on the number of presynaptic terminals that were stimulated. The average RRP sizes, measured by back extrapolation, actually appear to be very similar across genotypes. The authors should not make claims about release probability or RRP unless they repeat these experiments with longer stimulus trains that reach steady state amplitudes, and the RRP is normalized to the size of the initial EPSC in each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable feedback. Combined with the suggestion of the reviewer#3, we have redone the RRP and Pr experiments using a 100-Hz train (instead of 20-Hz which was used in the previous submission). This method has allowed us to have a much better estimation on RRP and Pr at PF-PC synapses, according to Thanawala and Regher (2016). The new results have been presented in new Figure 2E and 2F.</p><p>Question #1: in new experiments, we have paid particular attention to ensure that recorded EPSCs reached a steady-state level by giving 50 stimuli, so that the regression can be conducted using at least 20 data points for the back extrapolation.</p><p>Questions #2 and #3, we have created a linear fit from normalized steady-state</p><p>EPSCs and back-extrapolated the curve to the y-axis to obtain the RRP. Our results showed that RRP was similar between control and cKO mice (Math1-cre: 861 ± 113 vs <italic>Epac1</italic><sup>cKO</sup>;<italic>Epac2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> 790 ± 101, <italic>p</italic> = 0.31; PKCε<sup>f/f</sup> 764 ± 100 vs PKCε<sup>cKO</sup> 728 ± 106, <italic>p</italic> = 0.40). Actually, there was also no difference in RRP between control and cKO mice in our previous submission, but we incorrectly wrote “repeated stimulation (20 Hz) revealed significant reductions in both RRP and Pr in <italic>Epac1</italic><sup>cKO</sup>;<italic>Epac2</italic><sup>cKO</sup> (<italic>Figure 2E</italic>) and <italic>Prkce</italic><sup>cKO</sup> mice (<italic>Figure 2F</italic>)”.

We have modified the paragraph in Line 283 to “Next, we wondered which downstream effector, EPAC or PKA (Cheng et al., 2008), is responsible for cAMP-induced potentiation.

Moreover, Martín et al. (2020) showed that EPAC2 regulates synaptic release at PF synapses and is required for presynaptic PF-PC LTP.

Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that they both work on Rim1 at PF synapses, plus previous studies in the hippocampus using EPAC1 or EPAC2 knockout mice (Yang et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2013). It remains unclear whether EPAC1 or EPAC2 alone is sufficient and which one may dominate modulation of Rim1 phosphorylation.

Figure 4: What concentration of KT5720 was used to inhibit PKA? The authors note on Line 441 that previous studies used 10 microM, a concentration that produces off-target effects, but I cannot find the concentration the authors used. From their experiments, the authors conclude that the EPAC-PKC module is dominant in driving forskolin-induced potentiation. However, an obvious experiment would have been to apply KT to the control animals (Math1-Cre). This would rule out the possibility that PKA is activated somewhere within the EPAC-PKC, and plays a major role in potentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>Here are our responses.</p><p>1) We apologize for the missing information. The concentration of KT5720 used was 3 μM, which is close to the IC50 of PKA. According to Murray (2008), this concentration should minimize KT5720 effects on irrelevant signaling molecules, including EPAC, but still act on PKA.</p><p>2) We showed that KT5720 further decreased the potentiation by forskolin in conditional EPAC1/2 or PKCε knockout mice, albeit its effect was rather limited (Figure 4A). This result was also depicted in our summary Figure 7—figure supplement 2 (dashed line). Therefore, we believe that the impact of the EPAC-PKC module is much more significant than that of PKA in cAMP signaling pathway, at least at PF-PC synapses.</p><p>3) Following the reviewer’s comment, we have conducted new experiments to investigate the effect of KT5720 on the forskolin-induced potentiation in Math1-Cre mice.

However, the mice with dysfunctional RIM1α-Ser413 mutation exhibit normal presynaptic LTP in the cerebellum and the hippocampus (Kaeser et al., 2008; Yang and Calakos, 2010), questioning the role of RIM1α-Ser413 and PKA in presynaptic LTP.

It should be noted that the aim of VOR phase reversal training is to first decrease the gain, followed by an increase in phase. If the training is continued long enough, the gain will increase again, usually when the phase reaches the levels higher than 120 degrees. Therefore, the initial decrease of gain followed by the late-stage increase presumably underlies the absence of significant differences in gain between control and mutant groups in days 4 and 5. This does not imply that presynaptic LTP is more essential for the VOR phase than VOR gain, as the VOR gain decrease is affected during the first days of training.</p><p>This explanation has been included in the end of the manuscript “Although we observed only a difference in phase at the end of VOR phase reversal training, it should be noted that the gain was different on multiple days in both Rapgef3;Rapgef4-cKO and Prkce-cKO mice compared to their controls.

The authors should repeat the analysis using the Elmqvist and Quastel (EQ) method (see Thanawala and Regher, 2016). This method is more reliable at low Pr and can provide (when combined with the Train method) a high and low bracket of possible Pr and RRP values. Ideally, the authors would redo these experiments with a higher stimulus frequency. It would also be helpful to show a simple PPR value for each genotype. This can be done without additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the very insightful comment. In the previous experiments, we measured RRP and Pr based on parameter taken from the work in the hippocampal CA1 neurons (He et al., 2019), which, in our opinion, is similar to PF-PC synapses concerning low release probability. We have carefully read Thanawala and Regher (2016) paper and compared different methods. While the performance of the EQ method is in general more reliable to estimate small RRP and low Pr, it relies on <italic>p</italic> to be constant throughout a stimulus train (Thanawala and Regher, 2016). Although <italic>p</italic> may be constant for the calyx of Held synapses they studied, it cannot be case for PF-PC synapses. Therefore, we decided to redo the estimations of RRP and Pr using 100-Hz train (previously 20-Hz train).</p><p>This method does not require constant <italic>p</italic> and allows us to have a better estimation on RRP and Pr at PF-PC synapses (Thanawala and Regher, 2016).</p><p>The new results have been presented in new Figure 2E and 2F. The PF-PC synapses were stimulated at the frequency of 100 Hz, and the artifacts were truncated and the EPSCs were aligned (Figure 2E and 2F). Note that the aim of this experiment was to investigate whether there is difference between control and cKO mice. Indeed, we found that the amplitudes of both EPSC<sub>0</sub> and follow-up EPSCs were smaller in cKO mice, indicating that both the initial release and the replenishment are reduced by the conditional knockout o EPACs or PKCε. Compared to 20-Hz train, the 100-Hz train resulted in steady-state EPSCs brought EPSCs into steady state faster. We created linear fit from normalized steady-state EPSCs and back-extrapolated the curve to the y-axis to calculate Pr. Indeed, we found that the Pr value estimated from the 100-Hz train stimulus was significantly larger than that from the 20-Hz train, showing 0.17 (Math1-cre) and 0.19 (PKCε<sup>f/f</sup>) with 100-Hz, but 0.07 (Math1-cre) and 0.08 (PKCε<sup>f/f</sup>) in previous submission. This result was similar to Thanawala and Regher (2016), in which they claimed that the accuracy of estimation from a 100-Hz train is about three times of that from a 20-Hz train. Moreover, we found that the conditional knockout of either EPACs or PKCε produced significant decrease on Pr (Math1-cre 0.17 <italic>vs</italic> Math1-cre;EPAC1<sup>cKO</sup>EPAC2<sup>cKO</sup> 0.11; PKCε<sup>f/f</sup> 0.19 vs PKCε<sup>cKO</sup> 0.12).
