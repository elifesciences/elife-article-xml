In both cases, chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging is often desired, but challenged by the cytotoxicity intrinsic to calmodulin (CaM)-based GCaMP, a series of genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators that have been widely applied. Here, we demonstrate the performance of GCaMP-X in chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of cortical neurons, where GCaMP-X by design is to eliminate the unwanted interactions between the conventional GCaMP and endogenous (apo)CaM-binding proteins. By expressing in adult mice at high levels over an extended time frame, GCaMP-X showed less damage and improved performance in two-photon imaging of sensory (whisker-deflection) responses or spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations, in comparison with GCaMP. Chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of one month or longer was conducted for cultured cortical neurons expressing GCaMP-X, unveiling that spontaneous/local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients progressively developed into autonomous/global Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Along with the morphological indices of neurite length and soma size, the major metrics of oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup>, including rate, amplitude and synchrony were also examined. Dysregulations of both neuritogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations became discernible around 2–3 weeks after virus injection or drug induction to express GCaMP in newborn or mature neurons, which were exacerbated by stronger or prolonged expression of GCaMP. In contrast, neurons expressing GCaMP-X were significantly less damaged or perturbed, altogether highlighting the unique importance of oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> to neural development and neuronal health. In summary, GCaMP-X provides a viable solution for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging applications involving long-time and/or high-level expression of Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes.</p></abstract><kwd-group

closely involved in membrane excitability, sensory transduction, synaptic transmission, neural development, and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berridge et al., 2003</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulations are linked with the mental disorders including Parkinson’s diseases, Alzheimer’s diseases, epilepsy, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fernández de Sevilla et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liebscher et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that multiple factors and cascades may converge to Ca<sup>2+</sup> as one of the central factors underlying brain diseases, referred as the calcium hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berridge, 2010</xref>). According to their downstream consequences, cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals could be categorized as genomic versus non-genomic, to reflect the fact that in some cases where gene expressions are regulated (chronic) versus in other cases only the (acute) functions of existing proteins are concerned.</p><p>Acutely, cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> reflects single-neuron activities, such as spontaneous fluctuations and stimulus-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Banion and Yasuda, 2020</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging is often utilized to measure neuronal excitability, as one alternative to electrical recording. In fact, genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators (GECIs) represented by GCaMP, based on CaM (calmodulin) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-binding motif M13, have been broadly applied to monitor neurons and other excitable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tallini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to a faithful index of acute responses (in the timescale of seconds/minutes, such as a burst of action potentials), Ca<sup>2+</sup> is often tightly coupled to various chronic effects or processes, for example, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gene transcription and expression, neurite outgrowth or pruning, long-term potentiation or depression, learning and memory, and neural degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Banion and Yasuda, 2020</xref>). Therefore, it is highly desirable to monitor the long-term Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (days/weeks or longer) for cells, tissues, organs, or even whole organisms, which would greatly facilitate mechanistic understanding of the genomic/chronic roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in diverse pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). Meanwhile, back to the context of non-genomic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, longitudinal imaging may have a broad scope of applications where long-term changes in responses or behaviors are of interest. In parallel with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, different types of electrodes, such as MEA (multiple electrode array) and flexible electronics, have been extensively deployed for cultured neurons, brain slices, live animals, or human brains to record neural activities in the format of neuronal action potentials, local-field potentials, and EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hong and Lieber, 2019</xref>). The goal is to monitor neural activities across multiple days, weeks, or even the entire lifespan in the studies of training/behaviors, retina/vision, brain disorders, addictions, and pharmacological and interventional therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aramuni and Griesbeck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couto et al., 2021</xref>). GECIs hold great promise to avoid chronic immune responses and recoding instability that electrodes are often encountered with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aramuni and Griesbeck, 2013</xref>). Indeed, GCaMP and other GECIs have been demonstrated as more advantageous methods over electrodes or dyes during chronic imaging of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murphy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tian et al., 2009</xref>). Unfortunately, neural toxicities often accompany long-term expression of GCaMP or chronic GCaMP imaging with either virus infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2018</xref>) or transgenic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steinmetz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Perturbing L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels and presumably other (apo)CaM-binding proteins, GCaMP indicators cause side-effects in neurons which have been documented especially for enhanced or prolonged expressions. The unwanted molecular events of GCaMP may or may not be manifested as the toxic effects at the cellular or system levels. For instance, when employing viral infection, imaging experiments are restricted within the empirical time window and dosage range to alleviate nuclear-filling of GCaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Resendez et al., 2016</xref>); or for transgenic mice, special promoters, conditional expression, and other tactics are utilized to reduce the expression level/time of GCaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>). With such work-around solutions, rich information and rapid progress in neurosciences have been achieved by GCaMP imaging. At a cost, special cautions and procedures are required due to GCaMP toxicity, for example virus dilution trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Resendez et al., 2016</xref>), which often cause inconvenience in experiments besides other potential problems (e.g., nucleus-filling or low SNR).</p><p>Under the testing conditions in this work, neuronal perturbations were evidenced from GCaMP: with either earlier or newer versions, for either viral or transgenic expression, either in vitro (cultured neurons) or in vivo (living mice), and on either acute sensory response to whisker deflection or spontaneous oscillation encoding genomic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. GCaMP-X has been designed to resolve these perturbations by eliminating unwanted interferences with endogenous (apo)calmodulin signaling. For in vivo imaging beyond the safe time window (3-week extension) and dosage (10-fold higher), GCaMP-X outperformed GCaMP in recapitulating both sensory responses to whisker stimulation and autonomous Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations. In cultured cortical neurons, GCaMP of strong and/or prolonged expression caused the damage to neurites accompanied by aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, all overcome by GCaMP-X as a simple solution, which also highlights the importance of oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> to neurons both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design principles of GCaMP-X validated by newer GCaMP versions</title><p>Recently, GCaMP has been updated to its newest versions jGCaMP7 (but also see the bioRxiv preprint of jGCaMP8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>]), with enhanced sensing performance in multiple aspects over the previous GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grødem et al., 2021</xref>). Considering that the design of jGCaMP7 is also on the basis of CaM, we postulated that jGCaMP7-contained apoCaM would have similar problems to those of earlier GCaMPs. We chose jGCaMP7b to further validate the design principles of neuron-compatible GCaMP-X established in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Following the protocol of transient transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), jGCaMP7b accumulated into the nuclei in a substantial subpopulation of cortical neurons indexed by N/C (nucleus/cytosol) ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), considered as the hallmark of GCaMP side-effects. Notably, jGCaMP7b exhibited even more severe nuclear accumulation than other GCaMP variants, which may account for the nuclear jGCaMP7b evidenced in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dana et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, the total length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) of neurites were significantly reduced in jGCaMP7b-expressing neurons. The apoCaM-binding motif (CBM) and the localization tags were then appended onto jGCaMP7b, following the design of GCaMP-X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), to construct jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> and jGCaMP7b-X<sub>N</sub> for cytosolic and nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, respectively. GCaMP-X is supposed to eliminate its binding to apoCaM targets in neurons and reduce the cytotoxicity intrinsic to GCaMP, a critical issue to long-term Ca<sup>2+</sup> monitoring. Depicted by neurite tracing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), both cytosolic and nuclear versions of jGCaMP7-X have greatly enhanced the compatibility with neurons. In fact, neurons expressing jGCaMP7-X were essentially indistinguishable from GFP control neurons, in direct contrast to the neurons transfected with jGCaMP7 of the same amount of cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). In light of electrophysiological analyses on calmodulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Johny and Yue, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), we examined the effects of jGCaMP7b on recombinant Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in HEK293 cells. jGCaMP7b significantly altered the major properties of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 gating, that is, both inactivation and activation were enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The expression level is a critical factor to evaluate the side-effects of GCaMP. We then examined the actual levels of expressed proteins in HEK293 cells when transiently transfected with the same amount of cDNA for different indicators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Demonstrated by both western blotting and immunohistochemistry, jGCaMP7b in HEK293 cells was expressed either in the cytosol or in the nucleus at the same levels as jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> or jGCaMP7b-X<sub>N</sub>, respectively. Likewise, jGCaMP7 and jGCaMP7-X were at the same cytosolic or nuclear levels of expression when transiently transfected into neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, by coexpressing jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> and jGCaMP7b-X<sub>N</sub>, the total expression level estimated by immunostaining was even higher than that of jGCaMP7b, the latter of which caused significant damage to neurites whereas the total neurite length of jGCaMP7b-X neurons was about the same as GFP control neurons. Therefore, the expression levels of GCaMP-X versus GCaMP did not underlie their differential performances.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The design principles applicable to jGCaMP7 and jGCaMP7-X.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cultured cortical neurons from newborn mice were transiently transfected with YFP, jGCaMP7b, jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub>, or jGCaMP7b-X<sub>N</sub>, respectively, on DIV 5–7, then imaged by confocal microscopy on DIV 7–9.

Due to the cytotoxicity known from the very early versions of GCaMP, in vivo imaging experiments are normally required to conduct within the time window. In practice, an optimal time window (OTW) is about 3–8 weeks postinjection for GCaMP-infected neurons of live mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Resendez et al., 2016</xref>), in order to achieve substantial levels of GCaMP expression and fluorescence but not too high levels prone to side-effects.

To exclude the potential bias due to level of expression, GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> viruses (1.0 × 10<sup>13</sup> v.g./ml) of higher dose than GCaMP6m (1.0 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml) were injected (60 nl/injection). Progressive nuclear accumulation of GCaMP was previously reported in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zariwala et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, by the criteria of N/C ratio (0.8), nucleus-filling GCaMP was observed in a fraction of neurons 4–6 weeks postinjection, and the average N/C ratio was substantially increased when examined 8–13 weeks postinjection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In direct contrast, no neuron expressing GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> fell into the nucleus-filled category even weeks beyond OTW (up to 13 weeks postinjection). In the earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), the impairment on visual responses was reported from nucleus-filled neurons after long-term expression of GCaMP6 (several months postinjection); and during the initial phase (1- to 2-month postinjection) nuclear GCaMP6 did not perturb the proper physiology of neurons. Here, nucleus-filled neurons expressing GCaMP6m (N/C ratio &gt;0.8) started to show less responsiveness than neurons expressing GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> as early as within OTW (4–6 weeks) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which may underlie the lower amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<italic>ΔF</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) averaged over the whole population of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Of note, slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations have been observed from a variety of excitable or non-excitable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uhlén and Fritz, 2010</xref>). In neurons, oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals can increase the efficiency and specificity of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dolmetsch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 1998</xref>), thus playing important role in neuronal functions, development, morphology, and even general health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamijo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicotera and Orrenius, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toth et al., 2016</xref>). Spontaneous electrical activities are initiated at the early stage of neural development, and subsequently become more synchronized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luhmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spitzer, 2006</xref>). Such longitudinal processes of oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> and neuritogenesis which are mechanistically coupled may serves as a perfect scenario to demonstrate the side-effects of GCaMP on neurons. We then hypothesized that GCaMP-X versus GCaMP neurons would make a clear difference in their chronic recordings of oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Meanwhile, GCaMP-X with enhanced neuron compatibility is expected to provide new insights into the roles of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in neuronal morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez and Zheng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rosenberg and Spitzer, 2011</xref>). To monitor such Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in vitro, the AAVs carrying GCaMP6m or GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> (for in vitro use) were equally (1 μl, 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml) added to the cortical neurons of neonatal mice (DIV 0, 0-day in vitro) which were maintained and examined till DIV 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Fluctuations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities were perceivable starting from the first week (DIV 3 and DIV 6) with GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub>, in the pattern of high-frequency, low-amplitude, and unsynchronized signals. On DIV 10, the oscillation frequency decreased while the amplitude was increased with an enhanced level of synchronization. On DIV 28, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations of individual or subgrouped neurons became widely synchronized featuring robust spikes and slow frequency (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>), indicative of the formation of neural circuitry. In contrast, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were severely distorted in GCaMP6m-infected DIV-10 neurons. Despite that the performance of GCaMP6m in the first week resembled GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub>, longer expression time of GCaMP6m resulted in altered patterns of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2 fig3video3">Figure 3—videos 2 and 3</xref>). One major abnormity was the substantial reduction in oscillatory activities of GCaMP6m-expressing neurons, which was manifested after DIV 10 by much longer intervals between two adjacent peaks and much smaller amplitudes in average. Occasionally, abnormal Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes with ultralong lasting duration could be observed on DIV 17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). Around DIV 28, cease of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and broken neurites were often evidenced (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>). We then further analyzed oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals by the frequency and other key indices across the timespan from DIV 3 up to DIV 28. Statistical results demonstrated that the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuation with GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> was about 150 mHz during the first week, then gradually declined to the plateau around 20 mHz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Meanwhile, the peak amplitude exhibited a rising trend in the neurons expressing GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> across the full term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, both the frequency and the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations acquired by GCaMP6m were drastically changed after DIV 17, and then even more deteriorated later in that the oscillation was less and less recognizable and eventually halted on DIV 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Synchronization is one major hallmark of autonomous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, which was evaluated by the mean of correlation coefficient. As demonstrated by the temporal profiles of correlation coefficients, the comparison between GCaMP6m versus GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> unveiled a crucial phase turning from increasing to decreasing synchronization around DIV 17–21 in GCaMP6m-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Likewise, the full width at half maximum (FWHM), another index of oscillatory waveforms, was aberrantly wider for GCaMP6m than GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub>, becoming noticeable on DIV 10, and much more pronounced (10-fold) later on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Collectively from these indices, GCaMP indeed caused progressive damage on cortical neurons along with the culturing time or developmental stages; in contrast, GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> has overcome nearly all the above negative effects, emerging as a promising tool for chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with enhanced neural compatibility. Also, Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) was applied to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> waveforms acquired by GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The distribution of frequency components started to change during DIV 10–17, when slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations of 10–100 mHz appeared to be the dominant form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Based on separate preparations of neurons, we conducted another two experiments to compare GCaMP6m and GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> up to DIV 42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Statistical results from these data on frequency, <italic>ΔF</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>, correlation coefficient per view and FWHM support that GCaMP-X outperforms GCaMP in chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). The newer probes of jGCaMP7b and jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> resulted in differential performance that jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> was much less toxic, consistent with the above notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence imaging for autonomous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in cultured cortical neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time-lapse images of cultured cortical neurons infected with AAV-<italic>Syn</italic>-GCaMP6m or AAV-<italic>Syn</italic>-GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub>.

The key parameters of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics measured by jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> were much closer to those by Fluo-4 AM than jGCaMP7b, supporting that jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> is less toxic than jGCaMP7b.

GCaMP-X promises unprecedented opportunities for concurrent imaging of both neuronal functionalities and morphogenesis across different stages of development. Such chronic Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging is difficult to implement if using other approaches, for example, conventional GCaMP or Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes, both would cause side-effects to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). By taking advantage of GCaMP-X, we here aimed at the relationship between cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and neuronal morphology.</p><p>Indistinguishable from control neurons infected with GFP viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), neurons expressing GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> followed the typical development process of neonatal neurons, including neurite elongation/arborization and soma enlargement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, these developmental processes were severely impaired by virally delivered GCaMP6m, especially after DIV 14 onwards, when nuclear accumulation and neurite shortening became evident. Depicted by DIV-28 neurons with neurite tracings, GCaMP6m caused significant damage on neurite outgrowth, and to the extreme, discernable death of neurons, in contrast to GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> which had no apparent perturbation. In addition, the temporal profiles across the full time-course were achieved for both GCaMP6m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) by the major indices of neurite length and soma size. At the early phase (before DIV 17), no significant difference between the two groups of GCaMP6m versus GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> could be detected. However, toward the late stage (DIV 28 or later) of GCaMP-expressing neurons, the soma size was as small as ~200 μm<sup>2</sup> in contrast to the neurons expressing GFP or GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> (~300 μm<sup>2</sup>), as confirmed by the statistical summary over three independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Likewise, the total neurite length of GCaMP-expressing neurons rapidly declined, whereas GCaMP-X-expressing neurons went through an initial phase (~2 weeks) of rapid outgrowth before entering into the plateau phase, forming a monotonic increasing curve. Similar to neuritogenesis, the temporal profile of soma size also exhibited an upward-plateau trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Combining the data and analyses from both developmental and functional perspectives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), we speculated on the potential correlations between neuronal growth and spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Functionally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics appeared to be either ascending (amplitude) or descending (frequency) along with the developmental stages (DIV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Roughly, the oscillation amplitude linearly (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.84) correlated with the neurite length in total (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In direct contrast, the oscillation frequency and the total neurite length were inversely correlated (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Resembling the amplitude, the level of synchrony (correlation coefficient) indicative of circuitry formation was positively correlated with the total neurite length (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.86) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). All these tight correlations support the notion that spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities including its mature form of synchronized Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations may underpin neuritogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Estrada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez and Zheng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamijo et al., 2018</xref>).

However, the overall neurite outgrowth across the developmental phases may help elucidate the roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in neuritogenesis, which has been lacking due to the difficulties of long-term Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. In fact, contradictory observations have been reported regarding how Ca<sup>2+</sup> actually regulates the rates of neuronal growth. Here, based on GCaMP-X imaging data, the first derivative of the growth curves was calculated as the growth rate of neurites or soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The bell-shaped curves suggested that the relationships between Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and neuronal growth rates may depend on developmental stages, which reached the peak rates around DIV 10 for both neurite length and soma size. Therefore, the maximum growth rate appeared to be determined by both amplitude and frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. In general, there might not be a simple relationship between oscillation characteristics and neuronal development. Within a short or brief timeframe, the growth rates in relation to various combinations of amplitude and frequency could be complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gomez and Zheng, 2006</xref>), especially without considering the development stage of neurons. Similar results were obtained from jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> in comparison with jGCaMP7b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). In summary, chronic GCaMP-X imaging provided a glimpse of the potential roles of slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in neuritogenesis across multiple stages of neuronal development.</p><p>To further exclude any potential artifact related to probe expressions, a gradient of expression levels by jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> viruses were examined in cultured cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). 3 μl AAV-<italic>Syn</italic>-jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> (1.0 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml) and 1 μl AAV-<italic>Syn</italic>-jGCaMP7b (1.0 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml) led to the similar levels of whole-cell expression (the former would express much more in the cytosol). Under such conditions, the results from the two groups of neurons were consistent with those with equal amounts/volumes of viruses. jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> was much less toxic than jGCaMP7b, by comparing the indices of neuronal growth and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4F</xref>), where neurite length and soma size of neurons expressing high-level jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> were nearly indistinguishable from GFP control neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Chronic imaging of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in vivo</title><p>GCaMP6m perturbed autonomous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, presumably as one leading cause of neuronal toxicities. Such tight correlations between Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulations and aberrant morphology were clearly manifested during early development, which may extend onto mature neurons. The viruses were added to cultured cortical neurons at the mature stage (DIV 21), which were subsequently examined to compare the effects of jGCaMP7b versus jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analyses of both neurites and oscillations demonstrated similar side-effects of jGCaMP7b in comparison with jGCaMP7b-X<sub>C</sub>, starting to show up on DIV 28 and later on DIV 35 exhibiting significant differences in neurite length and oscillation characteristics. Similar to cultured neurons, spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in vivo are also correlated to gene transcription and expression at the cellular and circuity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laviv et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, based on our experiments and other published reports, a common theme of correlation exists between spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> and neuronal morphology, for both premature and mature neurons, and both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). For adult mouse brain infected by AAV viruses of GCaMP6m or GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> (the same procedures and dosages as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we characterized spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in S1 primary somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1 fig5video2">Figure 5—videos 1 and 2</xref>). Two checkpoints were set at 4 weeks postinjection (within OTW) and at 8 or 11 weeks postinjection (prolonged expression time beyond OTW), respectively. Similar to whisker deflection-response experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the nucleus-filled neurons exhibited noticeable abnormalities in spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities even within OTW. Beyond OTW, nucleus-filling was often found from GCaMP6m while very rare from GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> as indexed by N/C ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Accordingly, the damage was much exacerbated, as evidenced from the total or nucleus-filled neurons expressing GCaMP in comparison with the total neurons expressing GCaMP-X (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). With GCaMP6m, the frequency and amplitude resulted in significantly lower values, accompanied by aberrantly wider FWHM and slower on/off rates. In contrast, neurons expressing GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> maintained robust and stable spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities with key characteristics within the normal ranges across the full term of experiments (up to 11 weeks postinjection).

Firstly, titrations of GCaMP viruses were applied to characterize the dose-dependent damage of neurons, for which the concentrations were at 1 × 10<sup>11</sup>, 5 × 10<sup>11</sup>, and 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml for AAV-<italic>Syn</italic>-GCaMP6m, and 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml for AAV-<italic>Syn</italic>-GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub>, respectively. The viruses (30 nl) at the above concentrations were microinjected into different brain regions of the same mouse and then after 3 weeks the expression levels in brain slices were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Low-concentration injection of virus at 1 × 10<sup>11</sup> v.g./ml exhibited extremely sparse expression of GCaMP6m and yielded a low cell count. Correspondingly, the fluorescence signals were difficult to distinguish from the background, that is, low contrast and SNR. The virus concentration, when increased to 5 × 10<sup>11</sup> v.g./ml, resulted in a relatively larger number of healthy-looking cells expressing GCaMP6m. But the low image contrast still affected proper detection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals due to neuropil fluorescence. High-expression levels of GCaMP (at the virus concentration of 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml) significantly enhanced the fluorescence image contrast and greatly increased the numbers of GCaMP-positive cells. However, the majority of neurons exhibited severe nuclear accumulation, which would subsequently lead to aberrant Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics and cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, high-dose injection of GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> virus at 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml was beneficial for image contrast and the number of positive and healthy cells; meanwhile, the N/C ratio remained within the low range as expected. Next, under the conditions similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, we injected 60 nl GCaMP6m viruses of high dose (1 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml) and GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> viruses of ultrahigh dose (1 × 10<sup>13</sup> v.g./ml, 10-fold higher) to examine the temporal profile of damage in the same cortical region of S1BF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). At the checkpoints of 17-, 55-, 70-, and 92-day postinjection, neurons expressing GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> were compared with GCaMP6m. Confocal microscopy with brain slices revealed that the percentage of infected neurons and the expression level of GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> were close to their peaks on 17 days, suggesting that the ultrahigh dose could expedite GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> expression to reach the high level. Most importantly, long-term, high-level expression of GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> up to 92 days did not induce nuclear accumulation, whereas GCaMP6m at relatively lower concentration (1 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml) already caused severe nuclear accumulation evidenced from 17 to 92 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Meanwhile, the soma size of GCaMP6m-infected neurons was significantly smaller than that of GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> from 55 to 92 days, presumably due to impaired spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities and related Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in these neurons. To directly confirm the relative expression levels, immunocytochemistry was performed on the brain slices infected by GCaMP6m and GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> viruses, under similar conditions as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D</xref>. Long-term (13 weeks) expression levels of AAV-<italic>Syn</italic>-GCaMP6m (at the concentrations of 5 × 10<sup>11</sup> and 1 × 10<sup>12</sup> v.g./ml) in the brains of adult mice were quantified by anti-GFP immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). And both dosages resulted in significantly lower expression levels than AAV-<italic>Syn</italic>-GCaMP6m-X<sub>C</sub> of higher concentration (1 × 10<sup>13</sup> v.g./ml), excluding the expression level as the cause of less damage. Of note, the soma size of neurons after long-term GCaMP-X expression was larger than GCaMP, while indistinguishable from the blank control neurons.

Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, we examined GCaMP-expressing neurons from the layer II–III cortex of the 6-month-old Rasgrf2-2A-dCre;Ai148 mice (with TMP-inducible expression of GCaMP6f) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Nuclear accumulation of GCaMP was readily discernible, although it was relatively less severe than long-term expression of viral GCaMP6m of high doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Next, dissected from newborn Rasgrf2-2A-dCre;Ai148 mice, cortical neurons were cultured, and subsequently 10 μM TMP was added to induce GCaMP expression. Similar to viral delivery, transgenic neurons were also subject to GCaMP6f perturbations, especially in nucleus-filled neurons. Neurite tracings indicated that the complexity and length of neurites were reduced in Ai148 neurons as compared to GFP control neurons from DIV 21 onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The temporal profile of total neurite length indicated that neurite outgrowth was significantly slowed down or even halted on DIV 14, in comparison with the control neurons (GFP virus-infected and TMP treated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

By relieving the concerns on the time and level of probe expression, GCaMP-X provides a simple solution for chronic calcium imaging in alternative to circumventing GCaMP toxicity. GCaMP-X paves the way to unexplored directions previously impeded or discouraged due to GCaMP perturbations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Available design solutions to avoid the side-effects of CaM-based GECI</title><p>To better utilize CaM-based GECIs in vitro and in vivo, solutions with no or minimum side-effects are in need. In utero electroporation and viral infection often result in high-expression levels particularly near the injection site, and some lines of transgenic mice using weaker promoters could control probe expression within the low levels to alleviate nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dana et al., 2019</xref>). Since probes present in the cytosol are able to bind apoCaM targets including Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), neurons may still suffer from the toxicity of the probes. Evidently, cytosolic GCaMP affected neural excitability in transgenic mice expressing GCaMP5G or GCaMP6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steinmetz et al., 2017</xref>). To overcome these problems, one solution is to substitute the core components of GECI design, for example, to utilize troponin C from muscle as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mank et al., 2008</xref>). The TN-XXL has been claimed to be suitable for chronic imaging potentially benefitted from its design basis (less likely to bind endogenous proteins in neurons). However, the TN-XXL solution has at least two shortcomings. First, TNXXL is a FRET-based ratiometric sensor, of which the dynamic range is limited by FRET methods and indeed much narrower than GCaMP. Second, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding motif from mammalian troponin C has the canonical EF-hands (resembling CaM), thus still possible to perturb neurons by binding endogenous targets at the apo states, which needs further investigations.</p><p>The approach adopted by this work is to introduce an additional protective motif that specifically binds apoCaM within the probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Such CBM has been fused onto the N-terminus of conventional GCaMPs (from GCaMP3 to jGCaMP7) to construct a new series of GCaMP-X correspondingly. When Ca<sup>2+</sup> level is low, CBM successfully prevents apoCaM contained within GCaMP-X from interfering with Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels and other important apoCaM targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Once Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration rises, M13 binds to Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM with high affinity, without altering Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing characteristics of GCaMP-X inherited from years of efforts and improvements. With GCaMP-X as the proof-of-principle, the design rules centered with apoCaM/Ca<sup>2+</sup>-CaM binding are potentially applicable to CaM-based sensors or actuators of a broader scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grødem et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haiech et al., 2019</xref>), which may face similar challenges or problems to those associated with enhanced/prolonged expression of GCaMP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities in association with neural development and degeneration</title><p>While the membrane voltage is oscillating, cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals are also fluctuating, closely involved in neuronal development and circuit formation both in intro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kirkby et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, in line with the aforementioned calcium hypothesis, dysregulated spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities would lead to defective morphology and functions of neurons, and eventually neural diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harr and Distelhorst, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nicotera and Orrenius, 1998</xref>). In Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence signals and electrical activities are often referred to each other since action potentials initiated by Na<sup>+</sup> channels would subsequently drive the fast opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Electrical recording via MEA (multiple electrode array) has been widely applied in long-term brain/neuron monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Obien and Frey, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shafer, 2019</xref>), among other methods. On the other hand, both membrane potentials and ion fluxes (Na<sup>+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup>) could have sophisticated mechanisms and specific consequences, for example, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations of different forms: subthreshold oscillations by L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, or intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations by intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uhlén and Fritz, 2010</xref>). GECIs are promising tools to overcome the limitations of many other methods including MEA, if the cell compatibility issues could be resolved as demonstrated by GCaMP-X in this work. GECI imaging methods directly and faithfully capture Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities at different loci in the brain or within the cell, allowing high spatial–temporal resolution of concurrent morphological/functional imaging. Subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations may be responsible for different aspects of neurogenesis and neuritogenesis, awaiting future investigations with organelle-specific GCaMP-X, such as the nuclear version GCaMP-X<sub>N</sub>. Earlier Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities (weak fluctuations of higher frequency) may represent spontaneous activity before synapse or network formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spitzer, 2006</xref>). At the later stage, synchronized Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (of lower frequency) emerge, along with dramatic changes in morphology and other aspects of development. Autonomous oscillations of SNc neurons are tightly coupled with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels which may underpin Parkinson’s disease or neural aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guzman et al., 2009</xref>). Cultured cortical slices and hiPSC-derived cortical neurons also suggest that L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are crucial for both spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities and neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Horigane et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plumbly et al., 2019</xref>). A similar mechanism is likely shared by the correlation between spontaneous/oscillatory Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities and neuronal morphology/development unveiled in this study. Expression, trafficking and functions of ion channels and membrane receptors are also subject to regulations by activities of different patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruffinatti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spitzer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toth et al., 2016</xref>), and chronic GECI imaging is expected to help elucidate these compound effects and mechanisms. In this work, we have particularly focused on spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities of cortical neurons in association with neuronal morphology both in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and in both neonatal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and mature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>), as the exemplars to demonstrate the performance of chronic GCaMP-X imaging. Importantly, since such Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity-neuronal morphology coupling was perturbed by GCaMP under various testing conditions, we are expecting a broad scope of applications awaiting GCaMP-X to explore both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Improved neuron compatibility of GCaMP-X</title><p>GCaMP, as widely applied GECI, has been evolved into its eighth version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grødem et al., 2021</xref>), with enhanced sensitivity, brightness and kinetic properties tailored to specific imaging purposes, including single action potentials and activities in neuronal populations and microcompartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dana et al., 2019</xref>). However, the cytotoxicity of GCaMP has been a persistent problem from early on, mainly due to the fact that the CaM-centered schemes of GCaMP have been largely inherited across generations of its design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tallini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tian et al., 2009</xref>). In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging with GCaMP viruses is facing the dilemma of safety versus reliability. On the one hand, reducing GCaMP levels could alleviate or postpone the cytotoxicity, but low levels of expression would also reduce the contrast and SNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rose et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, increasing the expression level of GCaMP would enhance the data quality of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, but exacerbate the damage to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Resendez et al., 2016</xref>). It is not surprising that GCaMP transgenic mice have encountered with similar problems. Several lines of GCaMP transgenic mice reported earlier, such as Emx1-Cre;Ai38 GCaMP3 transgenic mice, attempted to resolve the safety issue by restricting the expression to ultra-low levels (~5 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zariwala et al., 2012</xref>), but sacrificing the imaging quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rose et al., 2014</xref>). The mouse lines reported recently, such as Emx1-Cre;CaMK2α-tTA;Ai93 GCaMP6f transgenic mice and Slc17a7-IRES2-Cre;Ai148 GCaMP6f transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madisen et al., 2015</xref>), managed to elevate the expression levels. However, epileptiform activities have been observed from these mice presumably due to GCaMP perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daigle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steinmetz et al., 2017</xref>). One bypass solution is to conditionally induce GCaMP expression to conduct GCaMP imaging within a time window, which would be much less feasible for long-term expression and/or chronic imaging.</p><p>Instead, GCaMP-X allows long-term and high-level expression to increase the quality and reliability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging while reducing neuronal toxicities. For in vitro studies, investigations of long-term Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are largely hindered by the cytotoxicity of GECIs or dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). GCaMP-X is well suited for longitudinal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics, for example, during neural development as in this study, for high-throughput screening of long-term drug effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vetter et al., 2020</xref>), or in other similar scenarios. For in vivo studies, due to the concerns known to GCaMP, false-negative or false-positive results by nuclear-filled GCaMP or under-expressed GCaMP are misleading especially in imaging large populations of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Resendez et al., 2016</xref>). The existing reports have not yet reached an agreement regarding whether nuclear GCaMP would cause neuronal toxicities with a significant impact during the early postinjection phase, for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>. Such discrepancy may reflect different doses of virus injection, different expression levels of GCaMP or even different types of neurons in different brain regions. Alternatively, it may still reinforce that neuronal damage could still exist even within OTW, as a precaution for selecting neurons and planning experiments. In this regard, GCaMP-X provides a viable option with higher SNR, more healthy neurons, lower neurotoxicity, prolonged expression/imaging, and meanwhile less experimental complexity.</p><p>Additional control experiments would help evaluate how close GCaMP-X data are to the reality, considering potential Ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering effect intrinsic to Ca<sup>2+</sup> probes and also other factors. Applicable controls were incorporated to better evaluate GCaMP-X data, for example, Ai140D mice (GFP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) and Fluo-4 AM (Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The results have been encouraging in that GCaMP-X neurons were nearly indistinguishable in the morphological and functional aspects from Ai140D neurons expressing GFP or loaded with Fluo-4 AM. The feedbacks from GCaMP-X applications should continue to help clarify this matter in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The authors need to tone down the unnecessary and misleading anti-GCaMP rhetoric and discuss the value of GCaMP-X in the context of neuronal development.</p><p>Throughout, the paper suffers from a failure to control critical parameters. The lack of adequate controls risks undermining conclusions about the relative toxicities of GCaMP and GCaMP-X indicators. For example, figure 1 provides compelling evidence that neurons transfected with jGCaMP7 are morphologically distinct from control neurons, and that GCaMP-X-expressing neurons are morphologically similar to control neurons. The difference could be due to the indicator, but there are many other possibilities. Are expression levels of the two indicators comparable, for example? Figure 1 establishes that the cells containing jGCaMP7 were perturbed and those containing GCaMP-X were not, but not that the difference was due to the indicator molecules.</p><p>The sensory responsiveness measurements of figure 2 provide another example of missing controls. Responsiveness is measured in GCaMP- and GCaMP-X containing neurons, but not control neurons. Which population is perturbed? And the authors have not accounted for the different SNR characteristics of the two indicators. The evolution of GCaMP indicators provides a lesson in the importance of SNR: with each new GCaMP from GCaMP1 to GCaMP6, a greater proportion of cortical pyramidal neurons appeared sensitive to sensory stimuli, simply because the improved SNR permitted the resolution of smaller signals with each new indicator.</p><p>Figure 7 illustrates that neurons from transgenic GCaMP lines are affected in culture.

Here is the summary:</p><p>1. We have conducted western-blot and immunocytochemistry experiments to directly measure the expression levels of GCaMP versus GCaMP-X in cultured neurons.</p><p>a) The localization tag NES of GCaMP-X<sub>C</sub> would yield less expression due to space restriction. To compare the potential effects in the cytosol (e.g. on Ca<sub>V</sub>1 channels), the cytosolic (instead of whole-cell/total) expression was focused on.</p><p>b) In parallel, for the nuclear effects, the expression level of GCaMP in the nucleus was compared with GCaMP-X<sub>N</sub>.</p><p>c) In the original manuscript, the amount of cDNA or virus was under control for fair comparison. Our new data confirmed that the GCaMP expression level in the cytosol was comparable to GCaMP-X<sub>C</sub>.</p><p>2. To further rule out the concern, two sets of additional in vitro experiments were conducted:</p><p>a) By increasing the amount of GCaMP-X<sub>C</sub> virus, the total expression was enhanced, to the level comparable to that of GCaMP. Under the above conditions, GCaMP-X<sub>C</sub> did not exhibit any significant side-effect;</p><p>b) In addition, both GCaMP-X<sub>C</sub> and GCaMP-X<sub>N</sub> were co-expressed in neurons, leading to higher expression levels than GCaMP, while reaching the same conclusion on the differential performance of GCaMP-X versus GCaMP.</p><p>3. Finally, for in vivo imaging, the injected viruses were of differential amount that GCaMP-X was ~10-fold of GCaMP as indicated in the first version. Here in this revision the immunostaining results from brain slices confirmed that the expression level of GCaMP-X was indeed higher than GCaMP.</p><p>The relevant data newly acquired include Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 4—figure supplement 4 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1. These results are consistent with the design principle that GCaMP-X eliminates unwanted CaM-binding by intramolecular protection regardless of its expression levels. Besides the above new data and evidence, additional information can be found in our earlier report (Yang 2018 PMID: 29666364).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewer 2 notes the absence of important controls for Figures 2 and 7. For Figure 2, the potential contribution of differences in signal to noise ratios (SNR) of the two indicators should be discussed. For Figure 7, the potential contribution of tTA expression in transgenic neurons inducibly expressing GCaMP6f should be accounted for.</p></disp-quote><p>I. In the context of our work, the effective SNR was calculated mainly to evaluate the overall performance of ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. More often, SNR refers to the intrinsic sensing property of the probe as the reviewer mentioned. Examined by artificially generated AP-like waveforms in HEK cells, GCaMP and GCaMP-X resulted in similar SNR values (Yang 2018 PMID: 29666364). Besides the intrinsic SNR, the effective SNR is jointly determined by multiple factors, including the expression level of the probes, and the health state of the neurons. Similar to the original report of GCaMP3 (Tian 2009 PMID: 19898485), the overall SNR could be severely impaired in GCaMPexpressing neurons, presumed to be much better in unaltered/healthy neurons. In this work, the effective/overall SNR using GCaMP-X (of higher dose) turned out to be significantly higher than that from GCaMP, highlighting the advantages of GCaMP-X over GCaMP: healthier neurons while expressing more probes. Meanwhile, we appreciate the review’s insight regarding the retrospect from GCaMP1 to GCaMP6, that the progressive improvements in overall SNR are mostly attributed to enhanced sensing characteristics of the probes. Collectively, a newer GCaMP may improve the overall SNR by enhancing the probe’s sensing characteristics (e.g., GCaMP1-6), or by alleviating neuronal toxicities (e.g., GCaMP-X, or those workaround solutions for GCaMP), or by permitting higher expression levels of probes (e.g. GCaMP-X versus GCaMP). In all, GCaMP-X imaging achieved higher overall SNR than GCaMP, as shown in the revised Figure 2C and Figure 5D.</p><p>II. Regarding the contribution of tTA (Tetracyclines) expression in Figure 7, we appreciate the reviewer for pointing it out, which does request additional controls. Indeed, tTA of high level could be toxic to neurons (Moullan 2015 PMID: 25772356) thus a concern for evaluating the toxicity of GCaMP6f. In this revision, the control mouse line of Ai140D was employed as the negative control to compare with Ai148. These two lines are nearly the same except that for Ai140D GFP would be triggered by tTA to express whereas for Ai148 GCaMP6f is to express. Keeping the conditions for these two lines exactly the same, e.g., the same TMP treatment, Ai148 neurons exhibited significantly less neurites than Ai140D neurons. Therefore, our data support that GCaMP but not tTA caused the defects (in comparison with the GFP control group) on neuritogenesis. Additional neurite tracing data demonstrate that no significant difference could be detected due to putative tTA effects, between Ai140D positive neurons and Ai140D negative neurons (or ICR control neurons). In summary, we have reached the same conclusions (as in the original version) regarding GCaM6f effects on neuritogenesis of transgenic Ai148 neurons, after incorporating the new data addressing the potential tTA effects (Figure 7—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewer 1 found the criticisms of GCaMP to be unnecessarily negative and unjustifiably so given that there have been numerous studies using GCaMP under conditions which circumvent the toxicity known to occur when expressed during development. Authors should tone down the anti-GCaMP phrasing and also shorten the Discussion as suggested by reviewer 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript according to the suggestions. Meanwhile, we would like to clarify the following matters.</p><p>a) We agree that it is fully possible to circumvent the aforementioned problems intrinsic to GCaMP, as extensively demonstrated in numerous reports. Using GCaMP, a great deal of new information/knowledge has been learned and important advances have been achieved. Instead of anti-GCaMP, our GCaMP-X is in line with the efforts from multiple labs to improve GCaMP, in hope to provide our solution regarding its toxicity directly and indirectly associated with unexpected (apo)GCaMP binding in neurons. GCaMP-X is rationally-designed, simple and effective; meanwhile, we agree that the empirical approaches by circumventing the core problem (e.g., limiting the level/time of GCaMP expression) are also effective options. GCaMP probes with the upgrades should continuously contribute to ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging research, provided that the perturbations of GCaMP could be cautiously controlled.</p><p>b) One critic from the reviewer 1 is about the application scope of GCaMP-X to claim based on our data. In this revision, we have clarified that GCaMP-X is an option with multiple virtues for imaging applications involving long-term/high-level GCaMP expressions. Early-stage neurons well represent the scenarios where GCaMP-X and GCaMP could have distinct performances. Together with the new data in this revision, the advantages of GCaMP-X have been confirmed in adult mice or mature neurons. We also agree with the reviewer that neural development should continue to serve as one important theme for future studies to take advantage of GCaMP-X. In addition to the data from adult mice (Figure 2, Figure 5 and Figure 6), the new data/evidence regarding mature/developed neurons can be found in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—figure supplement 3.</p><p>c) Due to its rational-design nature, the improvements of GCaMP-X are in both aspects: in principle (molecular mechanisms) and in practice (cellular and overall effects). In response to the comments/critics, we have revised the text accordingly: to provide the reference of data/figures for each claim when applicable, while avoiding to generalize the “molecular mechanisms” without further/future validations by particular experimental conditions.</p><p>d) In fact, there is no perfect probe of zero/null effect on neurons. Even when all other potential effects have been eliminated, GECIs are introduced into the cell acting as exogenous ca<sup>2+</sup>-buffering proteins, which potentially interfere with diverse cellular processes. GCaMP-X has no difference from other probes in the aspect of ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering effect, thus not a perfect probe either.</p><p>e) To provide further support on the design principle, we conducted additional Co-IP experiments to directly examine the interactions between the probes and the apoCaM targets. Under apo conditions, GCaMP-X behaved drastically different from GCaMP, the latter of which bound both α<sub>1D</sub> (at the IQ domain of the pore forming subunit of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels) and neurogranin (synaptic protein critical to neuritogenesis specifically binds apoCaM if unphosphorylated). This new set of data can be found in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While the results are valuable, the authors' conclusions are often unsubstantiated. The authors need to tone down the unnecessary and misleading anti-GCaMP rhetoric and discuss the value of GCaMP-X in the context of neuronal development.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to follow the suggestion/critics to carefully and fairly evaluate both probes. We agree with the reviewer that GCaMP-X data in this study have the immediate and direct value to calcium imaging in the context of neuronal development. Meanwhile, GCaMP-X by design is to resolve unwanted molecular interactions of GCaMP (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 3), promising a broader scope of applications beyond development. For instance, in our in vivo experiments, high (10fold) dose of GCaMP-X virus was injected to adult mice (82±8 days of age, n=17 if counted by the number of mice) or (~80±6 days, n=28 if counted by injections), yielding higher imaging quality and much less neural toxicity in comparison to GCaMP (Figure 2, Figure 5 and Figure 6). For cultured neurons, new data were acquired from both virus-infected neurons and TMP-induced transgenic neurons, starting to express the probe at the late/mature stages. For these neurons, the comparison between GCaMPX versus GCaMP resulted in similar conclusion (Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—figure supplement 3). In summary, the central problem is the excessive/prolonged expression of GCaMP, which has been resolved by GCaMP-X, thus promising its broad applications, represented by chronic calcium imaging (in vitro and in vivo) in this study.</p><p>Besides GCaMP-X, we fully agree that other solutions do exist to circumvent the problem: e.g., to carefully adjust/control the time and level of GCaMP expression as the reviewer pointed out. We have revised the text to explicitly state our overall opinions on GCaMP (see Item 3 in Essential Revisions and also Page 4, Line 107 in the revised manuscript). Meanwhile, we have ensured that the claims regarding GCaMP versus GCaMP-X should not go beyond our testing conditions until further validations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout, the paper suffers from a failure to control critical parameters. The lack of adequate controls risks undermining conclusions about the relative toxicities of GCaMP and GCaMP-X indicators. For example, figure 1 provides compelling evidence that neurons transfected with jGCaMP7 are morphologically distinct from control neurons, and that GCaMP-X-expressing neurons are morphologically similar to control neurons. The difference could be due to the indicator, but there are many other possibilities. Are expression levels of the two indicators comparable, for example? Figure 1 establishes that the cells containing jGCaMP7 were perturbed and those containing GCaMP-X were not, but not that the difference was due to the indicator molecules.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that more controls would strengthen the conclusions and we appreciate the particular suggestions of the reviewer. We conducted additional experiments for Figure 1 to control the expression levels for transient transfection. Briefly, the difference of GCaMP-X versus GCaMP was not due to the expression level (Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Since the amount of cDNA was controlled, it would be better to separately compare the expression level of GCaMP in the cytosol (versus GCaMP-X<sub>C</sub>) or in the nucleus (versus GCaMP-X<sub>N</sub>). To keep the total expression at the same level, differential amounts of GCaMP versus GCaMP-X<sub>C</sub> cDNA were transfected into cells. Furthermore, cytosolic GCaMP-X<sub>C</sub> and nuclear GCaMP-X<sub>N</sub> were co-expressed in neurons, resulting in the total GCaMP-X proteins at the level comparable to GCaMP. Similar validation experiments were conducted for long-term expression in vitro and in vivo (Figure 4— figure supplement 4 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). In all these experiments, GCaMP-X consistently outperformed GCaMP, ruling out the concern of expression levels. Please also see our reply to Item 1 in Essential Revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sensory responsiveness measurements of figure 2 provide another example of missing controls. Responsiveness is measured in GCaMP- and GCaMP-X containing neurons, but not control neurons. Which population is perturbed? And the authors have not accounted for the different SNR characteristics of the two indicators. The evolution of GCaMP indicators provides a lesson in the importance of SNR: with each new GCaMP from GCaMP1 to GCaMP6, a greater proportion of cortical pyramidal neurons appeared sensitive to sensory stimuli, simply because the improved SNR permitted the resolution of smaller signals with each new indicator.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing out this matter. Additional analyses and experiments on the whisker test have been conducted (see revised Figure 2). First of all, the nucleus-filled neurons (N/C ratio&gt;0.8 as the criteria) exhibited the most severe perturbations. The overall performance of GCaMP-X expressing neurons was significantly better than GCaMP mainly due to the nucleus-filled neurons, manifested by the key indices of amplitude, responsiveness and overall SNR. We agree that the probes’ SNR may also contribute to their difference in overall SNR and responsiveness.</p><p>Please see our response (Part I) to Essential Revisions, Item 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 illustrates that neurons from transgenic GCaMP lines are affected in culture. The lines used overexpress tTA and GCaMP, both of which have been implicated in toxicity in the past. Here again, a critical control is missing, leaving the conclusion uncertain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted additional experiments (Figure 7—figure supplement 2) to address the issue of tTA. Briefly, as suggested by the reviewer, an important control group was introduced, i.e., Ai140D mice also based on tTA but expressing GFP instead. The potential complications due to the documented effects of tTA have been excluded.</p><p>Please see our response (Part II) to Essential Revisions, Item 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At what age were virus injections performed? This information is missing from the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have systematically collected/verified our records for the timepoint of injection in our in vivo imaging experiments according to the protocol from Dr. Svoboda’s lab (Huber 2012 PMID: 22538608). The injection timepoints in relation to the age of mice have been summarized (82±8 days, n=17 if counted by the number of mice; or ~80±6 days, n=28 if counted by injections), also illustrated in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 appears to be an extension of the morphological analyses in figure 1. Spreading these results over two figures is unnecessary.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1, the morphological analyses were required by the design/validation process of jGCaMP7-X. Following the established procedure (Yang 2018 PMID: 29666364), transient transfection was utilized to quickly (a few days) achieve the proof-of-principle, but not suitable for chronic imaging which was the focus of this study. By virus infection, Figure 4 demonstrated one major aspect of GCaMP-X advantages: less toxicity while enduring prolonged time course (multiple weeks) of probe expression. Figure 4A-C shed new insights toward calcium oscillation dependent neuritogenesis gained in this study (Figure 4D and Figure 4E). In this context, we agree that the morphological analyses for viral delivery of jGCaMP7 and jGCaMP7-X in Figure 1— figure supplement 1 may be more relevant to similar data by GCaMP6 and GCaMP6-X viruses, now changed to Figure 4—figure supplement 3 in this revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are a large number of supplementary videos that contribute little to the paper.

In the original version, VGA referred to voltage-gated activation, adopting the terms previously used in describing Ca<sub>V</sub>1 properties subject to GCaMP perturbations and CaM modulation.
