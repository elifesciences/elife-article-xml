self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitors by aberrant gene activation, eventually causing leukemia. However, the molecular mechanism underlying aberrant gene activation remains elusive. Here, we showed that leukemic MLL fusion proteins associate with the HBO1 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex through their trithorax homology domain 2 (THD2) in various human cell lines. MLL proteins associated with the HBO1 complex through multiple contacts mediated mainly by the ING4/5 and PHF16 subunits in a chromatin-bound context where histone H3 lysine 4 tri-methylation marks were present. Of the many MLL fusions, MLL-ELL particularly depended on the THD2-mediated association with the HBO1 complex for leukemic transformation. The C-terminal portion of ELL provided a binding platform for multiple factors including AF4, EAF1, and p53. MLL-ELL activated gene expression in murine hematopoietic progenitors by loading an AF4/ENL/P-TEFb (AEP) complex onto the target promoters wherein the HBO1 complex promoted the association with AEP complex over EAF1 and p53. Moreover, the NUP98-HBO1 fusion protein exerted its oncogenic properties via interaction with MLL but not its intrinsic HAT activity. Thus, the interaction between the HBO1 complex and MLL is an important nexus in leukemic transformation, which may serve as a therapeutic target for drug development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MLL</kwd><kwd>HBO1</kwd><kwd>leukemia</kwd><kwd>epigenetic regulators</kwd><kwd>ENL</kwd><kwd>AF4</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H05337</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Akihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Akihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005931</institution-id><institution>Yamagata Health Support Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Akihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the City of Tsuruoka</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Akihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005968</institution-id><institution>Leukemia Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Akihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002975</institution-id><institution>Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yokoyama</surname><given-names>Akihiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interaction of the MLL and HBO1 complexes is a key nexus for leukemic transformation that can serve as a therapeutic target.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutated transcriptional regulators often cause uncontrolled self-renewal of immature hematopoietic precursors, which leads to aggressive leukemia. MLL (also known as KMT2A) is a transcriptional maintenance factor that upregulates homeobox (<italic>HOX</italic>) genes in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yu et al., 1998</xref>). Chromosomal translocations generate fusion genes encoding various MLL fusion proteins with more than 80 different partners to induce leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>). MLL fusion proteins cause uncontrolled self-renewal by constitutively activating various oncogenic genes (e.g., <italic>HOXA9</italic>, <italic>MEIS1</italic>), whose expression is normally restricted in immature precursors such as hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Krivtsov et al., 2006</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which MLL fusion proteins aberrantly activate the expression of HSC-specific genes remain elusive.</p><p>MLL fusion proteins form a complex with MENIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yokoyama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yokoyama et al., 2004</xref>), which leads to further association with LEGDF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yokoyama and Cleary, 2008</xref>). MLL fusion proteins bind to their target chromatin through the CXXC domain of MLL, which specifically recognizes unmethylated CpGs, and the PWWP domain of LEDGF, which selectively binds to di/tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me2/3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pradeepa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Nuland et al., 2013</xref>). The CXXC and PWWP domains constitute the minimum targeting module (MTM) which can stably bind to the human MLL target gene promoters (e.g., <italic>HOXA9</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okuda et al., 2014</xref>). Because unmethylated CpGs and H3K36me2/3 marks are associated with transcriptional activation, MLL fusion proteins target a broad range of previously transcribed CpG-rich promoters. Although MLL fuses with a variety of partners, most MLL fusion-mediated leukemia cases are caused by the fusions with the AF4 family (e.g., AF4 also known as AFF1, AF5Q31 also known as AFF4) and ENL family (e.g., ENL also known as MLLT1, AF9 also known as MLLT3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>). AF4 family proteins form a biochemically stable complex with ENL family proteins and the P-TEFb elongation factor (composed of CDK9 and CyclinT1/2), which we termed AEP complexÂ (as in AF4 family/ENL family/P-TEFb complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yokoyama et al., 2010</xref>). AF4 family proteins recruit the SL1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okuda et al., 2015</xref>), which is composed of TBP and the TAF1A/B/C/D subunits and is known to initiate ribosomal RNA transcription by RNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goodfellow and Zomerdijk, 2013</xref>). An artificial construct of MTM fused to the binding platform for SL1 activated the murine <italic>Hoxa9</italic> gene and transformed hematopoietic progenitors (HPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okuda et al., 2015</xref>), indicating that the AF4 family protein activates RNA polymerase II (RNAP2)-dependent transcription, presumably by loading TBP onto the target promoters via SL1. However, why MLL fusion proteins preferentially use the AEP/SL1-mediated transcription pathway is unclear.</p><p>In this study, we identified the evolutionarily conserved trithorax homology domain 2Â (THD2) of MLL (previously termed TRX2 domain) as a key structure required for aberrant self-renewal mediated by MLL fusion proteins. A subsequent proteomic approach identified the HBO1 (also known as KAT7 and MYST2) histone acetyltransferaseÂ (HAT) complex as an associating factor for THD2. HBO1 is a member of the MYST HAT family responsible for histone H3 lysine 14 acetylation (H3K14ac) when complexed with BRPF family proteins, while it mainly acetylates histone H4 lysine 5/8/12 when complexed with JADE family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lalonde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mishima et al., 2011</xref>). HBO1 was recently identified as a therapeutic vulnerability of leukemia stem cells by genetic screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Au et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">MacPherson et al., 2020</xref>). However, its molecular functions on leukemic proteins remain largely elusive. Our detailed structure/function analysis demonstrated that HBO1-MLL interaction promotes AEP-dependent gene activation in MLL fusion-mediated leukemic transformation. Moreover, another leukemic fusion of nucleoporin-98 (NUP98) and HBO1(i.e., NUP98-HBO1) also transformed HPCs via association with MLL. Hence, we propose that HBO1-MLL interaction modules can be utilized as molecular targets for developing drugs that specifically dismantle the oncogenic transcriptional machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>THD2-mediated functions promote MLL fusion-dependent leukemic transformation</title><p>MLL fusion proteins confer unlimited self-renewal ability, leading to the immortalization of HPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lavau et al., 1997</xref>). MLL-ELL is among the frequently observed MLL fusions associated with acute myelogenous leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>). To determine the domain structures required for MLL-ELL-mediated leukemic transformation, we performed myeloid progenitor transformation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lavau et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okuda and Yokoyama, 2017b</xref>), wherein murine HPCs were retrovirally transduced with an MLL fusion gene and cultured in a semisolid medium supplemented with myeloid cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). MLL-ELL transformed HPCs, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DiMartino et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 2001</xref>), featured vigorous colony-forming capacities at the third and fourth passages, and showed elevated <italic>Hoxa9</italic> expression at the first and second passages.

A minimalistic artificial construct of HA-tagged MTM fused to an intact OccludinÂ homology domain (OHD) of ELL failed to transform HPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see MTMh-ELLâ³), whereas inclusion of THD2 to MTM (hereafter denoted as MTMT) caused constitutive activation of <italic>Hoxa9</italic> and immortalization of HPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, see MTMTh-ELLâ³).

An MLL-AF6 fusion construct, in which MLL is fused to the RA1 and RA2 domains of AF6 (see MLL-AF6â²), fully transformed HPCs as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liedtke et al., 2010</xref>). The minimalistic MTM-AF6 fusion construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, see MTMh-AF6â²) activated <italic>Hoxa9</italic> expression in the early passages but produced modest numbers of colonies in later passages, while the inclusion of THD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, see MTMTh-AF6â²) conferred much more vigorous transforming capacities. Deletion of THD2 from a PWWP-MLL-AF6 fusion construct containing the residues 641/1267 of MLL (Pâ²641/1267h-AF6â²) abrogated its transforming ability, suggesting that MLL-AF6 requires THD2 to exert its full transforming potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Nonetheless, an MLL-AF6â² construct lacking THD2 immortalized HPCs albeit less efficiently compared to MLL-AF6â² (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, see MLL-AF6â² ÎTHD2), suggestive of some compensatory functions mediated by other MLL structures retained in MLL-AF6â² but missing in Pâ²641/1267h-AF6â² (i.e., the residues 1/640 and 1268/1395). MLL-AF10 showed a similar trend, in line with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okuda et al., 2017</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, the oncogenic properties of MLL-ENL were not severely affected by the loss of THD2 in terms of colony-forming capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okuda et al., 2014</xref>). However, the colony morphology of immortalized cells (ICs) transformed by the MTMh-ENL construct (MTMh-ENLâ²-ICs) was more differentiated compared to that of MTMTh-ENLâ²-ICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that THD2 is required to block differentiation to some extent. Leukemogenesis in vivo was compromised by the deletion of THD2 for MLL-AF6, -AF10, and -ENL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

Indeed, a FLAG-tagged MLL construct encompassing the residues 869/1152 efficiently co-precipitated with exogenously expressed AF4 or AF5Q31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, see fMLL 869/1152+37aa). However, deletion of THD2 from the FLAG-tagged MLLÎFP construct (containing the residues 1/1395: fMLL ÎFP) did not impair co-precipitation of AF4, indicating that the interaction with AF4 is not mediated by THD2. Sequencing analysis of the vector constructs revealed that the fMLL 869/1152+37aa construct contained an additional coding sequence tethered in frame for 37 residues derived from the pCMV5 vector, which corresponds to a part of the chorionic somatomammotropin hormone 1 gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

Moreover, a FLAG-tagged GAL4 fusion construct tethered to the additional 37 residues co-precipitated with AF5Q31 (see fGAL4+37aa).

Taken together, these results suggest that ELL forms at least two different stable complexes, one is with AF4 family proteins, which subsequently leads to the formation of an AEP/SL1/MED26 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and the other is an EAF1/ELL homodimer complex, which leads to the formation of an EAF1/SL1/MED26 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These two SL1/MED26 containing complexes are similar in composition but different in three key functions. The AEP/SL1/MED26 complex has the NKW motif which is required for AF4-dependent gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okuda et al., 2015</xref>), and contains P-TEFb which promotes transcription elongation, and ENL family proteins which tether AEP on acetylated chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Erb et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wan et al., 2017</xref>).

However, a substantial amount of AF4 (mostly the processed forms of AF4) remained associated with the SA/KT mutant, while co-precipitation of EAF1 was completely abolished. These results suggest that SA/KT mutation abolishes the primary contact of ELL for AF4 and EAF1, while there is an additional contact for AF4 that is unaffected by this mutation. Western blotting of the input samples of the chromatin fraction showed that the SA/KT mutant increased the amount of processed forms of AF4 in the chromatin fraction like the intact form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, see fGAL4-ELLâ³ and fGAL4-ELLâ³SA/KT in the Xpress blot), thus further confirming the interaction with fGAL4-ELLâ³ SA/KT and AF4.

The homeodomain of HOXA9 possesses a sequence-specific DNA-binding ability.

Because the HBO1 complex binds MLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), we hypothesized that the HBO1 portion might confer a targeting ability through association with MLL. To test this hypothesis, we generated an artificial NUP98 fusion construct in which MENIN is fused to NUP98 and examined its transforming properties. Indeed, NUP98-MENIN transformed HPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Artificial NUP98 constructs fused with an HBO complex component (i.e., fNUP98-MEAF6 or -ING5) also transformed HPCs. IP-western blotting showed that these artificial NUP98 fusions were associated with MLL in the chromatin fraction, supporting the hypothesis that NUP98-HBO1 transforms HPCs via interaction with MLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The NUP98 portion did not co-precipitate MLL in this setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, see fNUP98ÎFP), consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shima et al., 2017</xref>). However, it should be noted that the NUP98 portion was shown to localize in proximity with MLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2016</xref>) and promote the physical interaction of NUP98-HOXA9 with MLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shima et al., 2017</xref>). The sgRNA competition assay demonstrated fNUP98-HBO1-ICs depended on MLL for continuous proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), similarly to fNUP98-HOXA9-ICs as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2016</xref>).

IP-WB analysis wherein each component of the HBO1 complex was omitted indicated the PHF16 and ING5 are indeed the most influential components for the MLL-HBO1 complex association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Notably, the omission of HBO1 reduced the association albeit to a much lesser extent, which can be rescued by adding back the C-terminal half of HBO1 that mediates interaction with PHF16 and ING5. The omission of MEAF6 also reduced the association substantially, indicating that the formation of the entire HBO1 complex maximizes the potential of the MLL-HBO1 complex association. Deletion of the ING domain from ING5 resulted in the loss of the MLL-HBO1 complex association, suggesting that the ING domain may provide a direct contact for MLL interaction.

Instead, EAF1 homodimerizes through its EHD. The MTMT-EHD fusion (e.g., MTMTh-EAF1-N) transformed HPCs in a THD2-dependent manner, similar to MLL-AF6, which is known to transform HPCs via homodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liedtke et al., 2010</xref>).

The S600A/K606T double mutation on ELL completely abrogated the interaction with EAF1, while retaining some binding capacity to AF4 and did not impair MLL-ELL-mediated transformation. Thus, we concluded that MLL-ELL transforms HPCs via association with AF4 family proteins, but not with EAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>ChIP-qPCR analysis indicated that ELL recruited AF4 and ENL to the target chromatin but was unable to further recruit SL1 and MED26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that the AEP complex must dissociate from ELL to function as a transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, MLL-ELL is a loading factor of the AEP complex, but not a nucleating factor (like MLL-ENL). In our previous study, we showed that MLL-AF10 is also an AEP loading factor that loads ENL onto chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okuda et al., 2017</xref>). It remains unclear how MLL-AF6, a dimer type of MLL fusion, affects the function of AEP and transforms HPCs. Nonetheless, ChIP-qPCR analysis showed that MLL-AF6 colocalized with AEP components at its target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yokoyama et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that MLL-AF6 also loads AEP to the target chromatin via unknown mechanisms. All of the presumed AEP loading factor type MLL fusions (i.e., MLL-ELL, MLL-AF10, and MLL-AF6) showed susceptibility to <italic>Mllt1</italic> knockdown, whereas the AEP nucleating factor type MLL fusions (e.g., MLL-ENL) were relatively resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Okuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yokoyama et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the AEP loading factor type MLL fusions exhibited relatively strong dependency on THD2, which mediates HBO1 complex recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These results suggest that the HBO1 complex promotes loading of the AEP complex onto target chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Hence, the inhibitors that interfere with the MLL-HBO complex interaction may be highly effective for the AEP loading factor type MLL fusions.</p><p>Like MLL, NUP98 fuses with a variety of partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gough et al., 2011</xref>). NUP98 fusion partners can be roughly subdivided into three groups: the homeodomain-containing protein type (e.g., NUP98-HOXA9), the chromatin reader type (e.g., NUP98-HBO1, -LEDGF, -MLL, -NSD1, -PHF23, -BPTF, and -KDM5A), and the coiled-coil structure containing protein type. Among the chromatin reader type NUP98 fusions, MLL and LEDGF are components of the MLL complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yokoyama and Cleary, 2008</xref>), which targets previously transcribed CpG-rich promoters through association with unmethylated CpGs, di/tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me2/3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Okuda et al., 2014</xref>), and di/tri-methylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me2/3) recognized by the PHD finger 3 of MLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Milne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). NUP98-NSD1 was shown to activate HOX-A genes through the association with methylated H3K36 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2007</xref>), and NUP98-PHF23, -BPTF, and-KDM5A were through association with H3K4me2/3 marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the chromatin reader type NUP98 fusions confer a targeting ability to the chromatin of the HOX-A loci by interacting with specific chromatin modifications or chromatin-binding proteins. A subset of NUP98 fusions including NUP98-HBO1 and -LEDGF appear to target through interaction with MLL at least in part. This was supported by the immortalization of HPCs by the artificial fusion of NUP98 and MENIN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). It has been reported that a portion of MLL target genes is regulated in a MENIN-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artinger et al., 2013</xref>) and an MLL mutant protein lacking the MENIN-binding motif but retaining the CXXC domain and the PHD finger 3 localized at the <italic>HOXA9</italic> locus presumably through the association with unmethylated CpGs and H3K4me2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Milne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that MLL can bind to some of its target chromatin in a MENIN-independent manner. The NUP98-MLL fusion protein expressed in leukemia patients does not retain the structures responsible for interaction with MENIN and LEDGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaltenbach et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that the MLL portion in NUP98-MLL confers its targeting ability in a MENIN-independent manner. The proliferation of NUP98-HBO1-ICs was dependent on MLL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) and was slowed but not entirely blocked by the MENIN-MLL interaction inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These results indicate that a MENIN-less MLL complex may sufficiently recruit NUP98-HBO1 possibly through the association with H3K4me3 marks via the PHD finger 3 of MLL. The presence of H3K4me3 marks at the target promoter is also a prerequisite for the HBO1 complex-MLL association on chromatin as they are recognized by the PHD finger of ING4/5 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Champagne et al., 2008</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that a subset of NUP98 fusions target the HOX-A loci via association with MLL and H3K4me3 marks and activate transcription by NUP98-mediated functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).</p><p>This study demonstrated that various MLL fusions and NUP98 fusions transform HPCs via HBO1-MLL interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Hence, we propose that the binding modules in this interaction can be a good molecular target for drug development.

Myeloid progenitor transformation assays using various MLL fusion proteins reveal that MLL fusion proteins requires the TRX2 domain of MLL for effective leukemic transformation. IP-MS identifies HBO1 as a bona fide binding partner of the MLL TRX2 domain. ChIP-seq experiments in various cancer cell lines indicate overlap between MLL and some of the HBO complex subunits, however this does not establish recruitment at these sites. ChIP-qPCR at a few MLL-fusion target genes with MLL depletion supports the recruitment hypothesis somewhat although with only mixed and modest effect sizes. At this point the paper shifts to a seemingly distinct line of inquiry, which is not closely related to the HBO1-TRX2 story to the first three figures. The new direction examines the ELL fusion partner in some detail using similar fusion protein chimeras, but a portion of Figure 4, is largely confirmatory of previously established findings about the critical regions of ELL for transformation and its AF4/EAF1 partners, adding only that portions of the MLL fusion protein are dispensable, provided that they are replaced with the PWWP of LEDGF. Further experiments define potentially two distinct complexes that have already been characterized being recruited by ELL, although there is overlap here again with their previous studies, and the results are a little hard to interpret. The last figure in the paper tackles the seemingly unrelated Nup98-HBO1 fusion, a rare patient mutation-they demonstrate a requirement for MLL for viability of hematopoietic progenitors transformed by this fusion, connecting back to the TRX2 interaction, and show that Menin inhibitors slow growth.</p><p>Overall, this is a quite comprehensive study demonstrating that various MLL fusions transform hematopoietic progenitors via HBO1-MLL interaction. The quality of the science fairly high (with a few noted exceptions that can be addressed), but the lack of clarity in presentation actively obscures really nice and seemingly important elements of this work. It also stops short of really demonstrating that the MLL-TRX2 motif recruits HBO1 in some direct way, which would be of high impact if it could be more clearly molecularly defined.</p><p>1. The most significant impact of this manuscript is the identification of the TRX2 region of the MLL-N protein as the major point of contact (perhaps not direct), to the HBO1 complex, which adds mechanistic depth to the important recent discovery that the MLL-fusion leukemias rely on HBO1 function (MacPherson et al., Nature 2020). However, it is not clear whether this interaction is direct, or bridged by some, as yet unidentified factor including DNA. It is also important to define the point of contact on the HBO1 side (even which subunit).</p><p>2. The current evidence does not conclusively demonstrate that The MLL-HBO1 interaction is the mechanism of HBO1 recruitment. It would be helpful to do a ChIP experiment in the MLL null background rescuing with +/- TRX2 to demonstrate that this &quot;domain&quot; is responsible for the recruitment-- even more ideal, but perhaps beyond the scope would be a point-mutant that disrupts direct contact to the HBO1 complex.</p><p>3. A large number of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq are performed. However, it is not clear how many repeats were performed. This need to be clearly stated, and biological repeats are needed for at least some of the essential ones, such as MLL1, HBO1 and H3K14ac, the mark deposited by HBO1. It is also important to describe clearly the source and specificity of the antibodies used for ChIP.</p><p>4. It seems that characterization of the AF4 and EAF1 associated complexes (in Figures 4-6) is unrelated to the main topic of this paper. This part is essentially a reinterpretation of prior results from Okuda, JCI 2017. This portion of the prior paper should be corrected there.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65872.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisons:</p><p>1.

When each HBO1 complex component was co-expressed with the MLL bait protein, PHF16 and ING5 were weakly detected in the coprecipitates of the MLL bait protein, whereas HBO1 and MEAF6 were not (Figure 8A), suggesting that PHF16 and ING5 provide major points of contact for MLL. When all of the HBO complex components were co-expressed with the MLL bait protein, a very strong association was observed (Figure 8A, see fMLL 869/1124 + HBO1 complex), suggesting that MLL associates with the HBO1 complex through multiple contacts. Next, we omitted one component each from the HBO1 complex and tested which component provides the most significant contact for MLL. Omission of PHF16 or ING5 resulted in a drastic decrease of MLL-HBO1 complex association (Figure 8B), supporting the notion that PHF16 and ING5 provide major points of contact. Indeed, NUP98-ING5 fusion co-IPed MLL more efficiently compared to NUP98-HBO1 and NUP98-MEAF6 (Figure 7D). To further narrow down the structures responsible for MLL-HBO complex interaction, we generated a series of ING5 mutants and tested their association with MLL. Deleting the ING domain from ING5 resulted in the loss of MLL interaction (Figure 8C). In addition, mutations in the aromatic cage of the PHD finger of ING5, which is critical for methylation-specific association with Histone H3K4, also resulted in the loss of MLL interaction. This suggests that ING5 needs to be bound to methylated histone H3K4 and possibly mediates direct interaction with MLL via its ING domain. These results indicate that MLL-HBO1 complex interaction is mediated by multiple points of contact mainly mediated by PHF16 and ING5 in the chromatin-bound form. These new observations/notions have been added to the revised manuscript. Overall, our results indicated that MLL-HBO1 complex formation is highly context-dependent, which preferentially occurs on chromatin as a fully assembled HBO1 complex. As DNAseI treatment did not hinder the interaction, we believe that DNA is not required for MLL-HBO1 interaction (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We performed ChIP for HBO1 using 3 biological replicates and observed a consistent decrease in the HBO1 ChIP signals at the MYC promoter, supporting the idea that MLL-HBO1 interaction is the mechanism of HBO1 recruitment, at least partially, at the MYC promoter. However, it is also true that HBO1 is recruited to other non-MYC promoters such as RPL13A in the absence of MLL, indicating that HBO1 is recruited to the promoter in non-MLL-mediated manners as well. H3K4me3 marks were substantially decreased at the MYC promoter but not at the RPL13A promoter in MLL-deficient cells. This suggested that MLL-mediated H3K4 methylation is required for ING4/5-mediated HBO1 complex recruitment. As advised by the reviewer, we examined the ability of MLL mutants, with or without THD2 (Formally termed as TRX2 domain), to recruit HBO1 in MLL null background. We did not observe any substantial increase of HBO1 recruitment by the THD2-containing MLL mutant (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C), indicating that THD2 is not sufficient for HBO1 recruitment but requires the pre-existing H3K4me3 marks. We think that the MLL-HBO1 interaction enhances the recruitment of HBO1 to certain promoters such as MYC, while the HBO1 can be recruited to promoters in other ways. We speculate that gene promoters which depend on the AEP/SL1-mediated transcriptional pathway are heavily dependent on the MLL-HBO1 complex. In accord, the MYC promoter shows a relatively robust decrease of the ChIP signals of AEP/SL1 (i.e., ENL, CCNT1, CDK9 and TAF1C) in MLL knockout cells (Figure 3 and Figure 3âfigure supplement1B). In the revised manuscript, we have added these new findings and modified the text to avoid giving the misleading impression that MLL is the sole element whose presence is sufficient for the HBO1 complex recruitment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

This need to be clearly stated, and biological repeats are needed for at least some of the essential ones, such as MLL1, HBO1 and H3K14ac, the mark deposited by HBO1.

ChIP-seq data of H3K14ac was not presented in the initial manuscript. The HBO1/BRPF2 complex was shown to be responsible for the global acetylation of H3K14ac in the hematopoietic cells (1). However, it is considered that the preferred histone modifications provided by the HBO1/PHF16 complex are histone H4K5/8/12 acetylations rather than H3K14/23 acetylations (2). We apologize for indicating that the HBO1/PHF16 complex provides H3K14ac marks in the cartoon in the previous manuscript, which was incorrect. Thus, PHF16-, MEAF6-, and ING4-ChIP analyses were performed to more clearly demonstrate the specific localization of the HBO1 complex and the results have been presented. Details of the antibodies used for ChIP experiments are described in the revised manuscript in Key resource table.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It seems that characterization of the AF4 and EAF1 associated complexes (in Figures 4-6) is unrelated to the main topic of this paper.

The structure/function analysis of MLL fusion proteins demonstrated that MLL-ELL is highly dependent on the HBO1-mediated function in leukemic transformation. Hence, it was important to clarify the mechanism of gene activation by MLL-ELL in this paper to understand why HBO1 association is critically required for MLL-ELL-mediated transformation. Because MLL-ELL associates with AEP similarly to other major MLL fusions such as MLL-AF4 and MLL-ENL, it was speculated that MLL-ELL also activates its target genes via AEP. However, ELL associates with EAF family proteins and MLL-EAF also has transforming ability (3), which contradicts this idea. Thus, EAF1-mediated function could be more important for MLL-ELL-mediated transformation. To dissect the molecular mechanism of transformation, we generated a point mutant that selectively impaired ELL-EAF interaction and demonstrated that EAF1-association is dispensable for MLL-ELL-mediated transformation (Figure 6), thereby indicating that MLL-ELL transforms via AEP-mediated functions, which demands HBO1-mediated functions. We also showed that the presence of THD2 enhances ELL-AEP association to further suggest that one of the roles for the HBO1 complex is to enhance the association of ELL with AEP. These findings are not reinterpretations of our prior results and are relevant to the main topic of this paper, and therefore we have retained them in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
