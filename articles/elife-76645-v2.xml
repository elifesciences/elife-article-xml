The ability to obtain such information and link it to detailed molecular phenotypes of the cells would be highly useful for biomedical investigations but has been underappreciated. Here, we present a method that allows us to characterize complex physiologic behaviors of cells in an intact tissue and then perform live imaging-guided sequencing of the same cells. We validate this approach using a regeneration model of airway tissues and demonstrate how this method leads to new biological findings.</p><p>There is a pressing need for a comprehensive understanding of cellular behaviors in the lung, the site where aberrant cellular behavior has been linked to asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Park et al., 2015</xref>) pulmonary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukumoto et al., 2016</xref>), and viral infections including influenza and coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kumar et al., 2011</xref>). Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a precise way to define cell type and cell state, and new techniques are being developed to determine the spatial distribution of sequenced cells in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marx, 2021</xref>). However, the molecular pathways that drive the cellular behavior in situ continue to be inferred from time-lapse tissue sampling or transcriptional kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>). Moving beyond inference requires coupling visualized in situ cell behavior with deep molecular profiling of visualized cells.</p><p>Live cell imaging is an established technique for capturing morphology and cellular dynamics such as cellular migration during skin regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park et al., 2017</xref>), but imaging in the lung remains challenging due to difficult access and the constant motion of the respiratory system. Additionally, molecular information that accompanies live imaging is largely limited to a few fluorescent reporters. Prior attempts to link deep molecular profiling with live imaging have relied on imaging dissociated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>), cell monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hu et al., 2020</xref>), organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Konen et al., 2017</xref>) rather than on cell behaviors in their native tissue environment.</p><p>Our aim is to bridge the divide between two powerful methodologies - cell behavioral observation through live imaging and transcriptional profiling through single-cell sequencing, ultimately allowing the identification of a transcriptional signature that corresponds to that cell behavior. We present an important step forward toward linking dynamic cell behaviors with single-cell transcriptomics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We describe a novel approach to linking live tissue imaging with single-cell profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In order to visualize the airway epithelium at high resolution over days, we explant a mouse trachea and secure it in a custom imaging platform without tissue submersion. This approach minimizes sample movement during imaging, maintains a constant supply of nutrients from below the explant, and preserves an air-liquid interface (ALI), which is required for the maintenance of the normal cellular architecture of the airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">You et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). This platform allows imaging of common and rare cell types in the airway epithelium at high resolution in their native environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The explant culture also allows an uninjured tracheal epithelium to survive with its native cellular anatomy for weeks with daily high-resolution imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Platform for live imaging of airway tissue.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Behavioral transcriptomics workflow, starting with imaging, followed by image analysis to characterize cellular behavior over different time frames, leading to single-cell applications.

Thus, we imaged a wide range of cellular behaviors, from rapid fluctuations of ciliary beating and directional mucociliary transport over milliseconds to wholescale regeneration of the airway epithelium, which occurs over days after the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1, c to f</xref>, ). Furthermore, this method allows single-cell level registration within tissues that are live-imaged and subsequently fixed and stained, which enables a unique comparison between live fluorescence cellular patterns and immunostains that describe cell identity and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>).</p><p>Remarkably, this airway imaging platform faithfully recapitulates and captures cellular dynamics of epithelial regeneration from native basal stem cells after an extensive epithelial injury induced by sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the first 5 days, the basal cells divide, increasing cellular density and reforming the pseudostratified epithelium. In the next 5–10 days, the epithelium differentiates, leading to the restoration of the full epithelium, including the regeneration of ciliated cells. Complete regeneration requires an air-liquid interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Overall, this murine trachea explant ALI culture retains the nearly complete 3D organization and microenvironment of the basal progenitor cells and, therefore, offers a unique model to study organ physiology and regeneration outside of the body.</p><p>Continuous time-lapse imaging of the airway epithelium for up to 80 hr after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) demonstrated changes in cellular architecture over time, including an increase in the average cellular density and epithelial thickness, without apparent phototoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Imaging of trachea explant controls from uninjured mice over 19 hr revealed no cellular displacement in the airway epithelium (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). We examined cell movement using single-cell tracking following segmentation of cell nuclei and particle image velocimetry (PIV) of non-segmented images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b,c</xref>). These analyses revealed a variety of regeneration cellular dynamics inaccessible without live imaging. For example, Hertwig’s Rule predicts that a cell division plane is perpendicular to the long axis of the cell during the preceding interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Minc and Piel, 2012</xref>). This was established in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Besson and Dumais, 2011</xref>) and developing simple model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigouy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Concha and Adams, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tsou et al., 2003</xref>) but has never been probed in an adult regenerating tissue.

We found that the frequency distribution of cellular speed in different regions at 26–38 hr demonstrated large variability ranging from ‘non-mover’ regions (&lt;1.5 μm/hr) to ‘mover’ regions (&gt;4 μm/hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Furthermore, videos with higher temporal resolution revealed that the cells with much slower movements in the ‘non-mover’ regions had no directional preference and oscillated in place, whereas the ‘mover’ regions with faster cellular movements were more uni-directional with packs of cells migrating in waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3c,d</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-76645-video3.mp4" id="video3"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Timelapse two-photon imaging at 10 min intervals of a regenerating airway epithelium starting at 24 hr after sulfur dioxide injury of a Membrane-GFP/CAGs-H2B-mCherry transgenic mouse.</title><p>The video was composed of single optical sections through the epithelium at 5 μm above the basement membrane (left) and through the mesenchyme at 5 μm below the basement membrane (right).</p></caption></media><p>Distinct subsets of cells have been theorized to contribute to the regeneration process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pardo-Saganta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tadokoro et al., 2014</xref>), but it is unclear whether these heterogeneous transcriptional cell states reflect gene expression stochasticity or correlate with unique cell behaviors. To determine the molecular signatures of cells with directional movement compared to regenerating non-moving cells, we marked epithelial regions by photoconversion using the Kaede transgenic mouse model, in which cells change from green to red after exposure to violet light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tomura et al., 2008</xref>).

We examined published data of an independent injury model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Plasschaert et al., 2018</xref>) and analyzed the prevalence of these signatures during repair after polidocanol injury. As predicted, the M basal cell signature is strongly enriched 24 hr post injury (hpi), declines at 48 hpi and 72 hpi, and returns to baseline at 1 week after injury (all p&lt;10<sup>–16</sup>, Mann-Whitney U test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Similarly, the NM signature is decreased at 24 hpi when cell migration is presumed to be active, increases at 48 hpi and 72 hpi when cell migration is presumed to be diminished, and returns to baseline at 1 week post-injury when regeneration is complete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Furthermore, at 24 hpi we found that scoring basal cells using M and NM signatures segregated basal cells into two statistically distinct cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), indicating that polidocanol regeneration is likely also characterized by these cell phenotypes. To test this possibility, we used unsupervised clustering (Methods) to define two groups of basal cells at 24 hpi and found that these two populations were indeed separately enriched for the M and NM basal cell signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), confirming the presence of distinct M and NM basal cells during polidocanol regeneration.

However, these methods do not capture the dynamics of cell behaviors that often define the unique biological processes that occur in the tissues. To address this gap, we developed an approach to examine the association of molecular and behavioral phenotypes of cells in their native tissues. We established an airway organ explant culture that maintains tissue dynamics for an extended length of time and combined this platform with live imaging in order to observe distinct airway cellular behaviors at a broad time scale, spanning cell migration, cell division, and ciliary beating.</p><p>To link cell behavior to molecular analysis, we used photoconversion to mark cells for subsequent single-cell genomics analysis. We found that a subpopulation of basal stem cells migrates within the lung during early regeneration. We used recently developed single-cell RNA-sequencing approaches to establish molecular signatures for moving and nonmoving basal cells. These distinct cell signatures were identified across independent lung regeneration models, suggesting that M and NM cell behaviors are conserved cellular features of early epithelial regeneration.</p><p>There are important limitations to this approach. For example, the optical requirements of the Kaede photoconversion model limit its application for single cell photoconversion. However, a similar approach can take advantage of different methods of cell labeling and live imaging, including genetic labeling of single cells with fluorescent reporters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The requirement for fluorescence is another constraint of this approach, although label-free imaging approaches may be used to visualize the behavior of individual cells in native tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shah et al., 2022</xref>). Another consideration is that long-term live imaging itself can influence gene expression and cell behavior. Although phototoxicity that leads to photobleaching or dramatic changes in cell integrity can be avoided, subtle changes to gene expression or cell behavior due to live imaging may be difficult to detect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Magidson and Khodjakov, 2013</xref>).</p><p>This report focuses on cellular behavior in response to injury in the airway epithelium.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Murim Choi as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Martijn Nawijn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, the three reviewers agreed that the study has a novelty and will be an interest to the researchers who seek to overcome the current limitation of scRNA-seq approach. However, they also agreed that experimental limitations should be clearly defined and explained. And it should be reflected in the title and abstract. Please read the reviews carefully and address them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Please discuss the potential application of the system to different tissue or disease status.</p><p>Figure 1A. On the right part, proteomics is not actually performed in the paper.</p><p>The manuscript is written in a concise way, but please briefly introduce Kaede mouse photoconversion strategy and ALI culture as they may be new to some readers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) When investigating whether the gene signature that was derived from their own data set (Figure 3c) to a mouse injury model with published data, the description of the method refers to Figure 3e, which is not presented.</p><p>2) Furthermore, the Results section refers to the injury model presented by Borthwick et al., whilst the methods section refers to the mouse injury data by Plasschaert et al.. The authors need to clarify which data set was used in Figure 4.</p><p>3) The authors should also make clear in the Results section that mini-bulks had to be constructed to retrieve the mover versus the non-mover signature and not just leave this to the methods section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The single-cell transcriptomic data from this paper are not presented in any meaningful way by the authors, not even in supplementary figures. The authors claim to be able to discern clib and basal cells in non-mover regions but these data are lacking from the manuscript. The further analysis of the signatures identifying moving and non-moving (basal?) epithelial cells is also lacking, both with regard to similarity to in vivo phenotypes of the tracheal epithelial cells in the (naïve) mouse and with regard to basic functional interpretations. What sort of gene expression programs are different between these two subsets of basal cells?</p><p>The paper now reads very polished, almost like a sales brochure rather than a paper presenting a careful evaluation of the data presented. Limitations of this novel method are not mentioned at all, and the realistic implications of this new approach are also not mentioned. Instead, the authors make rather meaningless claims in the extremely short Discussion section. For instance, the first paragraph of the discussion starts with this language: &quot;The rapid progress in spatially resolved transcriptomics is enabling the discovery and characterization of transcriptionally heterogenous cells in diverse tissue contexts (Lee et al., 2021; Ståhl et al., 2016). However, these methods do not capture the dynamics of cell behaviors that often define the unique biological processes that occur in the tissues. To address this gap, we developed an approach to examine the association of molecular and behavioral phenotypes of single cells in their native tissues.&quot; The authors can hardly claim to examine the association of behavioural phenotypes in single cells when these are analyzed at the group level only. Even more so, the 'dynamics of cell behaviour that often define the unique biological processes in tissue' (what's lacking from the existing techniques) is not really something the authors now describe. This manuscript provides a first step towards linking transcriptional and 'behavioural' phenotypes in explanted tissue – which does signify a step forward, but not the giant leap the authors seem to have in mind.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Single-cell transcriptomics of a dynamic cell behavior in murine airways.&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Mone Zaidi (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Specifically, one of the reviewers felt that the paper would need a thorough re-write to remove all of the unsupported claims and make a real effort to discuss the shortcomings of the model. The re-write has to be reviewed again to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors addressed the previous comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have made several improvements to their manuscript which are well appreciated by this reviewer. The quality of the data presented has increased as a consequence. Unfortunately, these improvements do not extend to the discussion and interpretations offered by the authors.

Hence, such claims cannot be made.</p><p>All reviewers ask for a balanced discussion of the limitations of this platform. The authors indeed add a paragraph to the Discussion section.

This type of language should be completely removed from the manuscript and be replaced by a discussion of the real limitations of this system: identifying cell behaviour at the single-cell level has not been achieved with this platform, and therefore cannot be linked to transcriptional phenotypes of individual cells. The data merely show single-cell transcriptomes of groups of cells with a common behaviour. In itself, this is of interest, but it needs to be presented with an accurate discussion of the limitations of the technique.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76645.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Please discuss the potential application of the system to different tissue or disease status.</p><p>Figure 1A.

We used information from all of the single-cell profiles for basal cells in both the moving (M) and non-moving (NM) condition and fed this into the differential expression (DE) algorithm MAST, designed specifically for single-cell RNA seq profiles, to determine genes DE between the two conditions. This approach is described in the main text: “We defined the differences in gene expression between the M basal cells and NM basal cells and identified gene signatures that are enriched (FDR &lt; 0.05, likelihood-ratio test) either in the M or the NM basal cells (Figure 3c).” It is also added more detail in the methods section: “To identify the signature of moving vs non-moving basal cells (Figure 3c) we ran differential expression tests between cells in the Basal cluster between the two conditions (moving and non-moving), and selected genes that were differentially expressed (FDR&lt;0.05). Differential expression tests were carried using a two part ‘hurdle’ model to control for both technical quality and mouse-to-mouse variation. This was implemented using the R package MAST (Finak et al., 2015), and P values for differential expression were computed using the likelihood-ratio test. Multiple hypothesis testing correction was performed by controlling the false discovery rate using the R function ‘p.adjust’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The single-cell transcriptomic data from this paper are not presented in any meaningful way by the authors, not even in supplementary figures.

Figure 3B and Figure 3C present the single-cell transcriptomic data using a dimensionality reduction (3B) and a heatmap (3C), respectively. In the revised manuscript, we clarify this further in the text and present further distinction between basal and club cells in an additional figure (new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). The list of differentially expressed genes is included in the Figure 3 heatmap. Pathway analysis using Enrichr (Chen et al., 2013) demonstrated that the differentially expressed gene program is distinct from previously described migration programs such as EMT and unjamming.</p><p>We have added discussion on the limitations of the method in response to all 3 reviewers, including a discussion about single-cell resolution in photoconversion in this context and the use of the explant model (see end of the expanded Discussion section). We also removed the word “single” from the sentence “To address this gap, we developed an approach to examine the association of molecular and behavioral phenotypes of single cells in their native tissues” in the Discussion section.</p><p>Our aim is to bridge the divide between two powerful methodologies – cell behavioral observation through live imaging and transcriptional profiling through single cell sequencing, ultimately allowing the identification of a transcriptional signature that corresponds to that cell behavior. We agree with the reviewer that this is an important step forward towards linking dynamic cell behaviors with single cell transcriptomics and there are important challenges and limitations to resolve, and we have added this to the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have made several improvements to their manuscript which are well appreciated by this reviewer.
