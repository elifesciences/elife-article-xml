This neurodegeneration as well as other central nervous system (CNS) injuries cause permanent disabilities. Thus, generation of new neurons is the rosetta stone in contemporary neuroscience. Glial cells support CNS homeostasis through evolutionary conserved mechanisms. Upon damage, glial cells activate an immune and inflammatory response to clear the injury site from debris and proliferate to restore cell number. This glial regenerative response (GRR) is mediated by the neuropil-associated glia (NG) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, equivalent to vertebrate astrocytes, oligodendrocytes (OL), and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Here, we examine the contribution of NG lineages and the GRR in response to injury. The results indicate that NG exchanges identities between ensheathing glia (EG) and astrocyte-like glia (ALG). Additionally, we found that NG cells undergo transdifferentiation to yield neurons. Moreover, this transdifferentiation increases in injury conditions. Thus, these data demonstrate that glial cells are able to generate new neurons through direct transdifferentiation. The present work makes a fundamental contribution to the CNS regeneration field and describes a new physiological mechanism to generate new neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glia</kwd><kwd>CNS injury</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd><kwd>ventral nerve cord</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PI22CIII/00062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Casas-Tinto</surname><given-names>Sergio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2022-137751OA-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Losada-Perez</surname><given-names>María</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and lineage-tracing analyses reveal that neuropil-associated glia can directly transdifferentiate into neurons in the adultcentral nervous system (CNS) after injury, uncovering a previously unrecognised mechanism for CNS regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal loss caused by injury or neurodegenerative diseases is irreversible in the central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates. Spinal fractures represent 5–6% of all fractures, and spinal cord damage complicates 16–40% of spinal fractures causing significant impairment to patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ding et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, according to the United Nations, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases will almost double in the next 20 years. Current therapeutic strategies aim to replace damaged or lost cells through dedifferentiation and transplantation or cell reprogramming of glial cells. Thus, understanding glial cell contribution after CNS damage is relevant to attain its functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Glial cells activate inflammatory and proliferative responses upon injury in a process known as glial regenerative response (GRR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>). This response is described in multiple species of vertebrates and invertebrates, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process are conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mice or humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chandra et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Losada-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Purice et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Smith et al., 1987</xref>). Glial proliferation is a well-known cellular response upon CNS damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chandra et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li and Hidalgo, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Purice et al., 2017</xref>), however, it is not clear how this response contributes to CNS regeneration. In mammals, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs or NG2-glia) react, giving rise to oligodendrocytes (OL) while in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> neuropil-associated glia play that role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Losada-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>). Upon injury, mammalian OPCs can produce astrocytes and OL contributing to CNS repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Niu et al., 2021</xref>). GRR of neuropil glia (NPG) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva is modulated by a genetic network that controls the switch between quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation. However, whether these mechanisms operate in the mature differentiated adult brain remains unknown. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, NPG somata reside in the cortex/neuropil interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). NPG includes two groups: astrocyte-like glia (ALG) and ensheathing glia (EG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kremer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shweta Sharma et al., 2024</xref>). EG enwraps the neuropil and bundles of axons within the neuropil that define different functional regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>). By contrast, ALG cells project to the neuropil forming a dense meshwork with the synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>), which suggests that ALG cells may play a significant role in maintaining the architecture and function of the neuropil. Larval ALG upregulates <italic>kon-tiki</italic> expression upon injury, a gene which is required for glial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). Besides, larval EG during metamorphosis can dedifferentiate, proliferate, and redifferentiate into adult ALG and EG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, NPG appear as good candidates to replace lost cells with functional ones.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neuropil glia proliferation in normal conditions and upon crush injury in adults.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult central nervous system (CNS) and ventral nerve cord (VNC), indicating the MtN, where the injury is performed.

They secrete molecular signals that influence neuronal survival, axonal regrowth, and synaptic remodelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gallo and Deneen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Losada-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>). These signals include cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular matrix components, which coordinate the activation of repair pathways and the recruitment of immune cells to the injury site.</p><p>Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate glial cell behaviour is critical for developing therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing functional recovery after nervous system injuries. Previously we described that glial cells proliferate in basal conditions and in response to crush injury in the adult fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Losada-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>), although we did not identify the glial subtype responsible for this response. Thus, we questioned if those dividing cells were of the NPG type, i.e., ALG, as previous works suggest in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>), or EG.</p><p>ALG identity is defined by the co-expression of <italic>repo</italic> and <italic>prospero</italic> transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Omoto et al., 2015</xref>). To determine if ALG cells divide upon injury, we caused a crush in the metathoracic neuromere of the adult ventral nerve cord (VNC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Losada-Pérez et al., 2021</xref>) and performed EdU experiments combined with staining with anti-Repo (pan-glia marker) and anti-Prospero antibodies. The results show that ALG cells (Repo positive, Prospero positive) divide (EdU positive) after injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Besides, we also observed EdU+ Repo+ cells that were Pros negative. Therefore, this result indicates that glial cells, different from ALG, also undergo division.</p><p>There is no specific nuclear marker for EG cells, consequently, to determine if the other dividing cells were EG, we expressed the fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator FLY-FUCCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zielke et al., 2014</xref>) under control of a specific driver for EG (R56F03-Gal4). This genetic tool allows the visualisation and monitorisation of cell cycle-regulated proteins tagged with fluorescent markers, allowing to determine the cell cycle phase of individual cells based on their fluorescence (see Materials and methods). In parallel, to monitor cell cycle progression in ALG cells, we expressed FLY-FUCCI under control of the ALG-specific driver alrm-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altenhein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckervordersandforth et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We quantified the number of ALG or EG cells in G2-M (i.e. GFP and RFP positive) in control and injured animals at 24 hr after injury. The data show that EG cells have a basal division rate which does not change in response to injury. In contrast, ALG cells have a higher division rate in basal conditions compared to EG, and this rate increases in response to injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–C’</xref>). This result indicates that adult ALG cells activate a proliferative response after injury, akin to the proliferative response in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Losada-Perez et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, the basal proliferation of EG explains the presence of Repo+ EdU+ Pros- cells.</p><p>To further confirm these results, we generated twin-spot mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yu et al., 2009</xref>) using specific drivers for EG (R65F03-Gal4) or ALG (alrm-Gal4). We combined the twin-spot MARCM technique with tubGal80<sup>TS</sup> under temperature control (see Materials and methods). This technique allowed the study of ALG or EG division selectively in adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The results of ALG MARCM clones indicate that ALG divides in normal conditions in the adult CNS. Since ALG cells are very heterogeneous in size and shape, we were not able to determine the number of cells that composed each clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D’</xref>). However, we quantified the number of individuals with clones. The results indicate that the percentage of samples with clones is significantly higher in injured animals compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To confirm that this division is not the result of residual development, we repeated the experiment with <italic>mature</italic> (7-day-old) flies. In this case, the percentage of not-injured CNS with clones is lower compared with young flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating we were observing a developmental effect. However, in <italic>mature</italic> flies, the percentage of samples with clones is significantly higher in injured animals compared to not-injured controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that ALG divide upon damage after the developmental program is finished.</p><p>MARCM clones induction with the specific driver for EG did not generate any clone, neither in normal conditions nor after crush injury (ACI). MARCM technique generates clones in a stochastic manner, therefore, the lack of MARCM clones does not indicate that EG never divides, instead, it indicates that this event is less frequent than ALG division. These results are consistent with the FLY-FUCCI results.</p><p>Altogether, the results indicate that there is a basal division rate of neuropil glia where EG divides less often than ALG. Also, ALG shows a proliferative response to crush injury. These findings go in line with previous reports indicating the proliferative response of glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>). Moreover, the results now describe proliferation of adult fully differentiated glial cells and define a differential response of EG and ALG in basal conditions, and upon injury. OPCs carry the proliferative response upon injury in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kato et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Losada-Perez, 2018</xref>). Therefore, these results further support the homology between ALG and vertebrate OPC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Programmed cell death regulates ALG number after injury</title><p>The twin-spot MARCM technique implies that the cell division includes homologous recombination. The first division would give rise to two daughter cells, one GFP positive and other RFP positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These differentially marked daughter cells could further divide or not, yielding clones of different sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D’ and F</xref>). However, during ALG MARCM clone quantification, we noticed that &gt;50% of clones were single-colour clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). This means that after the first division, one of the daughter cells either dies or changes its identity (as we use the alrm-Gal4 ALG-specific driver to express GFP or RFP). To determine if single-colour clones could be explained by programmed cell death (PCD), we inhibited it by co-expressing UAS-p35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hay et al., 1994</xref>), while inducing twin-spot MARCM clones in injured animals. The results showed that p35 significantly reduced the number of single-colour clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These results indicate that a portion of dividing ALG cells undergo PCD, reducing the final number of newly generated ALG after injury. This cellular behaviour is commonly observed during development, where cells are produced in excess and are eliminated by PCD later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuchs and Steller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gabilondo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miguel-Aliaga and Thor, 2009</xref>). Now we describe how differentiated glial cells reproduce this proliferative response and the elimination of cells by PCD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NP glia exchange identities between EG and ALG</title><p>Apoptosis inhibition significantly reduces ALG single-colour clones, but we could still observe them. This could be explained not only by the different effectiveness of the UAS- p35 to suppress apoptosis, but also by the existence of dedifferentiation or transdifferentiation processes. To test this hypothesis, we combined the G-TRACE tool, which allows the visualisation of historical and current Gal4 activation, with TubGal80ts to restrict the G-TRACE historical visualisation to adulthood.</p><p>We drove the expression of G-TRACE reporter with the specific drivers for ALG or EG and analysed the historical and current activation of ALG or EG drivers. The results show that in both ALG and EG experiments, there were cells with historical driver activation but not current activation (GFP+RFP-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–A’</xref>).

To confirm this, we expressed Gal4 technique for real-time and clonal expression (G-TRACE) under the control of <italic>Repo Gal4</italic> pan-glial driver and analysed the presence or absence of transformed cells. We identified GFP+ RFP- cells localised in the VC with identical nuclear shape as the VC cells identified in previous experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), however, we could not find any NP-like cells. Thus, it seems that NP-like cells have glial identity while VC cells have not.</p><p>Next, we addressed if the NP-like glia fate change was triggered by injury. To that end we quantified the number of NP-like cells transformed from ALG or from EG, in not-injured and injured animals 6 hr and 24 hr ACI. The results show that the number of NP-like cells does not increase in response to injury no matter their initial identity, ALG or EG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, we found significant differences in the number of transformed cells that originated from ALG or EG.

The functional implications of this process include CNS regeneration, cellular homeostasis, and behavioural consequences including locomotion recovery, but probably also learning and memory. The concept of ‘baseline’ plasticity in adult tissues suggests that even in the absence of injury or external stimuli, certain cell types may retain the ability to undergo phenotypic changes. In the context of glial cells, this plasticity could reflect an intrinsic readiness to adapt to the dynamic needs of the surrounding tissue, such as maintaining homeostasis, or supporting regeneration. This property of glial cells might impact on compensatory mechanisms for neurodegenerative processes, tissue engineering, and regenerative therapies that exploit endogenous repair mechanisms and cellular adaptability in the nervous system to functional needs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NP glia transdifferentiate into neurons upon injury</title><p>Repo-G-TRACE experiments demonstrated that VC cells are not glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).

On the other hand, VC neurons increase from ALG and EG types in response to injury. This could indicate that ALG divides prior to transdifferentiation while EG transdifferentiate directly. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the number of ALG and EG cells in both injured animals and not-injured controls. We found a significant increase in ALG number in injured animals compared to controls in line with our previous results. Moreover, we found a significant decrease in EG in injured animals compared to not-injured controls, supporting the direct transformation in response to injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to determine the identity of transdifferentiated neurons, we stained VC cells with different neuronal markers such GABA, ChaT, or GluRIIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boppana et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katheder et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kolodziejczyk et al., 2008</xref>). The images showed that VC cells are negative for all markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), preventing definitive identification of their neuronal subtype. The absence of neuronal marker expression in VC cells suggests an immature cellular state. It is plausible that, given sufficient time and appropriate environmental cues, these cells might undergo further differentiation into mature neurons. Such maturation could enable their functional integration into existing neuronal networks, potentially contributing to nervous system regeneration. However, this hypothesis remains speculative and requires further investigation. Future studies should explore the conditions that promote VC cell maturation, including the influence of extracellular signals, transcriptional regulation, and synaptic connectivity. Understanding these processes could advance the development of regenerative therapies targeting neurodegenerative diseases or injuries.</p><p>Taken together, our results indicate that ALG and EG generate new neurons in response to injury through two different mechanisms. ALG divide and transdifferentiate while EG transdifferentiate directly. Thus, glial cells reveal as key contributors to newly generated glia and neurons during regeneration.</p><p>Many authors are exploring the potential of astrocytes to generate new neurons, however, they are focused on artificial reprogramming or transdifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Talifu et al., 2023</xref>). This is the first description of this phenomenon observed in vivo in wild-type animals. Therefore, these findings open a new approach to generate new neurons in a damaged CNS.

This observation opens up the possibility to get an handle on the molecular basis of neuronal and glial generation in the vertebrate CNS after traumatic injury caused by Stroke or Crush injury. The authors use an array of sophisticated tools to follow the development of glial cells at the injury site in very young and mature adults. The results in mature adults reveal a remarkable plasticity in the fly CNS and dispels the notion that repair after injury may be only possible in nerve cords which are still developing. The observation of so called VC cells which do not express the glial marker repo could point to the generation of neurons by former glial cells.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The authors present an interesting story which is technically sound and could form the basis for an in depth analysis of the molecular mechanism driving repair after brain injury in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The evidence for transdifferentiation of glial cells is convincing. In addition, the injury to the adult CNS shows an inherent plasticity of the mature ventral nerve cord which is unexpected.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Traumatic brain injury in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been previously reported to trigger mitosis of glial cells and generation of neural stem cells in the larval CNS and the adult brain hemispheres. Therefore this report adds to but does not significantly change our current understanding. The origin and identity of VC cells is still unclear. The authors show that VC cells are not GABA- or glutamergic. Yet, there are many other neurotransmitter or neuropetides. It would have been nice to see a staining with another general neuronal marker such as anti-Syt1 to confirm the neuronal identity of Syt1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments and positive feedback. We concur that previous studies have demonstrated glial cell proliferation in response to CNS injury. In contrast, our study focuses on glial transdifferentiation that emerges as a novel phenomenon, particularly in response to injury. We found that neuropile glia lose their glial identity and express the pan-neuronal marker Elav. To investigate the identity of these newly observed elav-positive cells, we employed anti-ChAT, antiGABA and anti-GluRIIA antibodies to determine the functional identity of these cells, besides we stained them with other neuronal markers such Enabled, Gigas or Dac (not shown); however, our attempts yielded limited success. To address this, we have now included a discussion section exploring the potential identity of these cells, considering the possibility that they may represent immature neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Casas-Tinto et al., provide new insight into glial plasticity using a crush injury paradigm in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

The authors conclude that these findings have important consequences for CNS regeneration and potentially for memory and learning. However, it remains somewhat unclear how glial transformation could contribute to regeneration and functional recovery.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an ongoing question in the laboratory and in the field. We know that glial cells contribute to the regenerative program in the nervous system, and molecular signalling in glial cells is determinant for the functional recovery (Losada-Perez et al 2021). Therefore, we include this concept in the discussion as the evidence indicates that glial cells participate in these programs. However, further investigation is required to clarify and determine the mechanisms underlying this glial contribution. To determine if glial to neuron transformation contributes to functional recovery, we would need to compare the recovery of animals with new VC to animals without VC, however, the molecular mechanism that produces this change of identity is still unknown, and therefore we are not able to generate injured flies with no new VC</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The signal of the Fucci cell cycle reporter seems more complex to interpret based on the panels provided compared to the other methods employed by the authors to assess cell divisions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Fly Fucci is a genetic reporter that might be more complex to interpret than EdU staining or other markers. However, glial cells proliferation is a milestone of this manuscript, and we used different available tools to confirm our results.

But we have not further characterized the identity of these cells. Our aim was to identify these proliferating glial cells as NPG (Neuropile glia), which are Astrocyte-Like Glia (ALG), as previous works suggest in larvae (Kato et al., 2020; Losada-Perez et al., 2016), or Ensheathing Glia (EG). To discard the ALG identity, we used prospero as the best marker. The results indicate that there are ALG among the proliferating population, but in addition, we also found pros- glial cells that were EdU positive. These cells are located in the interface between cortex and neuropile, where the neuropile glia position is described. The anti-pros staining indicated they were no ALG which suggest that they are EG.</p><p>There is no specific nuclear marker for EG cells, therefore we used FLY_FUCCI under the control of a EG specific promoter (R56F03-Gal4) to determine if the other dividing cells were EG. These results indicate that EG glia divide although their proliferation does not increase upon injury.</p><p>The R56F03 Gal4 construct is described as ensheathing glia specific by previous publications, including:</p><p>(1) Kremer M.

Our results can not discard that a residual part of these proliferating cells are not AG nor EG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) You mentioned that ALG are heterogenous in size and shape, does that mean that you may have different subpopulations of ALG? Would that also mean that only a portion of them responds to injury?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, as in Astrocytes in vertebrates this population is highly heterogeneous. Currently there are no molecular tools to specifically identify these subpopulations and characterize their distinct roles. However, emerging research suggests that differences in size, shape, and potentially molecular markers could correlate with functional diversity. This implies that certain subpopulations of ALG may be more specialized or primed to respond to injury, while others may play roles in homeostasis or other processes. Understanding this heterogeneity will require advanced techniques such as single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, or live imaging to unravel how these subpopulations contribute to injury responses and overall tissue dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) You mentioned that NP-like cells have similar nuclear shape and size to ALG and EG, while Ventral cortex cells have larger nuclei. Can you please show a quantification of the NP-like cells and Ventral cortex cells size, and show a direct comparison with ALG and EG cells to support those claims (images, quantification and analysis)?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a new supplementary figure with a graph showing nuclei size differences between VC and NP-like cells, and a diagram showing VC cell localization.

A direct comparison between EG and NP-like glia can be observed in Figure 3 as well.</p><p>Besides of size and localization, we conclude that VC and N-like cells present different molecular markers as VC are elav-positive and reponegative whereas NP-like cells are repo-positive elav-negative</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 2B, the repo expression is not very clear.
