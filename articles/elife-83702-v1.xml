Specifically, which cortical areas encode history-related information and how is this information modulated across learning? To study the relationship between history and learning, we continuously imaged cortex-wide calcium dynamics as mice learn to use their whiskers to discriminate between two different textures. We mainly focused on comparing the same trial type with different trial history, that is, a different preceding trial. We found trial history information in barrel cortex (BC) during stimulus presentation. Importantly, trial history in BC emerged only as the mouse learned the task. Next, we also found learning-dependent trial history information in rostrolateral (RL) association cortex that emerges before stimulus presentation, preceding activity in BC. Trial history was also encoded in other cortical areas and was not related to differences in body movements. Interestingly, a binary classifier could discriminate trial history at the single trial level just as well as current information both in BC and RL. These findings suggest that past experience emerges in the cortex around the time of learning, starting from higher-order association area RL and propagating down (i.e., top-down projection) to lower-order BC where it can be integrated with incoming sensory information. This integration between the past and present may facilitate learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>wide-field imaging</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>history</kwd><kwd>barrel cortex</kwd><kwd>posterior parietal cortex</kwd><kwd>texture discrimination</kwd><kwd>rostrolateral cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000654</institution-id><institution>Marie Curie - Global Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>659719</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilad</surname><given-names>Ariel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003483</institution-id><institution>Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Start up grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilad</surname><given-names>Ariel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A-149858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Helmchen</surname><given-names>Fritjof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030B_170269</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Helmchen</surname><given-names>Fritjof</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Union ERC starting grant, MESO-AG</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101040378</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilad</surname><given-names>Ariel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>As mice learn a sensory discrimination task, information from the previous trial emerges during the current trial period in several task-related cortical areas, just before and during the sensation period.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Learning is a process of acquiring new knowledge required for appropriate behavior and is highly dependent on our previous experience. Our brain integrates incoming sensory information with history information of previous stimuli to form a knowledgeable association of the current stimulus. Although the strong link between history (i.e., past experience) and learning, the underlying cortex-wide dynamics are relatively unknown, partially because most previous studies separately focus either on learning or history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hattori et al., 2019</xref>). Learning-related neuronal dynamics are broadly observed across the whole cortex, including primary sensory and motor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilad and Helmchen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jurjut et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Komiyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Makino and Komiyama, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yan et al., 2014</xref>), higher-order association areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Driscoll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilad and Helmchen, 2020</xref>), and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Le Merre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pasupathy and Miller, 2005</xref>). But do these areas that participate in the learning process also carry trial history information?</p><p>Encoding of information carried on from the previous trial (i.e., trial history) has been reported mainly in higher-order cortical areas such as the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morcos and Harvey, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>), retrosplenial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hattori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vann et al., 2009</xref>), and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsutsui et al., 2016</xref>), and to a smaller extent in lower-order primary sensory areas such as BC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chéreau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodgers et al., 2021</xref>). It is still unknown on how different cortical areas encode trial history with regard to learning. In other words, does trial history encoding in the cortex change as a function of learning? Another important aspect of the history learning is the temporal relationship between trial history encoding and the current stimulus. For example, does trial history emerge in cortex before the current incoming stimulus, or maybe both past and present information emerge simultaneously in a certain cortical area? From the temporal aspect, optogenetic silencing of PPC area during the inter-trial interval affected performance, highlighting that higher-order cortical areas may maintain history information before the incoming current stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To study the history-learning relationship, we use wide-field cortical imaging of mice learning to discriminate between two textures and focus on the cortex-wide dynamics of trial history. In a previous study using the same dataset, we showed that mice learning a whisker-based texture discrimination task, increase activity in task-related areas (e.g., BC and rostrolateral association cortex [RL]) as they become experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilad and Helmchen, 2020</xref>). RL is part of the PPC and is located within the cluster of higher-order association areas surrounding V1. RL plays pivotal roles in cross-modal sensory integration, learning, and history, but the relationship between history and learning in RL is relatively unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Driscoll et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hattori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khodagholy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morcos and Harvey, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Save and Poucet, 2009</xref>). By classifying trials according to the preceding trial, we were able to detect trial history information that emerges only as the mouse gains expertise. Specifically, trial history emerges in RL, before stimulus presentation and then is transferred to BC during stimulus presentation, which may aid in learning the rewarded stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we investigate trial history dynamics across the whole dorsal cortex and its emergence during learning in transgenic mice expressing a calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) in L2/3 excitatory neurons (<italic>n</italic> = 7 mice).

Whisker movements and body movements were video monitored and synchronized to the calcium imaging data (Materials and methods). To map the dorsal cortex, we functionally mapped sensory areas for each mouse during anesthesia (see Materials and methods). Based on these maps (and skull coordinates) we registered all images to the 2D topview Allen reference atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oh et al., 2014</xref>) and defined 25 areas of interest, further divided into four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilad and Helmchen, 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Trial types based on history.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Behavioral setup for head-fixed texture discrimination with simultaneous wide-field calcium imaging and video monitoring of whisker motion and body movement.

Each trial started with an auditory cue (stimulus cue), signaling the approach of either two types of sandpapers (grit size P100: rough texture; P1200: smooth texture; 3M) to the mouse’s whiskers as ‘go’ or ‘no-go’ textures. The texture stayed in touch with the whiskers for 2 s, and then it was moved out after which an additional auditory cue (response cue) signaled the start of a 2-s response period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) followed by a 6-s break until the next trial auditory cue. Five mice were trained to lick for the P100 and two mice were trained to lick for the P1200 texture. Mice were rewarded in ‘Hit’ trials for correctly licking after the go texture and punished with white noise for incorrectly licking for the no-go texture (‘false alarm’ trials, FA). Mice were neither rewarded nor punished when they withheld licking for the go and no-go textures (‘Miss’ and ‘correct-rejection’, CR, trials, respectively). We defined two time windows within the trial structure: the ‘pre period’ when the texture approaches the whiskers (−1 to −0.6 s relative to the texture stop; mainly before the first whisker-texture touch); and the ‘stim period’ during texture touch (−0.2 to 0.2 s relative to texture stop; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>The performance of all mice increased with training (5–11 days; ~500 trials/day) and eventually reached high discrimination levels (quantified by <italic>d</italic>′; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilad et al., 2018</xref>; Materials and methods). We defined the ‘learning threshold’ of reaching expert level for each mouse by crossing the inflection point of the sigmoid fit for the learning curve (in units of ‘trial number’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fastest learning mouse reached threshold in slightly less than thousand trials whereas mouse #4 took substantially longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we defined a naive (first day of recording), learning (day of crossing the learning threshold; second or third day), and expert (last recording day) phases for each mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). All mice, after gaining expertise, showed strong activation in the BC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, upper panel). This activation was during stimulus representation, stronger in Hit trials compared to CR trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, lower panel), not dependent on the texture type (i.e., if the hit was P100 or P1200).</p><p>Here, we focus on the trial history content for each trial type. We subgrouped all the Hit trials (i.e., the current trial type) based on the previous trial type (i.e., trial history): CR (‘CR-Hit’; <italic>n</italic> = 423 ± 74, mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]), Hit (‘Hit-Hit’; <italic>n</italic> = 585 ± 42), FA (‘FA-Hit’; <italic>n</italic> = 217 ± 24), or Miss (‘Miss-Hit’; <italic>n</italic> = 55 ± 24; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f, g</xref>). ‘Miss-Hit’ were not analyzed due to a small number of trials. Our main analysis will compare ‘CR-Hit’ (orange) and ‘Hit-Hit’ (blue) trial pairs, since they are present in large numbers during all phases in each mouse separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref> for a comparison of other trial pairs). We note that learning curves that are calculated separately for each pair (i.e., either a preceding Hit or CR trial) were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We further note FA probabilities did not significantly differ based on the preceding trial type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, the lick reaction time (but not the lick rate) between Hit-Hit and CR-Hit were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). We emphasize that in this comparison, the current trial type is identical (i.e., Hit) whereas only the pervious trial (i.e., the history, CR, or Hit) differed, therefore eliminating activity differences due to the current stimulus.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Trial history in BC emerges during learning</title><p>First, we focused on trial history encoding in BC, specifically during the stim period.

First, two mice performed the task (expert) while we excited the cortex with a control light (510 nm, isosbestic wavelength). Correcting the original signal with the control light maintained significant difference in trial history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, we trained an additional three mice on the same task and imaged their cortex using an interleaved protocol of 473 (calcium signal) and 405 (control signal, isosbestic wavelength) nm lights. The corrected signal (473 signal minus the 405 signal; see Materials and methods) maintained a significant trial history difference between CR-Hit and Hit-Hit conditions during learning and expert phases, but not during the naive phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, we further performed two photon imaging of single cells in BC and RL during the expert phase and found significant trial history differences, that is, higher response in CR-Hit compared to Hit-Hit in BC (during the stim period) and RL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; during the pre period). Taken together, non-calcium dynamics such as hemodynamics have a minor effect the results, specifically regarding trial history differences.</p><p>To check whether this effect is not due to difference in body or whisker movements between the two pair types, we calculated the body movements (1 − frame-to-frame correlation in mouth, forelimb and hindlimb areas) and whisker envelope as a function of time (see Materials and methods). Both body movements and whisker envelope were similar between CR-Hit and Hit-Hit pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and there was no significant difference across mice during the stim period for neither naive, learning, or expert phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, p &gt; 0.05; signed-rank test) nor during the pre period (p &gt; 0.05, signed-rank test, data not shown). A within mouse statistical comparison between body or whisker parameters in CR-Hit and Hit-Hit maintained a non-significant difference in expert (1/7 mice were significantly different; Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test p &gt; 0.05), learning (2/7 mice) and naive (0/7 mice). In addition, we performed a more detailed body and whisker analysis, for example, decomposing the movement to different body parts and obtaining single whisker dynamics. These analyses did not find significant differences in movement parameters between CR-Hit and Hit-Hit conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). These results, along with the fact that the current trial type in both conditions is identical, strongly indicate the presence of trial history information in BC.</p><p>We next quantified the emergence of trial history with regard to the different time scales, the trial structure (within seconds) or the learning profile (across days). We first show 2D activity plots in BC for each trial pair (i.e., CR-Hit and Hit-Hit; showing activity of only the Hit trial), where trial time is plotted on the <italic>x</italic>-axis and trial number across learning time on the <italic>y</italic>-axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; 100-trial bins regardless of trial pair). Both trial pairs display an increase in activity during the stim period slightly after passing the learning threshold. We defined a history modulation index as the difference in activity for BC between the two pair types (Hit-CR minus Hit-Hit). History modulation increased around the stim period only in learning and expert phases but not in the naive case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, c</xref>). A significant history modulation was defined as values exceeding mean ± 2 standard deviation (SD) of a trial-shuffled sample distribution (<italic>n</italic> = 1000 iterations) and was performed for each mouse separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The onset of the history modulation was defined as the first-time frame reaching significant values (red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) and was found in BC within the stim period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>; 0.08 ± 0.28 s, −0.32 ± 0.28 s, median ± SEM relative to texture stop in learning and expert phases, respectively). We note that in the expert phase there is also a small peak exceeding the significance around the cue, indicating history information in BC may be present to some extent before stimulus presentation. Next, we quantified the history modulation in BC during the stim period as a function of the learning profile. History modulation in BC had the steepest increase after mice crossed their learning threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e, f</xref>). The onset of the history modulation was defined as the first trial bin exceeding mean ± 2 standard deviation of trial-shuffled sample distribution and was found to occur shortly after the learning threshold, highly correlated with the learning threshold indicating strong relationship between history emergence and learning of each individual mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g, h</xref>; 500 ± 221 trials, median ± SEM, <italic>r</italic> = 0.97, p &lt; 0.001, Spearman correlation).

For sufficient trial numbers, we focused on the learning phase. First, we compare FA-Hit to Hit-Hit and CR-Hit, that is, the same current trial type but preceded by an error trial (FA). Response in BC for FA-Hit was similar to Hit-Hit and significantly lower compared to CR-Hit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>; p &lt; 0.05 signed-rank test). This result highlights that specifically a correct rejection (CR), rather than the stimulus (i.e., texture) type, has a strong history effect. Next, we compared FA-CR, Hit-CR, and CR-CR, that is, similar to the previous comparison differing only in the current trial type (CR instead of Hit). There was no significant difference between the different pairs, indicating that the current trial type, that is, Hit in this case, has a strong effect along with the history of the CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>; p &gt; 0.05, signed-rank test). A comparison of FA-FA, Hit-FA, and CR-FA did not show a significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>; p &gt; 0.05, signed-rank test). In general, a preceding CR trial resulted in higher activation independent of the current trial type (i.e., Hit, CR, or FA; not significant for CR and FA), indicating that history information is present at the current time independently of incoming sensory information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>; compare orange bars to the blue bars). In conclusion, we found that the CR-Hit pair displayed a specific enhancement in BC which is related both to the preceding and current trial type (see Discussion).</p><p>Next, we expanded our analysis to the whole dorsal cortex during the stim period. Mean activation maps for both CR-Hit and Hit-Hit pairs (i.e., activity for the current Hit trial whereas only the preceding trial was different) during the stim period displayed a pronounced activation patch in BC during naive, learning, and expert phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). BC activity was higher in CR-Hit compared to Hit-Hit especially during learning and expert phases. The grand average activity for all 25 cortical areas highlights history-dependent information that emerges during learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). We note that other areas, for example, different association areas, also encoded trial history information especially during learning and expert phases. In addition, we present activity difference maps between CR-Hit and Hit-Hit conditions during the stim period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These maps clearly show the highest trial history information (i.e., difference in activity) in BC.

Intuitively, one would assume that the current AUC will display higher discrimination power compared to the history AUC because the latter AUC measure compares the same previous trial type which should be harder to discriminate. Interestingly, during the expert phase, history AUC in both BC and RL has a discrimination power in the stim period that is not significantly different than that of the current AUC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b, c</xref>; p &gt; 0.05; singed rank test). In other words, we found that BC and RL discriminate past stimuli just as well as the current stimuli. In addition, during the learning phase, RL and to some extent BC, display a significantly higher history AUC compared to the current AUC, specifically in the pre period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d, e</xref>; p &lt; 0.05; singed rank test). This indicates that history information is discriminative at the single trial level before stimulus onset.

Trial history encoding was not dependent on the current stimulus and emerged at RL association area before texture touch. Our results indicate that a previous CR trial will lead to higher activity in BC and RL compared to a previous Hit trial. This difference is probably not due to pure sensory differences in the previous trial since the effect was not present after FA trials (sup <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>, left panel). In addition, mice trained to lick the P1200 texture displayed a similar bias to the CR-Hit, further indicating that these differences are not purely sensory related. Moreover, this difference is probably not related to the previous motor action (e.g., either lick or no-lick). During the current trial, body and whisker movements were not significantly different, emphasizing that there are no motor-related differences based on the previous trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c, d</xref>). The fact that these differences emerged only after learning implies that these differences are not purely sensory or motor related but rather reflect internal history-related information. It may be that in a go/no-go discrimination task the mouse mainly learns not to lick for the no-go texture (i.e., CR), making the information of a CR trials more pronounced relatively to Hit trials. Another possibility is that a previous CR will cause a pronounced anticipatory state for the incoming texture, leading to enhanced cortical activity. Again, we did not find any consistent differences in motor movements based on the previous trials making this possibility less likely. In summary, our results indicate that history-dependent information emerges internally in cortex as mice learn to discriminate between two stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Trial history emerges in RL and transferred to BC</title><p>BC is considered a lower-order sensory area but encodes not only lower-order stimulus features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Estebanez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garion et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Safaai et al., 2013</xref>) but also higher-order information such as choice and reward value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chéreau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodgers et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zuo and Diamond, 2019</xref>). We additionally found that BC carries trial history information during the sensation period which is related to the previous trial several seconds back. The presence of trial history information in lower-order areas such as BC is interesting by itself, but also raises the question of where is its origin. Interestingly, we show that trial history information emerges in RL before texture touch, implying that RL may transfer past experience in a top-down manner to BC for optimal sensory integration.</p><p>The presence of trial history in RL before the sensation period implies that RL may play a crucial role in linking past experience to ongoing sensory integration. RL is the lateral part of the PPC adjacent to BC, within the cluster of higher-order association areas surrounding V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hovde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lyamzin and Benucci, 2019</xref>). Previous studies showed that trial history of choice outcome is encoded by PPC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morcos and Harvey, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pho et al., 2018</xref>), as well as history of sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>). Silencing the PPC specifically during the inter-trial interval affected the behavioral performance of rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>), whereas silencing during the stimulus presentation did not affected performance. The PPC is also reciprocally connected to hippocampus via entorhinal and retrosplenial cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Save and Poucet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whitlock et al., 2008</xref>) and to basolateral amygdala via the anterior cingulate cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>), giving fast access to the different memory hubs. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khodagholy et al., 2017</xref>) showed coupling of PPC and hippocampal ripples that strengthen in non-REM (Rapid eye movement) sleep after rats learned a spatial exploration task, further indicating that RL may relay history information from subcortical memory hubs to cortex.</p><p>The fact that trial history emerges only after learning, implies that it encodes a subjective value or association of a certain past stimulus. It may be that only once the value of a certain stimulus is established, for example, by strengthening indirect connections between basolateral amygdala (that has a role in associative memory) and RL, history information can aid in efficiently encoding the incoming stimulus. In light of this discussion, we suggest that the consolidation of a certain association (in our case a CR), induces long-term synaptic plasticity of top-down projections from higher-order association area (e.g., RL) to a lower-order sensory area (e.g., BC). This projection-specific potentiation may facilitate the recruitment sensory cortex in the context of the immediate previous history.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanisms for integrating past and present</title><p>The wide-field signal measured in our study reports bulk population activity specifically in L2/3 excitatory cells. Are neuronal populations encoding past and present information in the BC overlapping or distinct? On the one side, it could be that the same cell in BC encodes both the current stimulus and additionally receives top-down input from RL carrying the past stimulus identity. This additional top-down information may amplify sensory integration and optimize discrimination of the current stimulus. On the other side, previous studies that measured single cell activity in the BC showed that single cells tend to respond to one information type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chéreau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Estebanez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rodgers et al., 2021</xref>). In this case, we hypothesize that different populations in BC encode current and history information, which leads to a larger fraction of neurons in BC that are active for the CR-Hit pair. A larger number of active neurons in BC may facilitate sensorimotor integration involving downstream areas such as the motor cortex, further resulting in gaining expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zuo and Diamond, 2019</xref>).</p><p>It is probable that both history and learning involve other circuit elements such as deep cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pasupathy and Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roelfsema and Holtmaat, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vecchia et al., 2020</xref>), inhibitory subtypes, other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lacefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mohan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musall et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petreanu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams and Holtmaat, 2019</xref>), and subcortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garrett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pasupathy and Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). Future work may aim to dissect specific subpopulations that carry history information using similar behavioral tasks, for example, imaging of cortex-wide layer 5 dynamics. Layer 5 neurons may be ideal in integrating past information arriving onto the apical dendrites in layer 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petreanu et al., 2012</xref>) with incoming information arriving from the thalamus. In addition, similar task with reward after CR trails, or tasks that better differentiate between choice and outcome (decision tasks, giving different probabilities of outcome to each choice), or tasks with a dynamic inter-trial interval may shed light on the meaning of this history-learning effect. In summary, our results imply that as we learn, the cortex learns to better integrate past and present information resulting in expert performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and surgical procedures</title><p>Methods were carried out according to the guidelines of the Veterinary Office of Switzerland and following approval by the Cantonal Veterinary Office in Zurich and by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel (Permit Number: MD-20-16065-4). A total of seven adult male mice (1–4 months old) were used in this study. These mice were triple transgenic Rasgrf2-2A-dCre; CamK2a-tTA;TITL-GCaMP6f animals, expressing GCaMP6f in excitatory neocortical layer 2/3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilad and Helmchen, 2020</xref>). The dataset used here is identical to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilad and Helmchen, 2020</xref>), but here we have applied a completely novel history analysis. To generate triple transgenic animals, double transgenic mice carrying CamK2a-Tta62 and TITL-GCaMP6f63 were crossed with a Rasgrf2-2A-dCre line (64; individual lines are available from The Jackson Laboratory as JAX# 016198, JAX#024103, and JAX# 22864, respectively). The Rasgrf2-2A-dCre;CamK2a-tTA;TITL-GCaMP6f line contains a tet-off system, by which transgene expression can be suppressed upon doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gossen and Bujard, 1992</xref>). However, doxycycline treatment is not necessary in these animals, since the Rasgrf2-2A-dCre line holds an inducible system of its own, given that the destabilized Cre (dCre) expressed under the control of the Rasgrf2-2A promoter needs to be stabilized by trimethoprim (TMP) to be fully functional. TMP (Sigma T7883) was reconstituted in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma 34869) at a saturation level of 100 mg/ml, freshly prepared for each experiment. For TMP induction, mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection (150 µg TMP/g body weight; 29 g needle; 3–5 days post-surgery), diluted in 0.9% saline solution. We used an intact skull preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Silasi et al., 2016</xref>) for chronic wide-field calcium imaging of neocortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilad et al., 2018</xref>). Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane (in pure O<sub>2</sub>) and body temperature was maintained at 37°C.

We built a wall around the hemisphere with adhesive material (iBond; UV-cured) and dental cement ‘worms’ (Charisma). Then, we applied transparent dental cement homogenously over the imaging field (Tetric EvoFlow T1). Finally, a metal post for head fixation was glued on the back of the right hemisphere.

Each trial started with an auditory cue (stimulus cue; 2 beeps at 2 kHz, 100 ms duration with 50 ms interval), signaling the approach of either two types of sandpapers (grit size P100: rough texture; P1200: smooth texture; 3M) to the mouse’s whiskers as ‘go’ or ‘no-go’ textures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; pseudo-randomly presented with no more than three repetitions). Sandpapers were mounted onto panels attached to a stepper motor (T-NM17A04; Zaber) mounted onto a motorized linear stage (T-LSM100A; Zaber) to move textures in and out of reach of whiskers. The texture stayed in touch with the whiskers for 2 s, and then it was moved out after which an additional auditory cue (response cue; 4 beeps at 4 kHz, 50 ms duration with 25 ms interval) signaled the start of a 2-s response period. The stimulus and response cues were identical in both textures. The interval between the trails was 6 s (8 s from response to next cue). A water reward (~3 µl) was given to the mouse for licking for the go texture only after the response cue (‘Hit’), that is for the first correct lick during the response period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; lick were detected using a piezo sensor). Punishment with white noise was given for licking for the no-go texture (‘false alarms’; FA). Licking before the response cue was neither rewarded nor punished.

Imaging began only after mice reliably licked for the response cue (typically after the first day; 200–400 trials).

This combination allowed a ~9 mm field-of-view, covering most of the dorsal cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to texture presentation. Blue LED light (Thorlabs; M470L3) was guided through an excitation filter (480/40 nm BrightLine HC), a diffuser, collimated, reflected from the dichroic mirror, and focused through the bottom objective ~100 µm below the blood vessels.

Motor cortex areas were defined based on stereotaxic coordinates and functional patches for each mouse (see below). Thus, all mice had similar regions of interest that were comparable within and across mice. We grouped these 25 areas into auditory (green), association (pink), somatosensory + V1 (blue), and motor (red) areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> ).

We note that the first touch occurred mostly (but not exclusively) in the pre period from −1 to −0.5 relative to texture stop.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using Matlab software (Mathworks). All mice were continuously imaged during learning (5–11 days). Wide-field fluorescence images were sampled down to 256 × 256 pixels and pixels outside the imaging area were discarded. This resulted in a spatial resolution of ~40 μm/pixel and was sufficient to determine cortical borders, despite further scattering of emitted light through the tissue and skull. Each pixel and each trial were normalized to baseline several frames before the stimulus cue (frame 0 division). Our main focus was on the history effect. Because the hit trails had the largest portion from all trails, we focused on the hit trials. We subgrouped all the Hit trials based on the type of the preceding trial as follows: CR-Hit – Hit trials that were preceded by CR trial. Hit-Hit – Hit trials that were preceded by a Hit trial. FA-Hit – hit trials that were preceded by an FA trial. We mainly focused on comparing Hit-Hit and CR-Hit pairs since they had a large proportion in naive, learning, and expert phases (but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). We defined two time periods within the trial structure: pre (−1 to 0.6 s relative to texture stop) and stim (−0.2 to 0.2 relative to texture stop; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Calculation of learning curves</title><p>Trials were binned (<italic>n</italic> = 100 trials with no overlap) across learning (at the stimulus time, adjusted for each mouse) and the performance (defined as <italic>d</italic>′ = <italic>Z</italic>(Hit/(Hit + Miss)) − <italic>Z</italic>(FA/(FA + CR)), where <italic>Z</italic> denotes the inverse of the cumulative distribution function) was calculated for each bin. Next, each behavioral learning curve was fitted with a sigmoid function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>a</italic> denotes the amplitude, <italic>b</italic> the time point (in trial numbers) of the inflection point, and <italic>c</italic> the steepness of the sigmoid.</p><p>A learning threshold was defined as the bin in which the <italic>d</italic>′ crossed the inflection point (half point) of the learning curve sigmoid fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Defining the learning phases</title><p>We defined the naive, learning, and expert phase each as 1 day of recordings, the naive day was defined as the first day to have enough CRs that the performance is still before the crossing threshold (typically the second recording day). The learning day was defined as the day that the mouse crossed the learning threshold, and the expert was defined as the last day of the mouse (usually the fifth day).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Calculating history modulation and onset</title><p>We defined the ‘history modulation’ as the difference between the average activation of all CR-Hit and Hit-Hit trials. To calculate significance of history modulation, we calculated the sample distribution by trial shuffling between CR-Hit and Hit-Hit trials (<italic>n</italic> = 1000 iterations). We than defined the onset of the history modulation as the first bin exceeding mean ± 2 SD of the sample distribution. We calculated this history modulation and significance across the trial dimension (every frame) and across learning dimension (every 100 trials). In the learning dimension, we calculated the average activity in the stim period (−0.2:0.2) of all the CR-Hit and Hit-Hit trials that were falling within each 100 trials bin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Discrimination power between hit trials subgrouped by history</title><p>To measure how well could neuronal populations discriminate between go and no-go textures, we calculated an ROC curve and calculated its AUC (with a value of 0.5 indicating no discrimination power). This can be done for a given area, each time frame within each learning phase separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In general, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare a population’s median to zero (or between two paired populations). For non-paired populations we used a Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test to compare between medians. A two-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to relate between learning and history in BC and RL separately. Multiple group correction was used when comparing between more than two groups.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, conducted additional control experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, conducted additional control experiments</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Methods were carried out according to the guidelines of the Veterinary Office of Switzerland and following approval by the Cantonal Veterinary Office in Zurich (Permit Number: MD-20-16065-4).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83702-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode1"><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral GoNoGo program.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83702-code1-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data and custom code that support the findings of this study are publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/HKVC5">https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/HKVC5</ext-link>.</p><p>The following previously published dataset was used:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marmor</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2022">2022</year><data-title>HistoryLearning</data-title><source>Open Science Framework</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17605/OSF.IO/HKVC5</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No. 659719 (AG).

However several potential confounds call into question the central finding about the effect of the preceding trial on neural responses during the next trial :</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the reviewers' concern very seriously and performed additional experiments and controls to show that the central findings regarding history information are completely maintained. Basically, we have redone the whole study. Please see details below</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Slow timescale hemodynamics can potentially explain the Hit-Hit/CR-Hit difference and need to be controlled for.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now completely addressed. First, we show control results from 2 mice that are in the original data set (m3 and m6). For these mice, we used also a non-calcium isosbestic light (510 nm; Mainly targeting hemodynamic signals) as mice performed the task (expert case). It is clear that the signal obtained from the control light is relatively weak with a typical slow decrease around stimulus onset (Figure S4 shown here). Importantly, when correcting the calcium signal (473 nm) to the hemodynamic signal, trial history information differences are significantly maintained in BC. In general, we have to mention that this mouse line (triple transgenic Layer 2/3 excitatory cells) has a much stronger calcium SNR compared to the hemodynamic intrinsic signal and we have already published 3 papers (2 in Neuron and one in Nat Comm.) with this type of imaging protocol (i.e., only 473 light).</p><p>Second, to thoroughly address this concern, we have basically redone the experiments in 3 mice while controlling for potential effects of non-calcium signal on the results. In short, we trained three mice on the same task and imaged throughout learning using an interleaved protocol of alternating calcium (473 nm) and control (405 nm) lights. This enabled us to correct for hemodynamic signals on a trial-wise basis. In short, results were maintained in both BC and RL (Figure S5 below; We also present within mouse statistics for the 3 mice).</p><p>Third, we performed additional and novel experiments using two-photon microscopy which is not affected by hemodynamic artifacts (Figure S6). In short, we find similar differences between CR-Hit and Hit-Hit conditions using a single cell approach.</p><p>In summary, we have performed additional experiments showing that hemodynamic modulations do not affect the results, specifically trial history information.</p><p>We have now added three Supplementary figures and revised the Results section which now reads (pg. 4): &quot;To control for the possible contamination of non-calcium related signals such as hemodynamics, we performed a battery of additional experiments. First, two mice performed the task (expert) while we excited the cortex with a control light (510 nm, isosbestic wavelength). Correcting the original signal with the control light maintained significant difference in trial history (Figure S4). Second, we trained an additional 3 mice on the same task and imaged their cortex using an interleaved protocol of 473 (calcium signal) and 405 (control signal, isosbestic wavelength) nm lights. The corrected signal (473 signal minus the 405 signal; See Methods) maintained a significant trial history difference between CR-Hit and Hit-Hit conditions during learning and expert phases, but not during the naïve phase (Figure S5). Finally, we further performed two photon imaging of single cells in BC and RL during the expert phase and found significant trial history differences, i.e., higher response in CR-Hit compared to Hit-Hit in BC (during the stim period) and RL (Figure S6; during the pre period). Taken together, noncalcium dynamics such as hemodynamics have a minor effect on the results, specifically regarding trial history differences.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Body movements may well differ on rewarded and unrewarded trials can also potentially account for the Hit-Hit/Cr-Hit difference and need to be controlled for (and unfortunately this can drive hemodynamic differences that could account for the result – for instance, if whisker posture is different after a rewarded and unrewarded trial, which is very common, one could imagine sustained greater blood flow to BC in one case and not the other).</p></disp-quote><p>Once resolving the hemodynamic issue raised in point 1, it might still be possible that some changes in movement or whisker position (even if it happened 10 seconds before) could have some effect on history information. I am one of the pioneers in addressing body movement in relation to wide field signals as can be seen in Gilad et al. 2018 and 2020a, b and Gallero-Salas et al. 2021. For this reason, we give a detailed movement analysis already in Figure 2c, d. From the example in Figure 2c, especially in the expert case, it is evident there are almost no differences in body movements or whisker envelope.</p><p>Nevertheless, we took this concern very seriously. We now meticulously examined and analyzed body and whisker parameters showing that there is no significant difference in body parameters between Hit-Hit and CR-Hit conditions. Please see relevant points below for more details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Statistical analyses need improvement – both because a small sample size makes insignificant outcomes highly likely even when in fact things are significant, and because in several places two sample tests are inappropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added additional statistical analyses beyond the original draft and beyond the statistics presented in Gilad and Helmchen 2020. We also add within mouse statistics per each original mouse (n=7) and also of three additional mice (Figure S5). Importantly, the additional statistics further substantiate the results. Please see detailed response below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) I found the second paragraph of the introduction a bit hard to follow, especially with regard to what the outstanding questions in the field are.
