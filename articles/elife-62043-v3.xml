Flagellar Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling nanodomains, organized by multi-subunit CatSper calcium channel complexes, are pivotal for sperm migration in the female tract, implicating CatSper-dependent mechanisms in sperm selection. Here using biochemical and pharmacological studies, we demonstrate that CatSper1 is an O-linked glycosylated protein, undergoing capacitation-induced processing dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphorylation cascades. CatSper1 processing correlates with protein tyrosine phosphorylation (pY) development in sperm cells capacitated in vitro and in vivo. Using 3D in situ molecular imaging and ANN-based automatic detection of sperm distributed along the cleared female tract, we demonstrate that spermatozoa past the utero-tubal junction possess the intact CatSper1 signals. Together, we reveal that fertilizing mouse spermatozoa in situ are characterized by intact CatSper channel, lack of pY, and reacted acrosomes. These findings provide molecular insight into sperm selection for successful fertilization in the female reproductive tract.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When mammals mate, males ejaculate millions of sperm cells into the females’ reproductive tract. But as the sperm travel up the tract, only a handful of the ‘fittest’ sperm will actually manage to reach the egg. This process of elimination prevents the egg from being fertilized by multiple sperm cells and stops the eggs from being fertilized outside of the womb. A lot of what is known about fertilization in mammals has come from studying how sperm and eggs cells interact in a Petri dish. However, this approach cannot explain how sperm are selected and removed as they journey towards the egg.</p><p>Previous work suggests that a calcium channel, which sits in the membrane surrounding the sperm tail, may provide some answers. The core of this channel, known as CatSper, is made up of four proteins arranged into a unique pattern similar to racing stripes. Without this specific arrangement, sperm cells cannot move forward and fertilize the egg in time. To investigate the role of this protein in more depth, Ded et al. established a new way to image the minute structures of sperm cells, such as CatSper, in the reproductive tract of female mice.</p><p>Experiments in a Petri dish revealed that sperm cells that have been primed to fertilize the egg are a diverse population: in some cells one of the proteins that make up the calcium channel, known as CatSper1, is cleaved, while in other cells this protein remains intact. Visualizing this protein in the female reproductive tract showed that sperm cells close to the site of fertilization contain non-cleaved CatSper1. Whereas sperm cells further away from the egg – and thus closer to the uterus – are more likely to contain broken down CatSper1.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that the state of the CatSper1 protein may be used to select sperm that are most likely to reach and fertilize the egg. Future studies should address what happens to the calcium channel once the CatSper1 protein is cleaved, and how this channel controls the movements and lifespan of sperm. This could help identify new targets for contraception and improve current strategies for assisted reproduction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fertilization</kwd><kwd>capacitation</kwd><kwd>sperm</kwd><kwd>molecular heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>CatSper</kwd><kwd>in situ imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD096745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Jean-Ju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007184</institution-id><institution>Yale School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Jean-Ju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005326</institution-id><institution>Yale University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Yale Goodman-Gilman ScholarAward-2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>Jean-Ju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Male Contraceptive Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hwang</surname><given-names>Jae Yeon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GJ20-17403Y</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ded</surname><given-names>Lukas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fertilizing mouse spermatozoa, characterized by intact CatSper channels, lack of protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and reacted acrosomes, in the female reproductive tract provide molecular insight into sperm selection for successful fertilization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In most mammals, millions or billions of spermatozoa are deposited into the cervix upon coitus. Yet less than 100 spermatozoa are found at the fertilization site, called the ampulla, and only 10–12 spermatozoa are observed around an oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kölle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suarez, 2002</xref>). This implies the presence of mechanisms to select spermatozoa as they travel through the female reproductive tract and to eliminate non-fertilizing, surplus spermatozoa once the egg is fertilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sakkas et al., 2015</xref>). Recent ex vivo imaging studies combined with mouse genetics have shown that surface molecules on the sperm plasma membranes such as ADAM family proteins are essential for the sperm to pass through the utero-tubal junction (UTJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujihara et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, whether such selection and elimination within the oviduct requires specific molecular signatures and cellular signaling of spermatozoa is not fully understood.</p><p>Mammalian sperm undergo capacitation, a physiological process to obtain the ability to fertilize the egg, naturally inside the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austin, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang, 1951</xref>). The emulation of sperm capacitation in vitro led to the development of in vitro fertilization (IVF) techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steptoe and Edwards, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Sauer, 2006</xref>). Since then, most studies on sperm capacitation and gamete interaction have been carried out under in vitro conditions. However, mounting evidence suggests that in vitro sperm capacitation does not precisely reproduce the time- and space-dependent in vivo events in the oviduct. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation (pY), which has been utilized as a hallmark of sperm capacitation over decades, showed different patterns in boar sperm capacitated in vitro from ex vivo and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luño et al., 2013</xref>). In mice, pY is not required for sperm hyperactivation or fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tateno et al., 2013</xref>). Previous in vitro studies that represent the population average at a given time may or may not have observed molecular details of a small number of the most fertilizing sperm cells.</p><p>Capacitation involves extensive sperm remodeling that triggers cellular signaling cascades. Cholesterol shedding and protein modifications occur within the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Visconti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vyklicka and Lishko, 2020</xref>). Cleavage and/or degradation of intracellular proteins by individual proteases and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) also participate in the capacitation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerns et al., 2016</xref>). Various capacitation-associated cellular signaling pathways that include cAMP/PKA activation followed by pY increase and rise in intracellular pH and calcium result in physiological outcomes such as acrosome reaction and motility changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Puga Molina et al., 2018</xref>). The sperm-specific CatSper Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel forms multi-linear nanodomains on the flagellar membrane, functioning as a signaling hub that links these events and motility regulation during capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Sperm from mice lacking the CatSper genes are unable to control pY development and fail to migrate past the UTJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 2009</xref>). The presence and integrity of CatSper nanodomains, probed by CatSper1, correlate with sperm ability to develop hyperactivated motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2019</xref>). It is not known how these molecular and functional events are coordinated in the individual sperm cells within the physiological context. The central hypothesis of this study is that specific modifications and processing of CatSper1, a pore subunit of CatSper channel, govern the channel biogenesis and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling state, endowing differential sperm motility and fertility during the fertilization journey in the female reproductive tract.</p><p>Here we reveal that most fertilizing mouse spermatozoa in situ are molecularly and functionally characterized by intact CatSper channel, lack of pY, and reacted acrosomes. Using biochemical and pharmacological analyses, we show that CatSper1 undergoes O-linked glycosylation during sperm differentiation and maturation. Capacitation induces CatSper1 cleavage and degradation dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and protein phosphorylation cascades. We find that CatSper1 processing correlates with pY development in the flagella among heterogenous sperm cells capacitated in vitro and in vivo. We use ex vivo imaging and microdissection to show that the intact CatSper channel is indispensable for sperm to successfully reach the ampulla and for the acrosome to react. Finally, we use newly developed 3D in situ molecular imaging strategies and ANN approach to determine and quantify the molecular characteristics of sperm distributed along the female reproductive tract. We demonstrate that spermatozoa past the UTJ are recognized by intact CatSper1 signals which are graded along the oviduct. These findings provide molecular insight into dynamic regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the selection, maintenance of the fertilizing capacity, and elimination of sperm in the female reproductive tract.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CatSper1 undergoes post-translational modifications during sperm development and maturation</title><p>We previously found that the CatSper channel complex is compartmentalized within the flagellar membrane, creating linear Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling nanodomains along the sperm tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2019</xref>). Caveolin-1, a scaffolding protein in cholesterol-rich microdomains, colocalizes with the CatSper channel complex but does not scaffold the nanodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). The molecular weight and amount of intact CatSper1, among all CatSper subunits, specifically declines during sperm capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D,H,I,K</xref>). To better understand the molecular basis and functional implications of the unique processing of CatSper1, we first examined CatSper1 protein expression in the testis and epididymis. Interestingly, the molecular weight of CatSper1 increases gradually during sperm development and epidydimal maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <italic>top</italic>), indicating that CatSper1 undergoes post-translational modifications. Next, we examined the nature of the modifications. Blocking tyrosine phosphatases by sodium orthovanadate or adding specific protein phosphatases, such as protein serine/threonine phosphatase 1(PP1) or protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) to solubilized sperm membrane fraction, does not change the molecular weight of CatSper1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By contrast, when the sperm membrane was subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation, O-glycosidase, but not PNGase F, shifts the apparent molecular weight of CatSper1 to closest to the CatSper1 band that corresponds to the smallest molecular weight observed in the testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Before inducing capacitation, CatSper1 is not processed in sperm cells, probably because the CatSper1-targeting protease activity is normally not in the immediate vicinity to the CatSper nanodomains in the flagellar membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,F</xref>). Supporting this notion, the protease activity readily cleaves CatSper1 by solubilizing the sperm membrane fraction with Triton X-100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The CatSper1 N-terminus undergoes capacitation-associated degradation in vitro</title><p>Next, we investigated the location of CatSper1 cleavage and degradation using recombinant CatSper1 proteins and sperm lysates. The CatSper1 antibody used in this study is raised against the first N-terminal 150 amino acids of recombinant CatSper1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ren et al., 2001</xref>). C-terminal HA-tagged full-length (FL) or N-terminal deleted (ND) recombinant CatSper1 are expressed in HEK 293 T cells for pull-down and detection by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Solubilized sperm lysates degrade FL-CatSper1 and result in increased detection of cleaved CatSper1 by HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). By contrast, protein levels of recombinant ND-CatSper1 are not affected by incubation with sperm lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results demonstrate that the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of CatSper1 is the target region for proteolytic activity in sperm cells. How is the CatSper proteolytic activity regulated?</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CatSper1 degradation involves Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphorylation-dependent protease activity</title><p>At the molecular level, capacitation is initiated by HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> uptake, which activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), resulting in increased cAMP levels. HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> also stimulates CatSper-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into sperm cells by raising intracellular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirichok et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We thus examined whether the proteolytic activity requires cAMP/PKA and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathways. Adding a PKA inhibitor H89 or the St-Ht31 peptide, which abolishes PKA anchoring to AKAP, accelerated CatSper1 degradation during sperm capacitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Consistently, calyculin A, a serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor, suppresses the capacitation-associated CatSper1 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data suggest that regulation of the proteolytic activity targeting CatSper1 involves protein phosphorylation cascades. Interestingly, adding Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore A23187 to the sperm suspension induces CatSper1 processing even under non-capacitating conditions that either do not support PKA activation or outright inhibit PKA activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). This effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by A23187 is not simply due to a rise in the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> but presumably also requires membrane events because loading sperm with BAPTA-AM cannot prevent the proteolytic activity under capacitating conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, bottom). Thus, we hypothesize a Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent protease that is indirectly regulated by protein phosphorylation such as calpain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ono et al., 2016</xref>) might process CatSper1. We observed that all three classes of calpain inhibitors prevent CatSper1 from capacitation-associated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). All these results corroborate our hypothesis that the responsible protease(s) is associated with the flagellar membrane but is not localized inside the CatSper nanodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>); capacitation-associated membrane reorganization and the increase in local Ca<sup>2+</sup> via the CatSper channel activates the protease(s). We speculate that this pathway can be indirectly modulated by PKA such as via regulation of the protease activity by PKA phosphorylation of PP1/PP2A.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CatSper1 degradation correlates with pY development in sperm cells capacitated in vitro</title><p>Inducing sperm capacitation in vitro results in a functionally heterogeneous sperm population in which no more than ~15% of cells are hyperactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neill and Olds-Clarke, 1987</xref>). This is because individual sperm cells undergo time-dependent changes. Accordingly, the extent to which CatSper1 degrades varies with individual sperm cells capacitated in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). The presence and integrity of the CatSper nanodomains, probed by the CatSper1 antibody, is an indicator of sperm capability to hyperactivate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Next, we examined the functional relevance of pY to sperm that can hyperactivate. Notably, we find that sperm cells that maintain intact CatSper1 develop capacitation-associated pY to a lesser degree in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This finding is consistent with the reported phenotype of <italic>Catsper1</italic> knockout sperm that exhibit potentiated pY during capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Thus far, our results suggest that in vitro capacitation generates a heterogeneous sperm population in which intact CatSper1 and pY development are inversely correlated at the single cell level.

Sperm from these transgenic mice have green acrosomes (EGFP) and red mitochondria (DsRed2); loss of GFP indicates a reacted acrosome and RFP allows detection of sperm regardless of the acrosome state. We performed microdissection to obtain the spatially distributed sperm populations along the female reproductive tract mated at 8 hr post-coitus and flushed out sperm cells from different regions. By subsequent immunostaining, we found that CatSper1 in the spermatozoa that passed the utero-tubal junction (UTJ) are arranged normally along the tail, mostly protected from degradation, but in decreasing intensity and continuity more towards UTJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In striking contrast, pY is not readily detected in the spermatozoa from the ampulla but appears in the oviductal sperm increasingly towards UTJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Absence of EGFP reveals that spermatozoa from the ampulla are fully capacitated and acrosome reacted (AR) but those in the isthmus are undergoing AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,G</xref>). Ex vivo imaging of Su9-DsRed2/Acr-EGFP sperm in the reproductive tract removed from mated female mice reveals segment-specific patterns of the acrosome status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

This new in situ imaging platform enables capturing a moment of sperm-egg interaction; a spermatozoon that approaches a fertilized egg protruding the 2nd polar body in the ampulla is detected in a cleared female tract 8 hr post-coitus immunostained by acetylated tubulin antibody (Figure 3, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video7">Figure 3—video 7</xref>). CatSper1 antibody specifically recognizes sperm cells transfixed inside the ampulla in cleared female tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). Tissue clearing allows 3D volume imaging of the female tract but does not compromise the resolution. Two linear CatSper1 domains typically observed by confocal imaging are easily observed in the sperm cells inside an ampullar region of the whole cleared female tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Thus, the integrity of CatSper1 in sperm cells at different locations along the female tract can be subjected to quantitative analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Sperm cell that successfully reach the ampulla are CatSper1-intact and acrosome reacted</title><p>With this new imaging strategy to detect sperm cells that remain transfixed in the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we investigated acrosome state and CatSper1 integrity in sperm populations directly from the cleared tract of females 8 hr after mating, focusing on a few anatomically defined regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Based on the earlier results from micro-dissection or ex vivo imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–H</xref>), we anticipated that sperm cells that successfully reach the ampulla would be CatSper1-intact and acrosome reacted. As expected, most sperm cells located in the ampulla exhibit linearly arranged intact CatSper1 and reacted acrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>top</italic>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). In the middle isthmus, both CatSper1 and acrosome remain intact in most sperm cells, but mixed patterns are observed in some cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). Interestingly, acrosome is largely intact in the sperm clusters in the proximal isthmus close to UTJ whereas CatSper1 is barely detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). This contrasts with the reduced but readily visible CatSper1 in the sperm from the same region by microdissection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It is possible that the relatively longer tissue processing time and subsequent labeling could have contributed to lower the signal to noise ratio to a certain degree. Notably, 3D volume imaging of this mid isthmus regions reveals sperm cells aligned in one direction towards the ampulla, providing unprecedented insight into sperm taxis in the fertilization process (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). Our qualitative but semi-quantitative analyses suggest that CatSper1 is largely protected from degradation once in the oviduct; acrosome reaction initiates in the mid-isthmus and is completed in the ampulla before interacting with the oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results are consistent with our initial observations from microdissection and ex vivo imaging studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,G</xref>), validating the information obtained by our in situ molecular imaging platform.

To address these logistics problems, we took an advantage of the artificial neural network (ANN) approach for automatic localization and signal isolation. We performed a proof-of-principle investigation utilizing CatSper1 distributions in sperm cells from our 3D in situ molecular imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). First, we manually annotated 3D fluorescent signatures of sperm, somatic nuclei and background noise from the original images. These signatures were placed in different abundance models in the ANN 3D training environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>) for subsequent ANN training using MatLab ANN module. We performed a supervised iteration process where the sperm locations were predefined in the training environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Detection sensitivity is chosen as a major parameter used to evaluate the ANN performance in the training environment simulated with the values similar to those in real samples. The specificity required for sperm detection is lower than the sensitivity, thus provides mainly empty analytical frames that are easily removed manually. After iteration and performance evaluation, we selected the best performing ANN and analyzed images from our experimental samples for which we manually counted sperm number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The selected ANN is able to recognize all the sperm detected manually and the ANN sensitivity varies around 90% in individual samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), validating the ANN performance. Furthermore, the false-negative detection of sperm all comes from the sperm with dubious signals in the antecedent human eye evaluation; the 90% of the ANN detected sperm expresses well recognizable CatSper1 fluorescent staining patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ANN automatically detects fluorescent patterns from 3D volume images of a cleared female reproductive tract, enabling isolation and statistical comparisons of sperm cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A 3D training environment for ANN emulating sperm cells, somatic nuclei, and noise.

Glycan-modifying enzymes such as glycosidases and glycosyltransferases are present in the epididymal luminal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tulsiani, 2003</xref>). Here we have shown that CatSper1 in mouse sperm is an O-linked glycosylated protein with gradually increasing molecular weight from the testis to the epididymis during male germ-cell development. The different forms of native CatSper1 may represent different degrees of glycosylation. Heterologously expressed CatSper1 cannot reach the plasma membrane, remaining instead at the ER/Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ren et al., 2001</xref>). It is intriguing that the molecular weight of recombinant CatSper1 is similar to one of the testicular forms of CatSper1 but bigger than that of the enzymatically deglycosylated and naked polypeptide. O-linked glycosylation takes place in the cis-Golgi for secreted and transmembrane proteins after the protein is folded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Röttger et al., 1998</xref>), suggesting that additional modification is required for native CatSper1 to exit the Golgi. Determining the precise identity and modification site may help to clarify the long-sought functional expression of the CatSper channel in heterologous systems. In rodents, sialyltransferase displays maturation-associated quantitative changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ram et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scully and Shur, 1988</xref>) and sperm lose sialic acid from the surface during capacitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Sperm glycoproteins promote sperm migration and survival in the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that mature CatSper1 in sperm contains terminal sialic acid residues, consistent with the small drop in Catsper1 molecular weight during capacitation. The dynamic sugar modifications on CatSper1 may serve as a binding site for decapacitation factors and/or a recognition site during capacitation. Supporting this idea, it was previously shown that mouse sperm lacking the CatSper channel cannot pass through the UTJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ho et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Capacitation-associated CatSper1 degradation is blocked by incubation with a 26S proteasome inhibitor, MG-132 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Now we show that solubilized sperm membrane fraction contains additional proteolytic activities that cleave within CatSper1 NTD. The proteolysis involves two distinct pathways: Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and phosphorylation cascades. We hypothesize that a member of calpains, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent modulatory protease family, might cleave CatSper1, as their proteolytic activity can be regulated by PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2018</xref>). Among 15 calpain proteins identified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ono et al., 2016</xref>), calpain1 and calpain11 were previously detected in our sperm proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, we observed that CatSper1 processing requires not a simple rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, but rather Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx mediated by the CatSper channel which normally accompanies membrane reorganization during capacitation. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> level overrides the phosphorylation effect on calpain1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du et al., 2018</xref>). We speculate that calpain11 might be similarly regulated to calpain1, as their domain structures and catalytic residues are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ono et al., 2016</xref>). Since recombinant CatSper1 is cleaved more specifically by sperm lysates, we propose that the testis-specific calpain11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Aharon et al., 2006</xref>) may target CatSper1.</p><p>The effect of CatSper1 truncation on channel activity and sperm motility remains to be determined in future studies. CatSper1 truncation may be coordinated with molecular changes of other CatSper subunits. For example, the protein level of CatSper2, but not CatSper3 or 4, also decreases after capacitation when probed with the antibody recognizing its C-terminal domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Since the cytoplasmic modulatory subunits, CatSperζ and Efcab9, mainly interact with the channel pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2019</xref>), specific processing of the intracellular domains of pore subunits could alter the interactions and subsequent channel activity. Spermatozoa that successfully navigate to the fertilization site in the female reproductive tract and interact with the egg are recognized by intact CatSper1. CatSper1 processing may lead to a loss of control in hyperactivation and eventually end sperm life.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Physiological function of capacitation-associated tyrosine phosphorylation and acrosome reaction</title><p>An increase in pY is one of the various capacitation-associated parameters observed from in vitro capacitated sperm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Visconti et al., 1995</xref>). Subsequently, pY was observed in the flagellum of mouse and human sperm interacting with the oocyte in the medium that supports sperm capacitation and fertilization in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sakkas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Urner et al., 2001</xref>). This correlation of pY and the zona binding previously established pY as an indicator of successful sperm capacitation. More recently, however, different observations have been made with in vivo approaches. In sows inseminated close to ovulation, spermatozoa found in the UTJ exhibited more phosphorylation in the flagella than those bound to oviductal epithelial cells (OEC), where pY was limited to the equatorial region in the sperm head or no pY was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luño et al., 2013</xref>). In mice, the testis-specific tyrosine kinase, Fer, is demonstrated as a master kinase for capacitation-associated pY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvau et al., 2016</xref>). Surprisingly, homozygous <italic>Fer</italic>-mutant male mice are fertile even though their sperm do not develop pY. All together, these results lead to a new interpretation of the physiological significance of pY: successful sperm capacitation does not require pY development. Determining the precise time and place of pY development in sperm in situ would help to elucidate its function in sperm capacitation and fertilization. Here we have shown that sperm cells, which have capacitated in vivo and successfully migrated to the ampulla, are characterized, not only by intact CatSper1, but also by relative lack of pY development and reacted acrosome. These results coincide with our observations from in vitro capacitated sperm cells and other previous studies; pY development inversely correlates with CatSper1 integrity at the single cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); genetic and pharmacological ablation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry potentiates pY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Navarrete et al., 2015</xref>); AR occurs in mid-isthmus before contacting an oocyte ZP( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muro et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Sperm remaining in the female reproductive tract need to be eliminated after fertilization.

We propose that capacitation-associated global pY development represents degenerating sperm which might concomitantly lose motility. It is intriguing that capacitation-associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation activates intrinsic apoptotic cascade and compromises sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koppers et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this idea, ROS inactivates protein tyrosine phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tonks, 2005</xref>) and enhances pY development in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitken et al., 1998</xref>).

Thus, CatSper-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling directly or indirectly contributes to sperm acrosome reaction in the female tract. Future work will determine molecular mechanisms by which CatSper channel activity fine-tunes Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling to regulate hyperactivated motility, as well as how the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is linked to coordinate acrosome reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>New in situ molecular imaging platform for the study of fertilization and reproduction</title><p>The successful development of in vitro capacitation and fertilization systems provided fundamental insights into sperm capacitation, fertilization, and early embryogenesis. On the other hand, it is evident that the in vitro systems have limitations. Sperm numbers required for IVF are much higher than those observed at the fertilization site in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suarez, 2007</xref>). Sperm capacitated in vitro do not encounter the anatomically and spatially distinct environment of the female reproductive tract, for example, missing their interaction with the oviductal epithelial cells. In vitro capacitation also lacks secretory factors from the male and female reproductive tracts that can affect the surface protein dynamics during the capacitation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flesch and Gadella, 2000</xref>). Mouse models that typically use epidydimal sperm for in vitro studies do not contain secretions from male glands. This is in contrast with ejaculated sperm from human and domestic animals. Recent studies have observed sperm behavior in the physiological context through ex vivo imaging of sperm in the mouse and bovine oviducts under transillumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hino and Yanagimachi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kölle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muro et al., 2016</xref>). Yet this technique is limited in providing molecular information at a single cell level, as live imaging is not easily amenable to direct molecular labeling and 3D volume imaging.</p><p>Here, we report new systems to molecularly examine individual sperm cells capacitated in vivo. Polymerization of the hydrogel-embedded time-mated female reproductive tract followed by passive clearing provides a stable meshwork to minimally disturb the original location of sperm cells inside the female tract. This approach allowed us to assess the fine organization of CatSper nanodomains in the sperm cells distributed along the female reproductive tract. We showed that both the intensity and the quadrilateral detection of the domains probed by CatSper1 appear as the common pattern of sperm reaching the ampulla and potentially fertilizing the oocyte. The experimental outputs complement the molecular and functional information of sperm released from micro-dissected female tracts and ex vivo imaging, identifying molecular and functional signatures of fertilizing sperm in the physiological context. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of topological heat-map representations of cumulative results by automatic sperm detection and image post-processing and averaging; this method provides statistically robust presentation and interpretation of the volumetric image data.</p><p>The present study opens up new horizons to microscopically visualize and analyze molecular events in single sperm cells that achieve fertilization. This will allow us to better understand physiologically relevant cellular signaling pathways directly involved in fertilization. We also have illustrated that the same approach of tissue-clearing based 3D in situ molecular imaging is applicable to study gametogenesis in situ. Future areas for investigations as natural extensions of the current study are gameto-maternal interaction, development, transport, and implantation of early embryos and maternal-fetal communication. Developing gamete-specific antibodies and/or knockout validated antibodies to probe molecular abundancy and dynamics in situ and post-processing tools for various parameters will be critical to this end.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Catsper1</italic></td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">Gene ID: 225865</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Catsper1</italic></td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">Gene ID: 225865</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">10-b</td><td valign="top">New England BioLabs</td><td valign="top">Cat# C3019H</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/><italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td valign="top">B6.129S4-<italic>Catsper1</italic>tm1Clph/J</td><td valign="top">Laboratory of <break/>David E.

The individual signal patterns (sperm, somatic cell nuclei, and noise) were isolated from the original volume images using Zen Blue (Carl Zeiss) and IMARIS software (Oxford instruments) and exported as. obj/.fbx files. The isolated signal patterns were used to generate 3D training environments for ANN by importing different abundancies of the individual components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) to the 3D environment operating system, Blender 2.79 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.blender.org/">https://www.blender.org/</ext-link>); the individual 3D training environment (~10<sup>4</sup>) generated together with the exactly defined coordinates of individual components were exported as. obj/.fbx/Notepad++ files. The ANN training environments were used to develop the ANN detecting the sperm in situ. The ANN training was carried out using MATLAB 9.3 (R2017b) software ANN toolbox. The input to the ANN would be virtual <italic>z</italic>-stacks of the produced training environments. The isolated sperm signal patterns were used as a target signature. The supervised training process was performed by comparing the vector coordinates of the individual sperm signatures in the output with the pre-defined vector coordinates of the signatures in the input. This approach also enabled us to evaluate the ANN performance and to quantify signature detection sensitivity and specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), panel 6 ‘ANN performance evaluation’. The detection sensitivity and specificity of ANNs were the major performance indicators used to select ANNs. ANNs with the best performance in detecting the sperm signature were subsequently applied to detect the sperm fluorescent signatures and their post-processing in real volumetric data. In the real environments, selected ANNs showed both sensitivity and specificity around 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Out of millions of sperm deposited in the reproductive tract upon coitus, very few reach the fertilization site, and only one succeeds in fertilizing the egg. The low success rate guarantees selection of the high &quot;quality&quot; of sperm and, in part, guards against polyspermy, but the characteristics of the &quot;successful&quot; spermatozoa have not been well defined. The authors developed a novel technique of in-situ molecular imaging along the whole reproductive tract and provided some of the most convincing answers to the long-standing question.</p><p>Ded and colleagues explore how CatSper channels change between the initial formation of the sperm, after spending time in the female reproductive tract, and the sperm near the site of fertilization. CatSper conducts a pH regulated, Ca<sup>2+</sup> current through sperm, and is required for a series of processes called capacitation. Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via CatSper is specifically required for a sperm swimming pattern called hyperactivation, and in human sperm, a CatSper-conducted Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is hypothesized to signal the acrosome reaction. The channel is a multimeric complex comprised of four different alpha subunits, and several accessory proteins that are nearly all required for CatSper expression and male fertility. Ded et al. found that most sperm lose the intact sperm Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel CatSper in the reproductive tract, but the ones that reach the fertilization sites have intact channels. Surprisingly, the sperm at the site do not have tyrosine phosphorylation, which is acquired during capacitation and traditionally thought to be important for sperm physiology. Also surprising is the finding that sperm successfully reaching the site of fertilization have already undergone the acrosome reaction (AR), a process during which the released acrosomal enzymes have been thought to help digest the egg for the sperm to penetrate and fuse with the egg. Intriguingly, the authors also found that CatSper1 proteins in sperm and in the precursors have different molecular weights. The authors attribute the difference, at least partly, to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent protease-mediated cleavage/degradation. Despite its fundamental importance in fertilization and clear demonstration to be a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in its native environment (sperm), CatSper has failed to be successfully reconstituted in heterologous expression system as a functional ion channel. The finding of molecular modification in the CatSper protein in this paper may help future functional reconstitution.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript presents new methods and provides molecular characterization of sperm physiology along the whole reproductive tract at a very high spatial and temporal resolution. The novel findings are convincing and important for our understanding of mammalian fertilization and ion channel-mediated calcium signaling. Suggested revisions will improve and clarify the presentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript reports several findings that will be of interest to the broad scientific community. However, it is written for a sperm-focused audience, rather than the <italic>eLife</italic> readership. The authors should clarify writing to increase the accessibility of this manuscript by stating motivations for each experiment in the context of biological processes. Also, the manuscript would be easier to read if there was a cohesive, central hypothesis that connect the seemingly separate stories (glycosylation, independence of tyrosine phosphorylation from CatSper, and the geometry of sperm distribution in different parts of the female reproductive tract).</p><p>2) &quot;The molecular weight and amount of CatSper1, but not the other CatSper subunits, declines during sperm capacitation (Chung et al., 2014; Figure 1B, D).&quot;</p><p>It is not clear from the figure that there is a decline in molecular weight of CatSper1 during capacitation. Similarly, it is not clear there is a decrease in amount, as the amount in the figure is not normalized. If there were a specific decrease in amount of CatSper1, but not that of the other CatSpers, would it suggest that the stoichiometry of the CatSper channel changes during capacitation?</p><p>3) Figure 1B, the figure legend for this panel is incomplete. In its current form, it is hard for the readers to understand what are the treatments in the panel.</p><p>4) Figure 1B, in the treatment with O-Gly, the cleavage appears quite incomplete. Did the density of the lower band increase with longer treatment?</p><p>5) Figure 1G, the legend states that &quot;ND-CatSper1 proteins remain largely unchanged under the same conditions (bottom)&quot;, but there seems to be significant change in the figure. Please show statistics from several blots.</p><p>6) Figure 1—figure supplement 1A: The figure legend suggests that CatSper1 is not a phosphoprotein, yet only tyrosine phosphorylation was explored. Does PP1 dephosphorylate serine/threonine as well? If not, the text should be updated to indicate that CatSper1 is not tyrosine phosphorylated.</p><p>7) Figure 1—figure supplement 1E: Please indicate how you determined that A23178 induced CatSper1 processing occurs via the same pathway as PKA. Perhaps the authors have demonstrated that H89 prevents A23178 induced CatSper1 degradation? Or inhibit PKA signaled degradation by loading sperm with BAPTA-AM? Alternatively, it is possible that these be two pathways are distinct? If this is not definitively known, the authors should clarify the schematic to indicate that these steps are speculated.</p><p>8) The motivation for use of the Su9DsRed; Acr EGFP mice is never stated in the manuscript. The authors should state why these sperm were used in both the text, and figure labels should be also be updated (e.g. Figure 2D – to which proteins/structures are these fluorophores anchored?).</p><p>9) Figure 2: This figure would be substantially enhanced by inclusion of a pie chart for in vivo capacitated sperm, similar to the chart included for in vitro capacitated sperm. Also, did you look at pY in the cleared organs?</p><p>10) When describing the images in Figure 3, the text (subsection “3D in situ molecular imaging of gametes in the female reproductive tract”, first paragraph) should state the protein/tissues labeled by each stain.</p><p>11) Have you quantified tyrosine phosphorylation of in vivo sperm? Perhaps the relative fluorescence of immune-stained sperm? The concluding statement to the in vivo imaging paragraph (subsection “Sperm cell that successfully reach the ampulla are CatSper1-intact and acrosome reacted”) suggests that you do. Perhaps the evidence could be explicitly stated and readers directed to a figure panel. Again, including a pie chart with this data would be of great value to the readers (in Figure 2E).</p><p>12) The methods describing development of ANN for these experiments is missing information such as the criteria used for choosing ANN? What quantitative evaluations were used in making these decisions? What percentage of the data were set aside for training?</p><p>13) Were the sperm in Figure 6 (used for ANN analysis) immunolabeled for CatSper1?</p><p>14) Figure 6H. Left panel, what do the delta values refer to? Fluorescence intensity? Right panel: delta fluorescence, what values were used for the basal measurements?</p><p>15) A role for calpain proteolysis in CatSper1 degradation with in vitro capacitation is intriguing, however, it is not clear from the writing that this is a hypothesis. If this is not a hypothesis and Calpain is known to mediate CatSper1 proteolysis, a citation should be provided. If not, the writing should be edited to clarify that this is a hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62043.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript reports several findings that will be of interest to the broad scientific community.

We speculate that the small difference in molecular weight comes from terminal sialylation on O-glycosylated CatSper1. To address the reviewer’s concern, we have re-arranged Figure 1B to show sperm lanes (WCL and Membrane) from a short-exposed image that clearly demonstrates that the upper band specifically declines in WCL from capacitated sperm. This small drop in the molecular weight of sperm CatSper1 is further supported by two other blots (Figure 1I and K) in which AcTub serves as a loading control. We have revised the corresponding figure legend accordingly.</p><p>Re: a decrease in amount and specificity: We previously reported normalized protein levels of CatSper subunits after capacitation to show specific decrease of CatSper1 (~60% of non-capacitated, **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and CatSper2 to a lesser extent (Chung et al., 2014; Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure 7D). In this study, CA IV in Figure 1D serves as a loading control to show specific decline of CatSper1 and Caveolin1, which is in contrast with no change in CatSper3 and CatSpere. To better represent the results and avoid confusion, we have also replaced CatSper1 blot in Figure 1H from a repeat experiment. Regardless, we have toned down this sentence and directed other panels as well “The molecular weight of CatSper1, among all CatSper subunits, specifically declines during sperm capacitation (Chung et al., 2014; Figure 1B, D, H, I, K)”.</p><p>The reviewer suggests an interesting possibility regarding the stoichiometry of the CatSper channel. We speculate that the stoichiometry is not likely to change during capacitation for the following reasons. First, mature sperm lack ER and Golgi and there is no new synthesis or assembly of CatSper channel subunits. Second, CatSper channel complexes (comprised of at least 10 gene products per complex) are linearly arranged in the specialized nanodomains in the flagellar membrane, which would not be favorable for lateral movement of a subunit between complexes. Third, the stoichiometry of the CatSper channel might remain the same if capacitation induced the cleavage only but not degradation of the whole CatSper1. Our CatSper1 antibody used throughout this study detects the N-terminal region of CatSper1 (Figure 1E and G). Currently, there is no antibody recognizing C-terminal CatSper1 available to directly test this idea.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1B, the figure legend for this panel is incomplete.

Therefore, we explored both S/T and Y phosphorylation of CatSper1. No changes in either PP1 or PTP treatment support our conclusion that CatSper1 is not a phosphoprotein. We have revised the text to clarify this point (subsection “CatSper1 undergoes post-translational modifications during sperm development and maturation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 1—figure supplement 1E: Please indicate how you determined that A23178 induced CatSper1 processing occurs via the same pathway as PKA.

Alternatively, it is possible that these be two pathways are distinct? If this is not definitively known, the authors should clarify the schematic to indicate that these steps are speculated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments and great suggestions to further clarify the signaling cascades. In fact, we <italic>did not think</italic> that A231178 induces CatSper1 processing occurs via the same pathway as PKA. We thought that these two pathways are distinct and only indirectly connected. Our model was based on the following observations:</p><p>– Our previous study demonstrated that CatSper1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling crosstalk with capacitation-associated PKA phosphorylation cascades. Blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry by genetic ablation of CatSper or chelating extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by BAPTA potentiated PKA activity and its downstream pY development only under capacitating conditions. Consistently, Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry via A23187 or ionomycin partly blocked this enhancement (Chung et al., 2014, see Figure 4, Supplementary Figure 5B and C and Supplementary Figure 6B).</p><p>– In this study, we have shown that (1) even in non-capacitating sperm, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is sufficient to induce CatSper1 processing (Figure 1I); (2) under capacitating conditions, PKA inhibition either by H89 or ST-Ht31 (Figure 1H and Figure 1—figure supplement 1D) accelerates CatSper1 processing.</p><p>As noted by the reviewer, the above experimental conditions did not directly test the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx alone (such as in the continuous presence of PKA inhibitor) or PKA inhibition itself (in the presence of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelator). We thank the reviewer for these excellent questions to further clarify the signaling pathways!</p><p>We newly performed these experiments and have revealed that (1) PKA inhibition (H89) itself induces CatSper1 processing to some extent, but A23187 treatment accelerate CatSper1 processing even in the presence of H89 under non-capacitation conditions (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, upper); (2) suppressing a rise in cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> by BAPTA-AM, regardless of PKA activity, did not prevent CatSper1 processing (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, bottom). All these results corroborate our hypothesis in our schematic (now Figure 1—figure supplement 1F) that the protease activity is localized close to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (but outside of CatSper nanodomains); the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via CatSper channel, which normally accompanies other capacitation-associated membrane events (i.e., cholesterol efflux), is essential for the protease activity. This pathway can be indirectly modulated by PKA phosphorylation cascades such as regulation of the protease activity by phosphorylating PP1/PP2A the activity.</p><p>We have included these new data as Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and revised the legend accordingly. We have clarified the text (subsections “CatSper1 degradation involves Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphorylation-dependent protease activity” and “CatSper1 as a molecular barcode for sperm maturation and transition in the female tract”) and modified the schematic to indicate PKA and PP1/PP2A regulation of protease X is our speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The motivation for use of the Su9DsRed; Acr EGFP mice is never stated in the manuscript. The authors should state why these sperm were used in both the text, and figure labels should be also be updated (e.g. Figure 2D – to which proteins/structures are these fluorophores anchored?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying the areas that need modification to improve our manuscript. Su9DsRed2/Acr-EGFP mice (Hasuwa et al., 2010) generate sperm that have green acrosome (EGFP fused to proacrosin signal sequence under Acrosin3 promoter) and red mitochondria (DsRed2 fused to a mitochondrial import sequence). Therefore, the sperm head is green prior to the acrosome reaction, but GFP is lost after acrosome reaction. RFP (DsRed2) expression is seen in the midpiece of the sperm regardless of the acrosome state. The mouse line has been utilized by us and others to track the location of sperm in the female reproductive tract and probe the acrosome state in the field (Tokuhiro et al., 2012; Fujihara et al., 2013; Chung et al., 2014; Kiyozumi et al., 2020). We have stated the rationale in the main text (subsection “Sperm cells capacitated in vivo become heterogeneous along the female tract with distinct molecular characteristics”) and updated the labels in Figure 2D. There is space constraint in figure label; we added one color component per each panel and revised the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Figure 2: This figure would be substantially enhanced by inclusion of a pie chart for in vivo capacitated sperm, similar to the chart included for in vitro capacitated sperm. Also, did you look at pY in the cleared organs?</p></disp-quote><p>We were not able to look at pY in the cleared organs because anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), which is a phosphorylation moiety antibody, cross-reacts with many other proteins and yield low signal-to-noise to detect sperm. Now we have included quantification of pY from in vivo capacitated sperm as Figure 2F (please see also our response to revision point #11). We have now provided raw data and pie charts as source data related to this figure.</p><p>We did not quantify in vivo capacitated sperm for CatSper1 from micro-dissection. Our CatSper1 antibody is suitable for direct and specific labeling of sperm by in situ imaging as CatSper1 is a sperm-specific protein. All our quantification from in situ imaging (Figure 4B) and ANN-detection and quantification of sperm for CatSper1 (Figure 6) are statistically significant and strongly support our conclusion. In situ imaging is more desirable when applicable since micro-dissection takes time and cross-contamination to a certain extent during handling is unavoidable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) When describing the images in Figure 3, the text (subsection “3D in situ molecular imaging of gametes in the female reproductive tract”, first paragraph) should state the protein/tissues labeled by each stain.</p></disp-quote><p>Good suggestion. We have updated the text with the requested information (subsections “3D in situ molecular imaging of gametes in the female reproductive tract” and “ANN-quantified CatSper1 signal reveals a molecular signature of successful sperm in situ”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Have you quantified tyrosine phosphorylation of in vivo sperm? Perhaps the relative fluorescence of immune-stained sperm? The concluding statement to the in vivo imaging paragraph (subsection “Sperm cell that successfully reach the ampulla are CatSper1-intact and acrosome reacted”) suggests that you do. Perhaps the evidence could be explicitly stated and readers directed to a figure panel. Again, including a pie chart with this data would be of great value to the readers (in Figure 2E).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion to improve our presentation of the data. Now we have added a bar graph to Figure 2F with the relative proportion of pY (-) vs. pY (+) sperm in these three regions. As we have done for in vitro capacitated sperm (Figure 2B and C), we have simply classified pY immunofluorescence as pY (-) vs. pY (+). The representative images in Figure 2E show our criteria for this classification. We have also included the raw data points (the number of sperm counted for pY immunofluorescence from each region) and pie charts from 9 micro-dissected tracts from 5 females as Figure 2—source data 1. As suggested, these raw data points providing the information on the individual-to-individual and tract-to-tract variations will be of great value to the scientific community. We have explicitly directed readers to the newly added figures for our conclusion statement (subsection “Sperm cells capacitated in vivo become heterogeneous along the female tract with distinct molecular characteristics”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The methods describing development of ANN for these experiments is missing information such as the criteria used for choosing ANN? What quantitative evaluations were used in making these decisions? What percentage of the data were set aside for training?</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, we dedicated one Results subsection “Automatic detection of sperm in the voluminous female tract using artificial neural network” to describe the method of developing ANN and the criteria, along with Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 2. Specifically, the developed ANNs were chosen according to their sensitivity and specificity in detecting sperm cells and somatic nuclei, and the abundance (voxel occupancy) of noise (subsection “Artificial neural network (ANN) image processing”). We have now further highlighted these aspects in the Materials and methods section and directed to the corresponding quantitative graphic output (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C). The approach to generate training environments was addressed in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, Generation of training environments for ANN development. In total, 10<sup>4</sup> environments were generated and utilized (100%) in ANN training. In this revision submission, we have now also provided additional materials related to ANN development such as ANN input feeding, training, construction of numerical objects coordinates arrays for supervised learning and ANN performance evaluation as source data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Were the sperm in Figure 6 (used for ANN analysis) immunolabeled for CatSper1?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the sperm in Figure 6 were immunolabeled for CatSper1 as described in Figure 6D and F. We have clarified this by stating in the figure title and have also revised the text accordingly.</p><p>“Figure 6. ANN assessment of quadrilateral CatSper nanodomains and Δ fluorescent intensity in sperm population along the cleared female tract immunolabeled for CatSper1 conform to findings by other approaches used in this study.”</p><p>“We isolated the fluorescent signal from a proximal region of the principal piece close to the annulus where the immunolabeled CatSper1 signal is the most intense (Figure 6B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 6H. Left panel, what do the delta values refer to? Fluorescence intensity? Right panel: delta fluorescence, what values were used for the basal measurements?</p></disp-quote><p>The delta values refer to the delta value of the fluorescent intensity. We have now clarified the figure legends. The baseline (zero) in the right panel of Figure 6H indicates homogenous angular distribution of the CatSper fluorescent signals with no quadrilateral arrangement. We have now added this description in the figure legend. In our revision submission, we have also provided the statistical evaluation presented in the Figure 6H right panel as “Figure 6H right panel statistical outputs summary table” as part of Figure 6—source data 2 “3D in situ analytical tools for CatSper quadrilateral structure”. We have placed custom scripts, digital masks for CatSper1 fluorescent signal quadrilateral delta values quantification together with text, and a snapshot and video description on how to operate them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) A role for calpain proteolysis in CatSper1 degradation with in vitro capacitation is intriguing, however, it is not clear from the writing that this is a hypothesis. If this is not a hypothesis and Calpain is known to mediate CatSper1 proteolysis, a citation should be provided. If not, the writing should be edited to clarify that this is a hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified and now explicitly present this concept as a hypothesis (subsections “CatSper1 degradation involves Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphorylation-dependent protease activity” and “CatSper1 as a molecular barcode for sperm maturation and transition in the female tract”). We previously showed that CatSper1 degradation is blocked by 26S proteasome inhibitor, MG-132 (Chung et al., 2014). In this study, we find that proteolysis is Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent and inhibited by all three classes of Calpain inhibitors. Yet we currently do not know the identity of the responsible protease(s).</p></body></sub-article></article>
