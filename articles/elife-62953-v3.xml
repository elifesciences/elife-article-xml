shape the biophysical properties of neurons, from the sign of the response mediated by neurotransmitter receptors to the dynamics shaped by voltage-gated ion channels. Therefore, knowing the localizations and types of receptors and channels present in neurons is fundamental to our understanding of neural computation. Here, we developed two approaches to visualize the subcellular localization of specific proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: The flippase-dependent expression of GFP-tagged receptor subunits in single neurons and ‘FlpTag’, a versatile new tool for the conditional labelling of endogenous proteins. Using these methods, we investigated the subcellular distribution of the receptors GluClα, Rdl, and Dα7 and the ion channels para and Ih in motion-sensing T4/T5 neurons of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system.

In the visual system of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, much progress has been made in this direction: numerous studies examined the response properties of different cell-types in the fly brain and electron microscopy studies revealed the neuronal wiring between them. However, one element crucial to our understanding is still missing; these are the neurotransmitter receptors used by cells at the postsynaptic site. This knowledge is essential since neurotransmitters and corresponding receptors define the sign and the time-course of a connection, that is whether a synapse is inhibitory or excitatory and whether the signal transduction is fast or slow. The same neurotransmitter can act on different receptors with widely differing effects for the postsynaptic neuron. Glutamate for instance is mainly excitatory, however, in invertebrates it can also have inhibitory effects when it acts on a glutamate-gated chloride channel, known as GluClα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cully et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mauss et al., 2015</xref>). Recently, it has also been shown that acetylcholine, usually excitatory, might also be inhibitory in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, if it binds to the muscarinic mAChR-A receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bielopolski et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, knowledge inferring the type of transmitter receptor at a synapse is essential for our understanding of the way neural circuits process information.</p><p>Moreover, voltage-gated ion channels shape synaptic transmission and the integration of synaptic inputs by defining the membrane properties of every neural cell type. The voltage-gated calcium channel cacophony, for instance, mediates influx of calcium ions that drives synaptic vesicle fusion at presynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawasaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>). Voltage-gated sodium channels like paralytic (para) are important for the cell’s excitability and the generation of sodium-dependent action potentials. The voltage-gated channel Ih influences the integration and kinetics of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Littleton and Ganetzky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">George et al., 2009</xref>). However, only little is known about how these channels are distributed in neurons and how this shapes the neural response properties.</p><p>One of the most extensively studied neural circuits in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is the motion vision pathway in the optic lobe and the underlying computation for direction-selectivity. The optic lobe comprises four neuropils: lamina, medulla, lobula, and lobula plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As in the vertebrate retina, the fly optic lobe processes information in parallel ON and OFF pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Joesch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borst and Helmstaedter, 2015</xref>). Along the visual processing chain, T4/T5 neurons are the first neurons that respond to visual motion in a direction selective way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behnia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). T4 dendrites reside in layer 10 of the medulla and compute the direction of moving bright edges (ON-pathway). T5 dendrites arborize in layer 1 of the lobula and compute the direction of moving dark edges (OFF-pathway) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>). The four subtypes of T4/T5 neurons (a, b, c, d), project axon terminals to one of the four layers in the lobula plate, each responding only to movement in one of the four cardinal directions, their preferred direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maisak et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of the fly optic lobe and anatomy of T4/T5 neurons with their presynaptic partners and distribution of input synapses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Horizontal view of optic lobe with retina, lamina, medulla, lobula, and lobula plate.

T4 dendrites receive glutamatergic, GABAergic and cholinergic input, whereas T5 dendrites receive GABAergic and cholinergic input only. These input synapses are arranged in a specific spatial order along T4/T5 dendrites (s. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; for overview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Which receptors receive this repertoire of different neurotransmitters at the level of T4/T5 dendrites? Recently, several RNA-sequencing studies described the gene expression pattern of nearly all cell-types in the optic lobe of the fruit fly including T4/T5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pankova and Borst, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Konstantinides et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hörmann et al., 2020</xref>). T4/T5 neurons were found to express numerous receptor subunits of different transmitter classes and voltage-gated ion channels at various expression strengths. However, RNA-sequencing studies do not unambiguously answer the above question for two reasons: mRNA and protein levels are regulated in complex ways via post-transcriptional, translational, and protein degradation mechanisms making it difficult to assign protein levels to RNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vogel and Marcotte, 2012</xref>). Secondly, standard RNA-sequencing techniques cannot provide spatial information about receptor localizations, hence, they are not sufficient to conclude which transmitter receptors receive which input signal. Both shortcomings could in principle be overcome by antibody staining since immunohistochemical techniques detect neurotransmitter receptors at the protein level and preserve spatial information. However, high-quality antibodies are not available for every protein of interest and may have variable affinity due to epitope recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fritschy, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, labeling ion channels via antibodies and ascribing expression of a given channel to a cell-type in dense neuronal tissue remains challenging. The disadvantages of the above techniques highlight the need for new strategies for labeling neurotransmitter receptors in cell types of interest.</p><p>In this study, we employed existing and generated new genetic methods to label and visualize ion channels in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For endogenous, cell-type-specific labeling of proteins, we developed a generalizable method called FlpTag which expresses a GFP-tag conditionally. Using these tools, we explored the subcellular distribution of the glutamate receptor subunit GluClα, the acetylcholine receptor subunit Dα7, and the GABA receptor subunit Rdl in motion-sensing T4/T5 neurons. We found these receptor subunits to be differentially localized between dendrites and axon terminals. Along the dendrites of individual T4/T5 cells, the receptor subunits GluClα, Rdl, and Dα7 reveal a distinct distribution profile that can be assigned to specific input neurons forming synapses in this area. Furthermore, we demonstrated the generalizability of the FlpTag approach by generating lines for the metabotropic GABA receptor subunit Gaba-b-r1 and the voltage-gated ion channels para and Ih. The strategies described here can be applied to other cells as well as other proteins to reveal the full inventory and spatial distribution of the various ion channels within individual neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subcellular localization of the inhibitory glutamate receptor GluClα in T4/T5 neurons</title><p>As suggested by the connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>) and antibody staining against the vesicular glutamate transporter VGluT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Richter et al., 2018</xref>), T4 cells receive input on their dendrites from the glutamatergic medulla neuron Mi9. Since a multitude of glutamate receptors exist, both excitatory and inhibitory, we explored which glutamate receptor forms the synapse between the glutamatergic Mi9 input and T4 dendrites.</p><p>According to a RNA-sequencing study, GluClα is the most highly expressed glutamate receptor in T4 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>). To investigate the distribution of this glutamate receptor in T4 and T5 neurons, we developed a transgenic fly line that allowed us to express a GFP-tagged GluClα in a cell-type specific way. We created a <italic>UAS-GluClα::GFP</italic> line bearing the cDNA of GluClα with a GFP-insertion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This construct can be combined with any <italic>Gal4</italic>-line to study the receptor’s expression and its subcellular localization. We combined the <italic>UAS-GluClα::GFP</italic> line with a membrane-bound <italic>UAS-myr::tdTomato</italic> and expressed both constructs under the control of a T4/T5-specific <italic>Gal4</italic>-driver line. We found GluClα in T4 dendrites of the medulla, where it is distributed in discrete puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; horizontal section, first two panels). A top view of the medulla of these flies reveals that these puncta are arranged in circular clusters, each corresponding to one column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right panel). Since Mi9 is the only glutamatergic presynaptic partner of T4 cells in the medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Richter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>), this columnar arrangement likely reflects the columnar array of Mi9 cell inputs. Conversely, T5 dendrites are completely devoid of GluClα signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, first two panels). This result is in agreement with T5 dendrites not receiving glutamatergic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Richter et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the medulla layer 10, GFP signal of GluClα::GFP is also visible in the axon terminals of T4/T5 in the lobula plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, first two panels). However, both T4 and T5 cells send their axons into the lobula plate, therefore, this staining cannot be assigned to one of the cell types specifically. To differentiate between the two cell types, we used two different driver lines, one specific for either T4 or T5 cells. We confirmed the presence of GluClα in the dendritic layer of T4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the lack thereof in the dendritic layer of T5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, with these specific driver lines, both T4 and T5 neurons express the glutamate receptor in their axon terminals in the lobula plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The presence of GluClα in the axon terminals of T5 neurons explains the high GluClα-mRNA levels in T5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>) even though T5 dendrites are missing a glutamatergic presynaptic partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Richter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Subcellular localization of the inhibitory glutamate receptor GluClα in T4/T5 neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Optic lobe with T4/T5 neurons labeled with myr::tdTomato and GluClα::GFP.

We quantified the mean fluorescence intensity of manually drawn ROIs around the medulla and found both values to be similar for the pan-neuronal <italic>UAS-GluClα::GFP</italic> and the MiMIC line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, we expressed the <italic>UAS-GluClα::GFP</italic> line with a driver line for T1, a cell-type which lacks GluClα mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>). Our <italic>UAS</italic>-line confirmed this result as we could not detect significant levels of GluClα::GFP protein in T1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Hence, overexpression of GFP-tagged GluClα, introduced as a transgene, leads to a subcellular localization pattern that seems to be identical to the endogenous GluClα protein.</p><p>Given that Mi9 is the only glutamatergic input neuron to T4 dendrites and GluClα is the corresponding glutamate receptor, we hypothesized that GluClα should localize on the individual T4 dendrite exclusively where Mi9 makes glutamatergic synapses with the latter. Therefore, we wanted to visualize the distribution of GluClα at the single-cell level along individual T4 dendrites. The dendrites of each T4/T5 subtype are oriented pointing against their preferred direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>). With respect to the point of axonal attachment to the dendrite, T4/T5 dendrites can be divided into a proximal, central and distal region (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Electron microscopy studies have shown that Mi9 forms synaptic contacts with T4 on the distal tips of its dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>). Since T4/T5 dendrites are strongly intermingled in their respective layers, it is not possible to resolve receptor localizations at the single-cell level by labeling the whole population. We used a flippase-based mosaic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>) to sparsely label single T4/T5 neurons with tdTomato together with the <italic>UAS-GluClα::GFP</italic> construct. By using a <italic>FRT-Gal80-FRT</italic> with an hs-FLP, both <italic>UAS-myr::tdTomato</italic> and <italic>UAS-GluClα::GFP</italic> expression are dependent on the same stochastic FLP-event. A heat-shock-activated flippase removes the FRT-flanked <italic>Gal4-repressor Gal80</italic>, which disinhibits Gal4, promoting transcription of both <italic>UAS</italic>-reporters simultaneously resulting in expression of membrane-bound tdTomato and GFP-tagged GluClα in only a few cells of interest. In individual T4 dendrites, we observed that GluClα was predominantly localized to the distal tips, which holds true for all four T4 subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We quantified the intensity distribution of the GluClα::GFP-signal over dendritic distance in individual T4 dendrites. To combine and average this distribution for all four subtypes, we rotated dendrites from each subtype such that the proximal side was on the left side of the image and the distal tips were pointing to the right. Averaged intensities across all subtypes confirmed our observations on individual cells, showing that GluClα is indeed localized toward the distal dendritic tips of T4 dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, we quantified the numbers of GluClα puncta for all subtypes and compared them to the synapse numbers of glutamatergic Mi9 inputs onto T4 determined by the previous EM study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>). The number of GluClα-puncta per T4 cell dendrite (mean: 20.5 puncta) matches closely the number of glutamatergic input synapses made by Mi9 onto one T4 cell (mean: 23 synaptic contacts; personal communication, K. Shinomiya, May 2020) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests that every GluClα-punctum resolved by confocal microscopy in individually labeled T4 dendrites represents one postsynaptic GluClα receptor cluster corresponding to one Mi9-T4 synapse.</p><p>In summary, GluClα localizes to the dendrites of T4 cells and to the axon terminals of both T4 and T5 cells. At the single-cell level, GluClα is distributed toward the distal tips of the dendrites in all T4 subtypes. Strikingly, the number of GluClα puncta closely matches the number of input synapses provided by Mi9, the only glutamatergic input neuron to T4 dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rdl localizes to T4/T5 dendritic compartments receiving GABAergic input</title><p>Having identified glutamatergic synapses, we employed similar methods to visualize GABAergic synapses in T4/T5 neurons. T4 dendrites receive input from several GABAergic cell-types in the medulla: on the proximal base of the dendrite, these are the columnar cells Mi4, C3; the multicolumnar amacrine cell CT1 in the middle and distal part of the dendrite as well as TmY15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, T5 dendrites receive GABAergic input from only two cell-types: CT1 on the proximal base and TmY15 again throughout the central and distal area of the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In total, T4 and T5 dendrites receive roughly the same number of GABAergic input synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>). Three ionotropic GABA receptor subunits are described in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome: Rdl, Lcch3, and Grd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). We focused on the GABA receptor subunit Rdl, since RNA-sequencing studies had identified Rdl as the most highly expressed ionotropic GABA receptor subunit in T4 and T5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pankova and Borst, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>). Five Rdl subunits can form a homomeric chloride channel which leads to hyperpolarization upon GABA-binding, thus representing a receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ffrench-Constant et al., 1993</xref>). Previous studies had created and used a UAS-Rdl::HA line to investigate the distribution of this GABA receptor subunit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons and LPTCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sánchez-Soriano et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raghu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuehn and Duch, 2013</xref>).

The Rdl::GFP protein was only visible in the cell bodies, presumably due to impaired protein translocation. This suggests that overexpressed Rdl only localizes to endogenous GABA synapses that are composed of the Rdl subunit. Hence, this line can be used to study the subcellular localization of Rdl in any given cell of interest.</p><p>Next, we looked at the distribution of the GABA receptor Rdl on individual T4 and T5 dendrites. Using the sparse labeling technique described above, we examined the Rdl::GFP distribution in individual T4/T5 dendrites. We found Rdl on the proximal base and in the central area of both T4 and T5 dendrites across all four subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). On the proximal base most of the Rdl-signal was arranged in strong discrete clusters, whereas sparse puncta localized to the central area and toward the distal tips. The strong Rdl-signal on the proximal base of the dendrite likely corresponds to the high number of GABAergic inputs provided by the following inputs: CT1, Mi4 and C3 for T4 (32.2 synapses) and CT1 for T5 (30.3 synapses) (personal communication, K. Shinomiya, May 2020). The sparsely distributed Rdl-puncta in the center and tips likely correspond to TmY15 inputs for both T4 and T5 dendrites. This distribution is recapitulated in the intensity quantification across all T4/T5 subtypes, with high Rdl intensity on the proximal side and lower signal in the central and distal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We quantified the numbers of Rdl receptor clusters in T4 and T5 dendrites and compared them to the sum of all GABAergic input synapses (Mi4, C3, CT1, TmY15 for T4 and CT1, TmY15 for T5) to T4/T5 mapped by EM studies. We found similar numbers of roughly 40 receptor clusters for both T4 and T5 which match the sum of all GABAergic input synapses to T4 (mean: 40.45) and T5 (mean: 37) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) (EM numbers: personal communication, K.

Furthermore, T4 neurons of the same subtype form synapses with each other at the distal tips of their dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As T4 neurons are cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mauss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>), these T4-T4 synapses are thought to be cholinergic as well. With the exception of GABAergic CT1, T5 dendrites receive cholinergic input from Tm1, Tm2, and Tm4 in the central area of the dendrite. Tm9 and T5 provide cholinergic input mainly towards the distal tips of the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>). T5 dendrites receive almost twice as many cholinergic inputs as T4; 160 and 87 synapses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>). We used an existing GFP-tagged <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic> line to explore the subcellular distribution of these cholinergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raghu et al., 2009</xref>).

Combining this line with the reporter lines <italic>UAS-myr::tdTomato</italic> and <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic> should label all Dα7-expressing cells with tdTomato, and only within those cells, the Dα7 receptor subunits with GFP. In the pan-neuronal overexpression of <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic>, the ACh receptor subunit is broadly expressed throughout all neuropils with specific strong Dα7 signal in medulla layer 10 where T4 dendrites reside and lobula layer 1 where T5 dendrites reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, in both the antibody- and the TG4-experiment, there is only weak Dα7 signal in M10 and Lo1 detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Thus, under UAS-driven overexpression, the levels of Dα7 are increased compared to endogenous Dα7 levels in M10 and Lo1.</p><p>To assess whether the subcellular distribution of Dα7 is qualitatively altered by overexpression, we characterized the distribution of Dα7 in a cell type that does not express this receptor subunit endogenously. Transcriptomic data revealed that Dα7 is not expressed in Mi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>). However, Mi1 receives cholinergic input from L3 and L5 and expresses several different ACh receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>). We tested the <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic> line in Mi1 to explore the qualitative overexpression-effects of this line. When <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic> was overexpressed in Mi1, Dα7 localized to layers 1 and 5 of the medulla, where the dendrites of Mi1 neurons arborize and receive cholinergic input from L3 and L5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This suggests that overexpressed Dα7::GFP localizes to cholinergic synapses and becomes part of an ACh-receptor, even if this subtype is not endogenously expressed in this neuron. If this scenario is true, the <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic> line does not report real endogenous subunit compositions with Dα7, but in general it can still be used as a marker for postsynaptic cholinergic sites.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we performed sparse labeling of individual T4/T5 dendrites with the earlier described Gal80-hs-flippase method to explore the subcellular distribution of Dα7 along T4/T5 dendrites. Dα7 was distributed along the central area and distal tips of both T4 and T5 dendrites whereas the proximal base of the dendrite was completely devoid of Dα7 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). In the quantification, it becomes clear that for all subtypes the Dα7-intensity is strongest in the central area and slightly reduced toward the distal tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that with the <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic> line, Dα7 localizes to the areas where T4/T5 dendrites receive cholinergic input and not to the proximal base which receives only GABAergic synapses. We quantified the number of Dα7-puncta and compared it to the number of cholinergic synaptic contacts from T4/T5 inputs. For T4 dendrites the numbers of Dα7 puncta quantified (mean: 88.4) matched the numbers of cholinergic input synapses mapped by EM reconstruction (mean: 86.9; personal communication, K. Shinomiya, May 2020) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This strongly suggests that Dα7 localizes only to cholinergic synapses. However, for T5 dendrites the Dα7 puncta exhibited 60 synapses less on average when compared to the mean of the summed cholinergic EM input synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The levels of Dα7 along the dendrite are similar for T4 and T5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), even though T5 receive more cholinergic inputs on their distal tips than T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shinomiya et al., 2019</xref>). The main cholinergic input to T5 in the distal area is Tm9, which makes approximately 60 synapses with T5 dendrites. These 60 synapses could potentially be formed via different cholinergic receptors other than Dα7, for instance muscarinic ACh receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic> line cannot be used to define the exact composition of ACh receptor subunits of cholinergic synapses, but labels (nicotinic) ACh receptors in general.

In this configuration FlpTag acts as a protein trap, revealing the protein’s expression pattern. In the alternate orientation the FlpTag cassette is in the 3’ to 5’ direction; oppositely oriented to the gene. For the FlpTag approach, we used the oppositely oriented line in which the coding intron with the FlpTag cassette is naturally cut out during mRNA splicing and no labeling takes place. Only upon UAS-Gal4 driven, cell-type-specific expression of the Flp recombinase, the cassette is flipped in the same orientation as the gene.

While all these approaches tag genes at their endogenous locus, none of them are conditional, for example they cannot be applied in a cell-type-specific manner. Hence, ascribing the expression of the pan-neuronally tagged proteins to cell-types of interest are challenging in dense neuronal tissue.</p><p>To overcome these difficulties, we used two conditional strategies for the investigation of membrane protein localizations in our cell types of interest, T4 and T5 neurons. First, we developed GFP-tagged <italic>UAS</italic>-lines for GluClα and Rdl and tested an existing <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic> line. As stated above, aberrant localization of overexpressed proteins can occur, however, this is not always the case. Overexpression of <italic>UAS-GluClα::GFP</italic> shows a similar receptor localization pattern as both MiMIC and FlpTag endogenous lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), thus, validating the use of <italic>UAS-GluClα::GFP</italic> for studying receptor distribution. Additionally, previous studies reported that the <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic> line showed proper localization of the acetylcholine receptor to endogenous synapses when compared to antibody stainings or endogenous bruchpilot (Brp) puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuehn and Duch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mosca and Luo, 2014</xref>). Here, we confirmed this finding and further showed that Dα7::GFP presumably localizes only to cholinergic synapses. Overexpressing Dα7::GFP in a medulla neuron that is devoid of endogenous Dα7 demonstrated that Dα7::GFP localized to apparent cholinergic synapses. Hence, the <italic>UAS-Dα7::GFP</italic> line can be used to study the distribution of cholinergic synapses, but not the exact composition of cholinergic receptor subunits. A recent study showed that quantitatively the levels of the postsynaptic density protein PSD95 change when overexpressed, but qualitatively the localization is not altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Willems et al., 2020</xref>). Altogether, this suggests that tagged overexpression lines can be used for studying protein localizations, but they have to be controlled carefully and drawn conclusions might be different for every line.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The FlpTag method is generalizable and can be expanded to many genes</title><p>Ideally, a tool for protein tagging should be both endogenous and conditional. This can be achieved by introducing an FRT-flanked STOP cassette upstream of the gene of interest which was engineered with an epitope tag or fluorescent protein. Only upon cell-type specific expression of Flp, the tagged protein will be expressed in a cell-type specific manner. This genetic strategy was utilized by two independent studies to label the presynaptic protein Brp, the histamine channel ort and the vesicular acetylcholine transporter VAChT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pankova and Borst, 2017</xref>).

Here, we found that T4 cells receive an inhibitory, glutamatergic input from Mi9 via GluClα, which, at first sight, seems to contradict our expectation. However, since Mi9 has an OFF-center receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Richter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Drews et al., 2020</xref>), this glutamatergic synapse will invert the polarity from Mi9-OFF to T4-ON. Theoretically, in darkness, Mi9 inhibits T4 via glutamate and GluClα, and this inhibition is released upon an ON-edge moving into its receptive field. The concomitant closure of chloride channels and subsequent increased input resistance in T4 cells results in an amplification of a subsequent excitatory input signal from Mi1 and Tm3. As shown by a recent modeling study, this biophysical mechanism can indeed account for preferred direction enhancement in T4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borst, 2018</xref>). Some studies failed to detect preferred direction enhancement in T4/T5 neurons and they proposed that the enhanced signal in PD seen in GCaMP recordings could be a result from a non-linear calcium-to-voltage transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gruntman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruntman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wienecke et al., 2018</xref>). If this was really the case, the role of Mi9 and GluClα must be reconsidered and future functional experiments will shed light onto this topic.</p><p>Nevertheless, Strother et al. showed that the RNAi- knock-down of GluClα in T4/T5 neurons leads to enhanced turning responses on the ball set-up for faster speeds of repeating ON and OFF edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). Although this observation cannot answer the question about preferred direction enhancement in T4 cells, it indicates that both T4 and T5 receive inhibitory input and that removal of such create enhanced turning responses at the behavioral level. In line with these observations, we also found the glutamate receptor GluClα in T4/T5 axon terminals. A possible functional role of these inhibitory receptors in the axon terminals could be a cross-inhibition of T4/T5 cells with opposite preferred directions via lobula plate intrinsic neurons (LPis). Glutamatergic LPi neurons are known to receive a cholinergic, excitatory signal from T4/T5 neurons within one layer and to inhibit lobula plate tangential cells, the downstream postsynaptic partners of T4/T5 neurons, via GluClα in the adjacent oppositely tuned layer. This mechanism induces a motion opponent response in lobula plate tangential cells and increases their flow-field selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mauss et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, LPi neurons could also inhibit T4/T5 neurons presynaptically at their axon terminals via GluClα in order to further sharpen the flow-field selectivity of lobula plate tangential cells. Taken together, exploring the subcellular distribution of GluClα in T4/T5 neurons highlights its differential functional roles in different parts of these cell types.</p><p>Secondly, the Dα7 signal in the center of T4/T5 dendrites discovered here, corresponds to ionotropic, cholinergic input from Mi1 and Tm3 for T4, and Tm1, Tm2 and Tm4 for T5. These signals correspond to the central, fast, excitatory arm of the motion detector model. As T4 and T5 express a variety of different ACh receptor subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>), the exact subunit composition and underlying biophysics of every cholinergic synapse on T4/T5 dendrites still awaits further investigations.</p><p>Third, inhibition via GABA plays an essential role in creating direction-selective responses in both T4 and T5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strother et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gruntman et al., 2018</xref>) by providing null direction suppression. Computer simulations showed that direction selectivity decreases in T4/T5 motion detector models without this inhibitory input on the null side of the dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borst, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Strother et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we show that T4 and T5 neurons possess the inhibitory GABA receptor subunit Rdl mainly on the proximal base on the null side of their dendrites, providing the synaptic basis for null direction suppression. We did not detect the metabotropic GABA receptor subunit Gaba-b-r1 in T4/T5 neurons using the newly generated FlpTag Gaba-b-r1 line. Finally, all of the receptor subunits GluClα, Rdl and Dα7 investigated here are ionotropic, fast receptors, which presumably do not add a temporal delay at the synaptic level. In the detector model described above, the two outer arms provide a slow and sustained signal, and such properties are already intrinsic properties of these input neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arenz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Serbe et al., 2016</xref>). However, we cannot exclude that slow, metabotropic receptor subunits for acetylcholine or GABA (e.g. Gaba-br2) which are also present in T4/T5 and could induce additional delays at the synaptic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takemura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated the subcellular distribution of the voltage-gated ion channels para and Ih in T4/T5 neurons. We found para, a voltage-gated sodium channel, to be distributed along the axonal fibers of both T4 and T5 neurons. As para is important for the generation of sodium-dependent action potentials, it will be interesting for future functional studies to investigate, if T4/T5 really fire action potentials and how this shapes their direction-selective response. Further, we detected Ih, a voltage-gated ion channel permeable for several types of ions, in T4/T5 dendrites using the FlpTag strategy. Ih channels are activated at negative potentials below −50 mV and as they are permeable to sodium and potassium ions, they can cause a depolarization of the cell after hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Magee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Littleton and Ganetzky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">George et al., 2009</xref>). Loss-of-function studies will unravel the functional role of the Ih channel for direction-selective responses in T4/T5 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Outlook</title><p>Since the ability to combine synaptic inputs from different neurotransmitters at different spatial sites is common to all neurons, the approaches described here represent an important future perspective for other circuits. Our tools can be used to study the ion channels GluClα, Rdl, Dα7, Gaba-b-r1, para and Ih in any given <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell-type and circuit. Furthermore, the FlpTag tool box can be used to target many genes of interest and thereby foster molecular questions across fields.</p><p>The techniques described here can be transferred to other model organisms as well, to study the distribution of different transmitter receptors. For instance, in the mouse retina - similar to motion-sensing T4/T5 neurons in the fruit fly - so-called On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells receive asymmetric inhibitory GABAergic inputs from presynaptic starburst amacrine cells during null-direction motion. A previous study investigated the spatial distribution of GABA receptors of these direction-selective ganglion cells using super-resolution imaging and antibody staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sigal et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, starburst amacrine cells also release ACh onto ganglion cells which contributes to the direction-selective responses of ganglion cells. Thus, mapping the distribution of ACh receptors on direction-selective ganglion cells will be the next important step to further investigate cholinergic transmission in this network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sethuramanujam et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Overall, we demonstrated the importance of exploring the distributions of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels for systems neuroscience. The distinct distributions in T4/T5 neurons discovered here and the resulting functional consequences expand our knowledge of the molecular basis of motion vision. Although powerful, recent RNAseq studies lacked information about spatial distributions of transmitter receptors which can change the whole logic of wiring patterns and underlying synaptic signs. Future studies can use this knowledge to target these receptors and directly probe their role in functional experiments or incorporate the gained insights into model simulations. However, this study is only highlighting some examples of important neural circuit components: expanding the approaches described here to other transmitter receptors and ion channels, as well as gap junction proteins will reveal the full inventory and the spatial distributions of these decisive determinants of neural function within an individual neuron.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Flies were raised at 25°C and 60% humidity on standard cornmeal agar medium at 12 hr light/dark cycle.

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper describes tools that will be useful for studying the subcellular localization of neurotransmitter receptors. GluCla should also be a useful tool as well as the GABAR, para, and Ih FlpTag alleles. The work is carefully executed work and the manuscript is clearly written. We still hope that, in the future, you will be able to expand and generalize the use of the FlpTag approach. The manuscript also provides an interesting description of the localization of Glutamatergic, Cholinergic and GABAergic synapses in the fly visual system.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Highly specific subcellular distribution of neurotransmitter receptors in motion-sensing neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Filipe Pinto Teixeira (Reviewer #2); Tom Baden (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after extensive consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the work is of quality but feel that the advances, both in terms of receptor localization in the T4/T5 circuit, and technical with the generation of new reporter lines, are incremental and would not be sufficient to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>As you will see below, the reviewers feel that the visualization of the localization of a small set of neurotransmitter receptors is in line with previous findings from TEM data while no further functional notions have been gained. The reviewers found it important to validate the role of the receptors in shaping the processing of the T4/T5 signal, either using functional imaging or electrophysiology/pharmacology.</p><p>The reviewers would have found it very interesting if you could have demonstrated what you suggest, that the localization of neurotransmitter receptors is intrinsic rather than induced by the presence of presynaptic sites. You should rephrase your claim that neurotransmitter receptor localization is intrinsic since you do not provide any evidence for that, which could be tested by manipulating these pre-synaptic sites that would have allowed you to test this important notion.</p><p>The reviewers also considered that the technical advances are limited: the UAS reporters are useful for the specific point that you address, and very well controlled, but they do not represent important tools that go beyond what is already available. Of course, the Flptag method could be such advance, but it is only described superficially and with little information on its efficiency and the possibility to develop it as a general method. It has only been used for one line, it relies on MiMic insertions and has not yet been tested with Crispr/Cas9. Furthermore, although the Flptag is a useful tool, it does not allow the tagging of individual neurons and thus it does not offer the fundamental and general tool needed to investigate localization at the single cell level in other systems. Similar methods with a larger coverage have already been published.</p><p>In conclusion, the part of the paper about receptor localization and how this helps refine our understanding of the T4T5 computation, needs validation of the role of the receptors in the shape of T4/T5 signal processing. In addition, you need to show the Flptag is a general method by targeting other genes and validating the Crispr/Cas9, and allowing the marking of single cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>To gain insights into the organization and function of neural circuits, knowledge about the distribution of synapses, neurotransmitters released on the pre-synaptic sides and neurotransmitter receptors on the postsynaptic side is invaluable. In this manuscript, S. Fendl, R. Vieira and A. Borst present genetic approaches to visualize the distinct subcellular distribution of three neurotransmitter receptors in motion-direction selective neurons T4 and T5 in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system. The genetic tools include over-expression of UAS transgenes for receptor units GluClalpha (Glutamate), Rdl (GABA) and Dalpha7 (ACh). Furthermore, a novel approach named FlpTag is presented, that allows the labeling of GluClalpha by inserting an invertible GFP tag in the endogenous locus. In line with the known differential distribution of presynaptic sites along the dendrites of T4 and T5 neuron subtypes, the authors report matching receptor unit distributions. The observed patterns are extensively discussed within the context of the recent model for computations underlying motion-direction selectivity by the Borst laboratory. The study is descriptive, and as it assesses only 3 receptor subunits, also not comprehensive, this providing limited new insights. The FlpTag method is elegant, but as it is employed only for one receptor unit, and efficiencies in generating lines with this method are not provided, it remains uncertain, whether it is an easily implementable tool together for MiMIC lines or proposed novel Crispr/Cas9 mediated integration.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors describe that GluClalpha is expressed in a matching pattern to what is expected from EM studies and known identities of pre-synaptic neurons. The patterns are similar when assessing over-expression and endogenous labeling techniques. The authors describe this must be an intrinsic property. But how can they conclude this? A novel insight would have been to use these new tools to address this point. For instance, by altering the pre-synaptic innervation, the assessment of the distribution of these receptors can be assessed. If it is unaltered, then the notion that distribution is intrinsic would gain support. An important aspect would also be to show the matching of pre-and postsynaptic markers to provide formal evidence that the puncta indeed correspond to synapses, and that matching occurs (in vertebrate synapses receptors are detected at the synapse, but also preisynaptically.)</p><p>2) The authors generate one line using their new FlpTag tool and conclude that this approach is generalizable. However, while it is likely on paper to be generalizable, the method would need to be described in detail regarding its efficiency with this and a few more factors. Alternatively, the significance of the method would need to be described with more careful wording.</p><p>3) &quot;Upon cell-type specific expression of flippase recombinase (Flp), an intronic GFP-label is inverted and stably integrated into the gene as an artificial exon&quot;. And &quot;Upon ΦC31-dependent integration of the FlpTag cassette into a coding intron of the GluCla target gene, the cassette is inverted, and spliced out together with the intron and no GFP-labeling occurs.&quot; Neither description seems quite right, phiC31 dependent-integration is not responsible for the inversion. Cassette exchange can be in either direction, but during injection, the inverted orientation is selected for. Also, Flp is not responsible for the integration, just the inversion. The method should be described correctly and in more detail with numbers allowing users to assess efficiency both to generate the lines and regarding inversion events. The line has been tested with Gal4 UAS-FLP for mediating inversion, which provides cell-type specificity, but it is not clear how efficient the method is at the single cell level with heat-shock during pupal development. Furthermore, for the other heat shock involving experiments in this study, it would be important to provide more details, including when and how many heat shock treatments are provided.</p><p>4) For the ACh receptor Dalpha7, the authors showed that GFP labeled puncta localized correctly, but that the numbers were less than expected from what is known about cholinergic input. It is proposed that another subunit/type of receptor may be important in this context, but it is not clear, why this was not further pursued.</p><p>5) The authors also assess the distribution of receptors in axons. The Discussion is extensive, highlighting, that &quot;the subcellular distribution… highlights its differential functional roles in different parts of these cell types&quot;. While, it is clear that the receptors are indicative of different connections, the experiments shown in this study do not provide any functional insights, in particular how inhibitory input at the dendritic level and again at the axonal level could be integrated during information processing of T4/T5 neurons.</p><p>6) Subsection “Methods for investigation of receptor distributions”, the manuscript discusses the possibility of using their construct also for Crispr/Cas9 mediated insertion by a HDR cassette, referring to supplementary files solely with sequences. This is an important aspect and would benefit from a more detailed presentation and evidence for functionality to support the claim and the technical emphasis of the study in general.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The tools the authors developed expand the repertoire of similar reagents already available to access neurotransmitter receptor expression in the fly. Additionally, the novel FlpTag tool allows to endogenously tag any gene of interest in a cell type specific manner expanding its usefulness to different molecular questions in various fields. The paper is well written, the results are solid and well supported but fall short. The results are limited to the validation of a previously published <italic>UAS-Da7::GFP</italic> line, two UAS lines the authors generated (<italic>UAS-GluCla::GFP</italic> and <italic>UAS-Rdl::GFP</italic>), the novel FlpTag tool, and to the description of the studied neurotransmitter receptors expression in the T4/T5 circuit. More specifically, the authors show that the GluCla, Rdl and Da7 distribution in T4 and T5 dendrites matches the known EM-reconstructed synapse distribution and neurotransmitter identity of upstream input neurons and it is compatible with one of several algorithmic models that describe how motion direction-selective responses in T4/T5 neurons is established. They further show a previously unknown expression of the glutamate receptor GluCla in T4/T5 axon terminals and discuss its possible role.

The paper extends previous results based on transcriptomics and EM (and other approaches) to lay out very nicely which receptors sit in which part of the dendrites.

The authors could compute the mean density map of receptors and plot it next to their example images. This would presumably also aid to more intuitively highlight the spatial offsets? It might make for a nice summary figure as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>Fendl et al. develop new labeling strategies to assess the asymmetric distribution of neurotransmitter subunits for glutamate, GABA, and Ach in the visual system. In particular, they develop ways to visualize GluClα, Dα7, and Rdl in motion-sensing T4/T5 neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The authors do a great job of carefully controlling for possible artifacts of overexpression in the channels they overexpress and show compelling evidence of distinct localization patterns of these three receptors in dendrites of the T4/T5 neurons. Overall, the manuscript is well written and presents both technical and biological advances, although both are somewhat incremental in significance. On the technical side, the development of the &quot;FlpTag&quot; tool for conditional labeling of proteins uses well-established technology and similar approaches have already been utilized. In addition, only a single receptor, GluClα, was actually successfully targeted for this FlpTag labeling. Beyond this technical achievement, the authors essentially confirm the localization of the three neurotransmitter receptors expected by the distribution of EM-reconstructed synapses of the relevant input neurons in the visual system. Thus, the contribution here of generating UAS-receptor-tags and the GluClα FlpTag to confirm putative receptor distributions appears to be an incremental contribution to the field. That being said, there are some additions that can improve the impact and rigor of this study.</p><p>1) Technical development: The authors used their FlpTag approach on GluClα and did not establish a toolkit targeting other neurotransmitter receptor subtypes. It's not clear why this strategy wasn't used for other receptors, at least for the two other receptors characterized in this study (ACh Dα7 and Rdl). Furthermore, a recent publication in <italic>eLife</italic> demonstrated that GluClα can be tagged conditionally as well (Molina-Obando et al., 2019), so it's not clear how important this reagent will prove to be to the field by targeting just this receptor. An expanded toolkit, akin to the one tagging all neurotransmitter receptors in the fly genome at their endogenous locus using T2A-Gal4 knock-in (Kondo et al., 2020), would be a great addition for the field but it is understood this is beyond the scope of the investigators interest in this study.</p><p>2) Biological insights: It is commendable the extent the authors went to carefully control for possible artifacts of mis-localization of the three neurotransmitter receptors due to overexpression of the straightforward UAS-receptor-tags. Beyond overexpression, it is always possible that the tags themselves may alter receptor trafficking, biochemical interactions, or integration into functional receptors. Can the authors comment in more detail on controls used to determine the tags do not impact receptor localization or function?</p><p>At least for the three receptors examined in this study, overexpression doesn't appear to lead to mis-localization or apparent artifacts. However, in terms of the biological significance, it's not clear how much is learned. Essentially, all the receptors mark synapses in areas they were suspected to be based on the neuronal inputs, and functional imaging or electrophysiology/pharmacology would be necessary to validate the ideas of how these receptors and their presumed physiological impacts actually shape signal processing in the T4/T5 neurons.</p><p>3) Although it is important to define which receptor subtypes exist at particular synapses, the experiments presented here by the authors do not really establish the receptors that function at the dendrites in the T4/T5 neurons. First, as the authors point out, it is a mystery what Ach receptor subtype(s) actually exist and function at dendrites in this system, and even whether Dα7 is playing a functional role. Second, while GluClα appears to be present at glutamatergic synapses, can the authors rule out the possibility of excitatory glutamate receptors also being present in T4/T5 neurons? It seems plausible that some of the kainate, AMPA, and/or NMDA type glutamate receptors encoded in the fly genome could also exist in this system, and if so these would have major impacts on the assumptions of signal processing proposed by the authors. Third, and for similar reasons, the findings on GABA receptors may be limited. Finally, also as pointed out by the authors, there are metabotropic receptors that could be expressed and play important roles that remain at present unknown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62953.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.
