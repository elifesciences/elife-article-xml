Data reported for LG100754 correspond to the data values LG100268, an accidental copy-and-paste error. Data reported for LG100268 were accidentally duplicated from the values for another ligand (bexarotene), another accidental copy-and-paste error. These copy-and-paste errors propagated into the correlation analyses in Figure 4e, Figure 4g, and Figure 7, but only have a small impact on the Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients and PCA analysis.None of these corrections change the conclusions of the paper. We sincerely apologize for these errors.
