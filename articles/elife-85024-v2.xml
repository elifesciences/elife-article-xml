The need to reduce community spread and reserve hospital capacity for the most severe COVID-19 cases led to rescheduling or postponement of cancer care appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nelson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Patt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ueda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wenger et al., 2022</xref>). These control measures significantly decreased cancer-related patient encounters in the early phase of the pandemic, particularly for cancer screenings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Patt et al., 2020</xref>). Comparing March to July 2020 with the same period in 2019, there was a substantial decrease in cancer screenings, biopsies, surgeries, office visits, and therapy; the decreases varied by service location and cancer type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Patt et al., 2020</xref>). For example, breast cancer screenings decreased by 89.2% and colorectal by 84.5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Warner et al., 2020</xref>). Patients reported delays in receiving cancer care, including follow-up clinic appointments and cancer therapies, such as radiation, infusion therapies, and surgeries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">London et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Riera et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Cancer care delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic are anticipated to lead to increased cancer morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blay et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Malagón et al., 2022</xref>). One study found an association between surgical and screening delays and increased cancer mortality among patients diagnosed with colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer during the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). Delayed mammography and computed tomography for lung cancer were associated with advanced stage of cancer at diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). Another study determined delayed surgery for lung cancer was associated with worse survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mayne et al., 2021</xref>). For breast screenings, some evidence suggests that patients were reluctant to return for mammograms after care disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Miller et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, cancer care disruptions during COVID-19 could have detrimental future impacts on cancer outcomes and may require changes to public health and clinical strategies across the cancer prevention and control continuum.</p><p>It is unclear if patients felt comfortable returning to care in the context of rapidly changing information and guidelines related to COVID-19 and even now that guidelines are more consistent and vaccines are available. There is concern about whether patients will prioritize immediate unmet social needs that might be a result of or exacerbated by COVID-19, such as food insecurity, employment loss, and housing challenges, over disease prevention. Furthermore, people of color, including African Americans, Latinx, and Native communities, as well as those employed in low-wage occupations, are likely to have greater concerns over COVID-19 safety, in addition to the immediate concerns noted above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cancino et al., 2020</xref>). Rural communities that already experience limited access to cancer care, have less capacity to manage COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Segel et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, hospitals rapidly increased the use of telehealth to continue cancer care during COVID-19, but older people and those who lived in low-income and rural areas, or were less likely to have commercial insurance were less likely to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darcourt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jaffe et al., 2020</xref>). This combination of factors may exacerbate existing disparities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cancino et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>This survey study was conducted by National Cancer Institute (NCI)—designated Siteman Cancer Center to elucidate: (1) to what extent cancer care appointments (including preventive screenings and treatment) in the bi-state Midwestern catchment area were canceled/postponed, (2) patients’ needs for returning to care, and (3) correlates of care disruption across the catchment area. This study aligns with the NCI’s goal to support population health assessments of their cancer center’s catchment areas. In our catchment area, the cancer burden is significantly greater than the US averages for multiple cancers. Moreover, racial and geographical disparities persist such that African American patients have higher incidence and mortality for lung, colorectal, late-stage breast cancer diagnoses, and prostate cancers compared to White patients. Rural counties also have higher mortality (but not incidence) for melanoma, breast, and prostate cancer compared to urban areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">National Cancer Institute, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Thus, we explore how socio-contextual factors impact cancer health disparities across the continuum of cancer control and prevention during COVID-19 in this bi-state Midwestern catchment area. This analysis is guided by the theory that social identities like race, ethnicity, social class, and gender shape many contextual factors related to cancer, COVID, and other outcomes and are ultimately the fundamental drivers of disease. We stratify our results by race because of the differential impact of COVID-19 on communities of color and the over-representation of socioeconomic factors such as low-income, low-wage work often experienced by communities of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Athavale et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Millett et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Data source</title><p>Data were collected from June through August 2020 as part of Siteman Cancer Center’s Community Outreach and Engagement efforts. The survey focused on understanding cancer prevention and control behaviors throughout the Siteman catchment area. The Siteman catchment area includes 82 counties throughout Missouri (40) and Illinois (42) and is diverse concerning race (21% people of color), geography (15% rural), and healthcare access (29% live in medically underrepresented areas as designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration, HRSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">United States Census Bureau, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Data collection</title><p>The Washington University in St. Louis, MO Institutional Review Board approved and exempted this study (ID#202006089). We recruited participants through Qualtrics Online Panels, which emailed potential participants a survey link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qualtrics, 2020</xref>). We screened potential participants for the following eligibility criteria: age 30 or older and residing in eastern or southeastern Missouri or central or southern Illinois. Recruitment oversampled for males (35%), people of color (35%) (defined as all races and ethnicities except for non-Hispanic White), and non-metro area residents (20%) (defined as a score of 4 or greater for census-designated rural-urban continuum [RUCC] codes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">United States Department of Agriculture, 2019</xref>) to allow for analyses by these groups. The median survey completion time was 20.3 min. All participants received an agreed-upon incentive from Qualtrics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Measures</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Outcome variable</title><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> provides detailed information about the measures used in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wadhera et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wadhera et al., 2020</xref>). Our outcome of interest, care disruption, was defined as any cancelation or postponement of a general medical or cancer screening appointment. Catchment area residents who reported that they decided not to attend an appointment not already canceled/postponed due to COVID-19 or they or their doctor/clinic postponed any cancer screening (Pap test, stool blood test, colonoscopy, mammogram, or PSA test) appointment were categorized as experiencing care disruption. Questions were drawn from validated measures assessing the impact of major life disruptions such as natural disasters, and pandemics such as H1N1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Saez-Clarke et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Explanatory variables</title><p>We included predictor variables that could result in differential access to care due to social stratification: age, race, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake, 2019</xref>) ethnicity, gender identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Killermann, 2020</xref>), sex assigned at birth, sexual orientation, education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake, 2019</xref>), income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake, 2019</xref>), residence in non-metro area, pre-COVID employment, health insurance status, job loss due to COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grasso et al., 2020</xref>), and access to a private vehicle. We also assessed self-report healthcare discrimination using a seven-item scale assessing how many times a participant experienced certain kinds of treatment (overall Cronbach’s alpha = 0.92; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Peek et al., 2011</xref>). We also controlled for whether they scheduled a telehealth appointment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Penedo et al., 2020</xref>). All items were adapted from standardized measures, except for sex assigned at birth and access to a private vehicle, which were created by the study team.</p><p>We asked if residents participated in a telehealth medical appointment since the COVID-19 pandemic started and whether it was for a general medical appointment or cancer care. While this measure is not directly associated with social stratification, it could be correlated with Internet and other technology access and also predict whether someone was more likely to cancel/postpone a scheduled in-person appointment. Finally, we developed a single item to understand what patients who may have experienced care disruption would need <italic>most</italic> to be able to reschedule the appointment. These options included transportation, time to schedule, and knowing: how they would pay for the appointment, if the doctor’s office or clinic was taking appropriate COVID-related safety precautions, if the doctor’s office was still open or scheduling appointments, or that they could bring someone with them; we also included an ‘other’ option with an open-ended response field.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Analytic procedures</title><p>Descriptive statistics were obtained for all variables separately and by care disruption status (any care disruption compared to no disruption). Next, logistic regression modeling was conducted to determine the associations with care disruption across the catchment area. For all analyses, ‘prefer not to answer’ responses were recoded as missing. We dropped those who reported that canceling/postponing an appointment did not apply to them (n=84) with more males, uninsured people, and those without telehealth appointments reflected in this exclusion. Additionally, there were 17 residents who had missing data and were not included in the logistic regression models. This missing data was due to responding to sex assigned at birth or sexual orientation questions with ‘prefer not to answer’ or having a missing value on another question included in the model (see footnote on <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for details). We also used sex at birth and not gender identity in the model due to the near-complete overlap between the two variables and the small sample size for some of the gender-diverse categories (N&lt;6). Additionally, we recoded the job loss variable into the following 3 categories: yes, resident was laid off; no, resident was not laid off; and combined categories of don’t know/not sure/prefer not to answer/not applicable. Finally, we conducted a stratified logistic regression analysis to determine if the associations of care disruption among non-Hispanic Black residents differed when compared to non-Hispanic White residents. Metro/non-metro area was excluded from the stratified non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White models due to a small number of non-Hispanic Black residents in non-metro areas. We do not present other race/ethnicity in the race-stratified models due to the small sample size of participants with non-missing variables for the model in this category (N=71).</p><table-wrap

3+comorbidities) in the overall and race-specific models as a posthoc analysis. We found that this variable was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05) in the overall model and the model for Non-Hispanic Black residents. For the Non-Hispanic White model, number of comorbidities is marginally significant (p=0.052). In the overall model, results showed that those with 3+comorbidities were more likely to have care disruptions (vs. 0 comorbidities: OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.18–3.45; vs. 1–2 comorbidities: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.31–3.27). Among Black residents, we see similar results – those with 3+comorbidities were more likely to have care disruptions (vs. 0 comorbidities: 2.80, 95% CI: 0.97–8.04; vs. 1–2 comorbidities: 4.82, 95% CI: 1.80–12.93). We take note of the wide confidence intervals and the smaller sample size of Black residents with 3+comorbidities (n=39).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using primary data collected from residents across the 82-county Siteman catchment area overlapping Missouri and Illinois, we learned that across different type of screenings, 21% to 57% of cancer screening or treatment appointments were canceled/postponed from March 2020 through the end of 2020. Across all races, residents with higher educational attainment had 1.25 higher odds of care disruption for general or cancer care compared to residents with lower educational attainment; this association remained significant among Black and White residents. Additionally, White residents of older age, assigned female at birth, or having scheduled a telehealth appointment, also had higher odds of care disruption. Interestingly, while the sample size is small, we did see a trend that suggested that Black people with 3+comorbidities were more likely to cancel/postpone care. Finally, knowing their doctor’s office or clinic is taking the appropriate COVID-related safety precautions was the greatest reported need for returning to care (33.8%).</p><p>Delays in cancer screening can lead to stage shifts where patients are diagnosed at later stages and thus have a higher risk for cancer morbidity and mortality. Understanding which screenings were impacted locally and for whom and identifying patient concerns can inform community outreach and engagement efforts. This allows programs to target groups in their catchment, most likely to have delayed screening and draft messaging that can alleviate patient concerns and in turn facilitate a return to care. Moreover, knowing that those with 3+comorbidities, who likely have additional health needs were more likely to cancel/postpone appointments could also inform recruitment methods in getting people to return to care. It is possible that these cancellations and postponements were due to an increased risk of contracting and dying of COVID; however, it is critical to get this high need population to return to care so widening disparities are avoided.</p><p>Mammograms and Pap tests are an area of increased interest for our catchment area given the high number of women scheduled for screening. Approximately 38% of the 170 women who were scheduled for mammograms had canceled/postponed appointments. Similarly, 45% of the 188 women scheduled for Pap tests had canceled/postponed appointments. Delays in colorectal cancer screening impacted a smaller number of people, but colorectal cancer screening is an important area given the high proportion of cancellations/postponements, overall low number of scheduled appointments in general, and high colorectal cancer disparities in the region. Of the 51 people scheduled for a colonoscopy, 57% canceled/postponed appointments, and of the 38 scheduled for a blood stool test, 29% canceled/postponed appointments as well. To help healthcare systems reduce the cancer screening deficit, community outreach and engagement strategies need to address these needs. For example, employing mobile strategies such as the use of mobile mammography and home-based cervical and colorectal cancer screening tests could serve those most impacted.</p><p>These data are consistent with prior literature that suggests a reduction in general medical and cancer-related appointments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Patt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wenger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">London et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Czeisler et al., 2020</xref>). This study allows us to understand the magnitude of the impact across eastern/southeastern Missouri and southern Illinois. Future research exploring whether those with higher educational attainment were more likely to cancel/postpone appointments because they were more likely to have better access to scheduling future appointments could further elucidate the extent of educational disparities in healthcare access.</p><p>These cross-sectional data cannot infer causality however, many of the correlates of interest (e.g. race, educational attainment) pre-date COVID-19 and the need to consider postponing clinical care. Thus, it is unlikely these results are subject to reverse causation. Also, those excluded due to missing data were more likely to be uninsured. If uninsured persons were also more likely to have canceled/postponed appointments, this could potentially bias results about care disruptions by insurance status towards the null and underestimate the impact. Finally, unmeasured confounding is possible in cross-sectional studies like ours. Despite these limitations, this is a significant study that can improve our understanding of COVID-19 impacts on cancer prevention and control and offer specific insights into the region. In our data, those with higher education were more likely to cancel/postpone care. This indicates that any trends seen in increasing late-stage diagnosis might occur across socioeconomic categories. Additionally, while Black and White people of higher educational attainment both had increased odds of care disruption, having a scheduled telehealth visit was significantly associated with higher odds of care disruption only for White residents. This suggests that while White people were canceling/postponing in-person care, this care may have been substituted with telehealth appointments. Many of these screenings cannot be done virtually, yet this warrants further investigation to understand if care disruption does not always equate to being disconnected from healthcare for some and the subsequent impact on racial disparities in cancer care.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>has received consulting fees from Dana Farber Cancer Institute.

We agree that it is important to understand national trends in COVID-related care disruptions and using causal methods. However, this manuscript was not intended to be generalizable to the nation. Instead, it aimed to examine the local impact of COVID care disruptions. We focused on the Siteman Cancer Center’s (SCC) catchment area because the co-author team includes the SCC’s Associate Director of Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) program, the SCC Associate Director for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, multiple members of the SCC COE leadership team. Thus, we are uniquely positioned to mobilize and identify outreach opportunities and/or programs that address any gaps we discover. Moreover, this focus on our catchment area aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s priorities to characterize cancer-relevant knowledge across cancer center catchment areas. Finally, this is our first cross-sectional study of our catchment area, so we could not implement a difference-in-difference analysis. We will regularly survey residents in our catchment in the future. We will be able to track trends over time and consider additional methods like difference-in-difference once we have multiple data points. We have added text in the manuscript to emphasize the purpose of this study as a local, area-level assessment and to indicate that confounding bias is possible in cross-sectional studies, including this one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What conceptual model did the authors use to select the explanatory variables? It seems to me that authors just throw a bunch of variables in a logistic regression model.</p></disp-quote><p>Our analysis was guided by the theory that social identities related to race, ethnicity, class, and gender shape access to healthcare and disease processes and are the fundamental drivers of health. We edited the sentence below in the methods section to help clarify this.</p><p>“This analysis is guided by the theory that social identities like race, ethnicity, social class, and gender shape many contextual factors related to cancer, COVID, and other health outcomes and are ultimately, the fundamental drivers of disease”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If this study examined disruption to care, the most important explanatory variables to include in the model were the basic health status or severity and type of cancer.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not ask severity of cancer, but we conducted a posthoc analysis to understand care disruption among those with multiple comorbidities to understand basic health status and determine who may have additional health needs. We found that among Black residents, those that had 3+ comorbidities were more likely to have care disruptions. We have included this in the results and discussed implications in the discussion. We note that the sample size is small.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sample size was small, and with the cross-sectional nature of the study, no conclusion can be achieved.</p></disp-quote><p>This was meant to be an area-level, local assessment to help Siteman Cancer Center understand how to deploy resources to mitigate the potential for health disparities. There were no causal interpretations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The characteristics of people with missing data were not presented and discussed. This can easily create a biased sample to begin with.

This sentence appears in the analytic procedures section: “We dropped those who reported that canceling an appointment did not apply to them (n=84) with more males, uninsured people, and those without telehealth appointments reflected in this exclusion.”</p><p>We also added the text below to describe the 17 people missing from the regression model. Given that this is less than 2% of our total sample, it is unlikely that this has introduced bias.</p><p>“Additionally, there were 17 residents who had missing data and were not included in the logistic regression models. This missing data was due to responding to sex assigned at birth or sexual orientation questions with “prefer not to answer” or having a missing value on another question included in the model (see footnote on Table 1 for details).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to review your manuscript submitted to eLife.

We have added the test below to our results. Results were mostly similar.</p><p>Results stayed similar when looking at the highest need for rescheduling by race, except that the third highest need for Black residents was time to schedule the appointment (14.2%), and for White residents, it was dealing with other things and not ready to reschedule yet (14.5%). The top two needs to reschedule appointments were the same across race though the proportion of those who selected each need varied somewhat by race. The top two needs were knowing if their doctor’s office or clinic is taking the appropriate COVID-related safety precautions (Non-Hispanic Black: 34.2%; Non-Hispanic White: 33.8%; All Other: 32.7%) and not needing anything for all three racial groups (Non-Hispanic Black: 19.2%; Non-Hispanic White: 18.8%; All Other: 12.2%).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
