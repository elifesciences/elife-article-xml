form of biological organization. A key characteristic of advanced eusociality is the presence of non-reproductive workers. Why evolution should produce organisms that sacrifice their own reproductive potential in order to aid others is an important question in evolutionary biology. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the selective forces that determine the emergence and stability of non-reproductive workers. We study the effects, in situations where the queen of the colony has mated once or several times, of recessive and dominant sterility alleles acting in her offspring. Contrary to widespread belief based on heuristic arguments of genetic relatedness, non-reproductive workers can easily evolve in polyandrous species. The crucial quantity is the functional relationship between a colony’s reproductive rate and the fraction of non-reproductive workers present in that colony. We derive precise conditions for natural selection to favor the evolution of non-reproductive workers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08918.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08918.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08918.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Certain wasps, bees and ants live in highly organized social groups in which one member of a colony (the queen) produces all or almost all of the offspring. This form of social organization – called eusociality – raises an important question for evolutionary biology: why do individuals that forego the chance to reproduce and instead raise the offspring of others evolve?</p><p>One factor linked to the evolution of eusociality in insects is a system that determines the gender of offspring known as haplodiploidy. In this system, female offspring develop from fertilized eggs, while male offspring develop from unfertilized eggs. The queen mates with male insects and so she can produce both male and female offspring. On the other hand, the workers – which are also female – do not mate and therefore can only produce male offspring.</p><p>So, should these workers produce their own male eggs, or should all male offspring come from the queen? The answer to this question could depend on whether the queen has mated with a single male (monandry) or with multiple males (polyandry) because this affects how closely related the other insects in the colony are to each other. It is a widespread belief that monandry is important for the evolution of non-reproductive workers.</p><p>Here, Olejarz et al. develop a mathematical model that explores the conditions under which natural selection favors the evolution of non-reproductive workers. Contrary to the widespread belief, it turns out that non-reproductive workers can easily evolve in polyandrous species. The crucial quantity is the relationship between the overall reproductive rate of the colony and the fraction of non-reproductive workers present in that colony.</p><p>Olejarz et al. challenge the view that single mating is crucial for the evolution of non-reproductive workers. The study demonstrates the need for precise mathematical models of population dynamics and natural selection instead of informal arguments that are only based on considerations of genetic relatedness.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08918.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08918.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>hymenoptera</kwd><kwd>social insect</kwd><kwd>evolutionary dynamics</kwd><kwd>eusociality</kwd><kwd>mathematical model</kwd><kwd>genetic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mathematical model predicts the precise conditions for natural selection to favor the evolution of non-reproductive workers in insect colonies with haplodiploid genetics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eusociality is a form of social organization where some individuals reduce their own lifetime reproductive potential to raise the offspring of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crespi and Yanega, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gadagkar, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hunt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nowak et al., 2010</xref>). Primary examples are ants, bees, social wasps, termites, and naked mole rats. There have been ~10–20 origins of eusociality, about half of them in haplodiploid species and the other half in diploid ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson, 1984</xref>). A crucial step in the origin of eusociality is cancellation of dispersal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abouheif and Wray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nowak et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tarnita et al., 2013</xref>). Individuals who stay at the nest begin to work at tasks such as care of the young, defense of the nest, and foraging behavior. Eusociality can evolve if the strong reproductive advantages of the queen, including reduced mortality and increased rate of oviposition, arise already for small colony sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nowak et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Haplodiploidy is the sex-determination system of ants, bees, and wasps. With haplodiploidy, females arise from fertilized eggs and are diploid. They have two homologous sets of chromosomes, one padumnal (paternally inherited) and one madumnal (maternally inherited). Males arise from unfertilized eggs and are haploid. They have one set of chromosomes, which is madumnal. With haplodiploid genetics, mated females can become queens and lay female and male eggs. In many cases, unmated females become workers, which can lay male eggs but not female eggs. Therefore, in a haplodiploid colony, male eggs could come from the queen or from the workers. This creates intracolony competition between the fertilized queen and the unfertilized workers over the production of males. In this paper, we investigate genetic mutations that affect the phenotype of the workers and make them non-reproductive (or sterile). We calculate conditions both for the evolutionary invasion and evolutionary stability of such mutations.</p><p>The typical theoretical approach for investigating the evolution of non-reproductive workers makes use of coefficients of relatedness. Relatedness of one individual to another is the probability that a random allele in the former is also in the latter due to recent common ancestry. In particular, there are three coefficients of relatedness that are of primary interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trivers and Hare, 1976</xref>). First, consider the relatedness of a female to one of her sons, <italic>R</italic><sub>son</sub>. In parthenogenetically producing a son, a diploid female transmits a haploid genome to him. Under Mendelian segregation, each allele in her genome has probability 1/2 of inclusion in this transmitted haploid complement, and so <italic>R</italic><sub>son</sub> = 1/2. Next, consider the relatedness of a female to one of her brothers, <italic>R</italic><sub>brother</sub>. The female and her brother share a mother, and so the probability that an allele inherited maternally by the female is the same allele as inherited maternally by her brother is 1/2. On the other hand, the male has no father, and so there is no chance that an allele in the female is equivalent to one in her brother through paternal inheritance. A random allele in the diploid female has equal chance of being padumnal or madumnal, and so <italic>R</italic><sub>brother</sub> = (1/2)(0) + (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Finally, consider the relatedness of a female to one of her sisters, <italic>R</italic><sub>sister</sub>. This coefficient of relatedness depends on the number, <italic>n</italic>, of different males that the queen mates with before laying eggs. For a padumnal allele in a female to be identical, by paternal descent, to that in a sister requires them only to share the same father (probability 1/<italic>n</italic>), since that father is haploid and therefore always transmits the same allele. Sisters share a mother, and so the probability that an allele inherited maternally by one female is the same allele as inherited maternally by her sister is 1/2. Therefore, <italic>R</italic><sub>sister</sub> = (1/2)(1/<italic>n</italic>) + (1/2)(1/2) = (2 + <italic>n</italic>)/(4<italic>n</italic>).</p><p>The traditional investigation of evolution of non-reproductive workers uses the following relatedness-based heuristic. The relatedness of a female to her male offspring is <italic>R</italic><sub>son</sub> = 1/2. If the queen mates with only a single male (<italic>n</italic> = 1), then the relatedness of a female worker to one of her random sisters is <italic>R</italic><sub>sister</sub> = 3/4 &gt; <italic>R</italic><sub>son</sub>. The naive conclusion is that worker altruism should readily evolve, because a worker can more efficiently spread her genes by raising her sisters. This conjecture is known as the ‘haplodiploidy hypothesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton, 1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1972</xref>). If the queen mates with more than two males (<italic>n</italic>&gt;2), then <italic>R</italic><sub>sister</sub> &lt; <italic>R</italic><sub>son</sub>. Now the preference of an unfertilized worker is reversed, because she has a higher relatedness to her own male offspring than to one of her random sisters. These old arguments suggest that queen monogamy and haplodiploid genetics synergistically act as a driving force for the evolution of worker altruism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamilton, 1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1972</xref>).</p><p>But worker-laid eggs do not compete only with queen-laid female eggs. The high relatedness of a female to her sisters in Hymenopteran colonies is cancelled by the low relatedness of the same female to her brothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trivers and Hare, 1976</xref>). In a colony with a singly mated queen, the relatedness of a worker to a sister is <italic>R</italic><sub>sister</sub> = 3/4. But the relatedness of a worker to a brother is only <italic>R</italic><sub>brother</sub> = 1/4, regardless of the number of times the queen mates. So, when a worker female helps her queen reproduce, she aids in the production both of sisters (to whom she is highly related) and brothers (to whom she is not). In the relatedness-based argument, these effects exactly cancel each other out, and so the unusually high relatedness of sisters in eusocial colonies cannot be the simple solution to the puzzle of worker altruism that it was once thought to be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trivers and Hare, 1976</xref>). This is true even when the population sex ratio is female-biased, because when more reproductive females are produced than males, the average reproductive success of a female is lower than that of the average male exactly in proportion to their relative abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craig, 1979</xref>).</p><p>More recently, it was proposed that each eusocial lineage must have passed through a ‘monogamy window’—a period of evolutionary history in which queens were singly mated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boomsma, 2009</xref>). This argument assumes that worker-laid eggs compete equally with queen-laid female and male eggs. If the queen is singly mated (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and if the colony’s sex ratio is 1/2, then a worker has an average relatedness to siblings (sisters and brothers) of (<italic>R</italic><sub>sister</sub> + <italic>R</italic><sub>brother</sub>)/2 = ((3/4) + (1/4))/2 = 1/2. Relatedness of a worker to her son is also <italic>R</italic><sub>son</sub> = 1/2. In this case, assuming that worker-laid eggs substitute equally for queen-laid female and male eggs, the argument suggests that any infinitesimal benefit of non-reproductive workers to colony productivity should lead to evolution of worker altruism. If queens mate more than once (n≥2), then the average relatedness of a worker to a random sibling falls below 1/2, and evolution of worker altruism is supposed to be strongly disfavored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boomsma, 2009</xref>).</p><p>There also exist hypothetical scenarios in which the relatedness values of a female to a random sister and a random brother would not cancel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trivers and Hare, 1976</xref>): for example, the sex ratio could vary from colony to colony, while the average sex ratio in the population remains at 1/2. Evolution of helping might then be expected in the female-biased colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Trivers and Hare, 1976</xref>). Some recent papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alpedrinha et al., 2013</xref>) examine this case of split sex ratios and also question the importance of haplodiploidy for the evolution of helping. Based on their analysis, the authors conclude that haplodiploidy can have either a positive or negative influence on the evolution of helping depending on colony variables, and they determine the effect of haplodiploidy on the evolution of helping to generally be small. But they claim, in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boomsma (2009)</xref>, that monandry is a key requirement for the evolution of a worker caste. They argue that, in the case of lifetime monogamy, “any small efficiency benefit from rearing siblings (<italic>b</italic>/<italic>c</italic> &gt; 1) would lead to helping being favored by natural selection.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gardner et al., 2012</xref>)</p><p>In this paper, we investigate the situation where worker-laid male eggs compete directly with queen-laid male eggs. In other words, there are two types of reproduction events to consider: A worker can lay a male egg, or, instead, the queen can lay a male egg while the worker helps to raise the queen’s male egg. In either case, a male is produced. Thus, the sex ratio of the colony is unaffected by which of these two strategies is realized. The reproductive competition between the queen and the workers is only over the male offspring. (We do not assume that the sex ratio is equal to 1/2; we only assume that it is independent of the fraction of worker-produced males.) This possibility represents the simplest scenario for studying the evolution of non-reproductive workers and is biologically plausible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Winston, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sundstrom, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sundstrom et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Queller and Strassmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hammond et al., 2002</xref>). Once this case is understood, subsequent analysis can consider the situation where both the fraction of worker-produced male offspring and the colony’s sex ratio vary at the same time.</p><p>The relatedness of a worker to her male offspring, <italic>R</italic><sub>son</sub> = 1/2, is always larger than the relatedness of a worker to a brother, <italic>R</italic><sub>brother</sub> = 1/4. Thus, if worker-laid male eggs compete primarily with queen-laid male eggs, then relatedness-based arguments might predict that worker altruism should not evolve with any number of matings of the queen unless non-reproductive workers provide some benefit to the colony.</p><p>We study a model of competition between worker-laid and queen-laid male eggs that incorporates both haplodiploid genetics and a variable number of matings of the queen. Specifically, we analyze the selection pressure acting on the emergence and stability of non-reproductive workers in situations where the queen has mated once or several times. Our model assumes that the evolution of sterile workers has a negligible effect on the sex ratio of a population, which allows us to isolate and identify the specific selective forces. We derive exact conditions for the invasion and stability of non-reproductive workers.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Model</title><p>We study the evolution of a non-reproductive worker caste in the context of haplodiploid genetics, where females are diploid and males are haploid.

The fraction of queen-produced females of type <italic>AA</italic> is, as described above, (<italic>n</italic> − <italic>m</italic>)/<italic>n</italic>, and each type <italic>AA</italic> female produces only type <italic>A</italic> males. The fraction of queen-produced females of type <italic>Aa</italic> is, as described above, <italic>m</italic>/<italic>n</italic>, and each type <italic>Aa</italic> female produces type <italic>A</italic> and type <italic>a</italic> males with equal probability. The total fraction of worker-laid males that are of type <italic>A</italic> is (<italic>n</italic> − <italic>m</italic>)/<italic>n</italic> + (1/2)(<italic>m</italic>/<italic>n</italic>) = (2<italic>n</italic> − <italic>m</italic>)/2<italic>n</italic>. The total fraction of worker-laid males that are of type <italic>a</italic> is (1/2)(<italic>m</italic>/<italic>n</italic>) = <italic>m</italic>/2<italic>n</italic>. Therefore, the workers of type <italic>AAm</italic> colonies produce 2<italic>n</italic> − <italic>m</italic> type <italic>A</italic> males for every <italic>m</italic> type <italic>a</italic> males (first row, fourth column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The logic behind the offspring of type <italic>Aam</italic> and type <italic>aam</italic> colonies is the same. The only other point is that type <italic>aa</italic> workers are non-reproductive. To see how worker sterility enters into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, consider the worker-produced males of type <italic>aam</italic> colonies. The queen of type <italic>aam</italic> colonies produces <italic>n</italic> − <italic>m</italic> type <italic>Aa</italic> females for every <italic>m</italic> type <italic>aa</italic> females (third row, second column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Type <italic>Aa</italic> workers produce equal numbers of type <italic>A</italic> and type <italic>a</italic> males. Type <italic>aa</italic> workers are non-reproductive; they do not contribute to the colony’s production of worker-produced males. So, in type <italic>aam</italic> colonies, all worker-produced males come from type <italic>Aa</italic> workers, and type <italic>A</italic> and type <italic>a</italic> males are therefore produced by workers in equal amounts (third row, fourth column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The entries in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> originate from the same reasoning. The only difference is that, if the sterility allele, <italic>a</italic>, is dominant, then type <italic>Aa</italic> and type <italic>aa</italic> workers do not contribute to a colony’s production of worker-produced males. The entries in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> are described in detail in the Materials and methods.</p><p>In our analysis, we neglect stochastic effects. This is reasonable if we assume that the number of individuals produced by a colony is very large. In this case, the fractions of colony offspring of different genotypes in a generation do not differ significantly from the entries in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>.</p><p>A crucial quantity is the functional relationship between the fraction of males produced by the queen, <italic>p</italic>, and the fraction of non-reproductive workers, <italic>z</italic>, that are present in a colony. The parameter <italic>z</italic> can vary between 0 and 1. If <italic>z</italic> = 0, then there are no non-reproductive workers in the colony. If <italic>z </italic>= 1, then all workers in the colony are non-reproductive. We denote by <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic> the fraction of males that come from the queen if the fraction of non-reproductive workers is <italic>z</italic>. The quantity <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> denotes the fraction of males that come from the queen if there are no non-reproductive workers in the colony. We expect <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> to be less than 1. The quantity <italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub> denotes the fraction of males that come from the queen if all workers are non-reproductive. Clearly, <italic>p</italic><sub>1 </sub>= 1.</p><p>It is natural to assume that <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic> is an increasing function of <italic>z</italic>, but various functional forms are possible. Perhaps the simplest possibility is that <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic> is a linearly increasing function of <italic>z</italic>. Intuitively, this means that the fraction, 1 − <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic>, of male eggs that originate from workers is simply proportional to the fraction, 1 − <italic>z</italic>, of workers that are reproducing. But there are nonlinear intracolony effects that modulate worker production of male eggs. For example, the queen might efficiently suppress worker reproduction via aggression or removal of worker-laid eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Free and Butler, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Michener, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oster and Wilson, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fletcher and Ross, 1985</xref>), if only a small number of workers attempt to reproduce. If too many workers reproduce, then the queen could be overwhelmed, and her effect on removing worker-laid eggs is diminished. In this equally plausible scenario, the fraction, <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic>, of male eggs that originate from the queen would be expected to increase sublinearly with the fraction, <italic>z</italic>, of workers that are sterile. Several sample forms of the function <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08918.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>For understanding the evolution of non-reproductive workers, the following two functions are crucial.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The function <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic> denotes the fraction of male offspring that come from the queen if a fraction, <italic>z</italic>, of the workers are non-reproductive.

Another key component in our analysis is the functional relationship between the rate, <italic>r</italic>, at which the colony produces reproductive units (virgin queens and males) and the fraction of sterile workers, <italic>z</italic>.

Moreover, both the queen and the workers in <italic>Aa</italic>1 colonies each produce 50% type <italic>A</italic> males and 50% type <italic>a</italic> males; therefore the parameter <italic>p</italic><sub>1/2</sub> is irrelevant for the invasion and absent from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>.</p><p>If all males are initially produced by the workers (<italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0), then the ratio of the efficiency of type <italic>Aa</italic>1 colonies to type <italic>AA</italic>0 colonies, <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub>, must be greater than 6/5 for non-reproductive workers to appear. Notice that the critical value of <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub>/<italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> is a decreasing function of <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub>.

The simplest case of singly mated queens already shows rich behavior.

It is also interesting that, for a fixed value of <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>, increasing the value of <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub> does not necessarily promote the stability of worker sterility, and doing so can actually render non-reproductive workers evolutionarily unstable.

This paradigm derives from heuristic relatedness-based arguments. For example, Boomsma’s ‘monogamy window hypothesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boomsma, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2009</xref>) holds that persistent monandry is crucial in the evolution of a worker caste. His argument is that, under monandry, because a worker is equally related to her own offspring as to her mother’s offspring (1/2), her reduced reproduction will be selected for if it increases production of the latter more than it decreases production of the former. By this argument, under monandry but not multiple mating, very small colony-level efficiency gains from workers should lead to their evolution.</p><p>On the empirical side, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes et al. (2008)</xref> study a phylogeny of the Hymenoptera, and, employing an ancestral state reconstruction analysis, infer that each of the eight independent transitions to eusociality in the Hymenoptera occurred in a monandrous ancestral species. They take this correlation to be evidence for the causal claim that monandry is key to the evolution of eusociality. But, if most ancestral species in the clade were monandrous [as appears to be the case: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes et al. (2008)</xref>, Fig S1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nonacs (2011)</xref>], then the fact that the ancestors of eusocial species in the clade were monandrous would not be surprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nonacs, 2011</xref>). As an extreme example, if Hughes et al. were to repeat their study for the trait of haplodiploidy, they would also find that each of the eight independent transitions to eusociality occurred in a haplodiploid ancestral species (since all Hymenoptera are haplodiploid). It would be absurd to consider this to be evidence for the theoretical claim that haplodiploidy is key to the evolution of eusociality.</p><p>An important aspect of the evolution of advanced eusociality is the cancellation of all worker reproduction—in particular, the production of males. Here, we have performed a rigorous mathematical analysis of the conditions under which worker non-reproduction evolves. Our analysis has revealed that monandry does not play a crucial role in the evolution of non-reproductive worker castes. Indeed, in some cases, non-reproduction evolves when queens are multiply mated, but not when they are singly mated. Our results therefore show that the dominant paradigm, that monandry is crucial for the evolution of eusociality because it maximizes relatedness among siblings, needs to be revised. It may still turn out that monandry is important in the evolution of non-reproductive castes, but this would have to be for other reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nowak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nonacs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hunt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilson and Nowak, 2014</xref>).</p><p>These insights have been achieved because of a more general treatment of the colony-level effects of non-reproductive workers than is allowed for by simple relatedness-based arguments. In our model, we have explicitly accounted for two key parameters that are often neglected in other studies: <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic>, the reproductive rate of the colony, and <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic>, the proportion of male offspring that come from the queen, if a fraction <italic>z</italic> of the colony’s workers are non-reproductive. The conditions under which selection favors non-reproductive workers have been shown to depend crucially, and in interesting ways, on these two parameters. Empirical measurement of these parameters is therefore required to understand the selective forces underlying the evolution of non-reproductive castes in social insects. This suggests a line of future research.</p><p>It is important to distinguish between worker non-reproduction (workers produce no offspring, but may still retain the ability to do so), and the more specific phenomenon of worker sterility (workers do not have the ability to reproduce). An embedded distinction is that, in very many eusocial insect species, worker females have lost the ability to lay fertilized (female) eggs—e.g., through loss or degradation of the spermatheca—but retain the ability to lay unfertilized (male) eggs—i.e., they have functional ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourke, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hölldobler and Wilson, 1990</xref>). In comparison, complete sterility (sexual and asexual) is rare in the eusocial insects; for example, only 9 of the roughly 300 genera of ants are known to have evolved complete worker sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourke, 1995</xref>).</p><p>In our model, we have assumed that workers can lay only unfertilized male eggs. Our model therefore best applies to those transitions from species whose workers lay only male eggs to species where the workers are non-reproductive. This is probably the most common and important route to a non-reproductive worker caste in the social insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourke, 1988</xref>).</p><p>It is important to realize that our model applies significantly more generally than to just the (comparatively few) transitions to complete worker sterility. We have focused here on the case where a single (recessive or dominant) allele turns off worker production of males. However, mathematically, this assumption can easily be relaxed by supposing that the allele in question merely alters the frequency of worker male production by some amount. Thus, our approach is flexible enough to handle a variety of molecular mechanisms for worker reproductive restraint, which are still being elucidated for particular species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abouheif and Wray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dearden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khila and Abouheif, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moczek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sadd et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kapheim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One potentially important factor in the evolution of worker non-reproduction is worker policing. Here, if a worker lays a (male) egg, there is some chance that another worker will destroy the egg. This reduces the incentive for workers to lay male eggs in the first place, therefore selecting for decreased worker reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bourke, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wenseleers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ratnieks et al., 2006</xref>). A slightly modified version of our model can cover the case of worker policing (with appropriate interpretations of the parameters <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> and <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic>). A detailed investigation of this situation is desirable, and is in progress. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that worker policing, though perhaps conducive to the evolution of worker non-reproduction, is not necessary for it.</p><p>Our analysis makes no use of inclusive fitness theory, which is an unnecessary construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nowak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, our analysis shows that the evolution of non-reproductive workers depends on precise functional relationships between worker reproduction, queen reproduction, and colony efficiency, which inclusive fitness heuristics cannot account for. We note that inclusive fitness theory, which has dominated this area for decades, has not produced a mathematical analysis of even the most basic factors leading to the evolution of non-reproductive workers. A clear understanding of how natural selection acts on the evolution of any social behavior is possible once the field has recognized the limitations of inclusive fitness and has moved beyond them.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In this Materials and methods section, we present a mathematical model for the population dynamics of Hymenopteran colonies, and we calculate exact conditions that must be satisfied for non-reproductive workers to evolve. Our model uses haplodiploid genetics. Each female carries homologous pairs of maternal and paternal chromosomes, while each male possesses a single set of chromosomes. We assume that a specific mutation (allele) leads to non-reproductive workers. The <italic>A</italic> allele represents normal behavior, while the mutant <italic>a</italic> allele leads to unmated females (workers) abstaining from laying their own male eggs. If the <italic>a</italic> allele is dominant, then workers that possess at least one <italic>a</italic> allele are sterile. If the <italic>a</italic> allele is recessive, then workers that are homozygous for <italic>a</italic> are sterile. Under what conditions does the <italic>a</italic> allele for non-reproductive workers invade a population? Under what conditions is the <italic>a</italic> allele evolutionarily stable against invasion by <italic>A</italic>? A mathematical analysis of this problem lends insight into the selective forces that act on the evolution of worker sterility. While a loss of function mutation is probably recessive, it is instructive to consider both the dominant and recessive cases in detail.</p><sec id="s5-1"><title>Description of the model</title><p>Consider a large population of insects. There are many colonies in the population, and each colony produces many offspring over its lifetime. The particular species under investigation has a haplodiploid genetic system. Females carry homologous pairs of maternal and paternal chromosomes, while males carry a single set of chromosomes. Queens can produce diploid female workers and gynes (future queens) from her own genotype combined with the genotype of each of the male drones that she has mated with. Queens can also produce drones using her own genotype. Female workers can produce drones as well. Thus there can be competition over whether the queen or the workers produce most of the males in a colony.</p><p>To investigate the selective forces behind non-reproductive workers—i.e., workers that do not parthenogenetically produce haploid drones—we propose two alleles, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>a</italic>. The phenotype corresponding to the <italic>A</italic> allele is such that workers produce drones. The phenotype corresponding to the <italic>a</italic> allele is such that workers do not produce drones.</p><p>An important parameter is the number, <italic>n</italic>, of males with which the colony’s queen has mated. A schematic of the mating events is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. There are several possibilities: A type <italic>AA</italic> gyne mates with <italic>n</italic> − <italic>m</italic> type <italic>A</italic> males and <italic>m</italic> type <italic>a</italic> males. A type <italic>Aa</italic> gyne mates with <italic>n</italic> − <italic>m</italic> type <italic>A</italic> males and <italic>m</italic> type <italic>a</italic> males. A type <italic>aa</italic> gyne mates with <italic>n</italic> − <italic>m</italic> type <italic>A</italic> males and <italic>m</italic> type <italic>a</italic> males.</p><p>The mating events are random. A virgin queen mates with <italic>n</italic> randomly chosen males in the population. Notice that, for mating, the gynes and drones are considered well-mixed: A gyne from one colony can mate with <italic>n</italic> drones, each chosen randomly from among the colonies in the population. For <italic>n</italic> = 1, we obtain single mating (monandry). For <italic>n</italic> = 2, we obtain double mating.</p><p>The following system of ordinary differential equations describes the selection dynamics in continuous time:</p><p><disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(5)</label><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mtable columnalign="left"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mtable columnalign="left center left" columnspacing="2px 2px 2px"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced><mml:mtable columnspacing="0.4em" rowspacing="0.2ex"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mtable columnalign="right center left" columnspacing="2px 2px 2px"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mo>=</mml:mo></mml:mtd><mml:mtd><mml:mfenced><mml:mtable columnspacing="0.4em" rowspacing="0.2ex"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfenced><mml:mtable columnspacing="0.4em" rowspacing="0.2ex"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mspace linebreak="newline"/><mml:mspace linebreak="newline"/><mml:mspace linebreak="newline"/></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The overdot denotes the time derivative, <italic>d</italic>/<italic>dt</italic>.

Working in continuous time usually simplifies the analysis. For example, when we derive conditions for the invasion of a recessive allele or the stability of a dominant allele, the perturbative expansion of the colony variables must be performed to second order, and the calculations become quite messy.</p><p>There are a couple of key biological parameters in our model. The emergence of sterile workers can affect the fraction of male eggs in a colony that originate from the queen. If a fraction <italic>z</italic> of workers in a colony are non-reproductive, then the fraction of male offspring that originate from the queen is denoted by <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic>. The queen and the unfertilized females may compete for production of male eggs. The function <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic> for 0 ≤ <italic>z </italic>&lt; 1 likely varies for different species. It is reasonable to expect that <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic> is an increasing function of <italic>z</italic>; an increase in the proportion of workers that are non-reproductive results in a larger proportion of queen-produced males. If all workers are non-reproductive, then <italic>z</italic> = 1 and <italic>p</italic><sub>1</sub> = 1.</p><p>The other key function in our model is the efficiency, <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic>, of a colony in which a fraction <italic>z</italic> of workers are non-reproductive. An appropriate biological intuition is that the parameter <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> is the total number of offspring produced by a colony when a fraction, <italic>z</italic>, of workers in the colony are non-reproductive. As we shall see, the <italic>ratios</italic> of colony efficiency values, <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic>, for colonies with different genotypes—i.e., the <italic>relative</italic> reproductive efficiencies of colonies with different genotypes—are important quantities for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of a mutation that causes workers to be non-reproductive. As baseline, we set <italic>r</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1.</p><p>Non-reproductive workers forego their own reproductive potential in order to help raise their nestmates’ offspring. If this division of labor has some advantage for the colony, then we expect <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> &gt; 1 for some values of <italic>z</italic>. It is not necessary, however, that <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> is a monotonically increasing function.</p><p>Since we are focused on the evolutionary dynamics of the colony variables, <italic>X<sub>AA,m</sub></italic>, <italic>X<sub>Aa,m</sub></italic>, and <italic>X<sub>aa,m</sub></italic> for 0 ≤ <italic>m</italic> ≤ <italic>n</italic>, we rewrite the first term on the right-hand side of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref> in terms of the colony variables. We express each of the gyne and drone numbers, <italic>x<sub>AA</sub></italic>, x<italic><sub>Aa</sub></italic>, <italic>x<sub>aa</sub></italic>, <italic>y<sub>A</sub></italic>, and <italic>y<sub>a</sub></italic>, as a linear combination of the colony variables, <italic>X<sub>AA,m</sub></italic>, <italic>X<sub>Aa,m</sub></italic>, and <italic>X<sub>aa,m</sub></italic>.

Only workers that carry two copies of the <italic>A</italic> allele are capable of making drones, and they can therefore only pass on copies of the <italic>A</italic> allele, so workers are also only capable of making type <italic>A</italic> drones.</p><p>Consider the offspring of type <italic>Aa,m</italic> colonies. The queen produces <italic>n</italic> − <italic>m</italic> type <italic>AA</italic> females, <italic>n</italic> type <italic>Aa</italic> females, and <italic>m</italic> type <italic>aa</italic> females out of every 2<italic>n</italic> females that she produces. Because the queen carries the <italic>A</italic> and <italic>a</italic> alleles, she produces type <italic>A</italic> and type <italic>a</italic> drones in equal proportion. Only workers that carry two copies of the <italic>A</italic> allele are capable of making drones, and they therefore only pass on copies of the <italic>A</italic> allele, so workers are only capable of making type <italic>A</italic> drones.</p><p>Consider the offspring of type <italic>aa,m</italic> colonies.

Only workers that carry two copies of the <italic>A</italic> allele are capable of making drones, but type <italic>AA</italic> workers are not produced by the queen, so workers do not produce males.</p><p>For studying the invasion of the mutant allele, only a subset of those colony types are relevant. Also, for simplicity, we neglect stochastic effects. The number of individuals produced by a colony is assumed to be very large, so that the fractions of colony offspring of the various possible genotypes are always exactly the same for that type of colony.</p><p>Our attention is on the evolution of the 3(<italic>n</italic> + 1) colony variables.

Holding all other parameters constant, an increase in <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> favors the invasion of the dominant sterility allele for <italic>n</italic> = 1. This is easy to see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: the upper panels (higher <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>) correspond to invasion of the dominant sterility allele for <italic>n</italic> = 1, while the lower panels do not. Holding all other parameters constant, an increase in <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub> favors the invasion of the dominant sterility allele for <italic>n</italic> = 2. Again, this is seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: the right panels (higher <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) represent invasion of the dominant sterility allele for <italic>n</italic> = 2, while the left panels do not. Additionally, holding all other parameters constant, an increase in <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub> facilitates the invasion of the dominant sterility allele for <italic>n</italic> = 1. This can also be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: the boundary separating the upper panels from the lower panels decreases as <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub> increases. If <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub> &gt; <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub>, then it is possible that a dominant sterility allele invades for double mating but not for single mating.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08918.010</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Regions of the parameter space and evolution of worker sterility for a dominant sterility allele.</title><p>The evolutionary invasion of a dominant worker sterility allele depends on values of the parameters <italic>p</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, and <italic>r</italic><sub>1</sub> for single mating, <italic>n</italic> = 1, and on values of the parameters <italic>p</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for double mating, <italic>n</italic> = 2.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Ian Baldwin (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>You will be pleased to see that the reviews are generally favorable, and we are willing to consider a revised submission that addresses the following concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> This is an interesting and potentially important paper that sheds new light on a classical problem. The authors show that in contrast to often made heuristic arguments, it is not true that monandry (single matings) of queens is necessary for the evolution of sterile workers, and hence eusociality. In fact, the authors show that depending on the fraction of males coming from the queen and on the benefit provided by sterile workers, multiple matings may sometimes be more conducive to the evolution of eusociality. The arguments are based on a population genetic model whose analysis appears to be sound. Given the importance of the results, which have the potential to generate a paradigm shift in the theory of eusociality, I recommend publication of this paper. Nevertheless, I have two major concerns that I think the authors should address prior to publication.</p><p>First, I think the Introduction is difficult to read for scientists who are not already familiar with the theory of eusociality. The term &quot;haplodiploid&quot; is used without explanation, and several logical steps need fleshing out. For example, if the eggs of a worker are unfertilized, why is relatedness between offspring only 1/2, and not 1? In general, various claims and statements about &quot;relatedness&quot; need to be better explained. Further, I don't understand the logic behind the &quot;thus&quot; in the seventh paragraph. I also don't understand last column (worker's sons) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>. This should be better explained. And I don't really understand why the quantity <italic>p<sub>z</sub> </italic>is not an emergent property of the model.</p><p>I also don't find the Discussion very convincing. For example, in the second paragraph the concept of worker policing is introduced seemingly out of the blue. On the one hand, the paragraph seems to discuss previous claims that monandry is necessary for eusociality, but then suddenly switches to talking about alternative causes of worker sterility (such as policing), which does not really seem pertinent and makes the logical flow somewhat unconvincing. All of the above needs serious attention if this paper is to be published in a journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>, which has a wide and general biology audience.</p><p>Second, the main claim that multiple matings may be more conducive to eusociality, and in fact may be necessary for the evolution of worker sterility, is based on a proof of principle: it is shown that there are cases (i.e., choices of parameter values for the model) in which this is true. However, I did not get a sense of how often these situations are expected to occur. I would like to see an analysis that reveals how &quot;large&quot; the regions in parameter space are for which multiple matings are more conducive to the evolution of eusociality than single matings, and how large the regions are for which multiple matings are necessary (i.e., single matings do not allow for eusociality to evolve, but multiple matings do). Such an analysis would give a quantitative sense of how large the paradigm shift generated by the results really is. Also, are there cases where more than two matings are necessary for the evolution of eusociality? If there are, this would be interesting to know as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> The authors have constructed a very &quot;flexible&quot; model of the population dynamics of haplodiploid organisms, with alleles <italic>A</italic> and <italic>a</italic>, that live in large colonies. The model is studied via systems of (ordinary) differential equations. By analyzing limiting cases of the systems of ODEs they derive exact conditions for invasion and stability of a worker sterility mutation, <italic>a</italic>. Worker sterility is a defining feature of eusociality.</p><p>They argue convincingly that the functions <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> (colony &quot;efficiency&quot;) and <italic>p<sub>z</sub> </italic>(% of males from the queen):</p><p>1) Can (theoretically) take on a large number of qualitatively different forms;</p><p>2) Are not well understood even for modern species, and perhaps are unknowable in cases from the distant past;</p><p>3) Are crucial in determining whether or not behaviors like worker sterility can invade and/or stabilize.</p><p>Point 2 might seem to make a case against the proposed methodology, but it does not. The approach is honest, and ultimately much more satisfying than (paraphrasing the authors) &quot;heuristics based on relatedness arguments&quot;.</p><p>I recommend this paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, as I think the approach to eusociality taken is an important theoretical advance. I have a few comments that the authors may want to consider in a revision.</p><p>1) If I understand correctly, nobody knows what the functions <italic>p<sub>z</sub> </italic>and <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> look like, aside from that they are (probably) increasing in z. What I take from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and the Discussion, is that subtle differences in <italic>p<sub>z</sub> </italic>and <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> can lead to very different outcomes. But these figures give just a few examples out of an infinity of possibilities. To illustrate in a different way, I would suggest the following experiment – or something like it. Generate the functions <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic> and <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> randomly, subject to the constraint that they are increasing. There are many ways to do this (actually, only a few values of the function are needed.) It is then a simple matter to decide (for <italic>n</italic>=1 and 2, and dominant/recessive) which of (+ or -) invasion and (+ or -) stability occur. The joint distribution for all possible outcomes can then be estimated by Monte Carlo. This would be very interesting (to me, anyway), and easy to do. Of course, someone could quibble with the way you generated <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> and <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic>, but I think that is exactly the conversation you want to have.</p><p>2) Is there any rule of thumb for when <italic>n</italic>=2 is more conducive to worker sterility than <italic>n</italic>=1? Perhaps some insights would come from a statistical analysis of the simulation data from the previous comment.</p><p>3) I would be interested to see (numerical) solutions of the differential equations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>), perhaps corresponding to the examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>. I'm curious why the authors do not provide this, as the solutions would be very interesting, and also provide a check on the main results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> Olejarz et al. provide a mathematical model detailing the selective forces that determine the emergence and stability of non-reproductive workers. Understanding how the degree of genetic relatedness influences the evolution of eusociality is a key question in evolutionary biology. Recently, the role and significance of genetic relatedness as a factor facilitating the evolution eusociality has been hotly debated, and in this context, the authors’ conclusions would be quite controversial as their model attempts to show that monogamy (single queen that is singly mated), while increasing the genetic relatedness to the offspring, is not a necessary or facilitative condition, of eusociality. The mathematical model they present is quite elegant, but I have the following major concerns about the context and findings of the article:</p><p>1) Context: The major problem with the context of their findings is that the authors are equating the evolution eusociality with the evolution of non-reproductive workers. However, in ants, the evolution of eusociality occurs without the evolution of sterile, non-reproductive, workers. Workers in the basal lineages of ants are fully capable of mating and have the same number of ovarioles as the queen. The main difference in reproduction is in the overall activity of the ovarioles, and the queen regulates reproduction via policing. In fact, only 9 out of the ~300 genera of ants are completely sterile. So Darwin's famous quip that 'sterile' caste in ants possess a major challenge to his theory is misleading because sterility does not equate to origin of eusociality. This is not to say that the evolution of non-reproductive workers is not an important event in the history of eusociality in social insects, but it describes a transition to a much more advanced state of eusociality, long after the origin of eusociality occurs. Species with completely sterile workers are often ecological dominant (the fire ants) or evolutionarily successful (Pheidole, the big-headed ants). Therefore, the model the authors are proposing explains an important milestone in the social evolution, but is not reflective of the origin of the eusociality in most eusocial species. In this context, their model attempts to show that monogamy (single queen that is singly mated) is not necessarily a facilitating factor for the evolution of non-reproductive workers. They take this to mean that monogamy is then not a facilitating factor for the origin of eusociality. However, as I have explained above, they cannot equate evolution of eusociality to evolution of non-reproductive workers. The authors would have to re-write the manuscript and implications of their findings making the distinctions I have made above. Otherwise, the article will needlessly create controversy, and overlook the more interesting implications of their findings, especially in the light of molecular work (work from the Dearden and Abouheif labs) elucidating the molecular mechanisms of reproductive constraint in worker in bees and ants.</p><p>2) Model results: when comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, it was initially unclear to me why the authors chose to model the sterility under a <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.5 and <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.9. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.5 means that approximately 40-50% fraction of non-reproductive workers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that the conditions of colony efficiency under which a mutant allele can invade and is stable is relatively small and larger for <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.9. Therefore for <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub>'s less than 0.5 the conditions of colony efficiency under which a mutant allele can invade and be stable is very small. Therefore, it raises the question of how realistic, or likely, is it that the mutant allele will invade to lead to the evolution of non-reproductive workers. This may explain why it occurs so rarely in social insects (see above) and why eusociality is so rare to begin with. This is the much more interesting finding and the manuscript should be re-written to highlight these facts.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08918.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] First, I think the Introduction is difficult to read for scientists who are not already familiar with the theory of eusociality.

We provide a better explanation for our statements about relatedness.</p><p>The “thus” in the Introduction of the original submission refers to the fact that, in our model, if a worker does not lay an egg, then a queen-laid male egg takes its place. Therefore, worker-laid eggs (which are always male) are replaced by queen-laid male eggs, but not by queen-laid female eggs. This is why, in our model, the sex ratio is independent of the number of sterile workers. If, instead, queen-laid female eggs replace worker-laid male eggs, then the emergence of sterile workers would change the sex ratio of the colony. We have clarified this point.</p><p>We have added some descriptive text in the section “Model” regarding the “Workers’ Sons” columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. This should ease the reader’s interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We also refer to the supplementary information for a more detailed description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>.</p><p>We have clarified some subtleties of the quantity <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic>, which is the fraction of male eggs that originate from the queen if a fraction, z, of workers are non-reproductive. One might initially think that <italic>p<sub>z</sub> </italic>would linearly increase in <italic>z</italic>. But this assumption is not necessarily true, because there can be nonlinear effects acting on the quantity <italic>p<sub>z</sub></italic>. For example, the queen might remove worker-laid male eggs. If there are only a few reproducing workers (so that <italic>z</italic> is slightly less than 1), then the queen might effectively eliminate all worker-produced eggs. If there are many reproducing workers (so that <italic>z</italic> is slightly greater than 0), then the queen might only be able to remove a small fraction of all worker-laid eggs. In this case, <italic>p<sub>z</sub> </italic>would be expected to increase sublinearly with <italic>z</italic>.</p><p>Please note that <italic>p<sub>z</sub> </italic>is not an emerging property of the model. All we can say for sure is that <italic>p<sub>1</sub></italic>=1. If all workers are non-reproductive, <italic>z</italic>=1, then all male eggs come from the queen. But if for example all of the workers are productive, <italic>z</italic>=0, then the value <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> does depend on biological details of that species, such as how many eggs are being laid by queen, how many by workers, how viable are the worker eggs, what happens to them, are they treated differently, etc.</p><p>We have rewritten the paragraph on policing. We have also added some text to the Discussion section to frame the phenomenon of worker sterility and other important aspects of eusociality in a clearer context. Our aim here is to make some statements about the broader discussion of evolution of eusociality.</p><p><italic>Second, the main claim that multiple matings may be more conducive to eusociality, and in fact may be necessary for the evolution of worker sterility, is based on a proof of principle: it is shown that there are cases (i.e., choices of parameter values for the model) in which this is true. However, I did not get a sense of how often these situations are expected to occur. I would like to see an analysis that reveals how &quot;large&quot; the regions in parameter space are for which multiple matings are more conducive to the evolution of eusociality than single matings, and how large the regions are for which multiple matings are necessary (i.e., single matings do not allow for eusociality to evolve, but multiple matings do). Such an analysis would give a quantitative sense of how large the paradigm shift generated by the results really is. Also, are there cases where more than two matings are necessary for the evolution of eusociality? If there are, this would be interesting to know as well.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent point. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, which show the regions of parameter space where non-reproductive workers invade for n+1 matings but not for n matings. An interesting principle emerges. When comparing <italic>n</italic>=1 and <italic>n</italic>=2 matings, increasing <italic>r</italic><sub>1/4</sub> favors evolution of non-reproductive workers for <italic>n</italic>=2 matings, while increasing <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and leaving everything else constant favors evolution for <italic>n</italic>=1 matings. Additionally, we have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, which illustrates sample forms of <italic>p<sub>z</sub> </italic>and <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> for which non-reproductive workers invade for triple mating but not for double or single mating.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] I recommend this paper for publication in</italic> eLife<italic>, as I think the approach to eusociality taken is an important theoretical advance. I have a few comments that the authors may want to consider in a revision.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) If I understand correctly, nobody knows what the functions</italic> p<sub>z</sub> <italic>and</italic> r<sub>z</sub> <italic>look like, aside from that they are (probably) increasing in z. What I take from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, and the Discussion, is that subtle differences in</italic> p<sub>z</sub><italic>and</italic> r<sub>z</sub> <italic>can lead to very different outcomes. But these figures give just a few examples out of an infinity of possibilities. To illustrate in a different way, I would suggest the following experiment – or something like it. Generate the functions</italic> p<sub>z</sub><italic>and</italic> r<sub>z</sub> <italic>randomly, subject to the constraint that they are increasing. There are many ways to do this (actually, only a few values of the function are needed). It is then a simple matter to decide (for</italic> n <italic>= 1 and 2, and dominant/recessive) which of (+ or -) invasion and (+ or -) stability occur. The joint distribution for all possible outcomes can then be estimated by Monte Carlo. This would be very interesting (to me, anyway), and easy to do. Of course, someone could quibble with the way you generated</italic> r<sub>z</sub> <italic>and</italic> p<sub>z</sub><italic>, but I think that is exactly the conversation you want to have.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent suggestion. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, which show typical regions of the parameter space and the associated behavior of the sterility allele. We agree that the case of a monotonically increasing efficiency function <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> is interesting, and we do not rule out the possibility of a function <italic>r<sub>z</sub></italic> that reaches a maximum for an intermediate value of 0&lt;z&lt;1. For example, it may be that the addition of sterile workers results in diminishing returns in colony productivity. We have added text on these subtleties at the end of the Model section and also in the Results section.</p><p>We have also done some numerical experiments, as you suggested. In the subsection “Numerical Experiments” in the Methods section, we generate efficiency parameters randomly according to a bivariate normal distribution. We investigate both the cases where efficiency parameters are uncorrelated and also where efficiency parameters are positively correlated. These experiments were run for each of the scenarios depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Is there any rule of thumb for when</italic> n<italic>=2 is more conducive to worker sterility than</italic> n<italic>=1? Perhaps some insights would come from a statistical analysis of the simulation data from the previous comment.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this excellent question, which led us to the following realization. The condition for non-reproductive workers to invade for single mating depends only on the parameters <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>r</italic><sub>1/2</sub>.

Understanding how the degree of genetic relatedness influences the evolution of eusociality is a key question in evolutionary biology. Recently, the role and significance of genetic relatedness as a factor facilitating the evolution eusociality has been hotly debated, and in this context, the authors’ conclusions would be quite controversial as their model attempts to show that monogamy (single queen that is singly mated), while increasing the genetic relatedness to the offspring, is not a necessary or facilitative condition, of eusociality. The mathematical model they present is quite elegant, but I have the following major concerns about the context and findings of the article: 1) Context: The major problem with the context of their findings is that the authors are equating the evolution eusociality with the evolution of non-reproductive workers. However, in ants, the evolution of eusociality occurs without the evolution of sterile, non-reproductive, workers. Workers in the basal lineages of ants are fully capable of mating and have the same number of ovarioles as the queen. The main difference in reproduction is in the overall activity of the ovarioles, and the queen regulates reproduction via policing. In fact, only 9 out of the ~300 genera of ants are completely sterile. So Darwin's famous quip that 'sterile' caste in ants possess a major challenge to his theory is misleading because sterility does not equate to origin of eusociality. This is not to say that the evolution of non-reproductive workers is not an important event in the history of eusociality in social insects, but it describes a transition to a much more advanced state of eusociality, long after the origin of eusociality occurs. Species with completely sterile workers are often ecological dominant (the fire ants) or evolutionarily successful (Pheidole, the big-headed ants). Therefore, the model the authors are proposing explains an important milestone in the social evolution, but is not reflective of the origin of the eusociality in most eusocial species. In this context, their model attempts to show that monogamy (single queen that is singly mated) is not necessarily a facilitating factor for the evolution of non-reproductive workers. They take this to mean that monogamy is then not a facilitating factor for the origin of eusociality. However, as I have explained above, they cannot equate evolution of eusociality to evolution of non-reproductive workers. The authors would have to re-write the manuscript and implications of their findings making the distinctions I have made above. Otherwise, the article will needlessly create controversy, and overlook the more interesting implications of their findings, especially in the light of molecular work (work from the Dearden and Abouheif labs) elucidating the molecular mechanisms of reproductive constraint in worker in bees and ants.</italic> </p><p>We fully agree. We did not mean to confuse the evolution of non-reproductive workers with the origin of eusociality. In the revised version of the manuscript, we fully clarify this difference, and we list the important points that you are making. We now describe evolution of non-reproductive (or sterile) workers as an important step in the evolution of advanced eusociality.</p><p>We have rewritten the manuscript accordingly. In the Discussion section, we have added text that explicitly acknowledges that worker sterility is only one aspect of advanced eusociality. We have added citations to interesting studies on other key aspects of eusociality, including nest formation, queen policing, and worker policing. We have also added citations to several important studies from both the Dearden and Abouheif labs that connect well with our work.</p><p><italic>2) Model results: when comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, it was initially unclear to me why the authors chose to model the sterility under a</italic> p<italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.5 and</italic> p<italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.9. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,</xref> </italic>p<italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.5 means that approximately 40-50% fraction of non-reproductive workers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that the conditions of colony efficiency under which a mutant allele can invade and is stable is relatively small and larger for</italic> p<italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.9. Therefore for</italic> p<italic><sub>0</sub>'s less than 0.5 the conditions of colony efficiency under which a mutant allele can invade and be stable is very small. Therefore, it raises the question of how realistic, or likely, is it that the mutant allele will invade to lead to the evolution of non-reproductive workers. This may explain why it occurs so rarely in social insects (see above) and why eusociality is so rare to begin with. This is the much more interesting finding and the manuscript should be re-written to highlight these facts.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for highlighting this important point.</p><p>We have made appropriate changes to the main text. After Equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), we now describe that small values of <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> (the fraction of male eggs from the queen when no workers are sterile) require efficiency increases of 10-20%. After Equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), we now also describe that large efficiency gains (of 10-20%) are needed.</p><p>Several paragraphs below, we now mention again that efficiency gains of 10-20% are large and may be difficult to achieve. Based on your suggestion, we conjecture that these large thresholds may aid in explaining the rarity of non-reproductive castes in the social insects.</p><p>We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>. These new figures show the regions of parameter space for which non-reproductive workers are favored by natural selection. We use small values of <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> in these new plots (<italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub>=0.1 or 0.2) to illustrate that large efficiency thresholds are needed for sterility to develop.</p><p>In the second-to-last paragraph of the Discussion section, we mention again that large efficiency gains are needed for sterility to invade if <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> is small. We point out that this is a central result. We mention that larger values of <italic>p</italic><sub>0</sub> probably correspond with a higher degree of social organization already being established before sterility invades, such as queen policing or worker policing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
