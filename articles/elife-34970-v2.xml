alone plays a key role in longevity and heat stress response. Whereas SET-26 is broadly expressed, SET-9 is only detectable in the germline, which likely accounts for their different biological roles. SET-9 and SET-26 bind to H3K4me3 with adjacent acetylation marks in vitro and in vivo. In the soma, SET-26 acts through DAF-16 to modulate longevity. In the germline, SET-9 and SET-26 restrict H3K4me3 domains around SET-9 and SET-26 binding sites, and regulate the expression of specific target genes, with critical consequence on germline development. SET-9 and SET-26 are highly conserved and our findings provide new insights into the functions of these H3K4me3 readers in germline development and longevity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34970.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells keep their DNA organized by wrapping it around groups of proteins called histones. These structures not only keep the genetic code tidy, they also affect how and when a cell uses its genes. This is because small chemical groups that are added to histones, such as a methyl group added to the fourth position of histone H3 (known as H3K4me3), affect which proteins can access the surrounding genes. This in turn determines whether those genes are likely to be on or off.</p><p>Many proteins help to regulate histone modifications, including proteins that add or remove the specific chemical groups. Enzymes that add a methyl group to histone usually contain a region called SET; while proteins containing a structure called a PHD finger can recognize histone modifications and help to amplify the signal to switch a gene on or off. SET-9 and SET-26 are two proteins containing both SET regions and PHD fingers. Found in the worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, these proteins are 97% identical. Changes in histone modifications can affect the lifespan of these worms, and the number of offspring they produce. Recent work revealed that loss of SET-9 and SET-26 makes the worms live longer.</p><p>Now, Wang et al. use gene editing to better understand how these proteins have their effects. Experiments with worms lacking the gene for SET-9 or SET-26 or both revealed that, despite looking almost identical, SET-9 and SET-26 have different roles. Every cell in the worm makes SET-26 protein and getting rid of it increases their lifespan by affecting the activity of a protein called DAF-16. But, only the cells in the reproductive system make SET-9, and both proteins play a role in fertility.</p><p>A technique called ChIP-seq revealed where each protein attached to the genome. The PHD fingers of SET-9 and SET-26 bound to around half of the possible H3K4me3 modification sites. Not all the possible sites actually had a methyl group attached, and the pattern of binding matched the pattern of modifications. This indicates that the two proteins arrive only once the positions already have their methyl groups.</p><p>Getting rid of the SET-9 and SET-26 proteins increased the number of H3K4me3 sites with methyl groups attached. This suggests that the role of SET-9 and SET-26 is to stop the spread of H3K4me3 modifications, controlling the use of certain genes.</p><p>In mammals, the proteins SETD5 and MLL5 likely do the job of SET-9 and SET-26. Understanding how they work in worms could further our understanding of fertility and ageing in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>H3K4me3</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 grant AG024425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Siu Sylvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two SET-domain containing proteins regulate H3K4me3 by their binding to H3K4me3 through their PHD domain and directly regulate expression of a subset of genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynamic regulations of histone methylation status have been linked to many biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Santos and Dean, 2004</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that specific histone methyltransferases and demethylases can play key roles in regulating germline functions and/or modulating longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Han and Brunet, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greer and Shi, 2012</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, loss of the COMPASS complex, which is critical for methylating histone H3 lysine 4, results in a global decrease in H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) levels, and reduced brood size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li and Kelly, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robert et al., 2014</xref>) and extended lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greer et al., 2010</xref>) phenotypes. Interestingly, deletion of <italic>spr-5</italic> or <italic>rbr-2</italic>, both of which encode demethylases that erase methyl marks on H3K4, also results in fertility defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvares et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Katz et al., 2009</xref>) and altered lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvares et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greer et al., 2010</xref>). These findings suggest that histone methylations need to be precisely controlled to maintain longevity and germline function. It is important to note that the molecular mechanisms whereby these H3K4 modifying enzymes effect reproduction and longevity functions, including the genomic regions that they act on and how the altered H3K4 methylation levels contribute to the biological outcomes in these mutants, are largely unknown.</p><p>SET (Su(var)3–9, Enhancer of Zeste, Trithorax) domain-containing proteins represent a major group of histone methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dillon et al., 2005</xref>). We previously carried out a targeted RNAi screen to identify the SET-domain containing proteins that play a role in longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We found that RNAi knockdown of <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic>, two closely related genes, results in significant lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). SET-9 and SET-26 share 96% sequence identity and both proteins contain highly conserved PHD and SET domains. PHD domains are known to bind to specific histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2006</xref>), suggesting that SET-9 and SET-26 could be recruited to chromatin via binding to specific histone marks. Interestingly, the SET domain of SET-9 and SET-26 contains mutations in conserved residues thought to be key for methylating activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2012</xref>), making it unclear whether SET-9 and SET-26 could be active enzymes. Nevertheless, a recent study reported that the SET domain of SET-26 exhibits H3K9me3 activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we demonstrated that, despite their high sequence identity, SET-26, but not SET-9, plays a key role in heat stress response and longevity. In addition, we revealed a novel redundant function of SET-9 and SET-26 in germline development. We also confirmed that SET-26 is broadly expressed, whereas SET-9 is only expressed in the germline, which likely accounts for their distinct and redundant functions in lifespan and reproduction. Indeed, genetic and transcriptomic analyses supported the notion that SET-26 acts through the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 in the soma to modulate longevity. Furthermore, we showed that the PHD domains of SET-9 and SET-26 bind to H3K4me3 in vitro and that the genome-wide binding patterns of SET-9 and SET-26 are highly concordant with that of H3K4me3 marking in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, indicating that SET-9 and SET-26 are recruited to H3K4me3 marked regions in vivo. Although the SET domain of SET-26 was reported to methylate H3K9me3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greer et al., 2014</xref>), our results indicated that loss of <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> does not affect global H3K9me3 levels and the genome-wide binding patterns of SET-9 and SET-26 are highly divergent from that of H3K9me3. Instead, we found that loss of <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> results in expansion of H3K4me3 marking surrounding most if not all of the SET-9 and SET-26 binding sites specifically in the germline, and significant RNA expression change of a subset of germline specific genes bound by SET-9 and SET-26. We propose that SET-9 and SET-26 are recruited to the chromatin via binding to H3K4me3, where they function to restrict H3K4me3 spreading and to regulate the expression of specific genes, and together these activities contribute to the proper maintenance of germline development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>set-26</italic>, but not <italic>set-9</italic>, single mutant exhibits prolonged lifespan and heightened resistance to heat stress</title><p>RNAi knockdown of the highly similar paralogs <italic>set-26</italic> and <italic>set-9</italic> were previously shown to significantly extend lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). However, due to their high sequence similarity, RNAi likely knocks down both <italic>set-26</italic> and <italic>set-9</italic> in those experiments. We confirmed the lifespan extension phenotype with multiple available <italic>set-26</italic> single mutants, but a <italic>set-9</italic> single mutant was not available at the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). To delineate whether <italic>set-9</italic>, like <italic>set-26</italic>, also plays a role in lifespan determination, we used CRISPR-cas9 to generate a <italic>set-9</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>set-9</italic> mutant we obtained carries a mutation that causes a premature stop codon and is expected to produce a truncated SET-9 protein lacking the conserved PHD and SET domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We tested the lifespan phenotype of this <italic>set-9</italic> single mutant along with the <italic>set-26</italic> single and <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants. Consistent with previous results, the <italic>set-26</italic> single mutant lived longer than wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, although SET-9 and SET-26 proteins share 97% identity in protein sequence, the <italic>set-9(rw5)</italic> mutation did not alter lifespan in either wild-type or the <italic>set-26</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similar to the lifespan phenotype, <italic>set-26</italic>, but not <italic>set-9</italic> single mutant, was more resistant to heat stress compared to wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

To more thoroughly assess the roles of SET-9 and SET-26 in reproduction, we assayed the brood size of <italic>set-9, set-26</italic> single and double mutants.

In an attempt to resolve the expression patterns of SET-9 and SET-26, we previously used RT-PCR at precise temperatures, as well as an antibody that recognized both SET-9 and SET-26, in wild-type, <italic>set-26</italic> single, and germlineless mutant worms, and deduced that SET-26 is likely broadly expressed and SET-9 is likely expressed in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). To unambiguously determine the expression patterns of the SET-9 and SET-26 proteins, we used CRISPR-cas9 to knock-in a GFP tag at the C-terminus of the endogenous <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> loci and monitored their expression patterns. Consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2012</xref>), we found that GFP-tagged SET-9 was only detected in germline cells of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The SET domain of SET-26 was recently reported to show H3K9me3 methylation activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Greer et al., 2014</xref>). This was a somewhat surprising result, as the SET domain of SET-26 (and SET-9) contains multiple mutations in the critical residues generally thought to be key for the methylating enzymatic activity of SET domain proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and we have previously speculated that SET-9 and SET-26 are likely not active enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the likely homologs of SET-9 and SET-26 in flies (UpSET) and mammals (MLL5) have been reported to lack methylating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sebastian et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rincon-Arano et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, because of the reported in vitro results, we sought to monitor the global levels of H3K9me3 in the <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> mutants. We reasoned that if SET-9 and SET-26 are major enzymes for depositing H3K9me3 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, then we would detect reduced H3K9me3 levels in the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant strain. Using Western blotting, we showed that the global levels of H3K9me3 were not detectably altered in the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants compared to wild-type worms at the L4 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We further investigated the genomic distribution of H3K9me3 in wild-type N2 and the F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant worms using ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next generation sequencing). Inspection of the genome-wide H3K9me3 distribution between N2 and the F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant revealed highly similar patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2A</xref>). Furthermore, the Diffbind data analysis pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bardet et al., 2011</xref>) identified little significant differences between the two data sets (data not shown). Taken together the Western and ChIP-seq results, we concluded that SET-9 and SET-26 are likely not the major enzymes required for H3K9me3 deposition in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, we could not rule out the possibility that the SET-9 and SET-26 could deposit H3K9me3 in specific cells, or during a specific time. Indeed, we previously reported that in the germlineless mutant <italic>glp-1</italic>, loss of <italic>set-26</italic> resulted in lower levels of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ni et al., 2012</xref>).

Because antibodies capable of immunoprecipitating endogenous SET-9 and SET-26 were not available, we utilized the GFP knock-in strains discussed above. We performed anti-GFP ChIP-seq using the <italic>set-9::gfp</italic>, <italic>set-26::gfp</italic>, and <italic>set-9::gfp set-26::gfp</italic> strains. The double GFP strain was used in the hope that higher levels of GFP expression would provide more robust ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). MACS2 was used to identify the genomic regions significantly enriched for SET-9 and SET-26 binding. From the analyses, 602, 3948, and 5903 peaks were identified as bound by SET-9, SET-26, and SET-9 and SET-26 together, respectively. Interestingly, 67% of the SET-9 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>) overlapped with the SET-26 peaks, and 87% of the SET-26 peaks overlapped with the SET-9 and SET-26 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>). That SET-9 was found to bind many fewer regions than SET-26, and that the SET-9-bound peaks largely overlapped with those bound by SET-26, are consistent with the earlier data indicating SET-9 has a much more restricted expression pattern and a more limited function in the germline that is redundant with SET-26. Interestingly, ChIP-seq analysis from the double GFP strain nevertheless revealed many more peaks compared to SET-26::GFP alone. We interpreted these results to suggest that the double GFP strain simply represented a better reagent for capturing the SET-9 and SET-26 binding profiles than either of the single GFP strain, because the ChIP assay worked more effectively with higher levels of GFP expression. For further analyses, we used the peak regions identified in the double GFP strain as representation of the binding sites of SET-9 and SET-26.</p><p>Given the in vitro binding of the PHD domain of SET-9 and SET-26 to H3K4me3, we wondered whether SET-9 and SET-26 also bind to H3K4me3 in vivo. To test this, we examined the genome-wide pattern of H3K4me3 in wild-type worms using ChIP-seq. A representative genome browser view revealed that the SET-9 and SET-26 binding profile generally correlated well with the H3K4me3 profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, the SET-9 and SET-26 binding profile was largely different from that of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), again consistent with our earlier conclusion that SET-9 and SET-26 likely do not modify H3K9me3.</p><p>To more rigorously assess whether the SET-9 and SET-26 profile is concordant with the H3K4me3 profile, we tested whether SET-9 and SET-26, and H3K4me3 were enriched in overlapping genomic regions. To this end, we used MACS2 to identify 5996 genomic regions enriched for H3K4me3 marking (peaks), and then compared the degree of overlap between the SET-9 and SET-26 peaks with those of H3K4me3. In this comparison, we found that 75% of the SET-9 and SET-26 binding regions overlapped with the H3K4me3 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The reciprocal comparison revealed that 49% of the H3K4me3 peaks overlapped with the SET-9 and SET-26 binding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We sought to further characterize the overlapping profiles between SET-9 and SET-26 and H3K4me3 using meta-analysis. We separated the H3K4me3 peaks into the group that bound by SET-9 and SET-26 and the group that did not, and we plotted the average normalized H3K4me3 levels centered around the summits of the H3K4me3 peaks and oriented at a 5’ to 3’ direction according the nearest genes associated with the peaks. We found that, on average, the H3K4me3 peaks bound by SET-9 and SET-26 had higher levels of H3K4me3 marking and their H3K4me3 marking was somewhat higher 5’ to the summit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>). This asymmetrical marking of H3K4me3 might relate to that these peaks generally localized around annotated transcriptional/translational start sites (TSSs) and H3K4me3 levels tend to be higher 5’ to the start sites of the genes. In contrast, the average plot of the H3K4me3 peaks that were not bound by SET-9 and SET-26 was more symmetrical, and this correlated with these H3K4me3 peaks generally localized to gene body regions (data not shown).</p><p>We next used a similar meta-analysis approach but plotted the normalized SET-9 and SET-26 ChIP signals for the two groups of H3K4me3 peaks, still oriented at the summits of the H3K4me3 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). This analysis allowed us to determine how far the average summit of the SET-9 and SET-26 peaks was relative to that of the H3K4me3 peaks. The results indicated that the average summit of the SET-9 and SET-26 peaks was ~100–200 bp upstream of the H3K4me3 summit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Interestingly, for the group of H3K4me3 peaks that were not identified to share SET-9 and SET-26 enrichment based on MACS2, we nevertheless detected a small amount of SET-9 and SET-26 binding exactly at the summits of the H3K4me3 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). We interpreted these results to suggest that SET-9 and SET-26 likely bind to most if not all of the H3K4me3 enriched regions, but some of the binding was too weak (or strong binding only in a subset of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> cells) to be called by a statistical program like MACS2. Lastly, we used scatter plot analysis to compare the H3K4me3 enriched signal vs. the SET-9 and SET-26 binding signal for each of the H3K4me3 peak region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The results showed that the H3K4me3 signal intensity is positively correlated with that of SET-9 and SET-26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The data thus far supported a model that SET-9 and SET-26 bind to regions marked by H3K4me3 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and that the detectable SET-9 and SET-26 binding sites are generally marked by higher levels of H3K4me3.</p><p>Since the in vitro histone peptide array results suggested that histone acetylations are also important for the binding, we next compared the degree of overlap between the SET-9 and SET-26 peaks with those of H3K9ac using data from modENCODE. In this comparison, we found that 28% of the SET-9 and SET-26 binding regions overlapped with the H3K9ac peaks (***p&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>), and 98% of these shared peak regions were also marked by H3K4me3 (data not shown). The significant but lower percentage of overlap between SET-9 and SET-26 binding with the H3K9ac enriched regions (relative to the overlap with H3K4me3 enriched regions) is consistent with the in vitro observation that SET-9 and SET-26 bind to H3K4me3 with adjacent acetylation, but the exact acetylated residues could vary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), but is also likely partly due to technical differences, for example the different ChIP-seq data were generated using worms at different stages and acetyl specific antibodies generally have lower specificity. We additionally compared the overall correlation between H3K4me3 and H3K9ac enriched regions and whether SET-9 and SET-26 may affect their co-occurrence. As expected, we found that the genome-wide distribution of H3K4me3 correlated well with that of H3K9ac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the correlation between H3K4me3 and H3K9ac was higher for the peaks that were bound by SET-9 and SET-26 compared to those that were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5D</xref>).

For the H3K4me3 peaks bound by SET-9 and SET-26, we again observed a ‘spreading’ of H3K4me3 marking, especially towards the 3’ direction. Statistically significant elevated levels of H3K4me3 were detected starting at around +500 and −1000 bp beyond the summit in the F1 and F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant compared to wild-type worms, where the 95% confidence intervals of H3K4me3 marking in the F1 and F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> mutants did not overlap with that in the wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Interestingly, for the H3K4me3 peaks that showed no detectable SET-9 and SET-26 binding, the average plot showed no significant ‘spreading’ of the H3K4me3 marking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

This could be due to residual binding of SET-9 and SET-26 that was statistically unable to be detected by the MACS2 pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref>). We further examined the observed ‘spreading’ of H3K4me3 marking by producing meta plot of the H3K4me3 peaks that overlapped with SET-9 and SET-26 binding that centered around the summits of SET-9 and SET-26 binding peaks. We again observed an insignificant increase at the center of the plot, where SET-9 and SET-26 binding peaked, but a detectable increase of H3K4me3 levels in regions flanking the summit of SET-9 and SET-26 binding sites in the F1 and F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant compared to wild-type worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that the F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant showed a more obvious expansion of H3K4me3 compared to the F1 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant, even though this difference was not statistically significant, as their 95% confidence intervals overlapped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Since the F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant had a more severe fertility defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), this observation hinted at a possible correlation between H3K4me3 expansion and germline defects.

To further investigate this possibility, we performed similar H3K4me3 ChIP-seq analysis in the germlineless <italic>glp-1; set-26</italic> and <italic>glp-1</italic> mutants. Interestingly, we observed no significant difference in the genome-wide patterns of H3K4me3 in germlineless worms with or without SET-26, even in regions bound by SET-9 and SET-26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The ChIP-seq results therefore corroborated with our previous Western blotting results, and together they supported the notion that SET-9 and SET-26 binding does not detectably impact H3K4me3 marking in somatic cells. Rather, SET-9 and SET-26 binding likely normally help to restrict H3K4me3 marking specifically in the germline.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>A subset of germline-specific genes show correlated changes in H3K4me3 and RNA expression levels in the F1 and F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants</title><p>H3K4me3 has been generally associated with active gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sims et al., 2007</xref>). We wondered whether the regions with expanded H3K4me3 marking could be associated with gene expression changes in the F1 and F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants. To assess this, we used csaw, an R package for differential binding analysis of ChIP-seq data using sliding windows, to identify 3438 and 5456 regions that exhibited statistically significant different H3K4me3 marking in F1 and F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants compared with wild-type worms (data not shown). Consistent with a slight global increase in H3K4me3 levels in the F1 and F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant, 92 and 99% of the differential H3K4me3 regions revealed by csaw showed elevated H3K4me3 levels in the F1 and F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants. We next assigned these differential H3K4me3 peaks to their closest genes and identified 3017 and 4517genes that are associated with altered H3K4me3 markings. We then compared these gene lists with the list of genes that exhibited significant expression change between the F1 and F3 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants compared to wild-type worms based on our earlier RNA-seq data.

Therefore, it appeared that for the germline-specific genes, H3K4me3 expansion indeed correlates well with RNA expression increase.

We confirmed that SET-9 is only detectable in the germline whereas SET-26 is broadly expressed, and we concluded that their differential expression patterns likely account for the different phenotypes associated with the loss of each gene.

The exact functions of the SET domains in these proteins remain to be elucidated.</p><p>The PHD domains of SET-9, SET-26, UpSET and MLL5 proteins are also highly conserved. The PHD domain of MLL5 was found to bind to H3K4me3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2013</xref>), and both MLL5 and UpSET have been shown to localize at promoter regions in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rincon-Arano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2013</xref>). Our results demonstrated that SET-9 and SET-26 also bind to H3K4me3 in vitro and in vivo. We further revealed that the PHD domains of SET-9 and SET-26 bind to H3K4me3 with adjacent acetylation (e.g. K9, K14, K18) with much greater affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This is an important finding and potentially links SET-9 and SET-26 to the regulation of both H3K4me3 and histone acetylation. Indeed, we showed that loss of <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> results in a slight elevation of global H3K4me3 and H3K9Ac levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We additionally uncovered expansion of H3K4me3 domains surrounding SET-9 and SET-26 bound regions, and we predict that similar expansion of H3K9Ac likely occurs in the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant. Interestingly, loss of <italic>set-26</italic> in somatic tissues does not result in similar H3K4me3 elevation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and we concluded that SET-9 and SET-26 are particularly important for restricting H3K4me3 domains in the germline. These data are reminiscent to those reported for MLL5 and UpSET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rincon-Arano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallo et al., 2015</xref>). In human glioblastoma cells with self-renewing potential, it was found that knockdown of MLL5 leads to increased global levels of H3K4me3 and a more open chromatin environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallo et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, this anti-correlation between MLL5 and H3K4me3 was only detected in primary glioblastoma cells with self-renewing potential, but not in bulk glioblastoma samples, nor in non-neoplastic brain samples or colon cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gallo et al., 2015</xref>), indicating a regulatory process that is highly cell type specific. A possible parallel in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is that the anti-correlation between SET-9 and SET-26 status and H3K4me3 levels is particularly obvious in the germline of adult worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), which harbor proliferative germline stem cells. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc cells, UpSET knockdown has been shown to increase the levels and spreading of H3K9Ac, H3K16Ac, and H3K4me2/3 around some TSSs, which results in a generally more accessible chromatin environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rincon-Arano et al., 2012</xref>). UpSET achieves this partly through recruitment of specific histone deacetylases. Although the role of SETD5 PHD domain has not been studied, SETD5 also has been found to interact with histone deacetylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Osipovich et al., 2016</xref>). Loss of SETD5 causes elevation in histone acetylation at transcriptional start sites and near downstream regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Osipovich et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that it acts in a similar manner to <italic>Drosophila</italic> UpSET. Taking together the <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mammalian data, it appears that the SET-9, SET-26, UpSET, SETD5, MLL5 family of factors play an important role in binding to H3K4me3, possibly with flanking acetylation sites, and regulating local chromatin accessibility, partly through restricting the spread of histone modifications such as H3K4 methylation and H3K9 acetylation. Extending from the findings with UpSET in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and SETD5 in mammals, SET-9 and SET-26 likely also recruit demethylating and deacetylating enzymes to confine local methylation and acetylation domains.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Biological functions of SET-9 and SET-26</title><p>In this study, we uncovered a novel redundant function of SET-9 and SET-26 in germline function.

Our data indicated that SET-9 and SET-26 have a more pleiotropic role in the germline, affecting both germline stem cell proliferation, and the subsequent differentiation into oocytes and sperms. This difference could be due to that <italic>C. elegans</italic> are hermaphrodites and SET-9 and SET-26 have adopted broader functions in the germline. In addition, MLL5 has been implicated in regulating cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Deng et al., 2004</xref>) and stem cell pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), which may parallel the redundant roles of SET-9 and SET-26 in germline stem cells proliferation. Considering the highly conserved functions of SET-9, SET-26, UpSET, SETD5 and MLL5 at the molecular and phenotypic levels, an intriguing possibility is that UpSET, SETD5 and MLL5 have yet-to-be characterized roles in stress response and longevity.</p><p>A key important question is how SET-9 and SET-26 can mediate their effects on stress response, longevity and germline development. Our data clearly supported that SET-26 acts in the soma and through DAF-16 to modulate longevity. The exact functional relationship between SET-26 and DAF-16 remains unclear. It was striking that the comparison of the SET-9 and SET-26 bound targets from whole worms and the DAF-16-mediated transcriptomic changes in germlineless mutant not only did not show a significant overlap, it in fact showed an overlap that was much lower than expected by random chance. Although it is difficult to cross-compare results from different experimental set-ups, it seems likely that SET-9 and SET-26 do not bind to candidate DAF-16 regulated genes. Therefore, SET-9 and SET-26 likely mediate their effect on DAF-16 indirectly.</p><p>We also note that while we were able to identify SET-9 and SET-26 targets whose expression show significant change in response to the loss of <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic>, the SET-9 and SET-26 binding targets were not enriched for genes that showed expression change in the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant.

Since our ChIP-seq data were from whole worms and could not distinguish the SET-9 and SET-26 binding targets in the soma vs the germline, our current results cannot resolve whether SET-9- and SET-26-binding has a direct consequence on gene expression regulation.</p><p>We detected significant broadening of H3K4me3 marking surrounding the SET-9 and SET-26 bound regions. Although this change was observed in whole worms, it was not detectable in worms lacking germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We interpreted this to mean that the expansion of H3K4me3 domains likely happen either specifically in the germline, or most noticeable in the germline. Somewhat surprisingly, such broadening of H3K4me3 domains did not appear to correlate with gene expression using whole worm analyses. This finding could partly be due to technical caveats, as the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data were generated using whole worms, which could mask correlated changes in specific cells. Consistent with this speculation, we detected a significant and positive correlation between H3K4me3 expansion with RNA expression change of germline-specific genes. In the future, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses using dissected gonads <italic>vs</italic> somatic tissues will help to further establish this prediction.</p><p>In addition to gene regulation, the expanded H3K4me3 regions likely represent perturbed chromatin environment that could interfere with processes other than gene regulation, such as genome maintenance. In fact, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, altered H3K4 methylations have been shown to predispose mutant worms to DNA damage and genome instabilities, which result in germline defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nottke et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, inactivating UpSET in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and MLL5 in mammals also lead to increased genome instability and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tasdogan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rincon-Arano et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we observed an increased number of germ cell apoptosis in the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant (data not shown). Moreover, RNAi knockdown of <italic>mre-11</italic>, a double-strand break repair protein, synergistically aggravated the fertility defects of the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant (data not shown). These data together suggested that DNA damage and genome instability could be increased in the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant, which may contribute to their germline defects.</p><p>In summary, our findings provided new mechanistic insights into the functions of SET-9 and SET-26 with important implications for their roles in longevity and germline development. We revealed that SET-9 and SET-26 are recruited to H3K4me3 marked regions and participate in confining H3K4me3 domains, particularly in the germline. Loss of <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> in these regions likely leads to a more open and accessible chromatin environment and RNA expression change in a subset of genes. In addition, SET-26 acts in the soma to modulate longevity and it achieves this by regulating DAF-16-mediated transcription indirectly. Our findings are consistent with the possibility that human MLL5 and SETD5 represent functional homologs of SET-9 and SET-26, and the results discussed here provide new insights into how MLL5 and SETD5 may act and also implicate them in stress response and longevity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains</title><p>The N2 strain was used as the wild-type (WT).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;SET-9 and SET-26, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of human MLL5, are critical for germline development and longevity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom served as Guest Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that this current version will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but would encourage the resubmission of a significantly revised manuscript addressing the concerns of the reviewers.</p><p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;SET-9 and SET-26, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of human MLL5, are critical for germline development and longevity&quot; the authors have done some elegant work to define the overlapping and specific roles of SET-9 and SET-26 regulation of histone methylation in the context of lifespan, stress resistance, and reproduction. Although these are clearly important findings and of interest, the manuscript requires further experiments to validate the claims put forward. Of greatest concern is the confounding effects of the germline defects in the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants when comparing ChIPseq and expression profiles to wt animals. The incorporation of tissue specific studies utilizing germlineless worms and dissected gonads would provide clarity to these questions. The concern of the reviewers is that this would take longer than the 2 months afforded by the journal and may result in a story that is much different than the current version. I should note that all reviewers universally recognized the importance of this work and support a new submission of a more developed story to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Lee and colleagues present the manuscript, &quot;SET-9 and SET-26, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of human MLL5, are critical for germline development and longevity&quot; where the overlapping and unique roles of these molecules is explored. This work is an extension of a previous study, by this same group, but provide further details on SET-9 and SET-26 function. Although this study does represent the foundation toward a novel scientific advancement, the manuscript however suffers from a lack of acknowledgement of previous work (some by this group), emphasis of the new findings, and rigor to rule out pleiotropic factors that influence the interpretation of results. That being said, I believe this work could be published in <italic>eLife</italic> in a significantly revised format.</p><p>The defects in sterility were not previously associated with mutations in the <italic>set-9; set-26</italic> double mutant. This basis of this phenotype however confounds the interpretation of several of the results of this study, namely:</p><p>1) Is the loss of germ cells the direct cause of this stress resistance and longevity response? This was not thoroughly studied in the previous 2012 paper, but the data are in line with previous work that a kri-1 and daf-16-dependent response. To this end, it would be useful to place <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> in the context of other established longevity regulators.</p><p>2) The authors use heat stress a surrogate for stress resistance, in general, it would be useful to test multiple types of stressors to define the extent to which this pathway impacts survival.</p><p>3) Related to the above the function of these K9me3 binding proteins in the context of other established SET proteins is needed.</p><p>4) The loss of germ cells, in my opinion, confounds the interpretation of the ChIP and the expression analyses. With a reduction of the germline, it is not surprising that reproduction and developmental genes were identified. The gonad is one of the few tissues that can be readily extracted from the worm. Although, this is a significant undertaking, I believe that it is necessary to dissect (pun intended) the somatic and germ cell specific changes.</p><p>The authors should make use of available resources to alter the expression of these targets specifically in the germline or in the soma (expression and RNAi based). This will also help to clarify the new results from above.</p><p>The sperm-related changes are intriguing, but bring into question whether the responses observed would also manifest to the same degree in males?</p><p>Lastly, the references to MLL5 are distracting in this manuscript and not supported. Unless the authors specifically look at MLL5, which would be amazing, but not essential in my opinion, this should be removed except in the Discussion, where appropriate.</p><p>The authors are missing several controls to quantify the degree of expression changes in all strains. This should be straightforward with the reagents made.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Wang et al. studied SET-9 and SET-26, two paralogous SET-domain containing genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that were previously implicated in lifespan regulation. They characterized various aspects of the phenotypes of single and double mutants and binding profiles of the proteins, concluding that the proteins &quot;organize local chromatin environment to regulate the expression of specific target genes.&quot; The paper contains some interesting observations that are a start to understanding what SET-9 and SET-26 do, but their functions and mechanisms of action on chromatin are only vaguely described. Additionally, expression profiling and ChIP seq analyses of the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant L4 animals are flawed because the mutant germ line is morphologically very different from wild-type. I do not think that this paper is yet ready for publication.</p><p>The beginning part of the paper is generally solid. Using putative null mutants, the authors show that SET-26 alone is important for lifespan and heat stress regulation, but that SET-26 and SET-9 have a redundant function in transgenerational fertility. The mitotic germ cell pool is 3X smaller in <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants, and 50-70% of mutants are sterile from the F2 stage onward. Consistent with this, they found that SET-9 expression appears restricted to the germ line whereas SET-26 is widely expressed. They also show that the PHD finger of these proteins binds to H3K4me3 when adjacent to acetylated H3K9 or H3K14.</p><p>They then performed RNA-seq on wild-type, <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> single mutants and <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants at the L4 stage. They found genes with altered expression in the different mutant L4 strains compared to wild-type and analysed the gene sets. A major problem with this analysis is that the germ lines of <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> mutants are very small compared to wild-type and the mutants have defective gametogenesis. Since the germ line of L4s constitutes a large fraction of the animal, differences in tissue type will confound the comparisons. That is, it is impossible to distinguish gene expression differences that are due to profiling different tissues (<italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants have a lower ratio of germ line to somatic tissue and the germline tissue is morphologically different) from direct effects of <italic>set-9 / set-26</italic> loss. The ChIP-seq experiments have a similar defect. Because of this non-matching of samples, the conclusions made from these analyses are unfortunately not supported.</p><p>To control for phenotypic differences, the authors could perform RNAseq on hand picked or sorted <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutants from heterozygous mothers. ChIP would be more difficult since more material is needed, but they could consider combining with a temperature sensitive mutant lacking a germ line, so they are profiling soma in all cases. Alternatively, they could profile a stage where the germ line is not a large fraction of the animal (e.g., embryos or L1 larvae). Another option would be to concentrate studies on <italic>set-26</italic> mutants and the lifespan/stress phenotypes, as they are not sterile.</p><p>As noted by the authors, previous work showed that mutants with either increased or decreased H3K4me3 (e.g., HMTs or demethylases) have alterations in both lifespan and fertility, with a variety of germline phenotypes documented including mortal germlines and somatic trans-differentiation of the germline observed in different mutants. More analysis of the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> sterility phenotype and its relationship to these other mutants (e.g., by phenotype comparison and genetic interactions) would help to clarify their roles. Similarly, the relationship of the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> lifespan phenotype to other genes affecting lifespan would be informative.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In the paper entitled &quot;SET-9 and SET-26, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologs of human MLL5, are critical for germline development and longevity&quot; Wang W et al. examine the role of two SET domain containing homologues SET-9 and SET-26 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They generate a series of tools including knock-outs and tagged transgenic strains to decipher the individual roles of these duplicated proteins biologically, genomically, and epigenomically. They validate some of their earlier findings (using just RNAi) that <italic>set-26</italic> but not <italic>set-9</italic> regulates worm lifespan, and further find that deletion of both genes causes a severe reduction in brood size that is accompanied with smaller germlines, and display a progressive fertility decline. They use tagged transgenic strains to reproduce earlier results published from their group using an antibody, showing that SET-9 is restricted in expression to the germline while <italic>set-26</italic> is expressed in both the soma and the germline presence. They have exciting preliminary data suggesting that <italic>set-26</italic>'s function in the soma is responsible for its extended longevity. They also examine the effect on gene expression of <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> deletion as well as the genomic localization of SET-9 and SET-26. They find that SET-9 and SET-26 bind to H3K4me3 regions and advance a hypothesis that these proteins bind to H3K4me3 to prevent the spreading of H3K4me3 into other regions.</p><p>In general, I feel this is an interesting and timely study. I felt that this was a more thorough examination of the roles of SET-9 and SET-26 than their earlier work yet still think that there are some additional experiments that are needed to really nail down the role of these proteins. I feel that delving a little deeper using some <italic>C. elegans</italic> tricks to examine things in a more tissue-specific manner would really help strengthen the paper as would a little deeper molecular analysis. The authors also need to discuss their work in the context of what they had previously shown and should not ignore their own published work.</p><p>1) This group earlier reported (Ni Z et al. Aging Cell) that SET-26 was an H3K9 trimethylase. The authors need to address this discrepancy with their own work. In this same work they showed that <italic>set-26</italic> deletion had no effect on H3K4me3 levels. Therefore, saying that it was a surprising result that SET-26 was a K9 methyltransferase after they had advanced that conclusion themselves is a bit surprising itself! I think the authors conclusions that SET-26 is not a major K9 methylase in vivo are perfectly appropriate based on their ChIPseq data (although it would be good to show this at least in supplemental) but they should also discuss their own previous work better to help explain why they feel more confident in their new conclusions.</p><p>2) What genes are mis-expressed in the germline or soma of <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> mutants? Since the worm is so physically different the comparison of whole worm RNAseq is not really that informative (having a smaller germline will obviously reveal mis-expression of reproduction and development genes!). The soma and the germline can be physically dissociated and RNAseq or analysis of specific genes could be performed by qRT-PCR.</p><p>3) To compliment the result in Figure 3D it would be nice to specifically knock-down <italic>set-26</italic> in the somatic cells. This would allow more than the deductive reasoning that SET-26 functioning in the soma is required for the phenotype. This could also be complimented by knocking down <italic>set-26</italic> in germlineless worms and showing that it has a larger lifespan extension phenotype than just the elimination of the germline.</p><p>4) It seems that the authors major conclusions are that these two SET domain proteins are acting as H3K4me3 binding proteins. The progressive fertility decline is reminiscent of some of the reported fertility defects of set-2 (Robert et al., 2014). It would be interesting to perform epistasis experiments with the set-2 mutants to see if these are functioning in the same pathway.</p><p>5) A way to compliment the in vivo binding data for SET-9/SET-26 ChIPseq would be to IP and then perform mass spec on the histones which were IP'd. This would provide a nice complementation. Also it would be a way to directly assess whether the bound histones had acetylation since the modENCODE data is historically not that accurate and the stages are not directly comparable to each other (which should be mentioned in the legends).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34970.039</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Lee and colleagues present the manuscript, &quot;SET-9 and SET-26, the C. elegans homologs of human MLL5, are critical for germline development and longevity&quot; where the overlapping and unique roles of these molecules is explored.

Our data indicated that the loss of germline does not explain the stress resistance and longevity phenotypes that we observed. First, the <italic>set-26</italic> single mutant, which is reproductive and has a brood size similar to that of wild-type worms (~10% reduction in brood size, Figure 2A), exhibits significant lifespan extension and heat resistant phenotypes. Second, the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant, which has a ~30% reduced brood size in the first generation (Figure 2A), is <italic>not</italic> more resistant to heat stress and does <italic>not</italic> live longer than the <italic>set-26</italic> single mutant. Additional data detailed in the text support the model that somatic SET-26 modulates longevity, and that germline-expressed SET-26 and SET-9 collaborate to regulate germline function.</p><p>In addition, as the reviewer suggested, in our 2012 paper, we demonstrated that the lifespan extension phenotype associated with loss of <italic>set-26</italic> is largely dependent on the transcription factor DAF-16. We more clearly stated this point in the revised text. We have additionally provided new RNA-seq data to reveal the transcriptional targets that are regulated by SET-26 in a DAF-16-dependent manner (Figure 4), which are highly enriched for lifespan regulators (Figure 4). We believe these data further support the functional relationship between SET-26 and DAF-16. Additional genetic analyses of <italic>set-26</italic> in the context of other longevity genes will be interesting but is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use heat stress a surrogate for stress resistance, in general, it would be useful to test multiple types of stressors to define the extent to which this pathway impacts survival.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. The idea of testing multiple stressors is interesting but is not the major focus of this study. Our paper focuses on characterizing the roles of SET-26 and SET-9 in longevity and in germline function, and a large amount of data are presented to support our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the above the function of these K9me3 binding proteins in the context of other established SET proteins is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer meant that we should test the genetic relationships of <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic> with other genes encoding SET domain proteins. To identify chromatin regulators that may function with SET-9 and SET-26 in germline regulation, we performed a targeted RNAi screen, testing genes encoding histone methyltransferases (containing SET domains) and histone demethylases, to look for genes that either enhance or repress the moderate fertility phenotype of the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> mutant at the F1 generation. Interestingly, we found that RNAi knockdown of the components of the MLL complex, which is established to deposit H3K4me3, significantly worsen the fertility defects of the F1 <italic>set-9 set26</italic> mutant worms. Furthermore, we constructed triple mutants lacking <italic>set-9, set-26</italic>, and carrying a partial loss-of-function allele of <italic>set-2</italic>, the methyltransferase component of the MLL complex. Although the partial loss-of-function mutation of <italic>set-2</italic> does not impact fertility on its own, it greatly worsened the fertility defect of the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> F1 mutant worms (Figure 9). These results suggested that SET-2 and SET-9 and SET-26 act cooperatively to maintain germline function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The loss of germ cells, in my opinion, confounds the interpretation of the ChIP and the expression analyses. With a reduction of the germline, it is not surprising that reproduction and developmental genes were identified. The gonad is one of the few tissues that can be readily extracted from the worm. Although, this is a significant undertaking, I believe that it is necessary to dissect (pun intended) the somatic and germ cell specific changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which was echoed by reviewers 2 and 3. We have re-designed the experiments and generated completely new data to address this concern.</p><p>For expression analysis, we first performed RNA-seq using the F1 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> mutant (hand-picked homozygous mutant progeny from the heterozygous <italic>set-9(rw5) set-26(tm2467)</italic> /nT1 balanced strain), which has a mild brood size phenotype, and a visibly normal germline (Figure 2A).

They characterized various aspects of the phenotypes of single and double mutants and binding profiles of the proteins, concluding that the proteins &quot;organize local chromatin environment to regulate the expression of specific target genes.&quot; The paper contains some interesting observations that are a start to understanding what SET-9 and SET-26 do, but their functions and mechanisms of action on chromatin are only vaguely described. Additionally, expression profiling and ChIP seq analyses of the set-9 set-26 double mutant L4 animals are flawed because the mutant germ line is morphologically very different from wild-type. I do not think that this paper is yet ready for publication.</p><p>The beginning part of the paper is generally solid. Using putative null mutants, the authors show that SET-26 alone is important for lifespan and heat stress regulation, but that SET-26 and SET-9 have a redundant function in transgenerational fertility. The mitotic germ cell pool is 3X smaller in set-9 set-26 double mutants, and 50-70% of mutants are sterile from the F2 stage onward. Consistent with this, they found that SET-9 expression appears restricted to the germ line whereas SET-26 is widely expressed. They also show that the PHD finger of these proteins binds to H3K4me3 when adjacent to acetylated H3K9 or H3K14.</p><p>They then performed RNA-seq on wild-type, set-9 and set-26 single mutants and set-9 set-26 double mutants at the L4 stage. They found genes with altered expression in the different mutant L4 strains compared to wild-type and analysed the gene sets. A major problem with this analysis is that the germ lines of set-9 set-26 mutants are very small compared to wild-type and the mutants have defective gametogenesis. Since the germ line of L4s constitutes a large fraction of the animal, differences in tissue type will confound the comparisons. That is, it is impossible to distinguish gene expression differences that are due to profiling different tissues (set-9 set-26 double mutants have a lower ratio of germ line to somatic tissue and the germline tissue is morphologically different) from direct effects of set-9 / set-26 loss. The ChIP-seq experiments have a similar defect. Because of this non-matching of samples, the conclusions made from these analyses are unfortunately not supported.</p><p>To control for phenotypic differences, the authors could perform RNAseq on hand picked or sorted set-9 set-26 double mutants from heterozygous mothers. ChIP would be more difficult since more material is needed, but they could consider combining with a temperature sensitive mutant lacking a germ line, so they are profiling soma in all cases. Alternatively, they could profile a stage where the germ line is not a large fraction of the animal (e.g., embryos or L1 larvae). Another option would be to concentrate studies on set-26 mutants and the lifespan/stress phenotypes, as they are not sterile.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and suggestion, which was echoed by reviewers 1 and 3. We have re-designed the experiments and generated completely new data to address this concern.</p><p>For expression analysis, we first performed RNA-seq using the F1 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> mutant.

More analysis of the set-9 set-26 sterility phenotype and its relationship to these other mutants (e.g., by phenotype comparison and genetic interactions) would help to clarify their roles. Similarly, the relationship of the set-9 set-26 lifespan phenotype to other genes affecting lifespan would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>To identify chromatin regulators that may function with SET-9 and SET-26 in germline regulation, we performed a targeted RNAi screen, testing genes encoding histone methyltransferases (containing SET domains) and histone demethylases, to look for genes that either enhance or repress the moderate fertility phenotype of the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> mutant at the F1 generation. Interestingly, we found that RNAi knockdown of the components of the MLL complex, which is established to deposit H3K4me3, significantly worsen the fertility defects of the F1 <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> mutant worms. Furthermore, we constructed triple mutants lacking <italic>set-9, set-26</italic>, and carrying a partial loss-of-function allele of <italic>set-2</italic>, the methyltransferase component of the MLL complex. Although the partial loss-of-function mutation of <italic>set-2</italic> does not impact fertility on its own, it greatly worsened the fertility defect of the <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> F1 mutant worms. These results suggested that SET-2 and SET-9 and SET-26 act cooperatively to maintain germline function.</p><p>Moreover, in our 2012 paper, we demonstrated that the lifespan extension phenotype associated with loss of <italic>set-26</italic> is largely dependent on the transcription factor DAF-16. We more clearly stated this point in the revised text. We have additionally provided new RNA-seq data to reveal the transcriptional targets that are regulated by SET-26 in a DAF-16-dependent manner (Figure 4), which are highly enriched for lifespan regulators (Figure 4). We believe these data further establish the functional relationship between SET-26 and DAF-16. Additional genetic analyses of <italic>set-26</italic> in the context of other longevity genes will be interesting but is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the paper entitled &quot;SET-9 and SET-26, the C. elegans homologs of human MLL5, are critical for germline development and longevity&quot; Wang W et al. examine the role of two SET domain containing homologues SET-9 and SET-26 in C. elegans. They generate a series of tools including knock-outs and tagged transgenic strains to decipher the individual roles of these duplicated proteins biologically, genomically, and epigenomically. They validate some of their earlier findings (using just RNAi) that set-26 but not set-9 regulates worm lifespan, and further find that deletion of both genes causes a severe reduction in brood size that is accompanied with smaller germlines, and display a progressive fertility decline. They use tagged transgenic strains to reproduce earlier results published from their group using an antibody, showing that SET-9 is restricted in expression to the germline while set-26 is expressed in both the soma and the germline presence. They have exciting preliminary data suggesting that set-26's function in the soma is responsible for its extended longevity. They also examine the effect on gene expression of set-9 and set-26 deletion as well as the genomic localization of SET-9 and SET-26. They find that SET-9 and SET-26 bind to H3K4me3 regions and advance a hypothesis that these proteins bind to H3K4me3 to prevent the spreading of H3K4me3 into other regions.</p><p>In general, I feel this is an interesting and timely study. I felt that this was a more thorough examination of the roles of SET-9 and SET-26 than their earlier work yet still think that there are some additional experiments that are needed to really nail down the role of these proteins. I feel that delving a little deeper using some C. elegans tricks to examine things in a more tissue-specific manner would really help strengthen the paper as would a little deeper molecular analysis. The authors also need to discuss their work in the context of what they had previously shown and should not ignore their own published work.</p><p>1) This group earlier reported (Ni Z et al. Aging Cell) that SET-26 was an H3K9 trimethylase. The authors need to address this discrepancy with their own work. In this same work they showed that set-26 deletion had no effect on H3K4me3 levels. Therefore, saying that it was a surprising result that SET-26 was a K9 methyltransferase after they had advanced that conclusion themselves is a bit surprising itself! I think the authors conclusions that SET-26 is not a major K9 methylase in vivo are perfectly appropriate based on their ChIPseq data (although it would be good to show this at least in supplemental) but they should also discuss their own previous work better to help explain why they feel more confident in their new conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and we would like to clarify our previous findings in more details. In our Ni et al. paper (2012), we monitored the total levels of four histone modifications, H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 at young and old time points in germlineless <italic>glp-1</italic> mutant with or without <italic>set-26</italic>. There, we observed that normalized H3K4me3 levels were not impacted by the loss of <italic>set-26</italic>. For the repressive marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, we observed that their normalized levels drastically reduce with aging in the <italic>glp-1</italic> single mutant, but their levels remained largely stable in the <italic>glp-1; set-26</italic> double mutants. The data suggested that loss of <italic>set-26</italic> somehow prevented the age-dependent reduction of these repressive marks in the soma. These data alone did not indicate that SET-26 is the enzyme responsible for depositing either of the repressive marks. Indeed, in our Ni et al. paper (pg. 316, 323), we speculated that SET-9 and SET-26 likely do NOT have methytransferase activity, based on changed amino acids in critical residues known to be required for SET domain enzymatic activity, and also that their putative homologs MLL5 (in mammals) and Upset (in flies) are suggested to lack methyltransferase activity.</p><p>Subsequent to our Ni et al. 2012 paper, Greer et al. (2014) reported that the SET domain of SET-26 contains in vitro methyltransferase activity and is able to methylate H3K9me3. This was a surprising result to us, and that is why we investigated both the total levels and the genome-wide profiles of H3K9me3 in wild-type and <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant worms in this study. We did not observe any differences in the levels or genome-wide distribution of H3K9me3 in worms with or without <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic>.</p><p>In the case of H3K4me3, we first examined the total levels and the genome-wide profiles in whole worms of wild-type and <italic>set-9 set-26</italic> double mutant. We observed elevated levels and expanded marking of H3K4me3, which appeared to be more noticeable in the germline. We further compared the genome-wide profiles of H3K4me3 in the germlineless <italic>glp-1</italic> background with or without <italic>set-26</italic> using ChIP-seq. Consistent with our previous results, we observed no significant changes in the genome-wide pattern of H3K4me3 in the <italic>set-26; glp-1</italic> double mutant compared with <italic>glp-1</italic>. Together, the data suggested that, loss of <italic>set-9</italic> and <italic>set-26</italic>, results in expansion of H3K4me3 marking surrounding regions normally bound by SET-9 and SET-26 only in the germ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What genes are mis-expressed in the germline or soma of set-9 and set-26 mutants? Since the worm is so physically different the comparison of whole worm RNAseq is not really that informative (having a smaller germline will obviously reveal mis-expression of reproduction and development genes!). The soma and the germline can be physically dissociated and RNAseq or analysis of specific genes could be performed by qRT-PCR.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, which was echoed by reviewers 1 and 2.
