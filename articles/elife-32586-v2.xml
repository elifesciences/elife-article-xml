pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32586.001</object-id><p>Specific cell shapes are fundamental to the organization and function of multicellular organisms. Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling induces the elongation of lens fiber cells during vertebrate lens development. Nonetheless, exactly how this extracellular FGF signal is transmitted to the cytoskeletal network has previously not been determined. Here, we show that the Crk family of adaptor proteins, Crk and Crkl, are required for mouse lens morphogenesis but not differentiation. Genetic ablation and epistasis experiments demonstrated that <italic>Crk</italic> and <italic>Crkl</italic> play overlapping roles downstream of FGF signaling in order to regulate lens fiber cell elongation. Upon FGF stimulation, Crk proteins were found to interact with Frs2, Shp2 and Grb2. The loss of Crk proteins was partially compensated for by the activation of Ras and Rac signaling. These results reveal that Crk proteins are important partners of the Frs2/Shp2/Grb2 complex in mediating FGF signaling, specifically promoting cell shape changes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32586.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As an embryo develops, its cells divide multiple times to transform into the specialized cell types that form our tissues and organs. To carry out specific roles, cells need to be of a certain shape. For example, in mammals, the cells that make up the main portion of the eye lens, develop into a fiber-like shape to be perfectly aligned with each other. This enables them to transmit light to the retina at the rear end of the eye. To do so, the lens cells increase over 1000 times in length with the help of a group of proteins called the Fibroblast Growth Factor, or FGF for short.</p><p>The FGF pathway includes a network of interacting proteins that transmit signals to molecules inside the lens cells to control how they specialize and grow. However, until now it was not clear how it does this. Here, Zhang et al. used mouse lens-cells grown in the laboratory to investigate how FGF signaling causes cells to change their structure. The experiments revealed two related proteins called Crk and Crkl that linked the FGF pathway with another signaling system. When these two proteins were removed from the lens cells, the lens cells were still able to specialize, but could no longer grow in length. This suggests that these two processes are independent of each other.</p><p>Moreover, Crk and Crkl helped the cells to change shape by increasing the amount of another group of proteins called Ras, which are known to both help cells to specialize and to regulate their shape. Zhang et al. discovered that the amount of Ras proteins determined whether cells specialized or modified their shape by changing the organization of proteins in the cell.</p><p>Millions of children are born with cataracts, a disease caused when lens cells fail to shape properly. A better knowledge of FGF signaling may help to understand how cataracts develop and inspire future treatments. Moreover, the pathways identified in this study could also apply to other organs and diseases in which FGF signaling is active.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>FGF</kwd><kwd>Frs2</kwd><kwd>Shp2</kwd><kwd>Grb2</kwd><kwd>Ras</kwd><kwd>cell shape</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY017061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Tamica N</given-names></name><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Yingyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Hongge</given-names></name><name><surname>Hong</surname><given-names>Angela</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5P30EY019007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Jules and Doris Stein professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Crk proteins are critical mediators of FGF signaling to control cell shape changes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the development of complex multicellular organisms, changes in epithelial cell morphology are essential for the tissue-specific cell differentiation patterning that leads to the subsequent formation of functional organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Settleman and Baum, 2008</xref>). This is particularly clear when considering the formation of the ocular lens, which has served as a model system to delineate many developmental pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cvekl and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gunhaga, 2011</xref>). The development of the mouse lens begins at embryonic day 9.5 when the optic vesicle extends toward the presumptive lens ectoderm, inducing the latter to thicken into a cuboidal layer of epithelial cells commonly referred to as the lens placode. At E10.5, the cells making up the lens placode undergo apical constriction to form the lens pit, which eventually closes at its anterior surface to form the lens vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chauhan et al., 2011</xref>). After the newly differentiated primary fiber cells extend anteriorly from the posterior region of the lens vesicle, the anterior epithelial cells begin to migrate posteriorly towards the equatorial region of the lens, at which point they begin to differentiate into secondary fiber cells that continue to occupy the space within the lens interior. This process is accompanied by up to a 1000-fold increase in the length of the newly formed secondary fiber cells, which coordinate with the primary fiber cells to organize an elegant concave pattern that maintains the structural integrity and transparency of the mature lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassnett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McAvoy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sue Menko, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Previously proposed models that have been considered for the mechanism by which lens fiber cells elongate consist of microtubule reorganization, increased cell volume and actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Audette et al., 2017</xref>). Microtubules are prominent components of the cytoskeleton lining the plasma membrane of lens fiber cells. They are oriented longitudinally along the lens with their minus end towards the anterior pole and their plus ends facing the posterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Byers and Porter, 1964</xref>). which is consistent with the presence of microtubule organizing centers at the apical ends of lens fiber cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lo et al., 2003</xref>). However, Beebe et al reported that Nocodazole inhibition of microtubule polymerization failed to disrupt fiber cell elongation in chick lens explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beebe et al., 1979</xref>). Instead, they proposed that the expansion of cell volume was the key mechanism by which fiber cells elongated to form the functional mature lens. However, utilizing precise measurement techniques, it was later found that there was no apparent increase in lens volume in vivo at the onset of fiber cell elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassnett, 2005</xref>). The differentiation of lens epithelial cells into lens fiber cells is also associated with the assembly of actin filaments beneath the cortical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weber and Menko, 2006</xref>). When this cortical actin structure was inhibited by cytochalasin D in lens explants, both the differentiation and elongation of lens cells were blocked. Nevertheless, neither the disruption of the cell adhesion molecules N-cadherin or β1-integrin nor the ablation of the actin regulators Rac1 and Rho completely prevented the lengthening of lens fiber cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Logan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maddala et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pathania et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pontoriero et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, how the actin cytoskeleton is controlled during fiber cell elongation has remained an open question.</p><p>Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) signaling is known to play an important role in lens cell differentiation and elongation. Transgenic expression of human FGF-1 using an αA-crystallin promoter was found to induce lens epithelial cells to acquire elongated shapes and fiber cell characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robinson et al., 1995</xref>). In explant cultures, FGF was also found to promote lens fiber cell differentiation and elongation in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lovicu and McAvoy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McAvoy and Chamberlain, 1989</xref>). Conversely, genetic ablation of FGF receptors leads to a complete loss of lens cell differentiation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Several proteins have been implicated in the direct engagement with these active FGF receptors, including Frs2/3, Grb14, Shb, PLCγ and Crk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klint and Claesson-Welsh, 1999</xref>). Of particular interests are Crk and the related protein Crkl, which are mammalian homologs of the viral <italic>Crk</italic> oncogene that prossess the ability to promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feller, 2001</xref>). Lacking intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, the Crk family of proteins act as adaptors that transduce signals from upstream phosphotyrosine-containing proteins to downstream SH3-interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birge et al., 2009</xref>). Biochemical studies have shown that FGF2-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation is dependent on the binding of Crk to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue 463 in FGFR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larsson et al., 1999</xref>). In line with this finding, <italic>Crk</italic> null mice display some of the cardiovascular and cranial features of Noonan syndrome, which is caused by aberrant Ras-MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schubbert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tartaglia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tartaglia et al., 2007</xref>). Crkl was also identified as a component of an FGF8-induced feed forward loop, resulting in anchorage-independent cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seo et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with this, the human <italic>CRKL</italic> gene lies within the chromosome 22q11 deletion region that causes DiGeorge syndrome, which shares the pharyngeal and cardiac defects seen in <italic>Fgf8</italic>-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moon et al., 2006</xref>). Despite these findings implicating Crk and Crkl in FGF signaling, a recent study has shown that mutating their putative Y463 binding site in Fgfr1 did not produce any observable phenotype in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brewer et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the potential role and mechanism of Crk proteins in FGF signaling remain uncertain.</p><p>In this study, we showed that the lens specific knockout of <italic>Crk</italic> and <italic>Crkl</italic> disrupted lens fiber cell elongation without affecting differentiation, suggesting that lens cell morphogenesis can be uncoupled from differentiation during development. FGF loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrated that Crk proteins act downstream of FGF signaling to enhance ERK phosphorylation. Contrary to the previous belief that Crk proteins directly bind to the Fgfr, we found that mutating the purported Crk docking site on Fgfr1 failed to perturb lens development or Crk phosphorylation. Instead, our data showed that Crkl was recruited to the Frs2/Shp2/Grb2 complex after FGF stimulation. Crk/Crkl deficient animals phenocopied Rac1 but not Rap1 mutants, and activation of Rac1 and Ras signaling partially reversed the observed lens elongation defects caused by the deletion of Crk and Crkl. These results show that the Crk family of adaptor proteins are essential partners of the Frs2/Shp2/Grb2 complex that forms during FGF signaling, and are specifically required for stimulating the actin reorganization that is necessary for the morphological shaping of lens cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ablation of Crk and Crkl caused lens defects</title><p>We observed that Crk and Crkl proteins displayed a restricted localization pattern in the lens. At E10.5, Crk and Crkl were predominantly confined to the apical side of the lens vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrows), away from the basal side where integrins interact with the basement membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, dotted lines). By contrast, Crk and Crkl exhibited a more diffuse pattern at E12.5 when the posterior lens vesicle cells gave rise to the primary lens fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, by E14.5, Crk and Crkl were specifically enriched in the transitional zone where the lens epithelial cells begin to differentiate and elongate into the secondary lens fiber cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrowheads). Using an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated forms of both of these proteins, we were able to observe that the phosphorylation of Crk and Crkl also mainly occurs in the transition zone of the lens at this stage of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, arrowheads). These results suggest that Crk activity is under dynamic regulation as the lens cells undergo successive morphological changes during development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32586.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crk and Crkl are essential for lens development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crk and Crkl immunostaining were localized to the invaginating lens vesicle at E10.5 (arrows) and to the elongating lens fiber cells near the transitional zone of the lens at E14.5 (arrowheads). These staining patterns were specifically lost in the CrkCKO lens.

Although the mutant lens cells still expressed Pax6, the lens specific marker αA-crystallin was not induced. Importantly, whereas the control embryos displayed the phosphorylation of Erk and Crk in the invaginating lens vesicle, these staining patterns were absent in FgfrCKO lens cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Although we have shown above that genetic inactivation of Fgfr1 and Fgfr2 together was sufficient to abrogate FGF signaling in MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), FGF was still able to induce phosphorylation of Crk/Crkl and Erk in <italic>Fgfr1<sup>CRK</sup></italic> MEF cells after the deletion of <italic>Fgfr2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Frs2 is a myristylated protein located at the plasma membrane that binds to Fgf receptors specifically at a juxtamembrane site. With multiple tyrosine residues phosphorylated by activated Fgf receptors, Frs2 acts as a nexus of FGF signaling by presenting easily accessible docking sites for the phosphotyrosine-binding proteins Shp2 and Grb2, which in turn activate Ras-MAPK signaling. Taking advantage of a mutant <italic>Fgfr1</italic> allele (<italic>Fgfr1<sup>ΔFrs</sup></italic>) that lacks the Frs2 binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoch and Soriano, 2006</xref>), we showed that formation of the lens vesicle was indeed disrupted in <italic>Pax6<sup>Le</sup>-Cre;Fgfr1<sup>flox/ΔFrs</sup>;Fgfr2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which resembled the phenotype of FgfrCKO null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Consistent with this, both CrkCKO and Shp2CKO embryos at E12.5 continued to display residual levels of pErk staining in the lens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Taken together, these results argue against the Rap1 family of proteins being downstream targets of Crk signaling during lens development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Activation of ras signaling ameliorated lens fiber cell elongation defects present in the <italic>Crk</italic> mutant</title><p>The above experiments showed that a constitutively active form of Rac1 resulted in only modest attenuation of the lens fiber cell elongation defects seen in the CrkCKO mutant, suggesting that there exist additional downstream effectors of the Crk proteins that are important in regulating fiber cell shape. As we have observed a significant downregulation of pErk in the CrkCKO mutant lens, one potential candidate is the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway. We subsequently crossed the CrkCKO mutant with a <italic>Kras<sup>LSL-G12D</sup></italic> mouse, which harbors a Cre-inducible allele of the oncogenic G12D mutated <italic>Kras</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tuveson et al., 2004</xref>). Because this mutant is expressed from the endogenous <italic>Kras</italic> locus, it is expected to activate Ras signaling at a normal physiological level as opposed to being overexpressed.

Importantly, the length of the lens fiber cells in the CrkCKO;<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> lens increased to about 90% of that of the control lens, demonstrating that the activation of Ras signaling can largely rescue the fiber elongation defects caused by the loss of Crk proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M–P</xref>). This result provides strong genetic evidence that Ras signaling plays an essential role in Crk-mediated lens cell shape changes.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32586.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Constitutive Kras signaling can compensate for the loss of Crk and Crkl in lens development.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Despite the loss of Crk and Crkl, Erk phosphorylation was partially recovered in CrkCKO;<italic>Kras<sup>G12D</sup></italic> lenses.

This makes it an excellent model for studying the cell signaling pathways involved in these morphological processes. Although FGF signaling is known to regulate both lens fiber cell differentiation and elongation, it is unclear whether these two functions can be separated at the mechanistic level. In this study, we successfully showed that the Crk family of adaptor proteins specifically mediate FGF signaling in the control of lens cell shape but not differentiation. Contrary to previous claims, we demonstrated that the putative Crk binding site on Fgfr1 is dispensable. Rather, the recruitment of Crk proteins to the Frs2-Shp2-Grb2 complex via the Frs2 docking site on Fgf receptors was observed. Our study further showed that the downstream Crk effectors involved in regulating the precise cytoarchitecture of the lens are primarily Ras and to a lesser extent Rac1, but not Rap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7Q</xref>). These results identify Crk proteins as the essential adapters that link FGF signaling to cytoskeletal dynamics.</p><p>This study also demonstrated that Crk and Crkl play essential overlapping functions in embryonic lens development. Whereas lack of either Crk or Crkl did not disrupt lens development in the mouse embryos, combined deletion of Crk and Crkl led to a profound defect in lens fiber cell elongation. There is a substantial overlap between Crk and Crkl in many biological functions including the Reelin pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park and Curran, 2008</xref>), neuromuscular synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hallock et al., 2010</xref>), migration of T cells to sites of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2015</xref>) and podocyte morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">George et al., 2014</xref>). These studies and ours confirm that single and double floxed mice for Crk and Crkl are crucial models for investigating the distinct and overlapping biological functions of these closely related proteins.</p><p>Crk and Crkl are versatile adaptor proteins that can interact with a wide spectrum of signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birge et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies have shown that they can be recruited by molecular scaffolds such as Dab1 to transmit Reelin signaling or p130Cas and paxillin to participate in integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nojima et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petit et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sekine et al., 2012</xref>). Following growth factor stimulation, Crk and Crkl are also known to bind directly to several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) via their SH2 domains and become rapidly phosphorylated at their specifically targeted tyrosine residues (Y221 in Crk and Y207 in Crkl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoku and Mayer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feller et al., 1994</xref>). Upon ligand stimulation, FGF receptors undergo autophosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues, which serve as docking sites for downstream signaling proteins. Previous studies have suggested that Crk and Crkl can recognize a conserved phosphotyrosine residue in FGFRs (pY463 in FGFR1 and pY466 in FGFR2) through their SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larsson et al., 1999</xref>). By examining the Y463F mutant of Fgfr1 both in vitro and in vivo, we showed that this site was dispensable for FGF signaling with regards to the activation of Crk proteins. By contrast, we showed that Crk proteins interact with Frs2 and Shp2 proteins, and that their loss prevents FGF-induced Crk phosphorylation. This is reminiscent of Frs2’s function in response to nerve growth factor (NGF) to assemble a complex containing Crk, C3G, Rap1 and Braf in order to prolong MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kao et al., 2001</xref>). Interestingly, in that case, the binding of Crk requires the Shp2-docking site on Frs2. We have also identified Grb2 as yet another interacting partner of Crkl and showed that Grb2 was required for FGF-induced phosphorylation of Crk and Crkl. Since both Frs2 and Shp2 interact with Grb2, we would like to suggest that the assembly of the entire Frs2-Shp2-Grb2 complex is necessary for the recruitment of the Crk family of adaptor proteins to Fgf receptors.</p><p>C3G, Sos and Dock1 were the first three GEFs identified to be directly associated with the SH3 domains of Crk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasegawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oda et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanaka et al., 1994</xref>). While Sos is primarily involved in the activation of Ras-MAPK signaling, C3G and Dock1 promote the exchange of GDP for GTP in the small GTPases Rap1 and Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Birge et al., 2009</xref>). These active GTP-bound proteins subsequently regulate integrin signaling and actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gloerich and Bos, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ridley, 2011</xref>). We showed that the <italic>Crk</italic> knockout did not recapitulate the <italic>Rap1</italic> mutant lens phenotype, ruling out Rap1 as a critical downstream effector of Crk proteins. Instead, activation of Rac1 and, more importantly, Ras effectively rescued the lens fiber elongation defect seen in <italic>Crk</italic> mutants. In addition to these results further clarifying the downstream targets of Crk in lens development, they also raise an interesting question regarding the nature of Ras signaling in this process. Previous studies have shown that the Frs2/Shp2 mediated Ras-MAPK pathway acts downstream of FGF signaling to regulate lens fiber cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Madakashira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Upadhya et al., 2013</xref>), but in this study, our genetic evidence demonstrated that the Crk-mediated Ras signaling pathway only promoted fiber cell elongation and not differentiation. The uncoupling of lens fiber cell differentiation and elongation have been previously observed in lens explants, where pharmacological inhibition of ERK suppressed the morphological changes induced by FGF signaling while not preventing the expression of differentiation markers such as β-crystallin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lovicu and McAvoy, 2001</xref>). We propose that these results reveal a biphasic function of Ras signaling, which promotes either differentiation or elongation of lens cells in a dosage dependent manner. In this model, Ras signaling induced directly by the Frs2/Shp2/Grb2 complex is sufficient to stimulate cell differentiation, with the additional elevation of Ras activity potentiated by the binding of Crk proteins to the signaling complex resulting in the necessary promotion of cell shape changes. In support of this idea, we note that the loss of Crk proteins did not completely squelch Ras-MAPK signaling, allowing cell differentiation to proceed in <italic>Crk</italic> mutant lenses. Therefore, in response to heightened FGF signaling, Crk proteins act as additional boosters to Ras activity that results in the specific promotion of cell shape changes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Lens capsules were torn open from the posterior before the lens epithelium was peeled off with forceps and pinned down onto a cell culture dish. To delete Crk and Crkl in the lens explants, 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> adenoviruses expressing Cre recombinase (Ad5CMVCre-eGFP, Cat #: VVC-U of Iowa-1174, Gene Transfer Vector Core, University of Iowa, IA) were added to the culture of 4 explants for 8 hr one day after explant isolation. GFP-expressing adenoviruses (Ad5CMVeGFP, Cat #: VVC-U of Iowa-4) were used as a control.

Both the treatment group and control were lysed with 1 ml immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5% glycerol) supplemented with Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (ThermoFisher). Lysates were then incubated with streptavidin resins (240207, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) to pull down TAP-Crkl, according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Resins were later washed in streptavidin binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl) twice at 4°C. All pulled-down proteins were eluted in 1X Laemmli SDS sample buffer (1.5% SDS, 9% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.00025% Bromophenol blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol).

the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Crk proteins transduce FGF signaling to promote lens fiber cell elongation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Mark Lewandoski (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers thought that your manuscript utilizes sophisticated genetics and biochemistry to reveal the components and interactions downstream of FGF signaling during the morphogenesis of the mouse lens. They felt that your work has important implications for how molecular signaling controls cell shape. Furthermore, the experiments were described as well executed and the findings as very interesting. The reviewers describe concerns that should be addressed before publication as detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There were concerns that &quot;Le-Cre only mice were used as controls.&quot; It is important to have Le-Cre in the controls, because Le-Cre itself can have an effect on eye development (PLoS One. 2014 Oct 1;9(10):e109193). But it is also important that littermates are used as controls to rule out differences due to genetic background affecting phenotypes (and the Le-Cre alone effect is background dependent!). This is a big problem as the authors would have to repeat a lot of experiments. Short of doing that work, perhaps the authors can argue that there was little or no variation in phenotypes? Thus the authors should mention how many samples were examined (hopefully at least three) and mention somewhere what variation was observed. It might also help to include a table listing all the genetic crosses, with parental genotypes and the important experimental progeny.</p><p>2) Some other histological phenotypes in the Crk/L-cKO mutants are not adequately described. For example, the lens epithelial layer appears missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, J, L, N, P</xref>). Also, there is an abnormal optic cub protrusion posterior to the lens vesicle in Crk/L-cKO mutants. The authors need to describe these phenotypes in more detail, and explain how these phenotypes are affected in other mutant backgrounds. If the lens epithelium is indeed disrupted, could this phenotype affect the maintenance of the polarity of primary fibers and the generation of secondary lens fibers? Also, given the lens-specific deletion of Crk/L, why does the mutation cause the abnormality in the optic cup?</p><p>3) The authors emphasize the co-expression of the pCrk/L and pERK in the transitional zone, where proliferation and differentiation of secondary lens fibers occurs, at E14.5. However, the Crk/L-cKO lens phenotype appears between E10.5 and E12.5. The authors should compare the pCrk/L and pER expression at these earlier stages to strengthen their argument.</p><p>4). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, it appears that the loss of Crk/L mainly affects the substantiation of pERK after FGF2 treatment. Quantification of the western blotting should be very informative here. It would be interesting that Crk/L modify the quantity of FGF-ERK signaling by prolonging ERK activation.</p><p>5) &quot;Despite the severe morphological defects, Prox1, Pax6 and multiple forms of crystallin (α,β,γ) were expressed without delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-N</xref>).&quot; The provided data do not demonstrate the normal onset of Pax6. The authors need to modify the statement or provide additional data to support the statement. Also, authors should indicate that the Pax6+ lens epithelium is greatly reduced and shifted to the ventral position in the mutant.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, the authors should provide quantitative data to demonstrate the partial rescue of the Crk/L-cKO phenotype by Rac1-ca.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6U</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, are post hoc tests used to confirm where the difference occurs between groups after a statistically significant one-way ANOVA test?</p><p>8) In the Abstract, the authors claim that Crk proteins are recruited to the Frs2/Sjp2/Grb2 signaling complex upon FGF signaling. The author should tone down that assertion because there is no direct evidence that Grb2 is a part of the complex.</p><p>9) In both Introduction and Discussion, many statements referring to published findings lack references. The authors need to revise these sections and add proper citations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32586.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There were concerns that &quot;Le-Cre only mice were used as controls.&quot; It is important to have Le-Cre in the controls, because Le-Cre itself can have an effect on eye development (PLoS One. 2014 Oct 1;9(10):e109193).

As described in the revised Materials and methods section, we believe such controls are justified because we did not observe any phenotypic differences between Le-Cre and Le-Cre;Crkflox/+;CrkLflox/+ mice in our mixed genetic background. Moreover, lens development was consistent and reproducible among these controls as shown by the modest variations in our quantifications (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>, for example). The revised Materials and methods section now includes a table of all the genetic crosses and confirms that at least three animals are examined for each genotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some other histological phenotypes in the Crk/L-cKO mutants are not adequately described. For example, the lens epithelial layer appears missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, J, L, N, P</xref>). Also, there is an abnormal optic cub protrusion posterior to the lens vesicle in Crk/L-cKO mutants. The authors need to describe these phenotypes in more detail, and explain how these phenotypes are affected in other mutant backgrounds. If the lens epithelium is indeed disrupted, could this phenotype affect the maintenance of the polarity of primary fibers and the generation of secondary lens fibers? Also, given the lens-specific deletion of Crk/L, why does the mutation cause the abnormality in the optic cup?</p></disp-quote><p>We highlight <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to show that the lens epithelial layer is diminished but not missing in Crk/L-cKO mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, arrowheads). Using apical marker Zo-1 and basal marker β1 integrin, we now show that the polarity of the lens fiber cells is also maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We also cited earlier work that show the disruption of lens development can lead to disorganization of the retina, which we believe explains the protrusion/abnormality of the optic cup in Crk/L-cKO mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors emphasize the co-expression of the pCrk/L and pERK in the transitional zone, where proliferation and differentiation of secondary lens fibers occurs, at E14.5. However, the Crk/L-cKO lens phenotype appears between E10.5 and E12.5. The authors should compare the pCrk/L and pER expression at these earlier stages to strengthen their argument.</p></disp-quote><p>The pCrk/L and pERK expressions at E12.5 are now added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, it appears that the loss of Crk/L mainly affects the substantiation of pERK after FGF2 treatment. Quantification of the western blotting should be very informative here. It would be interesting that Crk/L modify the quantity of FGF-ERK signaling by prolonging ERK activation.</p></disp-quote><p>Good advice. We have quantified the western blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, which indeed showed that depletion of Crk/L reduced both the intensity and duration of FGF-ERK signaling. This interesting observation is now described in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;Despite the severe morphological defects, Prox1, Pax6 and multiple forms of crystallin (α,β,γ) were expressed without delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-N</xref>).&quot; The provided data do not demonstrate the normal onset of Pax6. The authors need to modify the statement or provide additional data to support the statement. Also, authors should indicate that the Pax6+ lens epithelium is greatly reduced and shifted to the ventral position in the mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. This sentence is revised to only state that these lens markers are still expressed in the Crk/L-cKO mutant lens and it is noted that the lens epithelium is diminished and rotated ventrally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, the authors should provide quantitative data to demonstrate the partial rescue of the Crk/L-cKO phenotype by Rac1-ca.</p></disp-quote><p>The quantification is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6U</xref> (the last two columns).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6U</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, are post hoc tests used to confirm where the difference occurs between groups after a statistically significant one-way ANOVA test?</p></disp-quote><p>As now described in the figure legends, Tukey's multiple comparisons test was used after one-way ANOVA test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the Abstract, the authors claim that Crk proteins are recruited to the Frs2/Sjp2/Grb2 signaling complex upon FGF signaling. The author should tone down that assertion because there is no direct evidence that Grb2 is a part of the complex.</p></disp-quote><p>Agree. The modified sentence now only note that Crk proteins interact with Grb2 upon FGF signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In both Introduction and Discussion, many statements referring to published findings lack references. The authors need to revise these sections and add proper citations.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the oversight and added additional references as we have originally intended to.</p></body></sub-article></article>
