Several mechanisms regulate the centromeric deposition of CENP-A as its mislocalization causes erroneous chromosome segregation, leading to aneuploidy-based diseases, including cancers. The most crucial deposition factor is a CENP-A specific chaperone, HJURP (Scm3 in budding yeast), which specifically binds to CENP-A. However, the discovery of HJURP as a DDR (DNA damage repair) protein and evidence of its binding to Holliday junctions in vitro indicate a CENP-A-deposition-independent role of these chaperones. In this study, using budding yeast, we demonstrate that Scm3 is crucial for the DDR pathway as Scm3-depleted cells are sensitive to DNA damage. We further observe that Scm3 depletion genetically interacts with the <italic>rad52</italic> DDR mutant and is compromised in activating DDR-mediated arrest. We demonstrate that Scm3 associates with DNA damage sites and undergoes posttranslational modifications upon DNA damage. Overall, from this report and earlier studies on HJURP, we conclude that DDR functions of CENP-A chaperones are conserved across eukaryotes. The revelation that these chaperones promote genome stability in more than one pathway has clinical significance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Scm3</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>chromosome</kwd><kwd>HJURP</kwd><kwd>centromere</kwd><kwd>budding yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/028vaas30</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/PR43050/BRB/10/1992/2021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghosh</surname><given-names>Santanu K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/021wm7p51</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09/087 (0972)/2019- EMR-I</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agarwal</surname><given-names>Prakhar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0101xrq71</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IF230484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alekar</surname><given-names>Anushka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/021wm7p51</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09/0087 (17614)/2024-EMR-I</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mallick</surname><given-names>Shubhomita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02qyf5152</institution-id><institution>Indian Institute of Technology Bombay</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harini</surname><given-names>Kannan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and biochemical assays reveal the role of Scm3 in genome stability by regulating the DNA damage checkpoint pathway in budding yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The faithful replication and partitioning of the replicated chromatin as chromosomal units from mother to daughter cell is important for cell survival. New nucleosomes are assembled on DNA during replication, which requires the deposition of histones in a highly regulated step-by-step process that involves the deposition of an (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer followed by two H2A-H2B dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hammond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ransom et al., 2010</xref>). The deposition of histones is assisted by a group of proteins called histone chaperones. These chaperones physically interact with the histones in a pre-nucleosomal complex and thus prevent premature histone-DNA interaction or nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess and Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ransom et al., 2010</xref>). The deposition of the canonical histones occurs mainly during DNA replication via a replication-coupled (RC) pathway using chaperones dedicated to the RC pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Serra-Cardona and Zhang, 2018</xref>). For instance, Asf1 and CAF-1 deposit (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess and Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Koning et al., 2007</xref>) and Nap1 facilitates (H2A-H2B)<sub>2</sub> deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Koning et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Eitoku et al., 2008</xref>) into nucleosomes. On the other hand, variant histones that earmark specialized chromatin domains are deposited at specific sites throughout the cell cycle using the replication-independent (RI) pathway using variant-specific chaperones dedicated to the RI pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Smith, 2002</xref>). For instance, deposition of the variant histones H2A.Z, CENP-A, and MacroH2A, important in transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gerton et al., 2000</xref>), kinetochore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Earnshaw and Tomkiel, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McKinley and Cheeseman, 2016</xref>) and X chromosome inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sun and Bernstein, 2019</xref>), occurs via chromatin remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fan et al., 2022</xref>), the HJURP chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dunleavy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Foltz et al., 2009</xref>), and acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32B (ANP32B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mandemaker et al., 2023</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Almost all eukaryotes harbor CENP-A at centromeres, which promotes the formation of kinetochores at those loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blower and Karpen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchwitz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Howman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stoler et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Van Hooser et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985</xref>). In metazoans, HJURP (Holliday junction recognition protein) is the cognate chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dunleavy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foltz et al., 2006</xref>) of CENP-A. The CENP-A binding domain at the N-terminus of HJURP is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aravind et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sanchez-Pulido et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shuaib et al., 2010</xref>). Despite the well-established function of HJURP in CENP-A deposition at centromeres, HJURP was initially identified as a protein involved in the DNA damage response (DDR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>). HJURP was so named because of its ability to bind in vitro to Holliday junction DNA substrates generated in vivo during DNA damage repair through homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>). HJURP was found to interact physically with the DNA damage sensing complex MRN (Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1), and the interaction was found to increase significantly upon induction of double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>). As a corollary, the level and subcellular localization of HJURP change in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing radiation (IR), hydroxyurea (HU), cisplatin, and camptothecin (CPT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, the expression of HJURP was found to be regulated by ATM, a DDR kinase, as no protein expression was observed in ATM-deficient cancerous cell lines. Notably, HJURP has been found to be diffusely present throughout the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dunleavy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>), in agreement with its involvement in DDR.</p><p>Given the functions of HJURP in CENP-A deposition and DDR pathway, it is not surprising that misregulation of HJURP is involved in disease states. HJURP is considered an oncogene as its overexpression has been associated with cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kang et al., 2020</xref>) including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coates et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Montes de Oca et al., 2015</xref>), lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>), ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dou et al., 2022</xref>), glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Valente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Valente et al., 2009</xref>), hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luo et al., 2022</xref>), colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kang et al., 2020</xref>), and pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, the inhibition of HJURP attenuates the cancer cells' properties and increases the survival rate of patients, and thus, HJURP acts as a prognostic marker for several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lai et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In budding yeast, Cse4 and Scm3 are the homologs of CENP-A and HJURP, respectively. Scm3 deposits Cse4 at centromeres during S phase through its physical interaction with Ndc10, which binds to centromeric DNA as part of the CBF3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camahort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho and Harrison, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho and Harrison, 2011</xref>). Notably, following the deposition of Cse4, Scm3 remains associated with the centromeres throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wisniewski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>), and like HJURP, Scm3 has been found on non-centromeric chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</xref>). Besides the highly conserved CENP-A binding domain, both HJURP and Scm3 also harbor a homologous DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which is predicted to be evolutionarily conserved in all vertebrates and fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Müller et al., 2014</xref>). Overexpression of Scm3, like HJURP, causes chromosome instability, and it is believed that Scm3, when in excess, binds to centromeric DNA independently and leads to chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mishra et al., 2011</xref>). Both Scm3 and HJURP form homo-dimers, and in an in vitro assay, Scm3 and HJURP bind to non-centromeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stoler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). Non-homologous proteins, such as budding yeast Ndc10 and mammalian Mis18, are critical for Cse4 and CENP-A deposition, respectively, but they bind to Scm3 and HJURP through regions other than the conserved Cse4/CENP-A- and DNA-binding domain of these chaperones. Therefore, despite the significant difference in polypeptide length between HJURP and Scm3 (748 vs 229), their functions appear conserved from humans to yeast. Given the physical interaction of HJURP with the MRN complex, it is highly plausible that Scm3 might also interact with DDR proteins in yeast. Altogether, from the above observations, we hypothesize that Scm3, like HJURP, may be involved in the DDR pathway in budding yeast. In this work, we report that cells lacking Scm3 are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents and are compromised in DNA damage repair. In addition to the known functions of HJURP in the DDR pathway, in this report, we show that Scm3 is required for mounting DDR-dependent checkpoint activation. Importantly, we demonstrate that Scm3 associates with DNA damage sites upon induction of DNA damage and persists there, perhaps to facilitate damage repair. Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of Scm3 might be involved in its DDR-related functions. Taken together, this study reveals an evolutionary kinship amongst CENP-A chaperones in conferring genome stability through efficient DNA damage repair, besides their canonical role in CENP-A deposition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Scm3-depleted cells are sensitive to MMS-mediated DNA damage</title><p>Yeast cells compromised in DNA damage repair (DDR) show sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents such as methyl methane sulfonate (MMS), HU, and CPT.

We pre-treated the cells with 0.75 mM auxin for 2 hr to deplete Scm3, then washed out auxin and spotted on plates containing different concentrations of MMS, without auxin. The depletion of Scm3 was verified by observing a higher percentage of G2/M arrested cells and by Western blot verifying the degradation of Scm3-AID after auxin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). Here also, we found that Scm3-depleted cells were more sensitive to MMS as compared to the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). To quantify the sensitivity observed by this approach, we performed a CFU count, as mentioned above. Following auxin pretreatment, an equal number of wild-type, <italic>SCM3-AID,</italic> and <italic>rad52∆</italic> cells were spread on plates with or without 0.01% MMS. We again found a statistically significant drop in cell viability on the MMS plate when Scm3 was pre-depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). The <italic>rad52∆</italic> cells, as the positive control, showed high sensitivity to MMS, as expected.</p><p>The increased sensitivity of Scm3-depleted cells to DNA-damaging agents could be due to the weakening of the kinetochores, as Scm3-mediated deposition of Cse4 promotes kinetochore assembly, or due to the delay in the cell cycle, as Scm3-depleted cells arrest in late G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camahort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cho and Harrison, 2011</xref>). If either of these hold true, perturbation of the kinetochore by degradation of other kinetochore proteins or wild-type cells arrested at metaphase would likely show a similar sensitivity to MMS. In budding yeast, Ndc10 is recruited to the centromeres upstream of Scm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lang et al., 2018</xref>), whereas the centromeric localization of Mif2, another essential inner kinetochore protein, depends on Scm3 and Cse4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). We constructed <italic>NDC10-AID</italic> and <italic>MIF2-AID</italic> strains and used them for our assay to represent proteins independent or dependent on Scm3 for centromeric localization, respectively. We also included one non-essential kinetochore protein, Ctf19, a protein of the COMA complex, to remove any possible misjudgment in distinguishing a cell-growth-arrest phenotype occurring due to drug sensitivity vs. auxin-mediated degradation of essential proteins. The COMA complex is directly recruited to the centromeres through interaction with the N-terminal tail of Cse4, hence dependent on Scm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fischböck-Halwachs et al., 2019</xref>). Mid-log phase cells were harvested and spotted on plates with or without MMS and/or auxin; however, we did not observe any increased sensitivity of such cells to MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further, wild-type cells, when challenged in the presence of nocodazole and MMS, also did not show an increased sensitivity to MMS. Therefore, the increased sensitivity to MMS in Scm3-depleted cells but not in other kinetochore mutant or metaphase-arrested cells indicates that Scm3 possesses an additional function in genome stability besides its role in kinetochore assembly.</p><p>Since HJURP is involved in DDR through the HR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>), Scm3-depleted cells are expected to interact genetically with HR mutants if Scm3 shares this function with HJURP. We therefore tested genetic interaction between Scm3-depleted and <italic>rad52∆</italic> cells<italic>,</italic> as Rad52 is essential for efficient homologous recombination in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barlow and Rothstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). In the presence of auxin, the double mutant grew slowly compared to the single mutants and the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To further validate the genetic interaction between the two genes, mid-log grown cells were pre-treated with 0.75 mM auxin to deplete Scm3 before cells were spotted on YPD plates. Again, we observed that the double mutant grew slower than the wild type and single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Next, we wanted to investigate how the double mutant behaves when challenged by a DNA damaging agent. As expected, when the double mutant was spotted in the presence of 0.005% MMS, the single mutants grew better than the double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). These results indicate a genetic interaction between Scm3 depletion and <italic>rad52</italic> deletion.</p><p>Further, we wanted to identify the regions in Scm3 whose loss confers sensitivity to DNA damage. Scm3 contains two essential conserved regions, NES (nuclear export signal) and HR (heptad repeat), having functions in DNA and Cse4 binding, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Scm3 also has a non-essential D/E-rich region, which is important for protein stability but not involved in Cse4 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stoler et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, Scm3 possesses two BR (bromodomain) regions, each harboring a candidate NLS (nuclear localization signal). Deletion of the C-terminal 25 amino acids or the bromodomain regions does not cause cell lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shivaraju et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stoler et al., 2007</xref>). We used these non-essential <italic>scm3</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shivaraju et al., 2011</xref>) as the sole source of Scm3 and challenged the cells to MMS and CPT along with wild-type Scm3-expressing cells as a control. We found no growth defect in response to MMS or CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that at least the C-terminal 25 amino acids and bromodomain regions are not important for the DDR function of Scm3. This indicates that the essential NES and/or HR might be involved, but this is technically difficult to test using growth-based assays.</p><p>From these results, we conclude that the loss of Scm3 confers sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, indicating that Scm3, like its mammalian homolog HJURP, may play a role in the DDR pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The loss of Scm3 generates more Rad52 foci</title><p>Having shown that the Scm3-depleted cells are sensitive to DNA damage, we hypothesized that these cells might be deficient in repairing DNA damage.

Therefore, loss of <italic>RAD52</italic> causes these DNA breaks to accumulate upon damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dornfeld and Livingston, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lisby et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lisby et al., 2001</xref>). Mid-log phase <italic>RAD52-GFP SCM3-AID</italic> cells were treated with auxin or left untreated for 2 hr. The cultures were then split and incubated with or without 0.02% MMS for 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), followed by visualization of Rad52-GFP foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that 13% of Scm3-depleted (+auxin) cells showed Rad52-GFP foci in the absence of MMS, in contrast to only 5% of wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, untreated). Consistent with this observation, when these cells were challenged with MMS, the number of Rad52-GFP foci increased, and Scm3-depleted cells still showed Rad52-GFP foci more frequently (70%) than wild-type cells (45%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, 0.02% MMS). Moreover, while the Scm3-depleted cells harbored an average of ~3 foci in MMS, the wild type showed ~2 foci per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To rule out the possibility that auxin treatment alone can cause increased Rad52-GFP foci formation, we challenged the wild-type (<italic>RAD52-GFP</italic>) cells with auxin or DMSO and counted the number of cells with Rad52-GFP foci. We did not observe an increase in Rad52-GFP-positive cells when treated with auxin +DMSO, as compared to only DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Briefly, <italic>bar1∆ RAD52-GFP SCM3-AID</italic> cells were arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle by adding alpha factor. 1 hr before release from G1 phase, cells were treated with auxin to deplete Scm3 or with the solvent DMSO as control. Subsequently, cells were washed and released into alpha factor-free media with or without MMS with either DMSO or auxin and with nocodazole to have all cells eventually arrest at metaphase. Following the alpha factor release, cells were harvested every 30 min and the percentage of cells containing Rad52-GFP foci was determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Without MMS, Scm3-depleted cells, but not the wild type, showed a peak of Rad52-GFP accumulation at around 60 min after G1 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Notably, this time point coincides with the timing of DNA replication (judged by bud morphology) when DNA is most susceptible to damage. In the presence of MMS, both cells with or without auxin showed a peak of Rad52-GFP accumulation at 60 min after release, but the fraction of cells with Rad52-GFP foci was higher when auxin was present, that is Scm3 depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

To examine this, we first wanted to see if Scm3 alters its localization pattern in response to MMS-mediated DNA damage. Since Scm3 is also expected to localize at the kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</xref>), we visualized Scm3 along with the kinetochore marker, Ndc10, on chromatin spreads. Cells harboring <italic>NDC10-6HA SCM3-13MYC</italic> were mock-treated or treated with 0.02% MMS for 90 min. Ndc10 showed bright foci representing the kinetochore cluster, whereas Scm3 was localized to multiple locations across chromatin, including colocalizing with Ndc10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, arrow). A similar localization of Scm3 throughout the nucleus has been observed earlier in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Luconi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wisniewski et al., 2014</xref>).

The untreated samples had a comparatively smaller number of such damage-prone sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, fragile sites and hotspots). Moreover, the MMS-treated samples had a higher number of peaks with short tandem repeats (length 5–7 nucleotides), interspersed repeats, and low complexity regions (less diversity of nucleotides) than in the untreated samples. These repeat regions are also shown to be a source of DNA damage, as they form alternative non-B DNA structures, which are more prone to damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Freudenreich, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wierdl et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, analysis of the gene ontology (GO) associated with the 17 non-centromeric peaks revealed GO terms that are involved in normal metabolic pathways such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, regulation of amino acids, and telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) while in the treated samples the 75 non-centromeric peaks had GO terms that are mostly related to nucleotide synthesis and detoxification/flocculation, which are usually triggered in stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We speculate that Scm3 might bind to these genes to ameliorate the DNA damage stress caused by MMS treatment. Hence, we could attribute the increased binding of the Scm3 to the non-centromeric regions to DNA damage.</p><p>To further understand the nature of the non-centromeric sites harboring the enriched peaks (17 untreated, 75 treated), they were scanned for the presence of any motifs, and we observed three and one significant motifs in the treated and in the untreated samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The three motifs in the MMS-treated samples were specifically observed in the viral LTR region of the gag-pol fusion gene, based on the annotation from the NCBI reference genome (NCBI accession: GCF_000146045.2). These viral LTRs are found in multiple chromosomes spanning 29 peaks (~39% of total peaks) in the treated samples. Interestingly, these regions are considered fragile sites marked by the binding of Rrm3 helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Song et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, these viral LTRs are also known to trigger DNA-damage response pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sinclair et al., 2006</xref>). This suggests that upon DNA damage induction, Scm3 is recruited to genomic locations that are more prone to damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Scm3 partially co-localizes with Rad52, perhaps at the DNA damage sites</title><p>Given the increased chromatin association of Scm3 in response to DNA damage, we wished to investigate if this occurs due to its binding to DNA damage sites.

In mammals, the DSB sites are marked by γ-H2Ax, which also goes to other chromosomal locales, due to ATM/ATR kinases mediated phosphorylation of the H2A variant, H2Ax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). In yeast, which lacks H2Ax, the DSBs are marked by γ-H2A due to phosphorylation of histone H2A by Mec1 and Tel1 kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, γ-H2A is also found at the heterochromatin region and co-localizes with the yeast heterochromatin protein Sir3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Javaheri et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kirkland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitada et al., 2011</xref>). We performed a chromatin spread assay using antibodies specific to γ-H2A and observed a drastic increase in the intensity of γ-H2A when the cells were subjected to DNA damage, which is expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). To verify that the phenomenon is associated with DNA damage, we observed a significant increase in the colocalization between Rad52 and γ-H2A in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). To further correlate the localization of Scm3 with DNA damage, we then visualized both Scm3-13Myc and γ-H2A simultaneously on chromatin spreads from <italic>SCM3-13MYC</italic> cells mock-treated or treated with 0.02% MMS for 90 min. We did not observe any significant co-localization between Scm3-13Myc and γ-H2A in untreated cells as judged by low Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient value (PCC &lt;0.3) but found a significant increase in the value (PCC &gt;0.5) in MMS-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). We verified the accuracy of the assay by rotating the red and green fluorescence images through 180° relative to each other and recalculating the PCC value as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ma et al., 2023</xref>). After rotation, we failed to observe any significant correlation between Scm3-13Myc and γ-H2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>), suggesting the observed high PCC values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>) are not an artifact of the assay. In order to negate the possibility that the increased co-localization of Scm3-6HA with Rad52 or γ-H2A following MMS treatment is merely due to the increased accumulation of the DDR proteins in response to MMS within the small yeast nucleus, we tested the colocalization of an unrelated transcription factor, Hsf1, with γ-H2A. Since Hsf1 is known to increase its chromatin association in response to heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rubio et al., 2024</xref>), we verified this by incubating the cells at 37 °C for 15 min. As expected, Hsf1 showed an increased chromatin association (a greater number of Hsf1-13Myc foci) at high temperatures compared to normal temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). As expected, the increased chromatin occupancy of Hsf1 or γ-H2A due to high temperature or MMS treatment, respectively, did not result in any significant increase in the co-localization frequency between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that the association of Scm3 with chromatin and its co-localization with DDR proteins increases with DNA damage.</p><p>Since we observed high co-localization between Scm3-13Myc and γ-H2A in MMS-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), we wished to understand if the localization of Scm3 is dependent on γ-H2A. For this, we performed chromatin spread assay to visualize the behavior of Scm3 in the <italic>mec1∆ tel1∆</italic> double mutant, where γ-H2A remains absent on the chromatin at the DSB sites. As expected, we observed a drastic drop in γ-H2A localization on the spreads in the double mutant as compared to wild-type cells in MMS--treated samples, which validates the assay. Upon quantification of the total intensity of Scm3 and normalizing that with the background intensity, we did not observe any statistically significant drop in the localization of Scm3 on the chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J–L</xref>). This suggests that the recruitment of Scm3 at the damage sites is not influenced by prior localization of γ-H2A at those sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Scm3 is recruited to a site-specific DSB</title><p>The overall increased association of Scm3 with chromatin and its colocalization with Rad52 and γ-H2A in response to MMS-mediated DNA damage prompted us to examine if Scm3 is recruited specifically to DNA damage sites.

As a positive control for Scm3 ChIP, we found significant enrichment of Scm3 at the centromere (<italic>CEN3</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We observed a significant increase in the Scm3 binding near the DSB at 2 hr of galactose induction and a decrease in the enrichment at 4 hr, possibly due to the gradual repair of the damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). We also observed an increase in the enrichment of Scm3 up to –3 kb distal to the cut site, which decreased gradually over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and no significant enrichment at the <italic>TUB2</italic> locus, used as negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) or in the no antibody control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This suggests that Scm3 is maximally recruited to the cleavage sites at the time of DNA damage and gradually dissociates when the DNA is repaired. To confirm that the enrichment of Scm3 at 2 hr at the HO-induced DSB sites is a site-specific response rather than a global chromatin enrichment, we verified the enrichment of Scm3-6HA at the <italic>CEN3</italic> and <italic>TUB2</italic> loci at different time points of HO induction. We could not observe any significant enrichment of Scm3 at those loci over different time points, suggesting Scm3 specifically enriches at the DSB sites upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). To verify that the HO-induced DSB can recruit DNA repair proteins, we also investigated the enrichment of one such protein, Rad51, which is known to bind DSB sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fangaria et al., 2022</xref>). We found Rad51 maximally enriched at the DSB site 2–3 hr after galactose induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We conclude that upon DNA damage, Scm3 associates with the damage sites and may act in cis to facilitate damage repair.</p><p>We postulate that the association of Scm3 at the DSB site is to facilitate DNA damage repair. In that case, we expect to observe an altered kinetics of repair in the absence of Scm3. To examine this, we constructed the <italic>SCM3-AID</italic> allele in the NA14 background and released the cells in galactose (for HO induction and DNA cleavage) after treating them with DMSO (wild type) or auxin (Scm3-depleted). Cells were harvested at different time points, as mentioned earlier, and the extent of DNA damage and DNA repair was monitored using primers flanking the HO cut site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). While in the wild type, the DSB is repaired by 55% by 4 hr and is completed by 6 hr, the Scm3-depleted cells showed a delay in the DSB repair, which was only 15% by 4 hr time point and reaches a maximum of 65% by 6 hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>).

In the DDR pathway, Rad53 is an effector kinase that becomes phosphorylated in a Mec1 sensor kinase-dependent manner in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Melo and Toczyski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhou and Elledge, 2000</xref>). The phosphorylation of Rad53 is essential to halt the cell cycle and provide cells with time to repair damaged DNA. To examine whether Scm3-depleted cells have defects in the activation of DDR checkpoint and in halting the cell cycle, we measured Rad53 phosphorylation in <italic>SCM3-AID</italic> cells in the presence or absence of auxin after treating them with 0.02% MMS for 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Anti-Rad53 antibodies that recognize both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of Rad53 were used. We observed lesser phosphorylation of Rad53 in Scm3-depleted cells (<italic>SCM3-AID</italic>+auxin) as compared to <italic>SCM3-AID</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).</p><p>Since Scm3-depleted cells, unlike the wild type, arrest at the G2/M stage due to activation of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camahort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stoler et al., 2007</xref>), the observed difference in Rad53 phosphorylation could be due to the difference in cell cycle stages. To circumvent this issue, we grew <italic>CDC20-AID</italic> and <italic>SCM3-AID</italic> cells for 3 hr before treating them with 0.75 mM auxin for 2 hr to arrest them at G2/M by depleting Cdc20 and Scm3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The cells were then treated with 0.02% MMS and harvested at indicated time points for total protein extraction. The <italic>CDC20-AID</italic> and <italic>SCM3-AID</italic> cultures showed around ~80% metaphase arrest cells after 2 hr of auxin treatment (0 min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Notably, while the Cdc20-depleted cells maintained the arrest even with a longer incubation in auxin, the Scm3-depleted cells tended to bypass the arrest after a certain time and showed accumulation of multibudded cells with fragmented DAPI, an arrest-release phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Consistent with our previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), we observed that in <italic>SCM3-AID</italic>+auxin cells, Rad53 was less phosphorylated than in <italic>CDC20-AID</italic>+auxin cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Since Scm3-depleted cells showed reduced Rad53 phosphorylation, we wished to examine if the lack of Scm3 perturbs Mec1 kinase function, which phosphorylates Rad53. Mec1 also phosphorylates histone H2A at S129 upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). However, we failed to observe any significant difference in the phosphorylation status of H2AS129 between Scm3- or Cdc20-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that Mec1 function is not perturbed in the absence of Scm3. These results indicate that in the absence of Scm3, when there is DNA damage, the activation of the DDR checkpoint is improper, and consequently, the phosphorylation of Rad53 is compromised.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Evidence of a DNA damage checkpoint defect in the absence of Scm3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental strategy to detect Rad53 in Scm3- or Cdc20-depleted cells treated with MMS for different time points.

However, Scm3-depleted cells arrest at G2/M due to improper kinetochore-microtubule attachment which activates the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camahort et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stoler et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore deleted the SAC component <italic>MAD2</italic> in <italic>SCM3-AID</italic> cells to exclude the effect of a SAC-mediated arrest. These cells were first depleted of Scm3 by treatment with auxin and then, along with <italic>mad2D</italic> control cells, incubated with or without MMS for 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). While the <italic>mad2D</italic> cells in the presence of MMS showed few multibudded cells (&lt;5%), the percentage of multibudded cells strongly increased after depletion of Scm3 (&gt;40%), suggesting that Scm3-depleted cells failed to activate the DNA damage checkpoint in the presence of DNA damage. To further validate this result, we monitored the degradation kinetics of Pds1 in the background of <italic>MAD2</italic> deletion. <italic>mad2∆ SCM3-AID</italic> cells were first arrested in G1 by alpha factor and then released in MMS-containing media in the absence or presence of auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

To examine if Scm3 becomes modified upon DNA damage, we treated <italic>SCM3-6HA</italic> cells with increasing concentrations of MMS or with 0.02% MMS for increasing duration. We observed slower migrating bands of Scm3 (Scm3*) that became brighter with increasing concentrations of MMS and were present very faintly, even in the untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left panel). We observed an increase in the background-subtracted[2]intensity of Scm3* and Scm3*/Scm3 ratio with increasing MMS concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, middle, and right panels). A similar observation was made when the cells were treated with 0.02% MMS for increasing time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since we could also detect Scm3* bands in the untreated cells, its enrichment in response to MMS could be due to a cell cycle arrest caused by MMS. To understand the dynamics of the appearance of Scm3* bands over different cell cycle stages and in response to MMS, we released the <italic>bar1∆ SCM3-6HA</italic> cells from alpha-factor-mediated G1 arrest into medium in the absence or presence of MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We harvested the cells at indicated time points and evaluated the cell cycle synchrony using bud morphology and DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>). The majority of cells at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min are in G1, S, metaphase, metaphase/anaphase, and anaphase, respectively. We could faintly observe the Scm3* bands after release from the G1 phase in MMS-free (untreated) media, and the band intensity did not change over time. However, when the cells were released in the presence of MMS, we observed an increase in the intensity of the Scm3* bands over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest that the accumulation of Scm3* in the MMS-treated cells is due to DNA damage rather than an effect of the pace of the cell cycle. It is possible that Scm3* bands are phosphorylated forms of Scm3 since the protein has several serine/threonine residues. To test this, we challenged the Scm3-6HA cells with MMS, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, and resolved the proteins on SDS-PAGE with or without Phos-Tag reagent. The presence of Phos-Tag in the gel enables slow mobility of the phosphorylated proteins and thus further differentiates them from their unphosphorylated forms. The mobility of the Scm3* bands was further reduced with respect to the Scm3 band in Phos-Tag gel compared to the normal gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>), suggesting that the modification is likely due to phosphorylation. We further verified this by performing a phosphatase experiment. <italic>SCM3-6HA</italic> cells treated or untreated with MMS were immunoprecipitated and subjected to alkaline phosphatase treatment for 3 hr at 37 °C. The disappearance of the Scm3* band upon phosphatase treatment confirms that the shift was indeed due to phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Notably, in several high-throughput studies, Scm3 has been shown to be phosphorylated at the S39, S64, and S165 residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lanz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">MacGilvray et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>).

However, in the absence of further validation in those studies, our observation of a gradual increase in the Scm3* band intensity with increasing dose of MMS convincingly demonstrates DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation of Scm3.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Post-translational modification of Scm3 in response to DNA damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, western blot showing Scm3-6HA and its modified form (Scm3*) along with tubulin as loading control from the cells untreated or treated with indicated concentrations of MMS for 90 min.

The observation that Scm3 persists not only at the centromeres throughout the cell cycle but also associates with the bulk of the chromatin argues for additional kinetochore-independent functions of Scm3 in maintaining genome stability. In metazoans, the Scm3 homolog HJURP was initially identified as a protein involved in DDR, and its role in CENP-A deposition was only discovered later. How HJURP regulates the DDR pathway is not well understood. The DDR role of Scm3 has not previously been reported in budding yeast to our knowledge. Showing that Scm3 also contributes to the DDR pathway in budding yeast is important since this organism is distinct from metazoans in terms of harboring small 125 bp point centromeres, contrasting the megabase pair large regional centromeres in metazoans, and its centromeres are not epigenetically determined. Here, for the first time, we report that Scm3, perhaps upon phosphorylation, promotes DNA damage repair by contributing to the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, and in the process, it possibly associates with DDR proteins at the DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our findings significantly advance knowledge of how CENP-A chaperones can be involved in the DDR pathway.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A working model summarizing the role of Scm3 in the DNA damage response (DDR).</title><p>Left, in wild-type cells, a subset of Scm3 present in the nucleus (green) is phosphorylated upon DNA damage. The phosphorylated Scm3 (p-Scm3) associates with DSB sites, colocalizes with γ-H2A, and spreads to chromatin flanking the DSB site. Possibly, p-Scm3 facilitates proper activation of Rad53 through its phosphorylation, leading to cell cycle arrest. Additionally, p-Scm3 co-localizes with Rad52 and assists in DSB repair. Right, in Scm3-depleted cells, there is an increase in endogenous DNA damage, corresponding to more Rad52 foci, likely due to the inability to repair DSBs, and cell viability drops. In parallel, reduced Rad53 activation causes improper DDR-mediated cell cycle arrest, generating multibudded cells and possibly aneuploid cells, leading to cell death. Phenotypes associated with the loss of Scm3 are shown in red.

To circumvent this issue with Scm3, which is essential for cell survival, we partially depleted Scm3 and found that these cells were sensitive to genotoxic agents, including MMS, HU, and CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The observed sensitivity is not due to problems in kinetochore formation or cell cycle progression in the absence of Scm3, as other kinetochore mutants or a metaphase block in wild-type cells did not show similar sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The arguments favoring the possible centromere-independent DDR functions of Scm3 can be gleaned as follows. From comparing the domain organization of Scm3 with HJURP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), we noticed that, besides the CENP-A/Cse4 binding domain, both HJURP and Scm3 have a common DNA binding domain, which is dispensable for CENP-A/Cse4 binding and also dispensable for Mis18 or Ndc10 binding in metazoans or budding yeast, respectively. Both in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrate binding of the DNA binding domain to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mizuguchi et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting this domain can recruit Scm3 to non-centromeric DNA damage sites. In support of this, Scm3 has recently been shown to be phosphorylated in an MMS-dependent manner at S64 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lanz et al., 2021</xref>), which, interestingly, lies within the DNA binding domain. Among other non-essential regions of Scm3, neither the NLS region nor the C-terminal region is involved in DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). On the other hand, the D/E-rich region, which is important for Scm3 stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stoler et al., 2007</xref>), forms a disordered domain as per alpha-fold prediction and hence is believed to be capable of interacting with multiple proteins or can act as a scaffold for engaging several protein-protein interactions which are required in DDR. It will be interesting to test whether and how CENP-A might influence the DDR function of Scm3. Analysis of damage-induced localization of CENP-A and isolation of separation-of-function (centromeric vs non-centromeric) mutants of Scm3 could provide insights into the role of CENP-A in Scm3’s DDR function.</p><p>MMS halts replication forks due to the formation of DNA adducts, which eventually generate recombinogenic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Conde and San-Segundo, 2008</xref>). In yeast, these lesions are repaired primarily through homologous recombination (HR), facilitated by the Rad52 epistasis group of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pizzul et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sirbu and Cortez, 2013</xref>). In the presence of DNA damage, Rad52 relocalizes to form bright foci, which mark the repair centers. Strikingly, we observed that the number of Rad52 foci is increased in the absence of Scm3, even without external DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Left), with maximal accumulation noticed at 60 min post-G1 release, which coincides with the timing of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This indicates that Scm3 might be required to avoid generating DNA lesions during replication, which itself is genotoxic. In support of this, it was previously observed that cells arrest during S phase in the absence of Scm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Camahort et al., 2007</xref>). In yeast, although HR is the preferred repair pathway, an alternative pathway named non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) exists. The absence of epistatic interaction between <italic>SCM3</italic> and <italic>RAD52</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) suggests that Scm3 may function in ways other than the Rad52-mediated classical HR pathway. In this context, it would be interesting to test how Scm3 might interact with the key proteins of the NHEJ pathway, such as Ku70/Ku80 and Lig4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that Scm3 may promote a specific chromatin architecture facilitating that DSB ends stay together and are accessible for NHEJ-mediated end joining.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Association of Scm3 with non-centromeric loci</title><p>In budding yeast, chromosome XII harbors ribosomal DNA (rDNA) with around 150 repetitive loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dammann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Smith, 2022</xref>). Recombination among these repeats excises rDNA circles, and therefore, efficient DNA damage repair through HR at these loci is crucial for preserving genomic stability. Notably, mammalian HJURP binds to the rDNA region and maintains its stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>). The knockdown of HJURP using siRNA resulted in increased rDNA recombination events and chromosome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kato et al., 2007</xref>). The presence of Scm3 at the rDNA loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and F</xref>) suggests that Scm3, like HJURP, might also be important in regulating the recombination and repair processes at these rDNA loci.</p><p>During DSB repair, lesions generated at multiple sites are recruited to repair centers, which are marked by Rad51 and Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lisby et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miyazaki et al., 2004</xref>). The observed statistically significant co-localization of Rad52 and γ-H2A with Scm3 in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) implicates the recruitment of Scm3 at multiple DNA damage sites distributed over several repair centers. Normally, these proteins localize independently onto chromatin owing to their specific functions and show limited overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), but in response to DNA damage, they significantly co-localize with each other aiding in the process of damage repair. This was supported by an overall increase in the association of Scm3 with the non-centromeric chromatin sites, the majority of which, through in-silico analysis, appear to be DNA-damage-prone sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). At the damage sites, it is possible that Scm3 might physically interact with Rad51/Rad52 and/or MRX (Mre11, Rad50, Xrs2) complex through its HR or DNA binding or the D/E rich domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, we failed to observe any interaction of Scm3 at least with Rad52 using a co-immunoprecipitation.</p><p>Although DNA damage sites are marked by γ-H2A in budding yeast, γ-H2A is also observed at stalled replication forks, fragile sites, telomeric, and heterochromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kirkland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kitada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bewersdorf et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the increased co-localization between Scm3 and γ-H2A upon MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>) suggests that Scm3 may be recruited to those sites as well. The presence of Scm3 up to 3 kb distal from the cut site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) is consistent with the pattern for γ-H2A, which also spreads distal to the cut site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Though Scm3’s presence at the cut site peaked at 2 hr following HO induction, it persisted at the cut site even when ~60% of the cut DNA was repaired, indicating that Scm3 remains associated with damage sites during the repair process. Importantly, in the absence of Scm3, the repair of the cut site was drastically reduced, suggesting that the localization of Scm3 at the cut site is required for the repair of the damage. These findings suggest that the localization of Scm3 at the DSB sites and its spreading up to –3 kb promote the repair process. Although how Scm3 might promote repair is currently not understood, it may facilitate multiple steps in the repair process, which will be investigated in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Scm3 regulates the DNA damage checkpoint</title><p>We wanted to address the mechanism by which Scm3 might be involved in DDR. Inefficient Rad53 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and abrogation of the cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and C</xref>) in the presence of DNA damage in Scm3-depleted cells suggest that these cells are defective in DDR checkpoint activation. Since Rad53 is known to be phosphorylated in a Mec1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gilbert et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pellicioli and Foiani, 2005</xref>), we examined but failed to observe any attenuation of Mec1 activity in Scm3-depleted cells in the presence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Therefore, we are uncertain about the cause of improper Rad53 phosphorylation; a defect in its auto-activation or in the activity of other mediator kinases, for example Tel1, may be responsible. Nevertheless, given the increased phosphorylation of Scm3 in response to DNA damage, phosphorylated Scm3 may be required to activate Rad53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Although we found that Scm3 phosphorylation is Mec1 independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>), other kinases may be involved. While the involvement of CDKs in the DNA damage checkpoint is not well understood, it is known that CDKs contribute to the phosphorylation of both Rad52 and Rad51 to promote repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lim et al., 2020</xref>). Given that the centromeric association of Scm3 varies with the cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mishra et al., 2011</xref>), probably due to oscillating levels of CDK activity, the DNA damage-dependent phosphorylation of Scm3 might also be regulated by CDKs. However, this does not rule out the involvement of other kinases, including Rad53 and Tel1, which are closely associated with the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Further investigation is required to determine the kinases involved in the Scm3 phosphorylation.</p><p>In summary, we report here that, like HJURP, Scm3 in budding yeast also possesses functions in DDR, indicating that the centromere-independent functions of the CENP-A chaperone are evolutionarily conserved. Although the chromatin landscape of budding yeast is far more ‘open’ with lesser involvement of epigenetic determinants than in metazoans, the inherent similarity in the DNA damage repair pathway may necessitate the utilization of these chaperones in a similar fashion in both cell types. Not much is known about how HJURP is involved in the DDR pathway. As we find that Scm3 is involved in the proper activation of the DNA damage checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), this could be tested for HJURP in metazoans. Abrogation of this surveillance function may lead to aneuploidy and disease states. Our findings on Scm3 will pave the way for future work using yeast as a model to decipher genome-wide functions of the CENP-A chaperone, like HJURP, which is crucial given its genome-wide localization and evidence of its modulation in several patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>All <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are derived from W303 genetic background and are mentioned in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>.

After clarification of the lysate by centrifugation, 5 µg of anti-HA antibodies (ab9110, Abcam) was added and incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle rotation followed by incubation with Protein G conjugated Dynabeads (10003D, Invitrogen) for 2 hr at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed thrice with lysis buffer followed by three times washing in phosphatase wash buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5; 0.2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol). The eluate was resuspended in phosphatase buffer and incubated with or without FastAP (EF0651, Thermo) for 3 hr at 37 °C. After incubation, the proteins were eluted in 1 X SDS-PAGE buffer, samples were run on 12% SDS gel, and immunoblotting was performed using anti-HA antibodies.</p><p>To detect Scm3-6HA, Rad53, and γ-H2A, cell extracts were run on 12%, 8%, and 15% SDS gels, respectively. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes, which were cut to detect the above proteins and the control protein tubulin separately. To quantify the bands on the western blots, a region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the band of interest, and the band’s intensity was calculated using ImageJ. An ROI of the same size from a no-band area of the blot was used to calculate the background intensity. The background intensity was subtracted from the band intensity. Tubulin band intensities were measured in the same way. The intensity of the target bands (Scm3-6HA, Rad53, and γ-H2A) was divided by control tubulin band intensity to get the normalized values for the target bands, which were plotted using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (Version 9.4.1) software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The data presented in the main and figure supplements were obtained from two to three independent experiments. The error bars in the individual bar graphs represent the SEM. The statistical significance (p) was determined by a two-tailed Student’s t-test, or one-way ANOVA test, as appropriate. A one-way ANOVA test was used when comparing more than one group; otherwise, a Student’s t-test was used. The ‘N’ values denote the total number of cells analyzed from the combined ‘n’ number of replicates of the individual assays. The p values less than or equal to 0.05 are categorized as significant differences. The SD, SE, and statistical significance (p) values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (Version 9.4.1) software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary file related to main article file.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) List of strains used in this study.

The authors address this important question using budding yeast as a model system, with convincing data that demonstrates a role for the centromeric histone H3 chaperone Scm3 contributing to this repair pathway. These data have exciting implications for repair pathways that regulate an essential chromosomal locus required for mitosis and cell viability.

Was the arrest similarly tight for the untreated and the MMS-treated sample?</p><p>(4) I cannot follow the argument about the enrichment of Scm3 after MMS treatment by ChIP (Figure 3). Almost all the peaks pointed out by black arrows are also observed in untreated cells. Please explain how this has been quantitatively assessed and provide additional metrics on all peaks observed without or with MMS treatment (more comprehensive than Table S1). How much of the variation observed is inter-experiment variability?</p><p>(5) In Figure 4, given the limited resolution of light microscopy, is it possible that any chromatin-associated protein would show an increased co-localization with Rad52 or γ-H2A (since the area of occupancy expands)?

There is no clear increase after MMS treatment and in fact, some sites lose Scm3 enrichment after MMS treatment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104431.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

We appreciate the thorough evaluation of our manuscript and are committed to revising both the manuscript and supplemental materials based on the suggestions. We have carefully considered each comment and have addressed most of them in the initial revised version, which has been transferred. Additionally, we are currently conducting new experiments to provide the requested data to address a few comments. We are confident that these revision experiments will be completed in a couple of months or so, which will significantly enhance the quality of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Description of the planned revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</p><p>In the manuscript by Agarwal and Ghosh, the authors examine yeast Scm3 function in the DNA damage response. They show that Scm3 loss results in DNA damage sensitivity and more Rad52 foci. Importantly, Scm3 is recruited to DSB sites using an HO-cut site and its loss results in an attenuated DNA damage checkpoint as measured by Rad53 phosphorylation. The authors demonstrate convincingly that Scm3, like its human counterpart HJURP, plays a role in the DNA damage response through altered Rad53 activation. However, what its specific role in DNA repair is remains ambiguous.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>A. The phosphorylation aspect of Scm3 is intriguing and the authors show that Mec1 is not responsible for mediating its phosphorylation. Tel1 is another kinase that should be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We are in the process of examining the role of Tel1 kinase on Scm3 phosphorylation. The results from the experiment will be incorporated in the manuscript.</p><p>All other major and minor comments of Reviewer #1 have been addressed. Please see the section 3 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</p><p>This manuscript describes a study implicating the Scm3 protein from budding yeast in the DNA damage response (DDR). Scm3 is a chaperone protein, whose main role is considered to be the loading of CENP-A(Cse4) at centromeres to facilitate chromosome segregation. However, the human ortholog of Scm3, HJURP, is known to have a role in DDR and in this study the authors provide evidence that Scm3 is also involved in the DDR in yeast. For the most part, the results presented support the conclusions made.</p></disp-quote><p>All the major and minor comments of Reviewer #2 have been addressed. Please see the section 3 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The western blots in the paper are not always entirely convincing. In addition, they are not described in enough detail to understand if a membrane was cut or if multiple gels were run. For example, the tubulin loading in Figure 6D is interrupted toward the end of the blot and the bands in Figure 7D go in different directions for the two blots for the MMS treated cells. In figure 6B, there are no detectable phospho-forms of Rad53 detected on the upper blot for the WT and scm3 lanes even though quantification is given on the right. It would be good to present better examples of the westerns or at least better describe what the reader is visualizing so the quantification and conclusions can be understood. How were the blots quantified? How were the westerns run and processed?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a separate paragraph in Materials and methods regarding the gel run, processing and quantification of the western blots in the revised manuscript for better understanding of the readers:</p><p>“To detect Scm3-6HA, Rad53, and g-H2A, the total proteins isolated from the appropriate cells were run on 12%, 8%, and 15% SDS gels, respectively. The proteins were transferred to the membranes, which were cut to detect the above proteins and the control protein tubulin separately. For the quantification of the bands on the western blots, a region of interest (ROI) was made around the band of interest, and the intensity of the band was calculated using ImageJ. A same ROI from a no-band area of the blot was used to calculate the background intensity. The background intensity was subtracted from the band intensity. The same process was done for the tubulin bands. The intensity of the target bands (Scm3-6HA, Rad53, and g-H2A) was divided by control tubulin band intensity to get the normalized values for the target bands, which were plotted using GraphPad Prism 9.0 (Version 9.4.1) software.” This has been added in page 25, lines: 881-890.”</p><p>Furthermore, we will again perform the experiments for a better representation of the western blots in figures 6B, D, and 7D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The argument that scm3 depletion leads to a defect in DNA damage checkpoint activation is not strongly supported. Monitoring exit from the cell cycle by multibudding is not the most rigorous assay, especially since the image shows one cell with 5 nuclei. The authors should release cells from G1 into auxin and MMS and monitor cell cycle progression at least one other cell cycle marker, such as anaphase onset, DNA replication and/or Pds1 levels.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, in order to support our argument that the absence of Scm3 causes a defect in DNA damage checkpoint activation, we will examine if these cells abrogate G2/M arrest and show an early anaphase onset. For this, we will monitor the levels of Pds1, as a marker of anaphase onset, along the cell cycle in wild type and Scm3-depleted cells both deleted for Mad2 to remove any inadvertent effect of spindle assembly checkpoint. The schematics of the experimental workflow is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.

The peaks with increased Scm3 recruitment by ChIP-seq upon MMS is confusing as MMS does not induce specific damage at genomic locations. Is Scm3 being recruited at other genomic sites that might be more susceptible to DNA damage? Is Scm3 recruited to Pol2 sites for example? Or fragile sites?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the MMS induced increase in association of Scm3 with the noncentromeric chromatin loci depends on MMS sensitive vulnerable chromosomal sites. We agree with the reviewer that MMS might cause DNA damage at these sites, leading to Scm3 occupancy at those sites. Therefore, we compared the sites of Scm3 occupancy with possible such sites available from the literature that include fragile sites, RNA Pol II binding sites, double strand break hotspots, and coldspots. Based on our analysis, we have included the following lines in the ‘discussion’ section in page 16-17, lines 566-594 as follows:</p><p>“Moreover, an overall increase in the chromatin association of Scm3 in response to MMS also suggests that Scm3 might be recruited to several repair centers or sites that are susceptible to DNA damage, for example, the fragile sites (Figure 3B, C, E, S6). These sites in yeast are DNA regions prone to breakage under replication stress, often corresponding to replication-slow zones (RSZs) (Lemoine et al., 2005). These regions include replication termination (TER) sequences, tRNA genes, long-terminal repeats (LTRs), highly transcribed genes, inverted repeats/palindromes, centromeres, autonomously replicating sequences (ARS), telomeres, and rDNA (Song et al., 2014). Since the helicase Rrm3 is often associated with these fragile regions (Song et al., 2014), we compared Scm3 binding sites with the top 25 Rrm3 binding sites from the literature (Azvolinsky et al., 2009). In untreated cells, Scm3 sites overlapped with three Rrm3 sites on chromosomes X, XII, and XIV. Whereas in MMS treated cells, overlapping was found with four Rrm3 sites, with two (on chromosomes XII and XIV) shared with untreated cells and two new sites were observed on chromosomes II and XII (Table R1). Mapping of the Scm3 sites with the tRNA genes and LTRs revealed that these sites from the untreated cells did not overlap with the LTRs (Raveendranathan et al., 2006). However, the same from the treated cells showed overlap with two LTRs on chromosome XVI. No overlap with tRNA genes was observed in the treated cells (Table R1). We next examined Scm3 occupancy at 71 TERs documented in the literature (Fachinetti et al., 2010). Scm3 was found to bind to 6 TERs in both untreated and MMS-treated cells. Notably, MMS treatment resulted in three new peaks, while three peaks were shared with untreated samples (Table R1). Lastly, we compared Scm3 sites with top 25 RNA Pol II sites obtained from the literature (Azvolinsky et al., 2009). In untreated cells, Scm3 was found at only one of these Pol II sites, whereas after MMS treatment, Scm3 sites overlapped with four such sites (Table R1). We further checked the occupancy of Scm3 at a few DSB hotspots (<italic>BUD23</italic>, <italic>ECM3</italic>, and <italic>CCT6</italic>) and DSB coldspot (<italic>YCR093W</italic>) as mentioned in the literature (Dash et al., 2024; Nandanan et al., 2021). However, we did not find Scm3 binding to these sites. Overall, in-silico analysis of the binding sites indicates that the non-centromeric enrichment of Scm3 occurs at sites that are amenable to DNA damage.”</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>The table summarising the occupancy of Scm3 in untreated or MMS treated conditions at the indicated regions.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Region</th><th valign="bottom">Chromosome</th><th valign="bottom">Scm3 occupancy</th><th valign="bottom"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Untreated</bold></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>MMS treated</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Rrm3 binding<break/>sites</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr II</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr X</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XII</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XII</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XIV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">LTRs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XVI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XVI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">tRNA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">TERs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr IV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr V</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr VI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr VII</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr X</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr X</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XIV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XVI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pol II binding sites</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr II</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr X</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XII</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XII</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chr XV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">YES</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is hard to see what MMS resistance the authors state is observed in Mif2-depleted cells in Figure S3.

Scm3 is a chaperone protein, whose main role is considered to be the loading of CENP-A(Cse4) at centromeres to facilitate chromosome segregation. However, the human ortholog of Scm3, HJURP, is known to have a role in DDR and in this study the authors provide evidence that Scm3 is also involved in the DDR in yeast.</p><p>For the most part, the results presented support the conclusions made.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>A. Figure 1 Could depletion of Scm3 arrest cells in late G2/M and it is this delay that causes increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents? A control with nocodazole or other means – that also arrests cells at this point – might provide a nice control for this. Perhaps the other kinetochore mutants, used therein, achieve this control – but cell cycle phase would need to be assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out to a probable effect of the cell cycle stage on the observed MMS sensitivity. In fact, we were also concerned that the observed DNA damage sensitivity in Scm3 depleted cells might be due to G2/M arrest. To rule out this possibility, we monitored Rad52-GFP foci as a marker for DNA damage in the wild type and Scm3 depleted cells both arrested at G2/M using nocodazole (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). While Scm3 depleted condition exhibited &gt;20% Rad52-GFP positive cells, less than 10% wild type cells showed the same in the absence of any DNA damaging agents (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, no MMS, 60 mins). Upon challenging these cells with MMS in the presence of nocodazole, Scm3 depleted condition exhibited over 40% Rad52-GFP positive cells, whereas less than 20% wild-type cells harboured Rad52-GFP. This significant increase in Rad52-GFP positive cells when Scm3 is depleted clearly indicates that the observed MMS sensitivity in these cells is due to the absence of Scm3 rather than due to an effect of a cell cycle stage. Furthermore, we have also used Cdc20 depleted G2/M arrested cells as a wild type control to test the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint by Rad53 phosphorylation. These cells showed robust Rad53 activation in response to MMS, in contrast to poor activation in Scm3 depleted cells (Figure 6), suggesting that G2/M arrest is not the reason for the DNA damage sensitivity observed in the latter cells.</p><p>However, as per the reviewer's suggestion, we examined the MMS sensitivity of the wild type cells arrested at G2/M by nocodazole. As expected, these cells did not show increased sensitivity which further confirms that the DNA damage sensitivity observed in the <italic>scm3</italic> mutant is not due to G2/M arrest. This result has been incorporated within Figure 1—figure supplement 3B, replacing the earlier figure.</p><p>To include this result, we have included new text, and revised the result section in page 5-6, lines 158-179 as follows:</p><p>“The increased sensitivity of <italic>scm3</italic>-depleted cells to DNA-damaging agents could be due to the weakening of the kinetochores as Scm3-mediated deposition of Cse4 promotes kinetochore assembly or due to the delay in cell cycle, as Scm3 depleted cells arrest in late G2/M phase (Camahort et al., 2007; Cho and Harrison, 2011). If either of these holds true, perturbation of the kinetochore by degradation of other kinetochore proteins or wild type cells arrested at metaphase must show a similar sensitivity to MMS. In budding yeast, Ndc10 is recruited to the centromeres upstream of Scm3 (Lang et al., 2018), whereas the centromeric localization of Mif2, another essential inner kinetochore protein, depends on Scm3 and Cse4 (Xiao et al., 2017). We constructed <italic>NDC10-AID</italic> and <italic>MIF2-AID</italic> strains and used them for our assay to represent the proteins independent or dependent on Scm3 for centromeric localization, respectively. We also included one non-essential kinetochore protein, Ctf19, a protein of the COMA complex, to remove any possible mis-judgement in distinguishing cell-growth-arrest phenotype occurring due to drug-sensitivity vs. auxin-mediated degradation of essential proteins. The COMA complex is directly recruited to the centromeres through interaction with the N terminal tail of Cse4, hence dependent on Scm3 (Chen et al., 2000; Fischböck-Halwachs et al., 2019). Mid-log phase cells were harvested and spotted on the indicated plates, however, we did not observe any increased sensitivity of such cells to MMS (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Further, wild type cells, when challenged in the presence of nocodazole and MMS, also did not show any increased sensitivity to MMS. Therefore, the increased sensitivity to MMS in <italic>scm3</italic> mutant but not in other kinetochore mutant or metaphase arrested cells indicates that Scm3 possesses an additional function in genome stability besides its role in kinetochore assembly.”</p><p>Further we have also revised the Discussion section to include the observed results in page 15-16, lines 535-539 as follows:</p><p>“The observed sensitivity is not due to problems in kinetochore formation or cell cycle progression in the absence of Scm3, as other kinetochore mutants or metaphase block in wild type cells did not show similar sensitivity (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), indicating that the drug sensitivity phenotype of Scm3 depleted cells is not due to weakly formed kinetochores or cell cycle delay.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mutants of the HR pathway in yeast (e.g. rad52∆ with mre11∆ for example) are typically epistatic. The observation that Scm3 depletion is not epistatic with rad52∆ (Figure 1C) suggests the Scm3 acts via another pathway than the classic Rad52 HR pathway. This should be pointed out and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the discussion “In yeast, although HR is the preferred repair pathway, in the case of perturbed HR, an alternate pathway named non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) can occur. The absence of epistatic interaction between <italic>SCM3</italic> and <italic>RAD52</italic> (Figure 1C) suggests that Scm3 may function in ways other than the Rad52-mediated classical HR pathway. In this context, it would be interesting to test how Scm3 might interact with the key proteins of the NHEJ pathway, such as Ku70/Ku80 and Lig4 (Gao et al., 2016). It is possible that Scm3 may promote a certain chromatin architecture facilitating the DSB ends to stay together to be accessible for NHEJ-mediated end joining.” in page 16, lines 541-548.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 should include auxin treatment of RAD52-GFP cells (without the Scm3 degron) to show that the auxin treatment alone does not increase Rad52 foci.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the suggested experiment and did not observe any significant increase in Rad52-GFP positive cells when treated the cells with auxin+DMSO as compared to only DMSO.</p><p>This result has been incorporated as a new supplementary Figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B) and new text has been added in the revised manuscript as “To rule out the possibility that auxin treatment alone can cause increased Rad52-GFP foci formation, we challenged the wild type (<italic>RAD52-GFP</italic>) cells with auxin or DMSO and counted the number of cells with Rad52-GFP foci.

Although the model is a detailed one, the contribution from this work has been mentioned legitimately at every stage so that the readers can judge the merit of this work. We believe that a detailed model would provide a better perspective to the readers to correlate the revealed as well as yet-to-reveal functions of Scm3 in a spatiotemporal manner with the other players of the DDR pathway.

How much of the variation observed is inter-experiment variability?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor for the comment and agree that the ChIP-seq data presentation in its current form might be confusing. We have now provided a revised version of Figure 3 with a better representation of the Scm3-binding peaks by using distinct and different colored bars that explain the ChIP-seq data in a much better way. We have quantitatively analysed the peaks obtained in the untreated and treated samples, and only those sites where the enrichment upon immunoprecipitation (in the treated or untreated sample) exceeds that of the input by more than one-fold are considered as the true peaks. Upon quantification from MACS2 results, we observed that in the untreated samples, 17 peaks were enriched (~1.4-1.8 fold) compared to the input, while 75 peaks were enriched (~1.3-1.9 fold) in the MMS treated samples at the non-centromeric sites (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, Figure 3D). Out of these peaks, two were commonly found in both samples. One peak was found in the <italic>FLO1</italic> gene of Chr II, while the other peak was found in the CT repeat region of the indole pyruvate decarboxylase1 gene of Chr XII. Interestingly, as commented by the reviewer, we observed ~1.4 fold enrichment of Scm3 binding at the rDNA, that harbors repetitive regions, in the treated cells (1.54 fold enrichment relative to input) compared to untreated cells (1.06 fold enrichment relative to input) (Figure 3E) suggesting its general preference towards such regions. This analysis clearly demonstrates an increase in the binding of Scm3 to the non-centromeric sites upon MMS treatment.</p><p>To further understand the nature of the non-centromeric sites harboring the enriched peaks (17 untreated, 75 treated) they were scanned for the presence of any motifs, and we observed three and one significant motifs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F) in the treated and in the untreated samples, respectively. The three motifs in the MMS treated samples were specifically observed in the viral LTR region of the gag-pol fusion gene, based on the annotation from the NCBI reference genome (NCBI accession: GCF_000146045.2). These viral LTRs are found in multiple chromosomes spanning 29 peaks (~39% of total peaks) in the treated samples. Interestingly, these regions are considered fragile sites marked by the binding of Rrm3 helicase (Song et al., 2014). Notably, these viral LTRs are also known to trigger DNA-damage response pathways (Sinclair et al., 2006). This suggests that upon DNA damage induction, Scm3 is recruited to genomic locations that are more prone to damage, perhaps by interaction with DNA damage repair proteins. This can be argued based on the increased co-localization of Scm3 with DNA damage repair proteins Rad52, and y-H2A (Figure 4 of the manuscript) and the recruitment of Scm3 to the HO-induced DSB site (Figure 5 of the manuscript), where Scm3 binds DNA up to -3 kb from the DNA cut site, and its enrichment correlates with the binding of Rad51, a DNA damage repair protein.</p><p>Additionally, we also scanned the peaks for different features and observed that MMS treated peaks comprise fragile sites (Song et al., 2014) and hotspots (Gerton et al., 2004), which are prone to DNA damage. The untreated samples had a comparatively smaller number of such damage-prone sites (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Moreover, the MMS treated samples had a higher number of peaks with short tandem repeats (length 5-7 nucleotides), interspersed repeats and low complexity regions (less diversity of nucleotides). These repeat regions are also shown to be a source of DNA damage, as they form alternative non-B DNA structures, which are more prone to damage (Brown et al., 2021; Wierdl et al., 1997). Further gene set enrichment analysis of the 17 non centromeric peaks in untreated cells revealed that Scm3 binds to regions that are involved in normal metabolic pathways such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, regulation of amino acids, and telomere maintenance (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E) while in the treated samples the 75 non-centromeric peaks had GO terms/pathways that are mostly related to nucleotide synthesis and detoxification/flocculation, which are usually triggered in stress conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). We speculate that Scm3 might bind to these genes to ameliorate the DNA damage stress caused by MMS treatment. Hence, we could attribute the increased binding of the Scm3 to the non-centromeric regions to DNA damage/repair.</p><p>Based on our analysis, we have edited the manuscript as follows on pages 9-10, lines 287-329:</p><p>“The Scm3 ChIP-seq signal was normalised with the input signal, and upon quantification from MACS2, we observed the enrichment (peaks) of Scm3 at all 16 centromeres in both untreated and MMS treated samples (Figure 3D, blue bars). Scm3 was also enriched at the 9.1 kb rDNA region on Chr XII in both untreated and treated samples (Figure 3E, at rDNA), consistent with our chromatin spread data (Figure 3A). Upon further analysis, the enrichment of Scm3 at rDNA, which harbours repetitive regions, was found to be ~1.4-fold in the treated cells (1.54-fold enrichment relative to input) compared to untreated cells (1.06-fold enrichment relative to input) (Figure 3E), suggesting its general preference towards such regions.</p><p>Besides the centromeric peaks, 17 non-centromeric peaks (~1.4–1.8-fold enrichment over input) were detected in untreated samples, compared to 75 peaks (~1.3–1.9-fold enrichment over input) in MMS-treated cells, in which only two peaks were shared (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). This analysis clearly demonstrates an increase in the binding of Scm3 to the non-centromeric sites upon MMS treatment. The feature analysis of these sites revealed that MMS treated samples were enriched in peaks which comprise fragile sites (Song et al., 2014) and recombination hotspots (Gerton et al., 2004), which are prone to DNA damage. The untreated samples had a comparatively smaller number of such damage-prone sites (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, fragile sites and hotspots). Moreover, the MMS treated samples had a higher number of peaks with short tandem repeats (length 5-7 nucleotides), interspersed repeats and low complexity regions (less diversity of nucleotides) than in the untreated samples. These repeat regions are also shown to be a source of DNA damage, as they form alternative non-B DNA structures, which are more prone to damage (Brown et al., 2021; Wierdl et al., 1996). Furthermore, analysis of the gene ontology (GO) associated with the 17 non-centromeric peaks revealed GO terms that are involved in normal metabolic pathways such as glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, regulation of amino acids, and telomere maintenance (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E) while in the treated samples the 75 non-centromeric peaks had GO terms that are mostly related to nucleotide synthesis and detoxification/flocculation, which are usually triggered in stress conditions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D).We speculate that Scm3 might bind to these genes to ameliorate the DNA damage stress caused by MMS treatment. Hence, we could attribute the increased binding of the Scm3 to the non-centromeric regions to DNA damage.</p><p>To further understand the nature of the non-centromeric sites harboring the enriched peaks (17 untreated, 75 treated), they were scanned for the presence of any motifs, and we observed three and one significant motifs in the treated and in the untreated samples, respectively (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F). The three motifs in the MMS treated samples were specifically observed in the viral LTR region of the gag-pol fusion gene, based on the annotation from the NCBI reference genome (NCBI accession: GCF_000146045.2). These viral LTRs are found in multiple chromosomes spanning 29 peaks (~39% of total peaks) in the treated samples. Interestingly, these regions are considered fragile sites marked by the binding of Rrm3 helicase (Song et al., 2014). Notably, these viral LTRs are also known to trigger DNA-damage response pathways (Sinclair et al., 2006). This suggests that upon DNA damage induction, Scm3 is recruited to genomic locations that are more prone to damage, perhaps by interaction with DNA damage repair proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 4, given the limited resolution of light microscopy, is it possible that any chromatin-associated protein would show an increased co-localization with Rad52 or γ-H2A (since the area of occupancy expands)?

In the revised version, we have included Hsf1, a transcription factor, as a negative control in the co-localization assay. We examined co-localisation between y-H2A and Hsf1-13Myc and unlike Scm3-6HA, found no increased co-localisation in response to MMS or heat shock between the two proteins (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><p>The result has been incorporated in the text as follows on pages 10-11 lines 346-356:</p><p>“In order to negate the possibility that the increased co-localisation of Scm3-6HA with Rad52 or γ-H2A following MMS treatment is merely due to the increased accumulation of the DDR proteins in response to MMS within the small yeast nucleus, we tested the colocalization of an unrelated transcription factor, Hsf1, with γ-H2A. Since Hsf1 is known to increase its chromatin association in response to heat shock (Chowdhary et al., 2019; Rubio et al., 2024), we verified this by incubating the cells at 37°C for 15 mins. As expected, Hsf1 showed an increased chromatin association (a greater number of Hsf1-13Myc foci) at high temperatures compared to normal temperatures (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-C). As expected, the increased chromatin occupancy of Hsf1 or γ-H2A due to high temperature or MMS treatment, respectively, did not result in any significant increase in the co-localization frequency between the two proteins (Figure 4—figure supplement 2D-F).”</p><p>We further verified if the assay was sensitive enough and does not show an increased co-localisation due to the limited resolution of light microscopy. For clarity of the experiment, we recalculated the PCC values by rotating the red image 180° as performed in our earlier studies (Ma et al., 2023). As per the analysis, we did not observe any significant increase in the PCC values after the MMS treatment, suggesting that the observed values (Figure 4D) are not an artefact due to experimental errors (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).

The quantification of the blot was not performed as both at early (30 mins and 60 mins) and late time points (240 mins), we can clearly see reduced levels of Rad53 phosphorylation in Scm3-depleted cells as compared to Cdc20-depleted cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the new immunoblot for Pds1 in Figure 6E does not give any strong indication that Pds1 degrades earlier in Scm3-depleted cells.

The ChIP profiles from untreated and MMS-treated cells look highly similar, and it remains unclear whether differences in peak height between control and MMS are inter-experiment variability or MMS-induced changes. While a few Scm3 peaks overlap with fragile sites based on the new data you report, this is the case both in untreated and in MMS-treated cells. There is no clear increase after MMS treatment and in fact, some sites lose Scm3 enrichment after MMS treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the ChIP-seq data, we detected 33 Scm3 peaks in untreated cells and approximately three times more (90 peaks) in MMS-treated cells. This indicates a potential increase in Scm3 chromatin association following MMS treatment. Previous studies have shown that Scm3 is not restricted to centromeres (Xiao et al., 2011; Wisniewski et al., 2014), and cells lacking Scm3 exhibit partial S-phase arrest; this could be the reason why Scm3 binds to a few fragile sites even without DNA damage. Notably, a greater number of Scm3 peaks are observed at fragile sites after MMS exposure; since untreated cells themselves show Scm3 binding to a few fragile sites, the difference is not as apparent. However, this does not change the fact that Scm3 interacts with fragile sites, and rDNA apart from centromeric regions. The presence of Scm3 at fragile sites, even in the absence of drug treatment, and its increased binding after MMS exposure, highlights the potential importance of Scm3 in maintaining genome stability in these vulnerable regions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
