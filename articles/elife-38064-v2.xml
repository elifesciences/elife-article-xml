heavy chain, which causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We examined how <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle responds to this mutation and integratively analyzed the biochemical, physiological and mechanical foundations of the disease. ATPase assays, actin motility, and indirect flight muscle mechanics suggest at least two rate constants of the cross-bridge cycle are altered by the mutation: increased myosin attachment to actin and decreased detachment, yielding prolonged binding. This increases isometric force generation, but also resistive force and work absorption during cyclical contractions, resulting in decreased work, power output, flight ability and degeneration of flight muscle sarcomere morphology. Consistent with prolonged cross-bridge binding serving as the mechanistic basis of the disease and with human phenotypes, <italic>146N</italic>/+ hearts are hypercontractile with increased tension generation periods, decreased diastolic/systolic diameters and myofibrillar disarray. This suggests that screening mutated <italic>Drosophila</italic> hearts could rapidly identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy alleles and treatments.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38064.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Myosin is a motor protein that drives the contraction of muscles. Filaments made from myosin molecules slide between filaments of another protein called actin, tugging the edges of the muscle cell inwards. To achieve this, part of each motor protein – called the 'head' – grabs hold of actin and uses energy to pull on the filaments.</p><p>Small genetic mutations in the gene for myosin can change the shape of the protein. This can change the way that it interacts with actin, altering the molecular machinery that makes muscles contract. In some cases, gene errors can cause the heart muscle wall to thicken, a condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Mapping the locations of known mutations revealed 'hot spots' on the myosin protein where these errors are likely to cause disease. These include the part of the molecule that swings the myosin heads, and the heads themselves.</p><p>It only takes a change to a single letter in the DNA code to thicken the heart wall, but the impact of each possible change is not yet known. Kronert et al. have now genetically modified fruit flies to give them one of the mutations that causes thickening of the heart wall in humans. The mutation, known as K146N, does not appear in one of the well-known 'hot spots'. The experiments revealed that the mutation causes myosin to remain attached to actin for longer than normal. This increased the amount of force the myosin generated, but slowed down actin movement, causing muscle stiffness. This resulted in less power for every cycle of muscle movement, and caused the muscles to degenerate over time. As a result, the flies were less able to use their wings, and their hearts pumped less well.</p><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause death in young adults, particularly competitive athletes. Yet studying the disease in humans is challenging. Recreating myosin mutations in fruit flies provides a way to study hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the laboratory. In the future, extensions to this technique could allow researchers to examine the impact of other mutations. Models like this one could also allow early testing of new drugs or genetic treatments to repair faulty myosin molecules.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle fiber</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>cardiomyopathy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37GM032443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernstein</surname><given-names>Sanford I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL124091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cammarato</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR064274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swank</surname><given-names>Douglas M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rees-Stealy Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trujillo</surname><given-names>Adriana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The content is solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent the official views of the National Institutes of Health.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrative analysis of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy demonstrates that prolonged binding of the myosin cross-bridge to actin is a root cause of the disorder.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heritable hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a leading cause of death among young adults, particularly competitive athletes. This heterogeneous and complex disease typically involves asymmetric growth of the heart, interventricular septum thickening, disorganized cellular architecture, diastolic dysfunction, arrhythmias, and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maron, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maron and Maron, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masarone et al., 2018</xref>). Diastolic dysfunction is characterized by impaired left ventricular relaxation, chamber stiffening, elevated filling pressures, and, consequently, reduced stroke volumes and cardiac output. Enhanced cardiomyocyte contractile activity is a leading hypothesis for the underlying cause of HCM. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the contractile apparatus as well as heightened function of the myosin molecular motor are potential molecular mechanisms. The over-active contractile apparatus can prolong mechanical tension, which apparently initiates hypertrophy via activation of specific signaling cascades that regulate heart growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2016</xref>). Although therapies exist to treat problematic HCM abnormalities, there is no cure. Thus, it is critical to better understand both the disease-causing mutations and the mechanism by which they produce HCM.</p><p>Over 1400 point mutations in sarcomeric proteins cause HCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maron and Maron, 2013</xref>), with the largest number (&gt;300) found in the β-cardiac myosin heavy chain. This myosin II molecule forms sarcomere thick filaments and serves as a molecular motor to drive ATP-dependent movement along actin-containing thin filaments. Mapping the locations of the mutations onto a three-dimensional structure of myosin reveals several hot spots. These include the converter domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colegrave and Peckham, 2014</xref>) and the recently described ‘myosin mesa’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Homburger et al., 2016</xref>). The converter guides the myosin lever arm in its rotation during the power stroke that generates force and motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mesentean et al., 2007</xref>). The myosin mesa has been implicated in enabling formation of an interacting head motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trivedi et al., 2018</xref>), wherein the heads of the dimeric molecule fold together to dampen motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Woodhead et al., 2005</xref>). Several molecular and physiological studies suggest that enhanced ATPase, in vitro actin sliding speed and muscle contractile force and/or velocity correlate with many, but not all, of the HCM-causing myosin mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sommese et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spudich, 2014</xref>). For the domains cited above, this could occur via activation of the lever arm through enhanced converter function or stimulation of myosin cross-bridge initiation through inhibiting the formation of the interacting head motif. The mechanism by which increased contractility results in development of HCM phenotypes remains an active area of investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garfinkel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In this communication, we model a human myosin HCM mutation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, which provides a highly integrative approach that yields unique insights into the disease. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart, although a relatively simple tube-shaped structure, shares numerous gene expression patterns, as well as developmental and functional properties, with the human heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bier and Bodmer, 2004</xref>). Further, the fly system allows evaluation of the effects of a mutation upon isolated myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swank et al., 2000</xref>), as well as on the myofibrillar structure and physiological function of both skeletal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maughan and Vigoreaux, 1999</xref>) and cardiac muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ocorr et al., 2014</xref>). A major advantage of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is its simplified genetics, in that one <italic>Mhc</italic> gene gives rise to all myosin isoforms through alternative RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">George et al., 1989</xref>). Hence compensation by myosin multigene family members that can mask mutant protein effects does not occur. Further, myosin expression levels and tissue-specificity can be controlled by combining <italic>Mhc</italic> transgenes with lines containing <italic>Mhc</italic> alleles that specifically knock out myosin heavy chain expression in the indirect flight muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collier et al., 1990</xref>) or in all muscle types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O'Donnell and Bernstein, 1988</xref>). Previously, using this approach, we showed that a mutant myosin with enhanced ATPase activity yielded disrupted skeletal muscle structure and function and restricted the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cardiac tube to reduce its output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cammarato et al., 2008</xref>). This indicates that <italic>Drosophila</italic> models could yield insights into the basis of HCM through assessing human mutations that cause overactive myosin.</p><p>For the current study, we produced transgenic flies expressing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> equivalent of the K146N human HCM myosin mutation. This mutation was identified in the family of an adult patient with increased left ventricular wall thickness in the absence of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ingles et al., 2005</xref>) and as a spontaneous mutation in a child who displayed left ventricular hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morita et al., 2008</xref>). Residue 146 is particularly interesting in that it does not map to a well-studied HCM hot spot. Instead, it maps near the N-terminus of the protein, which has few HCM-causing mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colegrave and Peckham, 2014</xref>). However, mutational analysis in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruppel et al., 1994</xref>) and a domain swap study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Swank et al., 2003</xref>) suggest that effects on the mechanochemical cycle of myosin might be expected from alterations to the N-terminal region of myosin II molecules. Our molecular modeling predicts that mutation of residue 146 of muscle myosin reduces its interaction with the myosin lever arm during the pre-power stroke state. The myosin S1 head domain is in a cocked position during this state, so that it is prepared to drive the power stroke and muscle contraction upon actin binding during the mechanochemical cycle. We found that the primary result of the 146N mutation is that myosin spends increased time in strongly bound states of the cross-bridge cycle. This prolonged binding of myosin to actin increases force generation, but slows actin motility, decreases cyclical muscle power generation and reduces flight ability. Higher force production and stiffness also cause progressive skeletal and cardiac muscle structural degeneration, and a restricted cardiac phenotype with diastolic dysfunction. Some of our observations, such as the prolonged periods of systolic tension as well as increased ATPase rates, indicate this HCM mutation causes hyperdynamic contractile properties. However, our use of the integrative approach in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> system shows that the mutant phenotype is complex, with reduced functions for a number of other parameters. This emphasizes the need for a comprehensive analysis, from the molecular to organismal levels, which has allowed us to provide key insights into defining the molecular mechanism behind myosin-based HCM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular modeling of myosin residue 146 and predicted effects of the HCM mutation</title><p>We determined the location and interactions for the amino acid residue corresponding to human K146, which in its mutant form (K146N) causes HCM.

The first, small amplitude sinusoidal analysis, involves imposing a 0.125% sinusoidal length change on an active muscle fiber and recording the resultant fiber force output. By measuring the amplitude and phase shift of the force trace relative to the length trace, muscle properties such as muscle stiffness, power, work, and cross-bridge kinetics can be elucidated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawai and Brandt, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swank, 2012</xref>).

Work and power are calculated by plotting the imposed length change versus force and integrating the area inside the resulting loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Josephson, 1985</xref>). Sinusoidal analysis revealed that fibers from homozygotes (<italic>R146N</italic>/<italic>R146N</italic>) and heterozygotes (<italic>R146N</italic>/<italic>+</italic>) showed decreased IFM fiber power generation over the frequency ranges 40–210 Hz and 40–100 Hz, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

The most informative result was observed when plotting [ATP] vs. f<sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). By fitting these data with a Michaelis-Menten curve, we found that the fibers from <italic>R146N</italic> homozygotes had a threefold larger <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value for f<sub>max</sub> than the control, 5.0 ± 1.2 mM vs. 1.5 ± 0.4 mM, respectively, suggesting that the mutant fibers have decreased affinity for ATP. The <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value of fibers from <italic>R146N</italic>/<italic>+ </italic>heterozygotes, 1.6 ± 0.2 mM, was not statistically different from the control. Results obtained from varying phosphate concentration also suggested changes to cross-bridge kinetics. The control fibers showed no change in f<sub>max</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) with increasing [Pi], as is typical of IFM fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swank et al., 2006</xref>). However, fibers from both the homozygous and heterozygous mutants showed that f<sub>max</sub> decreased as [Pi] increased, with plots showing significantly steeper slopes than the control. This decrease is typically attributed to phosphate competing with ATP for the rigor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pate and Cooke, 1989</xref>), again suggesting lower affinity of the mutant fibers for ATP.</p><p>If R146N myosin spends a longer time in strongly bound states than control myosin, one would expect increased stiffness and isometric tension generation in muscle fibers. We indeed found that fiber active stiffness, measured by oscillating fibers at 500 Hz, was greater than control levels at all ATP concentrations tested, for fibers from both <italic>R146N</italic>/<italic>+ </italic>heterozygous and <italic>R146N</italic> homozygous organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Likewise, fibers from both heterozygous and homozygous flies showed total calcium-activated isometric tension levels that were at least 1.5-fold greater than the control at all ATP concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, analysis of passive (relaxed) isometric tension at pCa 8.0 revealed that some of the increase in isometric tension is due to an increase in passive tension, particularly for heterozygous fibers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that more cross-bridges were binding to actin at low calcium concentrations in the mutant fibers compared to control. Based on the muscle mechanics results, it appears that the R146N mutation changes at least two rates of the cross-bridge cycle. The mutation increases a cross-bridge rate associated with myosin attachment to actin and/or the power stroke, and decreases a rate associated with ATP-induced myosin detachment from actin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>R146N myosin decreases flight ability</title><p>We assessed the effects of R146N myosin on IFM function by testing flight ability.

This interaction is abolished by the R146N mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which would reduce the stability of the pre-power stroke molecule. This could drive the cycle forward by enhancing ATP hydrolysis and the production of cross-bridges, possibly contributing to prolonged actin binding. A similar mechanism may occur for human β-cardiac myosin as well, since the analogous K146 residue is also predicted to interact with E775 in the pre-power stroke state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and this contact is destroyed by the K146N mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Omecamtiv mecarbil enhances the actin attachment rate and the duty ratio and slows in vitro motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), similar to the effects that we observed with R146N myosin. In contrast to our findings, ATPase activity in the absence of actin is inhibited by the compound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). However, the rate of phosphate release is increased upon actin binding. While the R146N mutation enhances basal activity, which may arise from destabilization of the pre-power stroke state, omecamtiv mecarbil appears to stabilize this state prior to actin interaction, including facilitation of a weak charge-based interaction between K146 and E774 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Further clinical evidence supports the importance of these interactions in relationship to HCM, in that mutation of E774 to V774 also yields HCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moric et al., 2003</xref>). More rapid cross-bridge formation due to the R146N or E774V mutations destabilizing the pre-power stroke state coupled with decreased detachment rates (see below) stabilize actin-myosin interaction, leading to enhanced force production and decreased actin filament in vitro motility. A similar outcome could arise from omecamtiv mecarbil increasing the number of molecules in the pre-power stroke state, which would increase the number of attached cross-bridges as the myosin molecules move through the mechanochemical cycle.</p><p>Although myosin attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brizendine et al., 2017</xref>) and detachment rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harris and Warshaw, 1993</xref>) both influence the duty ratio (the fraction of time myosin is strongly bound to actin during a mechanochemical cycle), the latter is thought to have the major influence on in vitro motility at high myosin concentrations. Thus, the ~50% decrease in the rate of actin movement in vitro for R146N myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) is likely facilitated by the decreased actin detachment rate suggested by our fiber mechanics measurements. We observed a decrease in apparent rate constant 2πc (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), a measure of rates associated with myosin detachment from actin, which includes detachment induced by ADP release and ATP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawai and Brandt, 1980</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further, our observed increase in ATP <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> in the fiber studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) suggests decreased ATP affinity, which would slow the ATP-induced detachment rate of myosin from actin. This is supported by the trends showing decreases in f<sub>max</sub> with increasing phosphate concentration for the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which does not occur in control myosin. f<sub>max</sub> is most likely being slowed by phosphate competing with ATP for the rigor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pate and Cooke, 1989</xref>). Normally, increasing phosphate either has no effect (as seen in the control) or causes f<sub>max</sub> and 2πb to increase (as seen in many slow vertebrate muscle types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawai et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Siemankowski et al., 1985</xref>]). Overall, the increase in attachment and decrease in detachment rate, in concert with no change in actin-activated ATPase rate arising from the mutation, indicate an increase in duty ratio. In addition to slowed in vitro motility, an increase in duty ratio would cause the increased fiber tension generation and stiffness that we observed from analysis of elastic modulus values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).</p><p>The increased duty ratio is also expected to negatively influence mutant IFM power generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The major cause of power loss is likely decreased net work production, given that there was relatively little change in optimal frequency for muscle power generation (f<sub>max</sub>). Lack of change in f<sub>max</sub> may be due to increased actin attachment and phosphate release being balanced by reduced ATP-induced detachment rate. Work production, however, was decreased proportionally to power for homozygous fibers examined via sinusoidal analysis, and for both homozygous and heterozygous fibers when measured using the work loop technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). When amplitude and length change conditions were optimized for power generation, the ratio of work absorption to work generation was increased in the mutants compared to control fibers. Tellingly, decreasing optimal muscle length change amplitude allowed the mutant fibers to generate more power (compare optimal power work loops with work loops performed under the identical length change and frequency conditions). This indicates that less muscle stretching was beneficial because it decreased work absorbed, resulting in more net work and hence more power. It appears that increased time of cross-bridge attachment causes cross-bridge elements to act more like brakes or shock absorbers during cyclical power generation. These abnormally high stresses on the myofilaments likely result in the disruption of sarcomere integrity that develops over time in the IFM expressing the mutant myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), as well as the reduced flight ability and WBF (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis of the heart tube in <italic>R146N</italic>/+ heterozygotes produced results that support the thesis that an increased myosin duty ratio yields significant mutant phenotypes. While the hearts in the mutants did not show a change in heart period (suggesting no overall change in kinetics, in agreement with no change for f<sub>max</sub> in IFM and for actin-activated ATPase), the heart spent a greater portion of each heart period in systole compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This is consistent with prolonged contractions arising from increased myosin attachment kinetics and a decreased detachment rate. An enhanced attachment rate would also increase the rate of force generation, which may partially account for the restricted cardiac phenotype. The reduced fractional shortening observed for the <italic>R146N</italic>/+ heart may correspond to its optimal pumping mode, mimicking the improved IFM fiber mechanical performance at shorter muscle length changes. At the ultrastructural level, the observed myofibrillar discontinuity in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) could be caused by the same mechanism as IFM degeneration, that is, excessive tension generation disrupting the integrity of the sarcomeric ultrastructure. We did not detect hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes in <italic>R146N</italic>/+ heterozygotes, although it has been shown that hypertrophy can occur in the conical chamber of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart as a result of abnormal receptor tyrosine kinase pathway signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). It is important to note, however, that there is significant variability in the presence and degree of hypertrophy detected in patients carrying the <italic>146N</italic> mutation (personal communication from Jodie Ingles, Sydney Medical School), suggesting that interacting genes or environment may play a role in hypertrophy.</p><p>Interestingly, our data suggest that cross-bridges in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart bind to thin filaments via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent mechanisms during diastole. This contributes to impaired relaxation. Our results imply that small amounts of diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> promote contraction and yield slightly shortened cardiomyocytes at rest in both mutant and control lines. However, based upon the greater diameter increase (greater tension drop) in <italic>R146N</italic>/+ hearts compared to control hearts upon extra- and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation with EGTA/EGTA,AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), disruption of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling in the mutant appears likely, which may promote the restricted cardiac tube phenotype. Therefore, it is possible that perturbation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-handling in <italic>R146N</italic>/+ mutant fly hearts, as is frequently observed in human cardiomyopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranias and Bers, 2007</xref>), results in excessive diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, yielding enhancement of cell shortening and elevated basal tone. Additionally, the higher duty ratio of R146N myosin could indirectly enhance the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the cross-bridges through thin filament activation. Full thin filament activation requires both Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to troponin and strong binding of cross-bridges. Thus, a higher duty-ratio myosin will have a greater number of myosin molecules strongly bound at a lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration than a lower-duty-ratio myosin. We experimentally demonstrated this when we expressed the high-duty-ratio EMB myosin in the jump muscle, which caused enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity for tension development compared to jump muscle myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eldred et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the same concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the <italic>R146N</italic>/+ mutant heart would generate higher force than in the control, yielding decreased cardiac diameters.</p><p>Our analysis with blebbistatin, which impedes acto-myosin cycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kovács et al., 2004</xref>), indicates that a portion of the cross-bridges responsible for diastolic tone is calcium-independent in both control and <italic>R146N</italic>/+ hearts. Treatment with the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) shows that there is a greater diameter increase in <italic>R146N</italic>/+ hearts than in control hearts, suggesting an enhanced number of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent cross-bridges. This enhancement likely arises from the higher on-rate (actin affinity), which contributes to the restricted phenotype and impaired relaxation observed in <italic>R146N</italic>/+ mutant hearts.</p><p>Increased cross-bridge availability could also result from disruption of the super-relaxed state that has been documented in both skeletal and cardiac muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hooijman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stewart et al., 2010</xref>). This state correlates with the presence of the interacting head motif, wherein the dimeric heads of myosin molecules interact to reduce their actin binding and ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Trivedi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Woodhead et al., 2005</xref>). Disruption of this motif by mutation is linked to myosin activation that correlates with HCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alamo et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nag et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, myosin is found in its pre-power stroke configuration in the interacting head motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alamo et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alamo et al., 2016</xref>) and disturbance of this state of filament packing by the R146N mutation could reduce the number of molecules in the super-relaxed state. This would enhance myosin activity within the myofibril, leading to the phenotypes we observed. <italic>Drosophila</italic> myosins are indeed capable of entering the interacting head motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), but the presence of the super-relaxed state in thick filaments or muscle fibers is yet to be documented.</p><p>In summary, our integrative analysis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> analogue of the K146N human HCM mutation revealed increases in several, but not all, contractile parameters, as posited for a general mechanism of action for HCM mutations in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Spudich, 2014</xref>). Notably, enhancements in basal ATPase rate, length of systole and cross-bridge binding are concordant with these expectations. Further, the restricted phenotype and reduced fractional shortening observed in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart mimic the diastolic dysfunction/impaired relaxation and reduced ejection fraction that can accompany HCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maron, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maron and Maron, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Masarone et al., 2018</xref>). The restricted phenotype observed in our model of an HCM mutant, as well as the restricted phenotypes arising from a hyperactive myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cammarato et al., 2008</xref>) or mutant troponin T or actin that enhance myosin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Viswanathan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viswanathan et al., 2017</xref>), suggest that restriction is a common phenotype produced in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cardiac tube due to over-active cross-bridges. If all or most HCM mutations have increased force production as their basis, the restricted cardiac tube phenotype in <italic>Drosophila</italic> could serve as a useful screening tool for determining whether specific human mutations are causative of HCM. The fly might also serve to illuminate conserved signaling pathways that lead from contractile protein mutations to HCM. Further, the amelioration of the mutant phenotype through genetic or drug screens in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may yield insights into potential treatments for human HCM.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein structure modeling</title><p>Scallop muscle myosin II crystal structures in the pre-power stroke state (PDB 1QVI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gourinath et al., 2003</xref>) and the actin-detached post-power stroke state (PDB 1KK8) were used as templates to predict <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human myosin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Himmel et al., 2002</xref>).

The power measurement from cycles 7 or 8 was used because the power values become consistent after cycle 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramanath et al., 2011</xref>). The fiber was then stretched by 1% ML and sinusoidal analysis repeated at 0.125% amplitude before any further experiments were performed to ensure fiber integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>ATP and phosphate response</title><p>The standard fiber activating solution was first exchanged to increase the ATP concentration from 12 mM to 20 mM. Sinusoidal analysis was then performed at decreasing ATP concentrations of 20.0, 15.0, 12.5, 10.0, 7.5, 5.0, 2.5, 2.0, 1.0, 0.75 and 0.5 mM by exchanging with the appropriate amount of 0 mM ATP activating solution. Similar to the ATP response, activating solution was exchanged so that [Pi] = 0 mM, and then the concentration of phosphate was sequentially increased to 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 mM by exchanging in appropriate amounts of a 20 mM phosphate activating solution before performing sinusoidal analysis. All solutions were made so that the ionic strength did not change when calcium, ATP or Pi was varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swank, 2012</xref>). High ATP solution was the same as relaxing solution with the following modifications: pCa 5.0, 20 mM ATP, 37 mM creatine phosphate, 450 U/ml CPK, and 260 mM ionic strength. Low ATP was the same as high ATP, except for 0 mM ATP. High Pi was the same as high ATP, except for 13 mM ATP and 20 mM Pi. Low Pi was the same as high ATP, except 13 mM ATP and 0 mM Pi.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Sinusoidal analysis</title><p>Sinusoidal analysis was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swank, 2012</xref>). Briefly, the muscle fiber was oscillated at 50 different frequencies, from 0.5 Hz to 650 Hz. Each oscillation was 0.125% ML and the elastic and viscous modulus were calculated from the amplitude and phase differences. Work and power were calculated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al. (2014</xref>). To determine fiber apparent rate constants, the complex modulus was fit with the equation Y(f) = A (2π if/α)k − B if /(b + if) + C if/ (c + if) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kawai and Brandt (1980)</xref>, and described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Swank (2012</xref>). The b frequency value is most influenced by work producing steps of the cross-bridge cycle, while the c frequency value is most influenced by work absorbing steps. Frequencies b and c are multiplied by 2π to convert from frequency to time (s<sup>−1</sup>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Flight assays</title><p>Two- and 7-day-old homozygotes for each of the three transgenic lines and controls were tested for flight ability in an <italic>Mhc<sup>10</sup></italic> background at 22<sup>°</sup>C.

Your article has been reviewed by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lee Sweeney (Reviewer #1); Justin E Molloy (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart condition involving abnormal heart structures and dysregulated cardiac functions. Mutations linked to HCM have been found in genes encoding proteins responsible for cardiac muscle contractility such as cardiac muscle myosins and troponins. However, it is not well understood how these mutations affect the encoded proteins and consequently cause HCM.</p><p>In this manuscript, Kronert et al., report an integrative study using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant model on an HCM mutation, R146N, in the human cardiac myosin heavy chain gene (K146N is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> equivalent), to investigate a potential molecular mechanism underlying HCM. Structurally, the 146N mutation abolishes a salt bridge between the motor domain and the lever arm and presumably destabilizes the pre-power stroke state pf the myosin head. Biochemically, the 146N mutation enhanced ATPase activity of myosin and decreased actin filament sliding. Kinetically, 146N mutant muscles exhibited reduced work and power output. The biochemical and kinetics data suggests that the mutant myosin spends a longer time in strongly bound cross-bridge states. Degeneration in skeletal and cardiac muscles and decrease in flight ability occurred in 146N mutant flies in an age-dependent manner.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle, the 146N mutation appears to model the key aspects of a human mutation that has been suggested to interfere with interactions of cross-bridge packing rather than cross-bridge kinetics. The impact of such mutations cannot be properly assessed in solution and thus <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles may provide an important model system for determining the impact of human HCM-causing mutations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers are all enthusiastic about the work, which they feel is of the highest quality and should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the comments of the reviewers should be addressed prior to publication. This will improve the readability and impact of the paper for a general audience. For the most part, this is more a matter of presentation and discussion, and not a need for further experimentation, so the authors should be able to accomplish this quickly. There is a request for additional modeling and structural information, which may or may not have already been done but not presented.</p><p>1) The significance the work is the fact that the impact of the mutation might have been restricted to cardiac muscle of vertebrates, but it is not. Not only does this allow for the use as <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model organism to assess human HCM mutations, but it begs a broader discussion of the mechanism. The authors model the potential electrostatic interactions made by R146N and the lever arm and postulate that loss of this interaction might destabilize the pre-power stroke (PPS) state, which is supported by an increase in the actin-independent ATPase activity. However, they stop short in connecting this concept to the potential importance of this state for the myosin head packing during relaxation, which has been termed the super-relaxed state. There seems to be conservation of the head packing interactions, which were first described for single molecules of regulated smooth muscle myosin and has since been shown to fit the head-head interactions of myosin in filaments from tarantula muscle as well as in vertebrate cardiac muscle. This conservation of the packing is striking and must be the basis of what is happening in the flies as well. It has been modeled, and data confirms, that the PPS state is the state in which the myosin heads interact and pack, so anything that destabilizes the PPS conformation would be expected to disrupt the packing of the heads on the filament. This point is not stressed and yet is the real take home message.</p><p>2) The &quot;myosin mesa&quot; hypothesis really refers to the idea that for a large subset of the HCM mutations, the mutation does not directly alter the kinetics of the head, but instead disrupts the filament packing of the heads, which leads to effects such as reported for the R146N mutation of this paper. This should be emphasized, and some modeling of the impact of the R146N mutation on the packing of cardiac myosin heads into the filament would have been helpful. This could be added to Figure 1, but at the very least, further discussion should be added.</p><p>3) <italic>R146N/+</italic> heterozygous flies displayed myofibrillar discontinuity suggesting a dominant effect of this mutation on cardiac ultrastructure. The IFM from <italic>R146N/+</italic> heterozygotes also exhibited changes in power and work generation and cross-bridge kinetics. However, the authors did not present the IFM structure and the flight ability of the heterozygous flies. Is there an age-related delay in structural disruptions, since IFM myofibrils were deteriorated in older flies (7 day adults)? The authors suggested that this deterioration results from mechanical stress during muscle use. To strengthen this conclusion, transgenic flies of the same ages without muscle use could be examined. If there is no defect in the structure and the function of IFM (somatic muscle) in the heterozygotes at the ages presented, in contrast to the cardiac muscle, please discuss what properties of the two muscles can cause this difference. This is a significant point if the authors are using somatic muscles to investigate a cardiac muscle mutation.</p><p>4) The R146N mutation recapitulated some pathological phenomena of HCM such as disorganized myofibrils and diastolic dysfunction in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, the authors did not observe the hypertrophic effect on skeletal and cardiac muscles. The authors discussed that it might be consistent to the 'significant variability in the presence and degree of hypertrophy detected in patients carry the 146N mutation'.

We have added a paragraph to the Discussion section that introduces the super-relaxed state (SRX). We indicate how the interacting head motif appears to be the basis for SRX. We then state that the pre-power stroke state is found in the SRX and hence its likely disruption from the R146N mutation could enhance cross-bridge binding, leading to the phenotypes we have documented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The &quot;myosin mesa&quot; hypothesis really refers to the idea that for a large subset of the HCM mutations, the mutation does not directly alter the kinetics of the head, but instead disrupts the filament packing of the heads, which leads to effects such as reported for the R146N mutation of this paper.

We point out that disruption of filament packing could be a key element in the effect of the R146N mutation. Further, we indicate that we have recently shown (with Roger Craig) that <italic>Drosophila</italic> myosins are capable of forming the interacting head motif (Lee et al., 2018). However, the IHM and SRX have not yet been documented in <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle and the observed phenotypes may be explained without invoking disruption of SRX. So, while we provided the requested further discussion, we felt that modeling of filament packing would be premature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) R146N/+ heterozygous flies displayed myofibrillar discontinuity suggesting a dominant effect of this mutation on cardiac ultrastructure.

We found a statistically significant reduction in flight ability at room temperature in two-day-old heterozygotes compared to controls (now mentioned in the Results). We now include a developmental series of electron micrographs as Figure 3—figure supplement 1. Here we show that assembly and structure are normal in the late pupa and two-hour-old adult, but there is minor myofibril deterioration at two days. While we have not assessed older heterozygous adults or determined whether muscle disuse prevents deterioration, it is clear that muscle function and structure (at least to some extent) are compromised in a dominant fashion, as is the case in the heart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The R146N mutation recapitulated some pathological phenomena of HCM such as disorganized myofibrils and diastolic dysfunction in Drosophila. However, the authors did not observe the hypertrophic effect on skeletal and cardiac muscles.

Since hypertrophy in Drosophila heart can occur due to abnormal cell proliferation from misregulated EGFR-Ras-Raf signaling (Yu et al., 2013), it would be interesting to test if increased stress by 146N mutation on Drosophila heart has an additive or synergistic effect on hypertrophy caused by abnormal RTK signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>While a hypertrophic response in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cardiac tube was not resolved in our studies, our primary goal was to uncover the mechanical effects of a human HCM-causing mutation in myosin across the molecular, myofibrillar, cellular, and tissue scales and, thereby, provide key insights into defining the mechanism behind K146N myosin-based cardiomyopathy. We believe we accomplished this goal. We would like to emphasize that Yu et al., (2013) reported that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in fly hearts was characterized by decreased end diastolic lumen dimensions that resulted from abnormal cardiomyocyte fiber morphology and increased heart wall thickness, rather than abnormal cell proliferation. According to the authors there were no changes in cardiomyocyte cell numbers. Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to determine the effects of the myosin mutation in the context of abnormal receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. In fact, such genetic interaction experiments are perfectly suited for the fly model. However, we feel these experiments are non-trivial to perform and are well beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
