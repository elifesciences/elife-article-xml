Although reduced ERα level is the major cause of tamoxifen resistance, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we report that FRMD8 raises the level of ERα at both transcriptional and post-translational layers. FRMD8 deficiency in <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic> mice accelerates mammary tumor growth and loss of luminal phenotype, and confers tamoxifen resistance. Single-cell RNA profiling reveals that Frmd8 loss decreases the proportion of hormone-sensing differentiated epithelial cells and downregulates the levels of ERα. Mechanically, on one hand, loss of FRMD8 inhibits <italic>ESR1</italic> transcription via suppressing the expression of FOXO3A, a transcription factor of <italic>ESR1</italic>. On the other hand, FRMD8 interacts both with ERα and UBE3A, and disrupts the interaction of UBE3A with ERα, thereby blocking UBE3A-mediated ERα degradation. In breast cancer patients, <italic>FRMD8</italic> gene promoter is found hypermethylated and low level of FRMD8 predicts poor prognosis. Therefore, FRMD8 is an important regulator of ERα and may control therapeutic sensitivity to tamoxifen in ERα-positive breast cancer patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sung et al., 2021</xref>), and more than 70% of breast cancer are estrogen receptor α (ERα)-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Habara and Shimada, 2022</xref>). Although endocrine therapy is the most common systemic treatment for ERα-positive breast cancer in clinical practice, approximately 40% of patients still develop primary or secondary resistance to endocrine therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Légaré and Basik, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Rondón-Lagos et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to explore the mechanisms of endocrine therapy resistance and search for new therapeutic targets.</p><p>ERα is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is activated by estrogen and promotes cell proliferation during breast cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Harbeck et al., 2019</xref>). Tamoxifen (TAM), a selective estrogen receptor antagonist, is the most widely used medicine in endocrine therapy. Tamoxifen competes with estrogen to bind with ERα and changes the conformation of ERα, thereby preventing the interaction between co-activators and ERα and inhibiting activation of ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Katzenellenbogen et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the level of ERα is strongly correlated with reactivity and resistance of endocrine therapy. Uncovering the mechanisms by which ERα expression is regulated is essential for overcoming endocrine therapy resistance. Multiple transcription factors, such as AP-2γ, FOXO3, FOXM1, and GATA3, have been reported to bind to the promoter region of <italic>ESR1</italic>, the gene encoding ERα, and participate in transcriptional regulation of <italic>ESR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Jia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kos et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, post-translational modifications of ERα, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination, also have effects on subcellular localization, transcriptional activity, and stability of ERα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Rogatsky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Williams et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zhou and Slingerland, 2014</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of ERα expression are still not clear and require further investigation.</p><p>FERM domain-containing proteins are widely involved in processes such as the formation of macromolecular complexes, subcellular localization, functional activation, and signal transduction, thereby regulating the occurrence and development of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Frame et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Moleirinho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zhan and Zhang, 2018</xref>). FRMD8, as a member of FERM domain-containing proteins, has been reported to bind with iRhom and enhance the stability of the iRhom/TACE complex on the cell surface, thereby preventing iRhom/TACE degradation mediated by lysosomes. TACE is responsible for cleaving and releasing TNF, and the absence of FRMD8 impairs the production of TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Künzel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Oikonomidi et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, FRMD8 expressions in both microenvironment and tumor cells promote lung tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badenes et al., 2023</xref>). FRMD8 inhibits colon cancer growth by preventing cell cycle progression. FRMD8 disrupts the interaction of CDK7 with CDK4, subsequently inhibiting CDK4 activation. Furthermore, FRMD8 competes with MDM2 to bind RB, thereby attenuating MDM2-mediated RB degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yu et al., 2023</xref>). However, the roles of FRMD8 in breast tumorigenesis and progression need further exploration.</p><p>In this study, we found that loss of Frmd8 in luminal epithelial cells of <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice accelerates mammary tumor progression and luminal epithelial phenotype loss, and confers tamoxifen resistance. Single-cell RNA profiling reveals that the number of hormone-sensing differentiated cells is diminished and the level of ERα is decreased in Frmd8-knocked-out mammary tumors. FRMD8 not only increases <italic>ESR1</italic> expression, but also prevents ERα degradation by interrupting the interaction between ERα and the E3 ligase UBE3A. Further, a low FRMD8 level predicts poor prognosis in human breast cancer patients. Thus, we demonstrated that FRMD8 is an important ERα regulator and a vital tumor suppressive protein in breast cancer growth and drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of Frmd8 promotes mammary tumor growth and generates tamoxifen resistance <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To examine whether FRMD8 plays a role in breast tumorigenesis, we established luminal epithelium-specific <italic>Frmd8</italic> knockout mice (<italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and further generated a Frmd8-deletion breast cancer mouse model (<italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>PyMT</italic>) by crossing <italic>MMTV-Cre</italic><sup>+</sup>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> (<italic>PyMT</italic>) mice, a widely used transgenic mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

In this study, our results suggested that FRMD8 inhibits mammary tumor progression in <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice.

Additionally, Hsd epithelial cells exhibited the lowest CNV score, indicating a closer resemblance to normal epithelial cells. The loss of Frmd8 reduced the proportion of Hsd epithelial cells and led to a downregulation of ERα and PR expression, implying that Frmd8 deficiency promotes the loss of luminal features in the mammary gland and accelerates mammary tumor progression.</p><p>In this study, we identified that loss of FRMD8 inhibiting <italic>ESR1</italic> expression through downregulating the level of FOXO3A. FOXO3A locates in nucleus and blocks cell cycle progression via activating the cell cycle blocking protein p27<sup>KIP1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Seoane et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, FOXO3A contributes to cell death through a Fas ligand-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Seoane et al., 2004</xref>). Phosphorylated FOXO3A mediated by AKT binds to 14-3-3 protein and remains in the cytoplasm, resulting in loss of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arden, 2004</xref>). Thus, FRMD8 may also be involved in the regulation of cell cycle or apoptosis in an ERα-independent manner by regulating FOXO3A.

Quantitative real-time PCR, carried out in triplicate, was used to assess relative mRNA levels and was standardized to <italic>GAPDH</italic> expression. The cDNA products were amplified using the LightCycler 96 (Roche) platform, and data were subsequently analyzed through LightCycler 96 (Roche) along with GraphPad Prism 7.0 software. All relevant primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Histology and immunohistochemistry staining</title><p>Tissues were preserved in 4% PFA, embedded in paraffin, and then sliced into 5 μm sections prior to staining. Following deparaffinization and rehydration, these sections were subject to H&amp;E staining for structural examination. Immunohistochemistry staining was executed using the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method, with subsequent detection of 3'3'-diaminobenzidine as guided by the manufacturer’s instructions (Dako, Agilent Pathology Solutions). Observations and imaging were performed using an Olympus BX51 microscope coupled with an Olympus DP73 CCD photography system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Tumor tissue microarray (TMA) immunohistochemistry analysis</title><p>Human breast carcinoma TMA (HBre-Duc140Sur-01) was purchased from Shanghai Biochip. Patient information of TMA is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. Immunohistochemistry staining for FRMD8 in TMA was performed as described above. The stained microarrays were evaluated by a pathologist blind to cancer outcomes. Based on histological evaluations, staining reactivity was categorized into four levels: absence of reactivity (score = 0), weak reactivity (score = 1), moderate reactivity (score = 2), and intense reactivity (score = 3 or 4).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Multiple immunohistochemistry staining and analysis</title><p>Multicolor immunohistochemistry was conducted using the TissueGnostics Multiple IHC Assay Kit (TissueGnostics, TGFP550) on mammary tumors from mice. Tumors were preserved in 4% PFA, embedded in paraffin, and then sliced into 5 μm sections prior to staining. The sections were then deparaffinized and hydrated, followed by antigen retrieval in a Tris-EDTA buffer via microwave. Slides underwent treatment with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at ambient temperature to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. For iterative rounds of cyclic staining, slides were treated with blocking solution, then incubated with the primary antibody either overnight at 4℃ or for 2 h at 37℃, and subsequently with HRP-linked secondary antibody at 37℃ for 30 min. Signal was enhanced using Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) reagents. Antigen retrieval buffer was applied once more, and the aforementioned steps were repeated for additional staining. Lastly, DAPI was used for 10 min to stain nuclei. Tissue images were captured using the tissue faxs platform (TissueGnostics).</p><p>Immunofluorescence image quantification was carried out via StrataQuest v7.0.158 software (TissueGnostics). Cells were identified based on DAPI staining, and the expression levels of Frmd8, ERα, PR, and CK8 were calculated by the software, measuring fluorescence intensity and area to enumerate positively stained cells. The threshold for identifying positive cells was set by inspecting cell recognition on the original image using the View Backward Data function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq)</title><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing libraries were meticulously prepared utilizing the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v3 according to the protocols recommended by 10×Genomics. Briefly, an initial quantity of approximately 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells, which had been sorted through fluorescence-activated cell sorting, underwent a triple wash process in DPBS containing 0.04% BSA. These cells were subsequently resuspended to a final concentration of 700–1200 cells/μl, with a minimum viability threshold of 85%. During the library preparation process, cells were encapsulated within droplets to facilitate a precise targeted recovery rate. After the reverse transcription phase, the generated emulsions were disrupted, and the barcoded cDNA was isolated using Dynabeads technology. This was followed by PCR amplification to enrich the cDNA pool. The amplified cDNA served as the template for constructing the 3’ gene expression libraries. Specifically, for this construction phase, 50 ng of the amplified cDNA was fragmented and subjected to end repair. This material was then subjected to a double-size selection process using SPRIselect beads. The prepared libraries were sequenced on NovaSeq system provided by Illumina, generating 150 bp paired-end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Single-cell RNA sequence original data process</title><p>Prior to commencing the analysis, cellular data underwent a stringent filtering process. Cells with unique molecular identifier counts below 30,000 and those exhibiting gene counts within the range of 200–5000 were excluded. Additionally, cells displaying a mitochondrial content exceeding 20% were also removed from further analysis. Following this preprocessing step, the Seurat package (version 2.3) was employed for both dimensionality reduction and cluster identification. The normalization and scaling of gene expression data were accomplished using the NormalizeData and ScaleData functions, respectively. Subsequently, the FindVariableFeatures function facilitated the selection of the 2000 genes demonstrating the most significant variation for principal component analysis. Cluster identification was achieved through the FindClusters function, which partitioned the genes into distinct groups. To mitigate batch effects across samples, the Harmony package was utilized. The refined dataset was then visualized in a two-dimensional space employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection techniques, thereby providing insightful representations of the underlying cellular heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Chromosomal copy-number variations estimation</title><p>The estimation of chromosomal copy-number variations (CNVs) was conducted utilizing the ‘inferCNV’ R package. A diverse reference panel comprised of B cells, T cells, NK cells, macrophages, and other immune cells facilitated this analysis. Quantification of CNV scores for each subcluster was achieved by aggregating the CNV levels observed across the constituent cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests, Mann–Whitney test, one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). Data are presented as mean ±the standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was defined as p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility at Laboratory Animal Center of Peking University Health Science Center with a 12 h light/dark cycle, constant temperature and humidity, and fed standard rodent chow and water ad libitum.

Whether FRMD8 can become a biomarker should be verified in large clinical samples or clinical data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your recognition and valuable suggestions. The proliferation of ERα-positive breast cancer cells is contingent upon the expression of ERα. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, competitively binds to ERα, thereby inhibiting the activation of the proliferation signaling pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated that the downregulation of ERα expression results in a reduction in the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen (PMID: 15894097; PMID: 922747). Our study revealed the molecular mechanism by which FRMD8 regulates ERα expression through FOXO3A and UBE3A, and thus FRMD8 deficiency is a cause of tamoxifen treatment resistance.</p><p>In this study, our results showed that low expression of FRMD8 predicts poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. We agree with this reviewer and will validate the role of FRMD8 in more patient samples and expand its application in different cancer types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript presents a valuable finding on the impact of FRMD8 loss on tumor progression and the resistance to tamoxifen therapy.

We have carefully revised the manuscript again.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>This manuscript suggests that the resistance of tamoxifen in breast cancer is linked to the loss of function of FRMD8. This is a relatively good and valuable contribution. However, there are several points that confused me.</p><p>(1) The subfigures with important conclusions should include quantitative analysis, for example, Figure 4D, 4E, and 6A. In Figure 6F, which subtypes of normal and tumor tissues were investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful suggestions. We have quantified the bands in Figure 4D, 4E, and 6A and labelled them in the figures.</p><p>We have also provided details of the tumor samples in Table S3 and the “Materials and Methods” section. The majority of tumor tissues are invasive ductal carcinomas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the luminal epithelium-specific Frmd8 knockout mice (<italic>MMTV-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic>; <italic>Frmd8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), the authors demonstrated that the loss of FRMD8 promotes the growth of breast tumors. In Figure 3A, the expression of ERα and PR in tumors is nearly negative. However, why was the validation of the mechanism performed in breast tumor cell lines and not in epithelial cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the question. Early-stage mammary tumors in <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice express ERα, while ERα is negative in advanced tumors of <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice. Figure 3A shows the results of tumors from four-month-old mice. Meanwhile, our supplementary results showed that loss of Frmd8 decreased ERα expression also in normal and atypical hyperplasia mammary tissues from 7-week-old <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice, when the mice had no palpable tumors and ERα is positive (Fig. S3E). We believe that the absence of FRMD8 contributes to the acceleration of the malignant progression during the dynamic evolution of breast cancer. Limited by the difficulty of transfection in breast normal epithelial cell line (MCF10A), we explored the subsequent mechanisms mainly in breast cancer cells and HEK293, a human embryonic kidney cell line. Besides, Figure S3E also showed the regulation of ERα expression by Frmd8 in mouse mammary</p><p>epithelial cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) To explore the mechanism by which FRMD8 inhibits ERα degradation, what is the reason for choosing HEK293A?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the good question. HEK293 cell line is commonly used in mechanistic studies. We also employed the breast cancer cell line T47D to verify the observations in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the mass spectrometry result of HEK293A cells presented in Figure 5E was an additional experiment performed when we were exploring the regulation of the cell cycle by FRMD8, which is published in Cell Reports (PMID: 37527040). Based on the mass spectrometry result, we assumed that FRMD8 may influence ERα degradation mediated by UBE3A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Introduction</p><p>(1) In order for the reader to better understand the content of the article, it is better to briefly describe the role of ERα in the progression of breast cancer.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have provided a brief description of the role of ERα in the introduction of revised manuscript:</p><p>“ERα is a ligand-activated transcription factor that is activated by oestrogen, and promotes cell proliferation during breast cancer development (Harbeck et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) As ESR1 is mentioned in the second paragraph, a brief description of the relationship between ESR1 and ERα can make the article more logical.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have added the description in the introduction:</p><p>“Multiple transcription factors, such as AP-2γ, FOXO3, FOXM1, and GATA3, have been reported to bind to the promoter region of <italic>ESR1</italic>, the gene encoding ERα, and participate in transcriptional regulation of <italic>ESR1</italic>(Jia et al., 2019; Koš et al., 2001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the text, there are two variations of the term FRMD8: 'FRMD8' and 'Frmd8'. It is best to standardize on one form throughout the document.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion. The terms &quot;FRMD8&quot; and &quot;Frmd8&quot; are used to indicate proteins derived from human and mouse, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>(4) In Figure 2L, there is no noticeable difference in the expression levels of Pgr and Esr1 between the Cre+ tumor and Cre- tumor groups. Figure S2E is more suitable for inclusion in the main text compared to Figure 2L.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. ERα and PR are positive in early-stage mammary tumors of <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice, while ERα and PR are gradually lost as the tumor progresses. In figure 2, mammary tumors from 4-month-old <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice were subjected to scRNA-seq analysis. Since the expression of ERα was very low in tumor cells at this time, there appears to be no difference between the two groups. We have exchanged Figure 2L and Figure S2E in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The CNV score can be used to assess the malignancy of cells, it would be better to compare the malignancy levels between the two groups.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good suggestion. However, copy number variations usually occur randomly and have a high degree of heterogeneity. Due to the limited sample size in our study, we did not compare the difference between the two groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Enrichment analysis is crucial for single-cell sequencing studies.

We have performed differential gene analysis and biological process enrichment analysis on the results of scRNA sequence using the gene ontology (GO) database. Our results showed that upregulated genes in luminal progenitor (Lp) epithelial cells were enriched in epithelial cell proliferation and transmembrane receptor protein serine/threonine kinase signaling pathways, suggesting that Frmd8 deficiency significantly promotes epithelial cells proliferation in <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101888-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The coherent logic in lines 300 to 308 should be that FRMD8 is expressed at higher levels in normal Hsd epithelial cells in mice, hence further verification was conducted to examine the expression levels of FRMD8 in various human breast cancer cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the figures and text as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion</p><p>(8) In lines 352 to 360, the background narrative in the first half seems to have little connection with the research findings in the second half; it is suggested to reorganize the language of this section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the advice. We have rewritten this paragraph in the manuscript:</p><p>“In <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice, early-stage mammary tumors express ERα and PR, but these receptors are gradually lost as the tumor progresses (Lapidus et al., 1998). Our scRNA-seq results revealed that mammary tumor epithelial cells in <italic>MMTV-PyMT</italic> mice fall into four clusters, with only Hsd epithelial cells showing ERα and PR expression. Additionally, Hsd epithelial cells exhibited the lowest CNV score, indicating a closer resemblance to normal epithelial cells. The loss of Frmd8 reduced the proportion of Hsd epithelial cells and led to a downregulation of ERα and PR expression, implying that Frmd8 deficiency promotes the loss of luminal features in the mammary gland and accelerates mammary tumor progression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) As stated in the result section, the depletion of FRMD8 may lead to the decrease of the Hsd epithelial cells proportion, it might be beneficial to discuss the significance of this finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a discussion of the Hsd epithelial cell proportion in the third paragraph of this section (please refer to the above question (8)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures</p><p>(10) The structural layout of Figure 4 should be reorganized to make it more aesthetically pleasing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.
