We previously established a link between coagulopathy and pyroptosis, a vital defense mechanism against infection. During pyroptosis, the formation of gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pores on the plasma membrane leads to the release of tissue factor (TF)-positive microvesicles (MVs) that are procoagulant. Mice lacking GSDMD release fewer of these procoagulant MVs. However, the specific mechanisms coupling the activation of GSDMD to MV release remain unclear. Plasma membrane rupture (PMR) in pyroptosis was recently reported to be actively mediated by the transmembrane protein Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1). Here, we show that NINJ1 promotes procoagulant MV release during pyroptosis. Haploinsufficiency or glycine inhibition of NINJ1 limited the release of procoagulant MVs and inflammatory cytokines, and partially protected against blood coagulation and lethality triggered by bacterial flagellin. Our findings suggest a crucial role for NINJ1-dependent PMR in inflammasome-induced blood coagulation and inflammation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NINJ1</kwd><kwd>Pyroptosis</kwd><kwd>Coagulation</kwd><kwd>Microvesicle</kwd><kwd>Inflammasome</kwd><kwd>Macrophage</kwd><kwd>Sepsis</kwd><kwd>Infection</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 HL145117</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Congqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL142640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Yinan</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhenyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM132443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Yinan</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhenyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL146744</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhenyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 HL129193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Jeremy P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Procoagulant microvesicles derived from ruptured immune cells fuel blood coagulation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammasomes are intracellular multiprotein complexes that detect pathogens by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>).

Elevated TF activity is associated with consumption coagulopathy in sepsis and COVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Taylor et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Levi et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pawlinski et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rosell et al., 2021</xref>). Our previous study has shown that TF-positive MVs released by pyroptotic macrophages trigger systemic coagulation and lethality in experimental sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which pyroptosis releases procoagulant MVs remain elusive. Pyroptotic cells undergo PMR at the late stage when the plasma membrane is beyond repair, where the blebbing and pinching of the plasma membrane releases MVs to remove membrane damaged by gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Vasconcelos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babiychuk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rühl et al., 2018</xref>). PMR could accelerate MV release as the entire plasma membrane is subject to being dissolved as MVs. Kayagaki et al. recently reported that Ninjurin-1 (NINJ1) oligomerization activates PMR, a process formerly thought to be passive, during lytic cell death like necrosis and pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kayagaki et al., 2021</xref>). However, the role of NINJ1 in releasing procoagulant MVs and initiating systemic coagulation after inflammasome activation remains unknown.</p><p>In this study, we show that <italic>Ninj1</italic> haploinsufficiency inhibits the release of TF-positive MVs and provides protection against systemic coagulation. Reduced NINJ1 also limits the release of inflammatory cytokines. We find that a single dose of glycine injection has similar protective effects as they prevent PMR. Our findings underscore the essential role of NINJ1-dependent PMR in inflammasome-induced blood coagulation, thus expanding our understanding of the dual role that inflammasomes play in host defense.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Ninj1</italic> haploinsufficiency partially protects against flagellin-induced blood coagulation</title><p>We aimed to understand the role of NINJ1 on inflammasome-induced blood coagulation, using heterozygous <italic>Ninj1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice with decreased NINJ1 protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In the presence of anthrax protein protective agent (PA), this flagellin fusion protein (LFn-Fla) can be transported into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Milne et al., 1995</xref>).

Our findings suggest that PMR serves as a pivotal molecular event responsible for the release of procoagulant MVs and the induction of systemic coagulation and inflammation. This novel mechanism sheds light on the potential for developing NINJ1 inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing acute inflammation and coagulation-associated tissue and organ damage. In fact, an anti-NINJ1 monoclonal antibody (but not the NINJ1<sub>26-37</sub> peptide) has been shown to prevent PMR, limiting tissue inflammation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kayagaki et al., 2023</xref>). We do, however, recognize the limitations of our main model, as a single injection of bacterial flagellin does not replicate the evolving nature of a polymicrobial infection. Consequently, it cannot offer insights into extended timelines beyond the brief period of flagellin-induced pyroptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Their previous data demonstrate that GSDMD is critical for the release of MV that contains Tissue Factor (TF), thus making a link between pyroptosis and hypercoagulation. Given the recent identification of NINJ1 being responsible for plasma membrane rupture (Kayagaki et al. Nature 2011), the authors wanted to determine if NINJ1 is responsible for TF-containing MV release. Given the constitutive ninj1 KO mouse leads to partial embryonic lethality, the authors decide to use a heterozygous ninj1 KO mouse (ninj1+/-), and demonstrate that Ninj1 plays a role in release of TF-containing MV.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91329.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nashville</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Hua</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Kentucky</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lexington</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>Dien</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Kentucky</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lexington</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Guoying</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Texas A&amp;M University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">College Station</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Texas A&amp;M University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">College Station</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ling</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Texas A&amp;M University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">College Station</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sim</surname><given-names>Martha MS</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Bloodworks Northwest</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Jeremy P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Kentucky</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lexington</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Yinan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Texas A&amp;M University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">College Station</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Zhenyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Texas A&amp;M University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">College Station</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Congqing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Kentucky</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Lexington</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors demonstrated that NINJ1 promotes TF-positive MV release during pyroptosis and thereby triggers coagulation.

NINJ1 protein is abundantly expressed (without induction) in tissues including liver, lung, kidney, and spleen, as shown in Fig S1. Consistently, other groups have shown abundant NINJ1 expression at baseline in tissues and cells such as liver (Kayagaki <italic>et.al.</italic> Nature 2023) and BMDM (Kayagaki <italic>et.al.</italic> Nature 2021; Borges <italic>et.al.</italic> eLife 2022).

In Fla-stimulated Ninj1+/- BMDMs, most of the NINJ1 is released in MVs, therefore, not in the cell lysate, as shown in Fig 3A. The difference in beta-actin band intensity correlated with MV numbers shown in Fig 3B.

We agree that platelet aggregation is closely linked to blood coagulation but would argue that one does not directly cause the other.

We examine PT time, plasma TAT, and tissue fibrin deposition as direct evidence of blood coagulation in this manuscript. We acknowledge that platelets play a key role in thrombosis; however, we hope the reviewer would agree that tissue factor-induced blood coagulation and platelet aggregation are linked yet distinct processes. Therefore, the role of NINJ1 in platelet aggregation falls beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Referring to previous research findings, the authors explain the connection between NINJ1 and MVs. Additional experiments and clarifications will strengthen the conclusions of this study.</p><p>Below are some comments I feel could strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>(1) The authors mentioned their choice of using heterozygous NINJ1+/- mice on page 4, because of lethality and hydrocephalus. Nonetheless, there is a substantial number of references that use homozygous NINJ1-/- mice. Could there be any other specific reasons for using heterozygous mice in this study?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the thoughtful comments. We are aware that a few homozygous NINJ1-/- mouse strains were used in several publications by different groups, including Drs. Kayagaki and Dixit (Genentech), from whom we obtained the heterozygous NINJ1+/- breeders. We do not have experience with the homozygous NINJ1-/- mice used by other groups. It’s reasonable to assume that homozygous NINJ1-/-, if healthy, would have even stronger protection against coagulopathy than heterozygous NINJ1+/-. The only reason for not using homozygous mice in this study is that a majority of our homozygous NINJ1-/- develops hydrocephalus around weaning and these mice are required to be euthanized by the rules of our DLAR facility. Although our homozygous NINJ1-/- mice develop hydrocephalus (the same reported by Drs. Kayagaki and Dixit, PMID: 37196676, PMCID: PMC10307625), heterozygous NINJ1+/- mice remain healthy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure S2 clearly shows the method of pyroptosis induction by flagellin. It is also necessary as a prerequisite for this paper to show the changes in flagellin-induced pyroptosis in heterozygous NINJ1+/- mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the valuable suggestions. We agree that a plasma LDH measurement as an indicator of pyroptosis <italic>in vivo</italic> would add to the manuscript. Therefore, we have made several attempts to measure plasma LDH in flagellin-challenged WT and NINJ1+/- mice using CytoTox96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (a Promega kit commonly used for LDH, Promega#G1780). Flagellin-challenged WT and NINJ1+/- mice develops hemolysis, which renders plasma red. Because plasma coloring interferes with the assay, we could not get a meaningful reading to make an accurate comparison. We also tried LHD-Glo Cytotoxicity Assay (Luciferase based, Promega#J2380) with no luck on both plasma and serum. We hope the reviewer would agree that reduced plasma MV count (Fig 3C) would serve as an alternative indictor for reduced pyroptosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) IL-1ß levels controlled by GSDMD were not affected by NINJ1 expression according to previous studies (Ref 37, 29, Nature volume 618, pages 1065-1071 (2023)). GSDMD also plays an important role in TF release in pyroptosis. Are GSDMD levels not altered in heterozygous NINJ1 +/- mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising these great points. It’s been reported that IL-1β secretion in cell culture supernatant were not affected by NINJ1 deficiency or inhibition when BMDMs were stimulated by LPS (Ref 29, 37, now Ref 29, 35) or nigericin (Ref 29). As GSDMD pore has been shown to facilitate the release of mature IL-1β, these <italic>in vitro</italic> observations are reasonable given that NINJ1-mediated PMR is a later event than GSDMD pore-forming. However, we observed that plasma IL-1β (also TNFα and IL-6) in Ninj1+/- mice were significantly lower. There are a few differences in the experimental condition that might contribute to the discrepancy: 1, there was no priming in our <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment, while priming in BMDMs were performed in both <italic>in vitro</italic> observations before stimulating with LPS or nigericin; 2, the flagellin in our study engages different inflammasome than either LPS or nigericin. Priming might change the expression and dynamics of IL-1β. More importantly, there might be unrecognized mechanisms in IL-1β secretion <italic>in vivo</italic>. We now add discussion on this in the main text.</p><p>We examined GSDMD protein levels in liver, lung, kidney, and spleen from WT and NINJ1+/- mice by Western blotting.

The fibrin-specific monoclonal antibody in our study is mouse anti-fibrin monoclonal antibody (59D8).

Their previous data demonstrate that GSDMD is critical for the release of MV that contains Tissue Factor (TF), thus making a link between pyroptosis and hypercoagulation. Given the recent identification of NINJ1 being responsible for plasma membrane rupture (Kayagaki et al. Nature 2011), the authors wanted to determine if NINJ1 is responsible for TF-containing MV release. Given the constitutive ninj1 KO mouse leads to partial embryonic lethality, the authors decided to use a heterozygous ninj1 KO mouse (ninj1+/-). While the data are well controlled, there is limited understanding of the mechanism of action. Also, given that the GSDMD pores have an ~18 nm inner diameter enough to release IL-1β, while larger molecules like LDH (140 kDa) and other DAMPs require plasma membrane rupture (likely mediated by NINJ1), it s not unexpected that large MVs require NINJ1-mediated plasma cell rupture.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that ninj1 haploinsufficiency leads to decreased prothrombin time, plasma TAT and plasma cytokines 90 minutes post-treatment in mice, which leads to partial protection from lethality.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- In the abstract, the authors say &quot;...cytokines and protected against blood coagulation and lethality triggered by bacterial flagellin&quot;. This conclusion is not substantiated by the data, as you still see 70% mortality at 24 hours in the ninj1+/- mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the thoughtful comments. We corrected the text to “partially protected against blood coagulation and lethality triggered by bacterial flagellin”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The previous publication by the authors (Wu et al. Immunity 2019) clearly shows that GSDMDdependent pyroptosis is required for inflammasome-induced coagulation and mouse lethality. However, as it is not possible for the authors to use the homozygous ninj1 KO mouse due to partial embryonic lethality, it becomes challenging to compare these two studies and the contributions of GSDMD vs. NINJ1. Comparing the contributions of GSDMD and NINJ1 in human blood-derived monocytes/macrophages where you can delete both genes and assess their relevant contributions to TF-containing MV release within the same background would be crucial in comparing how much contribution NINJ1 has versus what has been published for GSDMD? This would help support the in vivo findings and further corroborate the proposed conclusions made in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the valuable question. We have shown that plasma MV TF activity was reduced in both GSDMD deficient mice (Ref 23) and Ninj1+/- mice (present manuscript). Given that TF is a plasma membrane protein, MV TF most likely comes from ruptured plasma membrane. In flagellin-induced pyroptosis, both GSDMD and NINJ1 deficiency equally blocked LDH release (plasma membrane rupture) in BMDMs (Ref 29). Further, in pyroptosis glycine acts downstream of GSDMD pore formation for its effect against NINJ1 activation (Ref 35). Therefore, GSDMD pore-forming should be upstream of NINJ1 activation in pyroptosis (which may not be the case in other forms of cell death) and there are likely equal effects of GSDMD and NINJ1 on MV release in flagellin-induced pyroptosis. As the reviewer suggested, experiments using human blood-derived monocytes/macrophages will enable a direct comparison to determine the relative contribution. However, this approach presents a few technical difficulties: it’s not easy to manipulate gene expression on primary human monocytes/macrophages (in our experience); variable efficiency in gene manipulation of GSDMD and NINJ1 will complicate the comparison. I hope the reviewer would agree that a direct comparison between GSDMD and NINJ1 is not required to support our conclusion that NINJ1-dependent membrane rupture is involved in inflammasome-pyroptosis induced coagulation and inflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What are the levels of plasma TAT, PT, and inflammatory cytokines if you collect plasma after 90 minutes? Given the majority (~70%) of the ninj+/- mice are dead by 24 hours, it is imperative to determine whether the 90-minute timeframe data (in Fig 1A-G) is also representative of later time points. The question is whether ninj1+/- just delays the increases in prothrombin time, plasma TAT, and plasma cytokines.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank for the valuable question. The time point (90 min) was chosen based on our <italic>in vitro</italic> observation that flagellin-induced pyroptosis in BMDMs largely occurs within 60-90 min.</p><p>Because our focus on the primary effect of flagellin <italic>in vivo</italic>, potential secondary effects at later points may complicate the results and are hard to interpret. As the reviewer suggested, we have measured plasma PT, TAT at 6 hours post-flagellin challenge. The significant difference in PT sustained between Ninj1+/+ and Ninj1+/- (Fig A), suggesting coagulation proteins remained more depleted in Ninj1+/+ mice than in Ninj1+/- mice. However, plasma TAT levels were diminished to baseline level (refer to Fig 1B in main text) in both groups and showed no significant difference between groups (Fig B), which could be explained by the short half-life (less than 30 min) in the blood. Since flagellin challenge is a one-time hit, there might not a second episode of coagulation after the 90-minute time point, at least not triggered by flagellin, supported by the plasma TAT levels at 6 hours.

In the lethality data where there is a delay in ninj1+/- mortality, are the parameters (prothrombin time, plasma TAT, and plasma cytokines) measured at 90 minutes different between WT and ninj+/- mice?

We now include the method of BMDM isolation. In brief, mouse femur and tibia from one leg are harvested and rinsed in ice-cold PBS, followed by a brief rinse in 70% ethanol for 10-15 seconds. Both ends of the bones are then cut open, and the bone marrow is flushed out using a 10 ml syringe with a 26-gauge needle. The marrow is passed through a 19-gauge needle once to disperse the cells. After filtering through a 70-μm cell strainer, the cells are collected by centrifugation at 250 g for 5 minutes at 4 °C, then suspended in two 150 mm petri dish, each containing 25 ml of L-cell conditioned medium (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2mM L-Glutamine, 10mM HEPES, 15% LCM, and penicillin/streptomycin).
