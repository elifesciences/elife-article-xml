formation. In rodents, hippocampal LTP may be induced through electrical stimulation of the perforant path. To test whether similar techniques could improve episodic memory in humans, we implemented a microstimulation technique that allowed delivery of low-current electrical stimulation via 100 <italic>μm</italic>-diameter microelectrodes. As thirteen neurosurgical patients performed a person recognition task, microstimulation was applied in a theta-burst pattern, shown to optimally induce LTP. Microstimulation in the right entorhinal area during learning significantly improved subsequent memory specificity for novel portraits; participants were able both to recognize previously-viewed photos and reject similar lures. These results suggest that microstimulation with physiologic level currents—a radical departure from commonly used deep brain stimulation protocols—is sufficient to modulate human behavior and provides an avenue for refined interrogation of the circuits involved in human memory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>medial temporal lobe</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>episodic memory</kwd><kwd>microstimulation</kwd><kwd>deep brain stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PBSKP3-124730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Michael R H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS084017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fried</surname><given-names>Itzhak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS058280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mankin</surname><given-names>Emily A</given-names></name><name><surname>M Aghajan</surname><given-names>Zahra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002112</institution-id><institution>A.P.

Using electrical stimulation to modulate hippocampal activity to restore memory function has recently become a focus of considerable interest. This idea is motivated to an extent by a long history of research on long-term potentiation (LTP), which is accepted as a neural substrate of learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bliss and Lomo, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kandel and Schwartz, 1982</xref>) and can be induced by electrical stimulation to hippocampal afferents, such as the perforant path or Schaffer collaterals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bliss and Lomo, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooke and Bliss, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen and Kandel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Staubli and Lynch, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of hippocampal-related targets, such as the fornix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2015</xref>) and the entorhinal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suthana et al., 2012</xref>), have shown promise for modulating human cognition. However, DBS is commonly applied through pairs of large clinical electrodes (e.g., 1.27 mm diameter), which lack target specificity and, hence, may affect wide and heterogeneous neuronal assemblies in nearby brain regions. More spatially-focused stimulation in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) could be achieved using smaller electrodes (for example, 100 μm diameter microelectrodes), allowing higher anatomical specificity and physiological modulation of brain circuits critical for learning and memory. Moreover, targeting afferent projections may be a more specific and efficient strategy to drive downstream neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riva-Posse et al., 2014</xref>), as suggested by recent optogenetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rajasethupathy et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Microstimulation mimics effects that drive neurons naturally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fetsch et al., 2014</xref>) and has been shown in animal studies to modulate a variety of specific brain functions, depending on the site of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamani et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Histed et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Logothetis et al., 2010</xref>). For example, in nonhuman primates, stimulation using microelectrodes improved face categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afraz et al., 2006</xref>), modulated motion perception with great specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fetsch et al., 2014</xref>), and increased the learning rate during a reinforcement learning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Williams and Eskandar, 2006</xref>). In humans, microstimulation of primary visual cortex has been shown to induce phosphenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmidt et al., 1996</xref>), and microstimulation of the substantia nigra can influence reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramayya et al., 2014</xref>). Further evidence of the high specificity that this method of stimulation can bring to human brain modulation has been provided by intraoperative investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Histed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Logothetis et al., 2010</xref>). Stimulation using microwires presents a novel opportunity to improve selective and natural activation of neuronal circuits in the human brain.</p><p>Here, we asked whether application of microstimulation targeted to the entorhinal afferents into hippocampus could enhance declarative memory function in humans. We postulated that afferent stimulation would most directly affect the downstream hippocampal fields, and thus memory function as well. Importantly, LTP induction by high-frequency microstimulation of the perforant path in vivo has been shown to cause reorganization of wide hippocampal and cortical networks in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canals et al., 2009</xref>). A theta-burst protocol has been shown to be optimal for inducing LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larson et al., 1986</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that theta-burst microstimulation, targeted to brain regions containing afferent fibers to the hippocampus, would improve episodic memory performance in humans.</p><p>One crucial aspect of episodic memory is pattern separation, the ability to retrieve the specifics of past events without generalizing to similar or partially overlapping events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yassa and Stark, 2011</xref>). During a task in which subjects studied photos of novel people, microstimulation was applied in a theta-burst pattern. We show that theta-burst microstimulation of the right entorhinal area, applied prior to stimulus onset, enhanced memory specificity for these photographs. That is, during a test phase, subjects performed better at accepting photographs from the encoding stage as previously viewed, concomitant with rejecting similar (lure) photographs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Participants were thirteen neurosurgical patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, implanted with intracranial depth electrodes, who performed a person recognition task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). During the encoding phase, subjects viewed novel portraits of people. On half of the trials, randomly selected for each participant, electrical stimulation was applied during the fixation period prior to stimulus onset (see <italic>Microstimulation Protocol</italic> section in Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Stimulation was delivered through a 100 μm diameter microwire that had been targeted to the left or right entorhinal area (two subjects received stimulation on each side (in separate sessions); <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, all stimulation microwires were determined to have been located in regions known to include afferent inputs to the hippocampus, including entorhinal white matter (angular bundle), entorhinal gray matter, or subiculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yassa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeineh et al., 2017</xref>). Because the subiculum contains—in fact, is perforated by—fibers of the perforant path, a major output of the entorhinal cortex, it was included in our sample. After the encoding phase, subjects performed a 30 s distractor task and then were presented with a series of images and asked whether each was 'old’ (presented during the encoding phase) or ‘new.’ For each image presented during the encoding phase, two images were included in the test phase; one, the ‘target’ was the exact same image; the other, the ‘lure,’ was a portrait of a different person who looked similar to the person in the target portrait (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). These images were presented one at a time, in pseudo-random order, during the test phase. Whenever possible, subjects performed the task more than once, using a new set of images each time, such that a total of 40 experimental sessions were conducted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>; Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29515.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task Design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The person-recognition task consisted of three phases. In the encoding phase, participants were shown portraits of people for 4 s each (black bars in timeline), preceded by a 4.2–5.2 s fixation dot (gray bars). Half of the pictures were randomly selected for stimulation. For these, one second of theta-burst stimulation (red bar) was applied beginning 2.2–2.7 s before picture onset, during viewing of the fixation dot. To ensure that participants were viewing the portraits, they were asked to report whether the person in each image was male or female. The encoding phase was followed by a 30 s distractor task in which single digits were presented once per second and the participant was asked to identify each digit as odd or even. Finally, during the test phase, participants were shown a mixture of images they had seen during the encoding phase (targets) and portraits of people who looked similar but had not been previously viewed (lures). Participants were asked to report whether each image was ‘old’ or ‘new.’ (<bold>B</bold>) Theta burst stimulation consisted of 5 sets of current pulses, separated by 200 ms, in which each set included four biphasic stimulation pulses presented at 100 Hz.

For each image presented during encoding, we noted whether it was recognized as ‘old’ during the test phase, as well as whether its corresponding lure image was correctly identified as ‘new.’ For each session, we computed the target acceptance rate as the proportion of target images that were correctly identified as old, and the lure rejection rate as the proportion of lure images that were correctly identified as new. Independently, these measures are not fully informative; for example, if a subject has a bias toward answering ‘old’, that would inflate the target acceptance rate while decreasing the lure rejection rate. Thus, a comparison of responses to targets and lures is required. On the whole-session level, we can compute the discrimination index (DI), which is the probability of answering ‘old’ on target images minus the probability of answering ‘old’ on lure images. DI works to subtract out the bias toward one answer or another, but does not explicitly compare performance for specific targets and their corresponding lures. Thus, for each image we assigned a behavioral label of ‘remembered’ or ‘missed’. ‘Remembered’ images were those that were accepted as previously viewed, along with rejection of the corresponding lure. This required not only recognizing the target image but also remembering the details sufficiently to distinguish it from the lure image. We computed the remembered rate as the proportion of target images that met these criteria. All other images were categorized as ‘missed.’</p><p>To evaluate how microstimulation affected these behavioral metrics, we computed each metric separately for the subset of stimulated trials and the subset of non-stimulated trials within each session and used generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to model the effects of stimulation condition on these measures. GEEs are a class of generalized linear models that were developed for analyzing repeated measures data (in our case, multiple experiments for an individual subject) and, contrary to the conventional repeated measures ANOVA tests, can handle different numbers of observations per subject and do not assume equal correlations between within-subject observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gardiner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gueorguieva and Krystal, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hubbard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Subramanian and O'Malley, 2010</xref>), thus making this a rigorous statistical approach for our study (see Materials and methods for details)</p><p>We hypothesized that stimulation would improve memory specificity, but the effects of stimulation might vary with the precise location of the stimulating electrode. In particular, because previous studies in both human and non-human primates have indicated that facial processing may be lateralized within the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fried et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haxby et al., 1996</xref>), we predicted that stimulation within the left or right entorhinal area may be differentially effective. Thus, using GEEs, we modeled the difference in proportion of remembered pictures between stimulated and non-stimulated trials as a function of stimulation hemisphere. We found that there was a significant effect of stimulation hemisphere on the degree to which stimulation changed the proportion of remembered portraits (p=6.17 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, Wald <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> = 11.72). Specifically, stimulation of the right entorhinal area significantly improved performance (Estimated Mean (EM) = 0.12, 95% CI [0.05, 0.18]), while stimulation of the left entorhinal area had no effect (EM = −0.017, 95% CI [−0.060, 0.025]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>). We confirmed that these results were robust to the precise statistical method chosen; even a basic t-test on the difference between mean performance on stimulated and nonstimulated trials per participant revealed an effect of stimulation hemisphere (t(13) = −2.98, p=0.011), and <italic>post hoc</italic> t-tests indicated that right entorhinal stimulation caused significant improvement (mean change = 0.12 ± 0.04, t(8) = 3.53, p=0.008; effect size: Cohen’s d<sub>z</sub> = 1.18, CL = 0.88), while left entorhinal stimulation did not (mean change = −0.02 ± 0.03, t(5) = −0.77, p=0.48) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Further, out of 9 subjects who received microstimulation in the right entorhinal area, eight had a higher remembered rate for stimulated trials compared to nonstimulated trials, which is more than expected by chance (p=0.020, binomial test). Finally, because our subjects were patients with epilepsy, we wanted to ensure that the effect of stimulation was not driven by epileptic activity. To test this, we applied the GEE model described above to the subset of data that included only sessions in which the stimulating electrode was located outside of the seizure onset zone. Our results remained qualitatively the same, with a strong effect of stimulation hemisphere on behavior, and significant improvement induced by right-sided stimulation (p=9.49 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, Wald <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> = 6.73, right EM = 0.11; 95% CI [.029. 184]).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29515.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Stimulation of the right entorhinal area improved memory specificity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The estimated mean change in fraction of stimulated items that were remembered compared to non-stimulated items, as estimated with Generalized Estimating Equations, which accounted for within subject correlations in performance.

We thus modeled the behavioral data on a trial by trial basis while accounting for the trial order as well as whether the target image was presented before the lure image during the test phase (1207 trials). Here, the model included main effects of normalized trial number, whether the target was presented first, stimulation condition (trial received stimulation or not), stimulation hemisphere (left or right), and an interaction term between the last two. We found that the interaction term between the stimulation condition and hemisphere had a strong significant effect on behavior (p=2.19 × 10<sup>−3</sup>, Wald <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>= 9.38), while neither of the order variables were a significant predictor (normalized trial number: p=0.19, presentation of target before lure: p=0.053). Consistent with the previous model, stimulation of the right entorhinal area increased the probability of remembering a portrait to a greater degree than stimulation of the left entorhinal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode2">Source code 2</xref>).</p><p>Because the order of presentation of target and lure trended strongly toward a behavioral effect—memory was generally better when the target was presented before the lure—we wanted to ensure that the interaction between stimulation condition and hemisphere was independent of whether the target or lure had been presented first. We thus divided our dataset into trials in which the target was presented first (618 trials) and trials in which the lure was presented first (589 trials), and modeled behavioral outcome with normalized trial number, stimulation condition, stimulation hemisphere and an interaction for each dataset. Consistent with the full dataset, we found in each case that normalized trial number was not a significant predictor (target first: p=0.33; lure first: p=0.55), while the interaction between stimulation site and stimulation condition was (target first: p=0.018; lure first: p=0.011).</p><p>Finally, we tested whether precise electrode targeting had an effect on the degree to which stimulation improved memory. Our electrodes were localized to three distinct regions containing fibers of the perforant path: the angular bundle (entorhinal white matter), gray matter of the entorhinal cortex (where perforant path fibers originate), and the nearby subiculum (which is perforated by the perforant path prior to its arrival in the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeineh et al., 2017</xref>]). We hypothesized that, because stimulation to the perforant path can induce LTP, stimulating in the region where perforant path fibers are most densely concentrated might be the most effective. Specifically, we compared stimulation in the angular bundle, where perforant path fibers are most densely concentrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yassa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeineh et al., 2017</xref>), to stimulation in either the entorhinal or subicular gray matter, where these fibers are more spread out and fewer axons would be recruited by stimulation. Accordingly, we modeled the proportion of the remembered portraits as a function of two factors: stimulation region (whether the stimulating electrode was in the angular bundle or gray matter) and stimulation hemisphere (left versus right). We found significant main effects of each stimulation hemisphere (p=1.49 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, Wald <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>=14.39) and stimulation region (p=0.011, Wald <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>=6.53).

When right-sided stimulation was applied in the angular bundle, this also led to an increase in appropriately rejecting lure images. When applied in gray matter, however, stimulation led to an increase in incorrectly accepting lure images. Thus, it appears that right angular bundle stimulation improved memory specificity by simultaneously increasing the probability of accepting target images and rejecting lure images. Stimulation of the right gray matter, on the other hand—by increasing acceptance of both targets and lures—introduced a bias towards reporting positive memory, rather than increasing memory <italic>per se</italic>. Conversely, stimulation in the left entorhinal-adjacent gray matter decreased target acceptance rates and showed a moderate trend toward decreasing lure acceptance rates, introducing a bias toward negative memory. Together these results suggest that in entorhinal/subicular gray matter, stimulation in the left and right hemispheres may introduce opposite biases.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that, although we report uncorrected p-values throughout the results section, all reported statistically significant effects survive correction for multiple comparisons (see Materials and methods), further demonstrating the statistical robustness of our results.

The overall results are similar, but further studies will be necessary to examine potential differences between microstimulation of subicular and entorhinal cortices.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that microstimulation to the entorhinal area, targeted to maximally affect the entorhinal projections into the hippocampus, resulted in enhancement of memory specificity for images of novel people when the stimulating electrode was in the right hemisphere. This suggests a possible lateralization effect for memory of people, consistent with previous results: the right hippocampus shows increased metabolic activity during the learning of faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haxby et al., 1996</xref>), and single-unit activity in the right hippocampus encodes different facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fried et al., 1997</xref>). While direct recordings of neural activity have shown evidence for lateralization, imaging studies have indicated that the encoding of pictorial material involves bilateral activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim, 2011</xref>), and lesion studies noted a lack of asymmetry for encoding of non-verbal material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). This discrepancy may indicate a difference between encoding of faces and visual encoding in general, as the latter studies were not specific to images of faces or people. On the other hand, our results indicate that that the left hippocampus is not uninvolved during facial encoding, as stimulation of the left entorhinal area had a behavioral effect, even if it was not to increase memory specificity. Previous findings of bilateral activation, therefore, may indicate only that the two hemispheres are both involved, not that they are performing the same function. Thus, these results warrant further studies into potential lateralization effects, both of function and of the effect of stimulation. It is important to note that our study was conducted in people with epilepsy, a condition which may disproportionately affect one side of the brain and could result in lateralized effects, such as impairment of cognitive skills lateralized to the affected hemisphere. Thus conclusions with respect to lateralization of function should be viewed with caution. However, we have repeated our analysis with data restricted to the sessions in which the stimulating electrode was positioned outside the clinically-determined seizure onset zone, and found qualitatively similar results.</p><p>Previous studies in animals have noted the importance of the frequency and mode of stimulation on behavioral outcomes. Specifically, theta-burst stimulation has been used to elicit LTP in a wide range of animal models from hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nguyen and Kandel, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Staubli and Lynch, 1987</xref>) to whole animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larson et al., 1986</xref>). In the current study, we present evidence supporting the efficacy of theta-burst microstimulation in protocols aimed at human memory improvement. Further research is warranted to determine whether theta-burst stimulation is more effective than other protocols, such as continuous stimulation. We also made no effort in this study to synchronize our stimulation protocols to endogenous theta rhythms in the hippocampus; we hypothesize that the memory effects we observed may be enhanced further by developing a closed-loop stimulation system, allowing the theta-burst pattern to be initiated on specific phases of theta.</p><p>Beyond the temporal dynamics of stimulation, we found that the spatial targeting of the stimulating electrode was also a critical factor in determining the effects of stimulation on behavior. Controlling this factor is more feasible with microstimulation than macrostimulation, as it is challenging to confine the spatial extent of delivered current when using macroelectrodes, due to their large contact surface area, wide inter-contact distance for bipolar stimulation, and high magnitude of stimulation current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, high frequency stimulation delivered via macroelectrodes has been shown to inhibit nearby neuronal somata, while also providing excitation to axonal projections, indicating that small changes in electrode location could lead to substantially different results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herrington et al., 2016</xref>). For example, stimulating in gray matter could disrupt neuronal computations, whereas electrodes that are confined to white matter may enhance excitatory drive to downstream regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afraz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcot Desai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fetsch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Histed et al., 2009</xref>). Future work examining the physiological effects of microstimulation in downstream regions, such as the hippocampus, would further enlighten the mechanisms of the differential effects when stimulation is applied in gray matter or the angular bundle.</p><p>Recently, studies on the effects of DBS—delivered via macroelectrodes in the entorhinal area—on memory performance have resulted in contradicting outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacobs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suthana et al., 2012</xref>). Stimulation delivered in these studies likely affected different neuronal assemblies, which—together with other methodological differences between them—may account for the variability in the reported results. Microstimulation is delivered via a single, small electrode, which eliminates the heterogeneity introduced in macrostimulation studies by variable inter-contact distances and implantation trajectories, and may make the final localization of the electrode easier to compare between research groups; this may increase the ease of replicability of studies using microstimulation, even in the face of other methodological differences.</p><p>Additional evidence for the importance of stimulation specificity arises from optogenetic studies in animals. In particular, a transgenic mouse model of early Alzheimer’s disease shows that the more focally targeted an intervention is, the more specific of an effect can be elicited. This study demonstrated that direct optogenetic activation of specific hippocampal memory engram cells resulted in highly specific memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roy et al., 2016</xref>). Other optogenetic studies highlight the advantage of afferent stimulation to target downstream neuronal assemblies compared to direct stimulation of gray matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rajasethupathy et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While optogenetics is the state-of-the-art method for targeting neural circuits with precise spatial and temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rajasethupathy et al., 2016</xref>), it is not likely to be feasible in humans in the near future. The microstimulation approach may, thus, be the method available in humans that most closely serves a similar purpose. Compared to macroelectrodes, microelectrodes have much smaller electrode contacts and affect a more localized region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcot Desai et al., 2014</xref>). The lower current levels typically delivered through microelectrodes have also been shown to excite, rather than inhibit, nearby neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afraz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arcot Desai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fetsch et al., 2014</xref>), as well as those downstream of the nearby axonal projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Histed et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, high frequency microstimulation of the perforant path that induces LTP in hippocampus has been shown to cause widespread reorganization in hippocampal networks, as well as in cortical areas, such as medial frontal cortex and nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canals et al., 2009</xref>). These observations are compatible with the efficacy of microstimulation of the perforant path to cause overt behavioral changes in memory performance.</p><p>It has been suggested that stimulation in the entorhinal white matter, but not the adjacent gray matter, might lead to beneficial effects on memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suthana et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the results of the current study are consistent with this idea, such that applying microstimulation in the right angular bundle had a significant positive effect on memory for portraits, while applying microstimulation in the right entorhinal gray matter or subiculum did not improve memory, despite the presence of hippocampal afferents in these regions. This may be due to the fact that axons of the perforant path—a common locus for induction of LTP—are most densely concentrated in the angular bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yassa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeineh et al., 2017</xref>) and hence a larger number would be recruited via stimulation. In parallel, stimulation in the gray matter may more directly impact or interfere with neuronal computations, which could drive the biases observed in our results due to gray matter stimulation. Although we hypothesize that LTP induced via the perforant path is likely responsible for the positive effects of right angular bundle stimulation, it must be borne in mind that the entorhinal region includes several additional fiber tracts—including the direct projections to CA1 via the alvear path, and hippocampal efferents—any of which may be affected by microstimulation, and current imaging techniques do not allow us to separate these various tracts.</p><p>Further, it is worth noting that the present study does not address the precise mechanisms by which microstimulation wields its behavioral influence. The distinct patterns observed as a result of stimulation in different hemispheres or different regions offer hints of a complex effect. Future studies investigating how neural signals change in response to microstimulation (and how these changes vary with the precise targeting of the stimulating electrode) will be critical for increasing our understanding, not only of the physiological signatures of microstimulation, but also the microcircuit dynamics underlying memory.</p><p>This study presents the first evidence that microstimulation has the potential to improve hippocampal-dependent memory in humans. In addition to the interesting implications for our understanding of microcircuit dynamics of memory, this paves the way to developing new avenues that could one day be used for treating patients with chronic memory impairment. Chronic neural implants that use macrostimulation to treat conditions such as Parkinson’s Disease and Epilepsy have become increasingly common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fisher and Velasco, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schuepbach et al., 2013</xref>). As the use of neural implants moves toward treating cognitive disorders, one advantage of including microstimulation is the precise spatial targeting it affords, allowing for highly-controlled manipulation of neural circuits. Additionally, microstimulation requires lower levels of current to be delivered, thus allowing the implant to consume considerably less power. Future studies will be required to fully understand the stimulation protocols that provide the best cognitive enhancement for a wide variety of tasks. Large-scale datasets that evaluate the efficacy of macro- vs microstimulation, stimulation region and hemisphere, precise timing of stimulation relative to endogenous brain states, and more, will be required to establish the clinical relevance of stimulation for cognitive enhancement.</p><p>At present, there is only one relatively large-scale dataset published to date that attempts to report the effects of (macro) stimulation on memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacobs et al., 2016</xref>). Even that study includes only five patients with entorhinal stimulation for one task (spatial memory) and seven for the other (verbal memory). Although that study reported an overall negative effect of stimulation on memory, it is important to note the many differences between it and the present study. In addition to the critical differences between micro- and macrostimulation described above, the tasks in the two studies were quite different. Here we investigated memory specificity in a person recognition task, while in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jacobs et al., 2016</xref> the tasks required spatial navigation or memorization of a list of words, which may be differentially affected by stimulation. We also accounted for possible confounds of the effectiveness of stimulation, such as the precise location of the stimulating electrode and the hemisphere to receive stimulation. Without accounting for those factors, the positive effects of stimulation could be washed out.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that microstimulation, with its anatomical precision, physiologic-level currents, and action via axonal projections, holds promise for modification of memory circuits and thus for the treatment of memory impairments in people suffering from neurological disorders. More generally, this method may provide a tool for highly specific modulation of neuronal activity and human behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Young and Deisseroth, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study participants</title><p>The study subjects were thirteen patients (N = 13)* with pharmacoresistant epilepsy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) who met clinical criteria for depth-electrode placement in the entorhinal area for seizure localization and possible surgical cure by resection of the identified seizure focus. Electrodes fashioned with macro contacts along the shaft for intracranial EEG (Adtech Medical Instrument Corp., Racine, WI) and with micro wires at the distal end (California Fine Wire, Grover Beach, CA) were implanted stereotactically with the aid of CT angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fried et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">1999</xref>).

Language dominance testing was carried out when deemed clinically necessary. Language dominance was determined either through a standard Wada protocol or through fMRI language testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Połczyńska et al., 2015</xref>).

These trials were excluded from analysis, but the session was included in the statistics reported in the main text. Additionally, we re-ran all statistics excluding this session entirely and the results remain nearly identical.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral paradigm</title><p>Each experiment consisted of three phases: encoding, distraction, and retrieval. During the encoding phase, participants completed a behavioral task in which they viewed 31 ± 12 novel portraits of people (taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Versluis and Uyttenbroek, 2002</xref>) on a computer screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). People with epilepsy exhibit a wide spectrum of cognitive ability, due most likely to the effects of disease etiology as well as anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). As such, we titrated the number of photographs shown for each subject with the guidance of their previous neuropsychological testing, as well as a short 4-portrait pre-test, using distinct stimuli, before the first experiment to ensure that the participants understood the task and could follow instructions. For our titrations, we targeted a 60–70% target acceptance rate to avoid ceiling or floor effects. During each encoding phase, for half of the images stimulation was applied for one second during the fixation period preceding image onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>); the subset of images to receive stimulation was selected randomly for each participant to avoid potential confounds based on stimulus complexity or order effects. After viewing the novel photographs, subjects performed a distractor task for 30 s in which single digits were presented serially, one per second, and subjects identified them as odd or even. This task is a non-mnemonic distractor task that has been shown to increase the demand for hippocampal involvement during the subsequent test phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stark and Squire, 2001</xref>). Finally, during the test phase, the same images from the encoding phase (‘targets’) were intermixed with an equal number of images of similar-looking portraits of different people (‘lures’) and presented one at a time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>).

The stimulation electrodes consisted of 100 µm diameter Formvar-insulated Platinum-Iridium (Pt/Ir) micro wires with the insulation removed from 1 mm around the tip, implanted into the right or left entorhinal area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fried et al., 1999</xref>). Stimulation electrode impedance was measured immediately before testing to ensure it remained below 60 kΩ. Impedance values averaged 25.2 ± 13.9 kΩ. 150 µA cathodic-first, biphasic microstimulation was applied with a pulse width of 200 µs and an inter-pulse interval of 100 µs. Theta burst microstimulation pulse trains consisted of 4 such pulses at 100 Hz every 200 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), as this protocol has previously been demonstrated to be optimal for eliciting LTP in hippocampal slices from rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larson et al., 1986</xref>). This stimulation protocol resulted in a charge delivery of 30 nC per phase and a charge density of 9.32 µC/cm<sup>2</sup>, well below the generally accepted upper safety limit of 100–150 µC/cm<sup>2</sup> for stimulation of neural tissue through Pt/Ir electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merrill et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rose and Robblee, 1990</xref>).

All stimulation parameters were kept constant across patients, with the exception of precise electrode localization. Although two patients received stimulation on each side, the stimulating electrode was held constant throughout each experimental session.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Mary Pat McAndrews.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors test whether theta-burst microstimulation of the entorhinal area can improve performance on a task that tests memory specificity, thought to be dependent on the hippocampus. They find that stimulation of the right entorhinal area improves the ability to recognize pictures of people and reject similar lures. They also find that stimulation of gray matter, as opposed to white matter, does not improve memory.</p><p>These findings could potentially make several important contributions to our understanding of how deep brain stimulation (DBS) using theta bursts can modulate episodic memory formation. In animal studies, such stimulation has been shown to induce long-term potentiation (LTP) thus there is a strong a priori reason to attempt to use it in human. The authors show that microstimulation can effectively improve memory encoding. This method could potentially have many advantages over the macroelectrode stimulation used in previous studies as microstimulation is much more spatially focused and uses currents on a more physiologic level. The authors also show that stimulation of gray matter did not improve memory. To some extent, this could be an explanation of previous contradicting results using macroelectrode stimulation (Suthana et al., 2012; Jacobs et al., 2016), which might either enhance or disrupt the memory pathway. Overall, the manuscript is well written and organized, however, there are several issues and questions that should be addressed so that a careful assessment of the contribution can be made.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Only two patients received entorhinal gray matter stimulation. Based on such a small number, it is not clear if these results will generalize. Additionally, these results could mean that the laterality effect is due to the fact that the majority of stimulation sites on the left side were in gray matter (also see below). Relatedly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it looks like microelectrode for subject 1 is located in the entorhinal gray matter, not white matter, or at least it is in the area delineated as EC gray matter by ASHS. If this electrode is in fact in the gray matter, it would mean that only subject 4 received white matter stimulation on the left side. Looking at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, it looks like subject 4 actually showed a slight improvement on the task. Could this mean that the effect of laterality could be due to the stimulation site, not the hemisphere stimulated?</p><p>2) The 'positive' results (right EW with 5 of 6 showing the effect by 'eyeball' test on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) seems to be fairly compelling, whereas some of the 'negative' findings may be subject to serious power issues. This could be clarified by including number of sessions/subject in Figure 1—figure supplement1, but we only have subject-level information to go on (or aggregates in legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; whereas sessions contributed to effect estimations).</p><p>3) Subject 4 and Subject 10 have the opposite behavioral effect compared to others. What's the possible explanation for this discrepancy? Also, except these two subjects, 5 out of 8 subjects have been stimulated at the seizure-onset zone. Can such memory enhancement effect be generalized to healthy subjects?</p><p>4) Panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> suggests no variance in left sites whereas panel B indicates there must be (as not all subjects showed 0 change). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> has such problem throughout all panels in that no variance (error bars) is depicted for the left gray matter group which actually has several participants whereas the left AB 'group' likely has 1 (based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These errors make statistics behind the plots questionable.</p><p>5) Since the authors postulated that theta-burst microstimulation would target afferent fibers and most directly affect downstream hippocampal subfields, it would be tremendously instructive and helpful to provide sample characterization of brain activity in the hippocampus after the stimulation. Without these recordings or data it is difficult to assess what the downstream impact on hippocampal dynamics might be.</p><p>6) In testing whether precise targeting of the stimulation had an effect on the degree to which stimulation improved memory, the authors did not sufficiently discuss varying the details of the stimulation protocol. It seems that every subject went through several sessions but it is not clear if the stimulation site was changed within the same session or across sessions. Is there an order effect of switching stimulation side?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29515.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Only two patients received entorhinal gray matter stimulation.

We have added data from left and right side in an additional subject. This subject completed a total of three sessions, with stimulation in the right entorhinal gray matter in two sessions and in the left angular bundle in one. These additions lend further support to the overall nature of our results while providing a more balanced sample. The nature of our patient pool means that we are not always able to select the side or precise site of stimulation, yet we trust that the addition of these data creates a more balanced dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it looks like microelectrode for subject 1 is located in the entorhinal gray matter, not white matter, or at least it is in the area delineated as EC gray matter by ASHS.

In fact, in this figure, we erroneously included the MRI image from the RIGHT entorhinal cortex, rather than the left.

Using the updated model (see response to major point 4), we now find main effects of stimulation region and hemisphere. This indicates that stimulation site and hemisphere both contribute to the efficacy of stimulation, with the strongest effect observed when the right angular bundle is stimulated.

While it is presently impossible to answer that directly, we did add an analysis to the manuscript showing that when using only the data in which the stimulating electrode is outside of the seizure onset zone (24 sessions from 9 subjects), the results of performing the left/right analysis are virtually identical to the original analysis. We have acknowledged this point and presented the results at the end of the discussion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Additionally, we confirmed that results are not overall changed for analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Panel A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> suggests no variance in left sites whereas panel B indicates there must be (as not all subjects showed 0 change). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> has such problem throughout all panels in that no variance (error bars) is depicted for the left gray matter group which actually has several participants whereas the left AB 'group' likely has 1 (based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These errors make statistics behind the plots questionable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention. The model we used when we submitted this manuscript was chosen in consultation with statistics experts at UCLA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/">https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/</ext-link>). We chose, a priori, to use an exchangeable working correlation matrix. We acknowledge, though, that the error bars produced by this model in certain subsets of the data did not appear to reflect the true degree of variance present in the data. Thus, after further consultation, we decided to use independent working correlation matrices, instead. This was also – a priori – a plausible candidate for an appropriate working correlation structure. Indeed, this model produced similar expected means, with error bars that appear to better reflect the variance present in the data.</p><p>We note that although this change yields main effects for stimulation region and hemisphere, rather than statistical interaction, the overall conclusion—that microstimulation of the right angular bundle is the most effective for improving memory specificity—has not changed. Furthermore, we double checked that this difference is due to the model difference and not to the data added from the additional patient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Since the authors postulated that theta-burst microstimulation would target afferent fibers and most directly affect downstream hippocampal subfields, it would be tremendously instructive and helpful to provide sample characterization of brain activity in the hippocampus after the stimulation. Without these recordings or data it is difficult to assess what the downstream impact on hippocampal dynamics might be.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that without analysis of the downstream brain activity it is impossible to say with certainty what effects stimulation causes in the hippocampus. We have acknowledged this point in the discussion, highlighting the need for physiological analysis, particularly of the response to stimulation in downstream regions (Discussion section).</p><p>An in-depth analysis of the physiology is beyond the scope of the present manuscript. A thorough and careful analysis will take substantial additional time, and we believe that the behavioral findings presented currently are of sufficient importance to justify being published on their own. One reason we were motivated to publish these results in <italic>eLife</italic> is the “research advance” format offered here. We would like to publish the physiological analysis as a research advance to this article, which would allow the behavioral results to appear quickly, the physiology to be analyzed in depth, and proper authorship attribution to be ascribed to all involved in this paper and the next.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In testing whether precise targeting of the stimulation had an effect on the degree to which stimulation improved memory, the authors did not sufficiently discuss varying the details of the stimulation protocol. It seems that every subject went through several sessions but it is not clear if the stimulation site was changed within the same session or across sessions. Is there an order effect of switching stimulation side?</p></disp-quote><p>All stimulation parameters were kept constant for the duration of any experimental session. Apart from the location of the stimulating electrode, the stimulation protocol was kept constant across all sessions and patients. We have added explicit clarification of these points in the Microstimulation Protocol section of the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We include only two participants who received stimulation on each side, and the order was counter-balanced between them. Thus, we don’t believe that potential order effects between sets would be a confound for the effects we report.</p></body></sub-article></article>
