Acting with the MRN complex, it plays a particularly important role in handling complex DNA end structures by localised nucleolytic processing of DNA termini in preparation for longer range resection. Here we show that human CtIP is a tetrameric protein adopting a dumbbell architecture in which DNA binding domains are connected by long coiled-coils. The protein complex binds two short DNA duplexes with high affinity and bridges DNA molecules in trans. DNA binding is potentiated by dephosphorylation and is not specific for DNA end structures per se. However, the affinity for linear DNA molecules is increased if the DNA terminates with complex structures including forked ssDNA overhangs and nucleoprotein conjugates. This work provides a biochemical and structural basis for the function of CtIP at complex DNA breaks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homologous recombination</kwd><kwd>Sae2</kwd><kwd>DNA end resection</kwd><kwd>atomic force microscopy</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>double-stranded DNA break repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100401/Z/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Oliver J</given-names></name><name><surname>Northall</surname><given-names>Sarah J</given-names></name><name><surname>Dillingham</surname><given-names>Mark Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C6913/A21608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Haejoo</given-names></name><name><surname>Wigley</surname><given-names>Dale B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006280</institution-id><institution>Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2017-83794-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno-Herrero</surname><given-names>Fernando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>681299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno-Herrero</surname><given-names>Fernando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BES-2015-071244</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martín-González</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and biochemical analysis of human CtIP provides new insights into DNA break recognition, binding and bridging during homologous recombination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are a potentially lethal form of DNA damage associated with genomic instability, gross chromosomal rearrangements and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ranjha et al., 2018</xref>). They are caused by exogenous agents such as ionising radiation (IR) and chemotherapeutic drugs, but also by normal cell metabolism such as during V(D)J/class-switch recombination, Spo11-mediated meiotic recombination, or replication fork collapse. DSBs are repaired by two major pathways: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). The predominance of either pathway is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner owing to the requirement for a sister chromatid to act as a template for error-free repair. HR is promoted in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle by a variety of mechanisms including activation of CtIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huertas and Jackson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shibata and Jeggo, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The process of DNA end resection is a critical regulatory step, which commits a cell to repair by HR. During end resection, DSBs are preferentially degraded by nucleases to reveal long 3′-ssDNA overhangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cejka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daley et al., 2015</xref>). These are stabilised by RPA and then bound by Rad51, which forms nucleoprotein filaments that undergo strand invasion with the sister chromatid, eventually leading to DNA repair without loss of genetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kowalczykowski, 2015</xref>). DNA end resection can be broadly separated into three mechanistic stages: initial recognition of the DSB, short-range resection and long-range resection. Recognition of the DSB is achieved by binding of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex (MRN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paull and Gellert, 1999</xref>) which activates the DNA damage response through its interaction with ATM, and subsequently recruits other repair factors to the damage site including CtIP, which is itself activated by cyclin-dependent kinase in an Mre11-mediated process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huertas and Jackson, 2009</xref>). Human CtIP, which is mutated in Seckel2 and Jawad syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Qvist et al., 2011</xref>), has been shown to be crucial for the promotion of end resection and HR-mediated repair in many genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huertas and Jackson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sartori et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">You et al., 2009</xref>), but exactly how MRN and CtIP co-operate to achieve short-range resection is not fully understood. MRN harbours both 5′−3’ endonuclease and 3′−5’ exonuclease activities in the Mre11 subunit, and these activities are mediated by CtIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paull and Gellert, 1999</xref>). Some reports suggest that CtIP and its orthologues possess intrinsic endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lengsfeld et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Makharashvili et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), but the primary structure of the protein is not obviously related to any known class of nuclease, and other groups have reported that their preparations are devoid of nuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andres and Williams, 2017</xref>). Whatever the case, the combined activities of MRN and CtIP are especially important for processing complex DNA break structures, where the ends are composed of damaged nucleotides, non-canonical DNA secondary structures, or covalent nucleoprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andres and Williams, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aparicio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aparicio and Gautier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hartsuiker et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartsuiker et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paudyal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Quennet et al., 2011</xref>). Short range nucleolytic processing of these ends by MRN-CtIP facilitates further long-range resection by processive helicases and nucleases including Exo1, DNA2, BLM, and WRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cejka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daley et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In vitro experiments with recombinant human proteins show that Mre11 can cut the 5′-strand of a DNA duplex downstream of a break. This activity is dependent on the presence of Nbs1 and enhanced by a nucleoprotein block at the 5′-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anand et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reginato et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In Xenopus egg cell-free extracts, it was shown that CtIP-MRN is essential for the removal of Top2-DNA adducts and the subsequent resection of these breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aparicio et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the interaction between CtIP and BRCA1 (mediated by phosphorylation of S327 on CtIP) is required for the processing of Top2-adducted ‘complex’ DSBs but dispensable for the resection of endonuclease-generated ‘simple’ breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aparicio et al., 2016</xref>). This is reminiscent of the finding that the CtIP mutant N289A/H290A cannot rescue the end resection-deficient phenotype for topoisomerase-induced breaks but is proficient for simple breaks, although here it was postulated that this deficiency was based on a disruption of CtIP endonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Makharashvili et al., 2014</xref>). In any case, once a nick is made, Mre11 uses its 3′−5’ exonuclease function to strip back the 5’ strand towards the blocked end. In these experiments, wild type CtIP did not enhance the endonuclease activity of MRN, although a stimulation of activity was observed when a phosphomimic mutant (T847E/T859E) was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deshpande et al., 2016</xref>). In mammalian cells, it was shown that both phosphorylation sites are important for CtIP function. In contrast, studies using recombinant <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> proteins show that the CtIP orthologue Sae2 appears to be absolutely required for unlocking a cryptic endonuclease activity of Mre11, possibly highlighting a difference in regulation between the yeast and human systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Structural information for CtIP is limited to a small N-terminal region of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> homologue Ctp1 (amino acids 5–60) and a similar region of human CtIP (amino acids 18–52) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2015</xref>). In both cases, there is an interlocking arrangement of two antiparallel coiled coils which leads to a ‘dimer of dimers’ arrangement. In addition, it has been shown that a truncated form of the human protein comprising residues 18–145 forms a stable homotetramer in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2015</xref>). A mutation (L27E) that prevented tetramerization also rendered CtIP non-functional in vivo. The proposed model that arises from these reports is one where two rigid coiled coils (aa1-145) protrude in opposite directions from the tetramerisation domain, spanning a distance of about 30 nm, with the unstructured C-termini presumably placed at the opposing ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forment et al., 2015</xref>). It has been shown that CtIP binds to DNA; for S. <italic>pombe</italic> Ctp1 a number of DNA substrates have been interrogated by EMSA and were all shown to be bound with similar affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2015</xref>). This study also used scanning alanine mutagenesis to identify residues that are important for binding. A C-terminal ‘RHR’ motif (equivalent to conserved residues R837 to R839 in the human protein) was shown to be crucial for DNA recognition, but it was also shown that an N-terminal part of the protein binds DNA. For human CtIP, it has been shown that the C-terminal region (aa769-897) interacts with a 200 bp duplex, whereas the N-terminal region (aa1-145) does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2015</xref>). In the case of the full length human protein, DNA binding activity has only been demonstrated using gel-based crosslinking assays which gives limited information about equilibrium binding affinities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Makharashvili et al., 2014</xref>). An important outstanding question is whether the affinity of CtIP for different DNA end structures can explain its relative importance in the processing of ‘complex’ versus ‘simple’ ends in vivo. Moreover, since the DNA binding domains are thought to reside in the opposing C-termini, this may be a way in which a CtIP tetramer could bridge two distant broken DNA ends to promote DSB repair.</p><p>In this report, we show that full length human CtIP is a tetrameric protein that forms a dumbbell-shaped particle consisting of two polar globular domains separated by a thin and flexible ‘rod’. Semi-quantitative measurements of CtIP affinity for a range of DNA substrates show that, somewhat surprisingly, CtIP binding does not require DNA ends per se. However, CtIP binds much more effectively to structures with DNA ends that contain model nucleoprotein blocks or single-stranded DNA fork structures. Our results are rationalised in terms of a ‘slide and capture’ model for the recognition of complex DNA ends. Furthermore, we provide direct evidence for CtIP-dependent DNA bridging activity and show that both DNA binding and bridging are reduced by mutations which target the tetramerization interface or the C-terminal RHR motif.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Full length human CtIP is a tetrameric protein that forms a dumbbell-shaped particle</title><p>Full length recombinant human CtIP and mutant variants were overexpressed in insect cells and purified to homogeneity using a cleavable C-terminal strep-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; see Materials and methods for details). Analysis by SEC-MALS showed that wild type CtIP ran as a single symmetrical peak with a predicted molecular weight that was equal within error to a tetrameric species (391 ± 23 kDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as we had expected based on previous work with the isolated N-terminal region of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2015</xref>). However, the CtIP peak elutes earlier in the size exclusion column than would be expected for a ~ 400 kDa protein, which suggests that it adopts an unusual shape. Indeed, direct observation of purified CtIP using negative stain electron microscopy revealed an extraordinary dumbbell-like structure in which polar globular domains are held about 30 nm apart by a central ‘rod’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, β class; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The length of the rod is broadly consistent with the predicted length of the coiled-coil domains, which suggests that the centre of the dumbbell is the site of the tetramerization interface as proposed in a previous model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forment et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the dumbbell structures, we less frequently observed structures that we call ‘tadpoles’ containing a single globular domain and a tail, which presumably represent a dimeric form of the protein formed during EM sample preparation and deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, α class; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42129.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Wild type CtIP is a tetrameric protein that forms a dumbbell-shaped particle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SDS-PAGE and SEC-MALS analysis of wild type CtIP as prepared (lane 1, black trace) and following dephosphorylation post-purification (lane 2, grey trace). Horizontal lines on the SEC-MALS graph show the expected molecular weights for monomeric, dimeric and tetrameric CtIP species.

The simplest and smallest structures consisted of a single bright spot or a single spot with a tail (class I and II). Somewhat larger structures were observed in which two or three spots are connected by rods (class III and IV respectively). Finally, the largest class of particle contained up to four connected spots (class V). These different particles were associated with different volume profiles, with the largest particle class (class V) displaying a relative volume consistent with a tetrameric species (~380 kDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuentes-Perez et al., 2012</xref>). These either resembled the dumbbells we had observed by EM (β class particles) or showed a morphology that suggested that the polar globular domains had separated (‘splayed dumbbells’; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Other particle classes presumably arise from dissociation of the tetramer into smaller species, either upon dilution for the AFM analysis or because of deposition onto the mica surface. To aid interpretation of the different particle classes and for further biochemical analysis (see below) we also analysed two mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The putative DNA binding mutant CtIP<sup>R839A</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2015</xref>), which disrupts the C-terminal RHR motif, retained a tetrameric structure based on SEC-MALS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and produced very similar results to the wild type protein in the AFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). In contrast, the CtIP<sup>L27E</sup> mutant, which disrupts the N-terminal tetramerization interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2015</xref>), ran as an apparently smaller particle in SEC-MALS with predicted molecular weights across the peak ranging from ~ 270 to 190 kDa (most similar to a dimer molecular weight). Importantly, when imaged using AFM, the CtIP<sup>L27E</sup> preparation was completely devoid of the largest class of particle (Class V; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>) which, in combination with the SEC-MALS results, suggests again that the class V particle represents tetrameric CtIP.

Firstly, we analysed directly the binding of CtIP to a HEX-labelled DNA fork using anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The binding isotherm was well fit to a hyperbola yielding a value for the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of 16 nM, which is somewhat tighter than suggested by using the semi-quantitative EMSA technique with the same substrate.

Somewhat surprisingly however, CtIP treated with phosphatases has shown evidence for an <italic>increased</italic> DNA binding affinity although this effect was not extensively investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anand et al., 2016</xref>). This implies a possible regulation of DNA binding by phosphorylation at one or more undefined sites. Analysis by mass spectrometry showed that our standard CtIP preparation is hyper-phosphorylated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> for details). Therefore, to test how phosphorylation status affects DNA binding quantitatively, we next prepared dephosphorylated CtIP (CtIP<sup>λ</sup>) by treatment with λ phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). CtIP<sup>λ</sup> retained a tetrameric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and bound to forked DNA significantly more tightly than did untreated CtIP as judged crudely by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Furthermore, it displayed &gt; 10 fold tighter affinity for forked DNA based on fluorescence anisotropy measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The best fit to these data using the tight-binding equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>) gave K<sub>d</sub> = 1.5 nM and stoichiometry (n) = 0.58 CtIP<sub>4</sub> per DNA fork. Note that this K<sub>d</sub> value should be regarded as an upper limit, because the binding is too tight to measure accurately at the lowest probe concentration we used here (5 nM). The enhanced affinity observed for dephosphorylated CtIP is not the result of an artefactual change in solution conditions imposed by the λ phosphatase or its reaction buffer as the increase in binding affinity can be time-resolved, occurring slowly after the addition of the phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The molecular basis for this increased affinity presumably relates to the phosphorylation status of one or more amino acids in CtIP (see Discussion section). Although this very tight binding precluded an accurate determination of K<sub>d</sub>, it instead allowed us to rigorously investigate the stoichiometry of the CtIP-DNA interaction by performing anisotropy assays with different DNA concentrations, all of which were significantly above the value of the dissociation constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Under such conditions, the binding isotherms are approximately linear until saturation for a range of DNA concentrations as would be expected. The binding stoichiometry was determined as 0.56 CtIP<sub>4</sub> per DNA fork molecule by global fitting of the data to the tight-binding equation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>). This is equivalent to two DNA molecules bound to each CtIP tetramer at saturation (assuming that our CtIP preparation is 100% active).

To explore the biochemical basis for this phenomenon we tested whether the affinity of CtIP for different DNA substrates depended on the structure of the DNA ends. To compare the relative affinity of a wider range of DNA substrates, including those with complex DNA end structures such as DNA conjugated to other proteins, we performed competition unbinding assays using fluorescence anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>; further details for the structures of the DNA molecules used and their construction can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

This is consistent with a simple competition between the labelled probe DNA and the competitor DNA for the CtIP DNA binding loci. Note that the measured IC<sub>50</sub> value is limited at low values by the K<sub>d</sub> of the interaction between CtIP and the reference DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang, 2003</xref>). Therefore, this method is most useful for comparing the relative affinities of DNA substrates that bind weaker to CtIP than does the reference (HEX-fork) probe, as is generally the case here.

In comparison, fully single- and double-stranded DNA substrates were relatively poor competitors (IC<sub>50</sub> values of 314 nM and 392 nM respectively) in qualitative agreement with the EMSA analysis which had also shown a clear preference for forked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, this effect required the presence of both the 3′- and 5′- ssDNA overhangs in the fork (i.e. a Y-junction) as neither polarity overhang alone significantly improved the observed binding relative to duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We next titrated a variety of much larger competitor DNA molecules which differed in terms of their average length, topology, and whether they were single- or double-stranded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In terms of the total nucleotide concentration, the IC<sub>50</sub> value was broadly similar for single- and double-stranded DNA. Moreover, the IC<sub>50</sub> was largely unaffected by whether the DNA was circular, linearised or fragmented into many pieces. This demonstrates that CtIP does not bind preferentially to DNA ends compared to internal sites because the efficacy of the competitor is independent of the total concentration of free DNA ends. Further experiments with a range of short single-stranded oligonucleotides showed that binding was length dependent (in terms of absolute molecule concentrations) and very poor on substrates shorter than around 30 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Next, to investigate how modified ‘complex’ DNA ends might affect the affinity of CtIP for DNA, we end-labelled different DNA competitor molecules with a model nucleoprotein block based on the biotin:streptavidin interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The addition of biotin labels alone to the termini of the DNA competitor molecules had no significant effect or slightly weakened the IC<sub>50</sub> values. However, the additional binding of streptavidin to the terminal biotin moieties dramatically increased the efficacy of the DNA molecules as competitors. For example, a fully duplex 45 base pair DNA molecule displayed an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 392 nM and biotinylation of either one, or both of the ends, resulted in values of 413 and 448 nM respectively. However, the IC<sub>50</sub> value reduced to 146 nM with a single biotin:streptavidin block and further to 80 nM with a biotin:streptavidin block at either end (compare the red bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Moreover, similar effects were observed on both single-stranded and forked DNA substrates (blue and green bars respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The enhanced binding afforded by streptavidin blocking was apparent regardless of whether the biotin moiety was placed at the 5’ or 3’ end of DNA strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). In these competition experiments, streptavidin was added at a large excess (8.5-fold) to prevent multimerization of the competitor DNA. Importantly, the addition of streptavidin to either single- or double-stranded competitor DNAs that lacked biotin moieties had no effect on the observed IC<sub>50</sub> value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This shows that the observed effect is dependent on binding of a streptavidin molecule to the biotinylated DNA end, as opposed to a non-specific effect of free streptavidin. Nevertheless, it is difficult to exclude the possibility that the effect observed here is due to a weak non-specific interaction between CtIP and streptavidin. In an attempt to address this, we also found that when a biotin was placed in the middle of a duplex DNA molecule, the IC<sub>50</sub> value was now <italic>weaker</italic> in the presence of streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This could indicate either that the streptavidin is blocking the association of CtIP with internal sites and/or that the positive effect of streptavidin binding on CtIP affinity requires it to be positioned specifically at a DNA end.</p><p>The <italic>enhancement</italic> of DNA binding we observe as a result of DNA end blocking by streptavidin also serves to highlight the distinctive and unusual DNA binding properties of CtIP in comparison to more conventional DSB repair factors. For example, the association between DNA and the NHEJ-factor Ku (with which CtIP competes to determine pathway choice in DSB repair) is seen to be severely inhibited by biotin:streptavidin end blocks in experiments analogous to those described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>CtIP bridges DNA in vitro</title><p>We next used atomic force microscopy to directly image CtIP:DNA interactions and potential bridging interactions. We engineered a DNA substrate containing short ssDNA tails at both ends because EMSA assays had shown that this was a favourable structure for binding (see Materials and methods for details). Initially we used AFM to image the DNA substrate alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The DNA was homogenous, consisting virtually entirely of molecules with a single contour length as would be expected (i.e. the DNA substrate was monomeric). The length of the substrate DNA with single-strand overhangs is 587 bp, which we expect to be ~ 200 nm long based on a value of 0.34 nm/bp for B-DNA. In good agreement with this estimate, the mean contour length measured for the control bare DNA substrate was 195 ± 22 nm. We next repeated this imaging experiment, but in the presence of increasing concentrations of CtIP. In the presence of CtIP we observed free CtIP as well as CtIP:DNA complexes, albeit at a lower frequency than might be expected given the very tight binding of CtIP to DNA in free solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This might reflect the need to treat the mica surface with Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions to facilitate DNA deposition, a condition we know to be inhibitory to CtIP:DNA interaction (see Materials and methods for details). Furthermore, we saw an increase in the number of DNA molecules with contour lengths equal to 2x, 3x or even 4x the monomer length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, which shows the cumulative frequency of DNA molecules as a function of DNA length for increasing doses of CtIP. Considering a threshold length of 195 + 22 nm (mean control length + SD), the percentage of molecules above this threshold is 4% in the ‘no-protein’ control experiment rising to about 30% in samples containing the highest concentrations of CtIP. In terms of the bridged molecules which are exactly the expected lengths (i.e. multiples of 195 nm within 2σ error) we see none whatsoever for the ‘no protein’ control, rising to ~ 7% in samples containing wild type CtIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Note that this quantification method does not score for intramolecular bridging events as these would result in single length circularised products, although these were observed in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). As would be expected based on our observation that the binding specificity is not strictly for ends, we saw a range of intermolecular connections between two DNA duplexes including end-to-end, end-to-centre and centre-to-centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, zoomed-in panels). This observation serves to highlight the fact that DNA bridging cannot be the result of sticky end annealing between DNA substrates lacking the ligated forked ends. Moreover, in many cases, analysis of the height and width of the bridging interfaces between DNA molecules provided evidence for additional mass which we interpret as CtIP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> for data). We did observe instances of DNA bridges with no additional mass. These might reflect CtIP dissociation from DNA concomitant with deposition onto the Mg<sup>2+</sup>-treated mica surface as discussed above. In the presence of CtIP, a small proportion of the DNA substrate was less than a single contour length, and many of the bridged molecules were not (within error) multiples of single contour lengths as might be expected. This could be explained by the presence of a weak nuclease activity in the preparation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref> for further discussion and analysis of this activity), and/or by CtIP binding causing a condensation effect on the DNA such that contour length is underestimated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42129.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>CtIP promotes intermolecular DNA bridging.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative AFM images of forked DNA substrates in the absence of CtIP.

(<bold>D</bold>) Quantified nuclease assay using 250 nM wild type CtIP against 5 nM forked DNA in the presence of different divalent cations. Nuclease activity was observed which was consistent with cleavage of the 5′-terminated ssDNA flap as reported previously. This nuclease activity may explain the small proportion of less than single contour length substrates observed in our AFM bridging experiments. However, at the highest concentrations tested (which are &gt;&gt; Kd for the binding interaction with the DNA) the half-life of the DNA fork substrate was on the order of several hours. The specific nuclease activity varied between wild type preparations and did not correlate with the ability of CtIP to bind DNA. For example, the C-terminal deletion mutant CtIP<sup>1-782</sup> does not bind DNA (data not shown) while dephosphorylated CtIP has ~ 10 fold greater affinity for DNA than wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, main text), but both preparations retain apparent nuclease activity comparable to wild type. Mutations designed to inactivate a putative nuclease active site (N289A and H290A) did reduce the observed nuclease activity in the preparation as reported previously, but a mutation thought to result in hyperactivated nuclease activity (S347D) was less active than any of our wild type preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Makharashvili et al., 2014</xref>). The dependence of the observed activity on divalent cation identity was qualitatively different for our preparation compared to that reported previously, with Mg<sup>2+</sup> being the marginally favoured co-factor as opposed to a substantial preference for Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Makharashvili et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest to us that the nuclease activity in the preparation most likely belongs to a contaminant or co-purified protein rather than to the CtIP polypeptide. However, we are unable to exclude the possibility that CtIP (either as prepared or dephosphorylated) possesses a very weak and/or tightly-regulated nuclease activity.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42129-fig6-figsupp3-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig6s4" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42129.020</object-id><label>Figure 6—figure supplement 4.</label><caption><title>Dephosphorylated CtIP promotes intermolecular DNA bridging.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative AFM images of forked DNA substrates in the absence of dephosphorylated CtIP (CtIP<sup>λ</sup>).

In comparison to wild type, dephosphorylated CtIP was more effective at bridging DNA molecules. Both the total percentage of bridged molecules and the proportion of the bridged molecules displaying greater than 2x contour length were increased. In contrast, both mutant proteins were severely defective in DNA bridging as would be expected based on their weak DNA binding affinities. On this measure, no bridging was observed in the ‘no-protein’ control, although a second negative control using BSA did show a low level of apparent activity.

The purified protein is tetrameric and adopts a striking ‘dumbbell’ architecture, which we have observed with both negative-stain EM and AFM. This shape is expected based on the hypothesis that CtIP adopts a ‘dimer of dimers’ arrangement, in which the tips of long N-terminal parallel coiled coils interact to form the tetrameric interface observed in crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forment et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We found that CtIP bound tightly to DNA using both EMSA and fluorescence anisotropy assays. Evidence that a major DNA binding locus resides in the distal C-terminal domains is provided by the inability of the R839A mutant to bind effectively to DNA, despite retaining a normal oligomeric state (this work; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andres et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The globular structure of the C-terminal domains and the 2:4 stoichiometry of DNA to CtIP monomers implies a dimeric arrangement of the DNA binding domains. It will be of particular interest to determine a high-resolution structure for this region of the protein bound to DNA as, despite the presence of the small ‘RHR’ motif, this region of the protein does not obviously resemble any known DNA binding domain.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42129.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A speculative model for binding and bridging of broken DNA ends by CtIP.</title><p>The CtIP monomer comprises at least three functional regions; an N-terminal tetramerization domain, a central region of predicted disorder, and a C-terminal DNA binding domain. This assembles to form a dumbbell-shaped tetramer (evidence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Wild type CtIP binds tightly to two DNA molecules via C-terminal RHR motifs, but this is disfavoured by hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Mutation within this motif (R839A) prevents DNA binding and bridging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Mutation within the N-terminal coiled-coil domains prevents assembly into a tetramer, DNA binding and DNA bridging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The grey coloured domains are intended to indicate their inactivation by mutation. The inability of L27E to bind to DNA implies that mutations in the coiled coils have effects on the distal DNA binding domains (see main text for discussion). Wild type CtIP binds DNA without preference for ends per se (i.e. internally) and bridges DNA segments either intra- and inter-molecularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, and the Figure Supplements). Based on the preferential binding to DNA with forked or blocked ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we <italic>speculate</italic> that CtIP may then slide and capture DNA ends possessing forked structures or nucleoprotein conjugates, because they prevent dissociation from the free ends (see main text for discussion). This arrangement might then allow the dimeric sub-assemblies within CtIP to slide away from each DNA end to which they are bound, facilitating resection and/or access to the DSBs for resection and signalling factors while maintaining their pairing. This proposal will be the subject of future work.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42129-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>A surprising result was that the L27E point mutant also displayed a dramatically reduced DNA binding affinity. This mutation was designed on the basis of crystal structures of the extreme N-terminal coiled-coil to disrupt protein:protein interactions responsible for tetramer formation, and renders CtIP non-functional in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, analysis by both SEC-MALS and AFM suggested that this mutant was completely unable to form tetrameric assemblies. Our work suggests therefore, that mutations in the tetramer interface may have a more broadly destabilising effect on the biochemical activity of CtIP than simply interfering with the oligomeric state. It may be that association with DNA requires communication between two distant binding loci, although we have observed no evidence for co-operativity in our binding experiments. Alternatively, the failure to tetramerise may simply have an unfavourable effect on the global architecture of CtIP that disfavours DNA binding.</p><p>There was no evidence to suggest that CtIP bound preferentially to DNA ends in vitro, as might be expected given its well-defined role in the early stages of DSB repair. However, we did find that modifications to the ends of DNA substrates, including ssDNA forks and model nucleoprotein blocks, strongly increased their affinity for CtIP. This provides a biochemical basis for the observation that the activity of CtIP is especially important for the repair of ‘complex’ or ‘dirty’ DSBs in vivo, such as those programmed during meiosis by Spo11 or formed during topoisomerase poisoning by etoposide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aparicio and Gautier, 2016</xref>). It can also help to explain why MRN-dependent nicking of DNA neighbouring blocked DNA ends requires (or is at least strongly stimulated by) CtIP, which interacts physically and functionally with MRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anand et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Williams et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism by which modifications to DNA ends increase the affinity of CtIP for DNA remains to be determined. One simple possibility would be that CtIP interacts directly with the protein or nucleic acid conjugates that we have appended to our DNA substrates. However, we do not favour such a model: it is difficult to see how a direct protein-mediated interaction could recognise the fundamentally different types of ends that we have used in vitro or which must presumably be recognised in vivo. Alternatively, the protein might act via a ‘slide and capture’ mechanism in which the interaction is initially with internal sites with the DNA ends acting as exit sites. In that case the dissociation may be disfavoured if the end is modified with any bulky blocking moiety, including Y-junctions and nucleoprotein complexes, such that complex ends would act to capture CtIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Presumably, the localisation of CtIP at DSBs in vivo is also mediated by the many other proteins with which it interacts, including the BRCA1-BARD1 complex and MRN, or by the post-translational modifications which they facilitate.</p><p>CtIP was found to be hyperphosphorylated as prepared from insect cells lysed in the presence of dephosphorylation inhibitors. This is as expected based on several previous reports of regulatory phosphorylation events on CtIP mediated by kinases linked to the DNA damage response or cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huertas and Jackson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, we observed a strong potentiation of DNA binding affinity (&gt;10 fold tighter) when CtIP was dephosphorylated either during- or post-purification. This is consistent with a previous report that highlighted an apparent stimulation of DNA binding by dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anand et al., 2016</xref>), but unintuitive given that phosphorylation events on CtIP activate it in vivo. It remains unclear whether this effect is manifest by one or a small number of dephosphorylation events at specific residues, and therefore may represent a regulatory mechanism, or whether this simply represents a general effect of removing extensive negative charge from the surface of the protein, and this will be the subject of further study. Nevertheless, the regulation of DSB repair factors by downregulation of DNA binding via post-translational modification is certainly not unprecedented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Honda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The very tight binding mode of dephosphorylated CtIP facilitated experiments to determine the binding stoichiometry between the CtIP tetramer and short DNA fork substrates. We found that each tetramer can bind two such DNA molecules. Given the dumbbell architecture that we have observed and the location of a key DNA binding motif in the distal C-terminus, we speculate that these two DNA molecules bind to the opposing ends of the tetramer, where a major DNA binding locus might be formed by dimerization of the C-terminal domains including the RHR motif. This arrangement may help to co-ordinate the repair and eventual re-joining of two DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In this respect, it is interesting to note that our AFM experiments observed significant flexibility in the connecting rod between the globular domains, which may help facilitate such co-ordination. Consistent with this model, we also showed that CtIP was able to bridge DNA segments intermolecularly. Such a bridging activity might also help to tether the homology donor DNA in proximity to the broken DNA molecules to promote strand exchange. Given the very large number of reported CtIP interaction partners, it is possible that CtIP acts as a binding platform for co-ordinating two ended DSBs with the recruitment of signalling factors of the DNA damage response and for the assembly of a ‘resectosome’ complex to promote repair by recombination. Higher resolution structural information for full length CtIP protein and its interactions with partner proteins will be instrumental in understanding its important role in DNA break recognition and the regulation of homologous recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>A synthetic gene codon-optimised for <italic>S. frugiperda</italic> (Geneart, Invitrogen) encoding wild type human CtIP was cloned into the pACEBac1 vector using the BamHI and XbaI restriction sites for use in the MultiBac system (Geneva Biotech).

After 30 s, the mica surface was washed with 3 ml Milli-Q water (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and gently dried under nitrogen air flow.

The binding reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min in a 2 μl reaction volume. Then, the mica was pretreated with a solution of 7.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and washed with 3 ml MilliQ water. Note that this pre-treatment is essential for successful deposition of DNA and DNA:protein complexes onto the mica surface and also that MgCl<sub>2</sub> at moderate concentrations is inhibitory to CtIP binding (data not shown). Residual Mg<sup>2+</sup> may cause unbinding of CtIP from DNA concomitant with deposition onto the mica, explaining why relatively few DNA:CtIP complexes were observed despite the very tight binding observed in free solution.

Proteins were classified by the overall shape of the molecules in five different classes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Negative stain electron microscopy and image analysis</title><p>Purified CtIP was diluted to approximately 0.15 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris HCl pH8.0, 1 mM DTT, adsorbed onto glow-discharged carbon-coated grids, and negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The grids were observed using a FEI T12 Spirit electron microscope operating at 120 kV and the images were recorded using FEI 2K eagle camera at a magnification of 52,000. Image processing was performed using RELION 2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scheres, 2012</xref>). Initially 15,236 particles were picked from 96 micrographs and reference-free 2D classification was used to remove poor particles, resulting in 6924 particles with approximately a 35/65 ratio divided between the two classes α and β.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assays</title><p>5′-Cy5-labelled DNA substrates (2.5 nM final) were mixed with increasing amounts of CtIP protein (up to 250 nM for WT and up to 1 µM for mutants L27E and R839A, as indicated) in a total volume of 10 μL 1X EMSA buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 5% glycerol) and then incubated for 10 min at 25 ˚C. The samples were then loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide (29:1) native 1xTBE gel and separated by electrophoresis in 1xTBE at 150V for 40 mins. The gels were visualised using a Typhoon scanner and analysed using ImageQuant software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fluorescence anisotropy</title><p>Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made at 25 ˚C on a Horiba Jobin Yvon FluoroMax fluorimeter. The HEX dye was excited at wavelength 530 nm (excitation slit width 5 nm), and the emission was detected at 550 nm (emission slit width 5 nm). For the direct titrations, a 5 nM solution of DNA substrate in binding buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT) was used to which was added increasing amounts of concentrated CtIP protein. Note that the stated CtIP concentrations are as a tetramer. The contents of the cuvette were mixed thoroughly with a pipette and left for 1 min, which was sufficient to reach equilibrium, before each anisotropy reading was taken in duplicate and the numbers averaged. Fluorescence intensity changes were negligible (&lt;10% at saturation). The titrations were carried out three times independently to generate the error bars shown. The competition assays were carried out in the same way but with the pre-formation of the CtIP-Forked DNA complex at 5 nM DNA: 50 nM CtIP<sub>4</sub> (yielding about 75% bound DNA in the absence of competitor) followed by the addition of increasing amounts of unlabelled competitor DNA.</p><p>Anisotropy is given by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>I</italic><sub>VV</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>VH</sub> are the intensities of the vertical and horizontal components of the emitted light using vertical polarised excitation.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Maria Spies as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Luca Pellegrini (Reviewer #2); Claire Wyman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a biochemical and biophysical study of CtIP, a DNA repair factor with an important role in DNA-end resection. Activation of human CtIP protein promotes homologous recombination as it cooperates with the DSB processing machinery and is especially important for preparation of complex DSBs for longer range resection. The authors purified the full-length human CtIP. SEC-MALS analysis suggested that the protein is a tetramer, but with an unusual shape. The low resolution EM showed that this unusual shape is a dumbbell, in which polar globular domains are separated by the rod-like structure, which includes the tetramerization core. The dimers of CtIP appear as &quot;tadpoles&quot;. Similar, but more flexible structures were obtained by AFM. AFM, however, showed a broader diversity of the structures available to the CtIP tetramer, with most intriguing being the &quot;splayed dimers&quot;. Expertly performed biochemical studies show that human CtIP binds DNA structures with complex ends (forks, protein blocks etc.) with high affinity, that dephosphorylation enhances the binding. They also show that CtIP can bind simultaneously two DNA molecules and visualise DNA bridging using AFM. Based on these findings they propose a slide-and-capture model of CtIP function on DNA.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers agreed that this is an important, well-executed study that provides significant experimental support for current models of CtIP function. Much of the data solidly supports the authors' conclusions and their elegant &quot;slide-and-capture&quot; model. However, there are a couple of major issues that need to be addressed before publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) First, the reviewers were concerned with the AFM imaging data for DNA bridging. The authors need to provide additional explanation or experiments: CtIP has here low nM affinity for DNA end structures used. Binding reactions for AFM had 10 nM DNA and up to 250 nM CtIP BUT still show very little DNA bound protein. Please explain. If due to differences in buffer conditions, repeated with same buffer for all binding reactions.</p><p>Additional quantification if the AFM imaging is also necessary: Although the CtIP is ~100kD monomer and 400kD tetramer there is no additional volume/mass evident at the junction of bridged DNAs. What is the actual evidence of protein bound to the DNA in these images? This needs to be clarified. Measurements such as width and height of DNA and the protein coiled-coils could help. Perhaps these are exactly the same and cannot be distinguished, possible though unlikely, can easily be measured from existing images. Never the less the globular parts of the CtIP should still be evident at the junction of bridged DNA, but this is not the case for the examples shown in Figure 6.</p><p>Given the absence of protein mass/volume at DNA junctions, the authors need to address (with additional controls or explanation) the possibility that if the substrates were not well purified or separated from DNA with oligo ligated to one end, the DNA may have a sticky end and could form dimer due to hybridization of self-complementary ends.</p><p>In the EM analysis, the relative size of the globular domain is rather large, relative to the central connecting rod. In fact, it is surprising that a globular domain should be visible at all, given that the only autonomously folded part of CtIP is its N-terminal region (1-150, ~17% of the protein), while the rest is predicted to be mostly disordered, including the conserved C-terminal DNA-binding domain (~14%). Related to this, the shape of the protein as a dumbbell-like particle suggests that the two chains in each dimer, projecting away from the central, N-tetramerisation motif, manage somehow to remain associated throughout their length. This is an interesting, unanticipated finding of the study and should be highlighted in the Discussion.</p><p>2) The second main concern was about the possibility of Streptavidin-CtIP interaction. The positive effect of adding Streptavidin to CtIP's affinity towards DNA is general, which contrasts with the sharply different affinities for the various DNA substrates. Can the authors exclude whether a weak, non-specific interaction between CtIP and DNA-tethered Streptavidin could be responsible for the additional boost in competitor efficacy? After all, the CTD of CtIP is likely to engage in multiple protein-protein interactions. This wouldn't be adequately controlled by placing the streptavidin in the middle of the DNA, because in this substrate the main interaction site would be lost through steric hindrance. Even adding free streptavidin to the sample wouldn't completely control for this, because the effect of a putative non-specific interaction with streptavidin would presumably only be noticeable when taking place concurrently with the main interaction to the DNA. The increased affinity of CtIP for blocked DNA ends is an important conclusion of this study, however, the reviewers agreed that this additional control experiment would be a significant amount of extra-work. Thus, we would leave it to the authors to either carry out this control or to address this specific point in their Discussion.</p><p>3) Finally, it would be informative if the authors discuss their vision of how CtIP is targeted to the ends (perhaps through the interaction with MRN and MRN-dependent activation) and not to any other region of the genome that has sufficient stretches of naked DNA between obstacles (e.g. nucleosomes or other DNA bound proteins).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42129.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) First, the reviewers were concerned with the AFM imaging data for DNA bridging.

We tried many methods to reduce the negative charge on the mica surface to facilitate DNA binding and imaging of DNA:protein complexes. We eventually found that treating the surface with moderate MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations (7.5 mM) provided the best conditions. However, bulk experiments also showed that elevated Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were very poor for imaging CtIP alone and also dramatically decreased the affinity of CtIP for DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), and so our final protocol involved a Mg<sup>2+</sup> “pre-treatment” of the mica, followed by re-introduction of the CtIP:DNA complexes in the standard buffer. Because the pretreatment was necessary for binding, there must be residual Mg<sup>2+</sup> which is required for immobilisation of the DNA, but which would also be expected to inhibit the CtIP interaction concomitant with deposition. It is of course difficult to define these conditions precisely. Finally, the drying of the mica surface before imaging may also contribute to the low observed binding. We have now added statements in the Materials and methods and Results to more clearly explain this (subsection “CtIP bridges DNA in vitro”, first paragraph and subsection “Imaging”). <sup>-</sup></p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42129.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Moderately elevated MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations dramatically reduce the affinity of CtIP for DNA.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42129-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional quantification if the AFM imaging is also necessary: Although the CtIP is ~100kD monomer and 400kD tetramer there is no additional volume/mass evident at the junction of bridged DNAs.

We do in fact see examples of DNA bridges with additional volume present at the junction which indicates CtIP binding, and these are now presented along with discussion in the legend. Nevertheless, the reviewers are quite right to point out that we also see examples in which there is no apparent CtIP at the junctions and we imagine that these could arise in two ways. Firstly, for the reasons elaborated above, CtIP may dissociate from DNA concomitant with deposition onto the mica surface. Secondly, we do expect a small fraction (~4%) of the apparent bridges between DNA to be protein-free based on our own control experiments, which show longer than single contour length in the absence of protein (Figure 6C). This “noise” increases in the presence of proteins that cannot bind DNA (e.g. BSA) presumably due to crowding effects on the surface of the mica.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the absence of protein mass/volume at DNA junctions, the authors need to address (with additional controls or explanation) the possibility that if the substrates were not well purified or separated from DNA with oligo ligated to one end, the DNA may have a sticky end and could form dimer due to hybridization of self-complementary ends.</p></disp-quote><p>We think not for two reasons. (1) The bridging substrates were prepared by the annealing of 150-fold excess of oligonucleotides containing poly-dT overhangs to minimise this kind of issue. They were subsequently gel-purified away from unligated DNA which had a different mobility in agarose. Nevertheless, there might be some trace unligated DNA left, especially with just a single unligated sticky end which may not resolve well from the desired product. (2) Regardless of the substrate quality, the elevated levels of bridging we observe in the presence of CtIP cannot arise because of DNA:DNA interactions. Control experiments (bridging measured in the absence of protein, in the presence of BSA, or in the presence of CtIP mutants that do not bind DNA) all show markedly less bridging than experiments with wild type CtIP (or CtIP λ) and all were performed with identical DNA molecules. Moreover, the observed bridging is sometimes “end-to-centre” or “centre-to-centre” which is presumably impossible if it arises from sticky end annealing. We have now clarified these points in the Materials and methods (subsection “Sample preparation”) and Results (subsection “CtIP bridges DNA in vitro”, first paragraph) sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the EM analysis, the relative size of the globular domain is rather large, relative to the central connecting rod.

It should however be remembered that the EM “tadpoles” could conceivably represent tetramers with unfolded termini at one end and also that the particles we observe in AFM are far more variable, and include examples of tetrameric dumbbells with both “splayed” as well as intact globular C-terminal ends. The idea that the C-terminal ends are associated is also consistent with the fact that CtIP binds 0.5 DNA molecules per monomer, and implies that the DNA binding site might be dimeric in nature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The second main concern was about the possibility of Streptavidin-CtIP interaction. The positive effect of adding Streptavidin to CtIP's affinity towards DNA is general, which contrasts with the sharply different affinities for the various DNA substrates. Can the authors exclude whether a weak, non-specific interaction between CtIP and DNA-tethered Streptavidin could be responsible for the additional boost in competitor efficacy?

Thus, we would leave it to the authors to either carry out this control or to address this specific point in their Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>In our anisotropy-based DNA binding competition experiments we used streptavidin:biotin moieties as models for nucleoprotein conjugates at DNA ends. These have been widely used in the related literature to mimic the more physiologically relevant blocks that are formed by (e.g.) Spo11, etoposide-poisoned TopoII, or tightly bound NHEJ factors such as Ku. For example, the conclusion that CtIP activates the intrinsic nuclease activity of MRN at blocked DNA ends arose from analogous experiments to these, and so our experiments are important in this context. Nevertheless, the reviewers are right to point out that it is difficult to completely exclude the possibility that a weak non-specific interaction could also explain the effect we observe in our assay, and we now acknowledge this in the text (subsection “CtIP binds preferentially to DNA substrates with blocked DNA ends”, third paragraph). However, we are not clear what additional control could be performed, or is being suggested, since we have already performed the two that are mentioned in the review (moving the position of the streptavidin to the middle of the substrate and adding free streptavidin instead of DNA-conjugated streptavidin). We envision the best experiments moving forward will use more physiologically relevant covalent blocks; we are setting up to investigate the interaction of CtIP with topoII-conjugated DNA for instance (note that one cannot use non-covalent blocks in these competition experiments as they will exchange with the probe DNA to interfere with the FA measurement).</p><p>In addition to the above, we have performed a new experiment (subsection “CtIP binds preferentially to DNA substrates with blocked DNA ends”, last paragraph, Figure 5—figure supplement 4) which, we hope the reviewers will agree, helps to better define and highlight the unusual DNA binding properties of CtIP. One of our major conclusions supported by the streptavidin FA experiments is that CtIP is not a DNA end binding protein per se, but that modifications to ends affect its ability to retain DNA, which we rationalised in terms of a sliding model. This is in complete contrast to “classical” DNA end recognition factors such as Ku, or bacterial resection complexes like RecBCD, which display structural specificity for free DNA ends. We now present equivalent competition FA experiments with Ku which show that streptavidin blocks severely inhibit the ability of linear DNA substrates to compete for binding (behaviour which is the complete opposite to that of CtIP).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Finally, it would be informative if the authors discuss their vision of how CtIP is targeted to the ends (perhaps through the interaction with MRN and MRN-dependent activation) and not to any other region of the genome that has sufficient stretches of naked DNA between obstacles (e.g. nucleosomes or other DNA bound proteins).</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this point and have added a short paragraph to the Discussion (fourth paragraph).Briefly, and as implied by the reviewers, the most obvious possibility is that CtIP is directed to DNA ends by virtue of its many interactions with partner proteins. These include the BRCA1-BARD1 complex and MRN, either of which might influence its binding location via assembly or by facilitating post-translational modification.</p></body></sub-article></article>
