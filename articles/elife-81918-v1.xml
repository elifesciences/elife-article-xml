and genotoxic stresses. However, dysregulated inflammasomes cause an array of human diseases including autoinflammatory disorders and cancer. It was recently identified that endogenous pyrin-only-proteins (POPs) regulate inflammasomes by directly inhibiting their filament assembly. Here, by combining Rosetta in silico, in vitro, and in cellulo methods, we investigate the target specificity and inhibition mechanisms of POPs. We find here that POP1 is ineffective in directly inhibiting the central inflammasome adaptor ASC. Instead, POP1 acts as a decoy and targets the assembly of upstream receptor pyrin-domain (PYD) filaments such as those of AIM2, IFI16, NLRP3, and NLRP6. Moreover, not only does POP2 directly suppress the nucleation of ASC, but it can also inhibit the elongation of receptor filaments. In addition to inhibiting the elongation of AIM2 and NLRP6 filaments, POP3 potently suppresses the nucleation of ASC. Our Rosetta analyses and biochemical experiments consistently suggest that a combination of favorable and unfavorable interactions between POPs and PYDs is necessary for effective recognition and inhibition. Together, we reveal the intrinsic target redundancy of POPs and their inhibitory mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>pyrin-only-proteins</kwd><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM129342</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Shuai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM145363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Shuai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB1845003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garg</surname><given-names>Archit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08AI102696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roland</surname><given-names>Aubrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computational analyses and biochemical measurements redefine the mechanisms by which pyrin-only-proteins specifically target and regulate the assembly of inflammasomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inflammasomes are filamentous signaling platforms integral to host innate defense against a wide range of intracellular catastrophes, which include ionizing irradiation, genotoxic chemicals, and pathogen invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>).

Thus, understanding how inflammasome assemblies are regulated at the molecular level can provide key insights into developing strategies for preventing and treating various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Karki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tartey and Kanneganti, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vora et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Inflammasomes transduce signals by sequentially assembling filamentous oligomers, with multiple initial pathways progressively converging at downstream assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Wu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, an array of molecular signatures arising from various pathogenic conditions induces the oligomerization of inflammasome receptors, resulting in filament assembly by their pyrin-domains (PYDs; e.g. viral nucleic acids, reactive oxygen species, specific lipids from damaged mitochondria, and disruption of the trans-Golgi network) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreeva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hornung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>); PYDs are ~100 amino acid (a.a.) 6-helix bundle proteins that belong to the death-domain (DD) family often found in apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2007</xref>). The upstream PYD oligomers then induce the filament assembly by the PYD of the central adaptor ASC (ASC<sup>PYD</sup>), resulting in oligomerization/filamentation of its CARD (ASC: apoptosis-associated speck-forming protein-containing caspase-recruiting domain [CARD]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Wu, 2015</xref>). Finally, ASC<sup>CARD</sup> oligomers recruit pro-caspase-1 and induce its filament assembly, activating the enzyme by proximity-induced auto-proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Wu, 2015</xref>). Caspase-1 executes two key innate immune responses, namely the cleavage/maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, and the initiation of pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Wu, 2015</xref>).</p><p>A hallmark of inflammasome assembly is its binary (on-or-off) nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franklin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matyszewski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2021</xref>). That is, once assembled, inflammasomes do not dissociate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franklin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matyszewski et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, multiple positive feedback loops between upstream receptors and ASC not only bolster the assembly, but also result in prion-like self-perpetuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matyszewski et al., 2018</xref>). Such an inherently irreversible assembly mechanism in turn would necessitate extrinsic factors to prevent persistent activities. Indeed, mammalian pyrin-only-proteins (POPs) have emerged as major inhibitors of inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khare et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Periasamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ratsimandresy et al., 2017</xref>), functioning analogous to CARD-only proteins (COPs) that interfere with the oligomerization/activation of pro-caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Indramohan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). It has been proposed that the target specificities of POPs are dictated by their a.a. sequence homologies to inflammasome PYDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Indramohan et al., 2018</xref>). For example, POP1 is most homologous to ASC<sup>PYD</sup> (65% sequence identity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and thought to directly inhibit the nucleation of the ASC<sup>PYD</sup> filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2015</xref>). POP2 shares 68% sequence identity to the PYD of Nod-like receptor containing a PYD-2 (NLRP2<sup>PYD</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>); the primary target of POP2 is thought to be ASC, but it is also implicated in inhibiting the absent-in-melanoma-2 (AIM2) receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Periasamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ratsimandresy et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, POP3 is most similar to AIM2<sup>PYD</sup> (67% sequence identity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and targets AIM2-like receptors (ALRs, e.g. AIM2 and interferon inducible protein 16 [IFI16]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khare et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Inflammasome filaments are highly ordered supra-structures that entail at least two distinct steps for assembly: rate-limiting nucleation followed by elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Wu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matyszewski et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, although the PYDs of upstream receptors do not display significant a.a. sequence homologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Wu, 2015</xref>), they all assemble into structurally congruent helical filaments and signal through the common ASC adaptor, suggesting a degenerate-code-like recognition mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hochheiser et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Wu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matyszewski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2019</xref>). At present, little is known about how POPs selectively target and regulate the assembly of such diverse yet homologous supramolecular structures. This is because the current understanding on the mechanism of inhibition by POPs remains entirely inferred from indirect measurements and phenotypic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khare et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Periasamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ratsimandresy et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, by combining in silico, in cellulo, and in vitro methods, we delineate the target specificity and inhibition mechanisms of human POPs. We find that POP1 is a poor inhibitor of ASC and impedes the assembly of upstream receptor filaments instead (e.g. AIM2, IFI16, NLRP3, NLRP6). POP2 not only suppresses the nucleation of ASC, but also interferes with the assembly of multiple upstream receptors. Finally, in addition to potently suppressing the assembly of ALR and NLRP filaments (e.g. elongation of AIM2<sup>PYD</sup>), POP3 suppresses the nucleation of ASC. Our results indicate that a combination of favorable and strongly unfavorable interactions is necessary for POPs to inhibit the assembly of PYD filaments. Together, we propose that, instead of being dictated by a.a. sequence homology, degenerate-code-like target selection and inhibition mechanisms underpin the regulation of inflammasome assembly by POPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rosetta interface analyses suggest broad target specificities of POPs</title><p>Several inflammasome receptor PYDs signal through ASC<sup>PYD</sup> although their primary a.a. sequences vastly differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kagan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Wu, 2015</xref>). Such a functional redundancy among different PYDs in turn suggests that sequence homology may not dictate the target specificity of POPs. To elucidate how POPs recognize and regulate the assembly of different PYD filaments, we first implemented Rosetta-based in silico approach that we had recently developed to define the directionality of the AIM2-ASC inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matyszewski et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, PYDs assemble into helical filaments in which each protomer provides six unique protein-protein interaction surfaces (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, ‘Type’ 1a/b, 2a/b, and 3a/b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lu and Wu, 2015</xref>). As we had done before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matyszewski et al., 2021</xref>), we created a honeycomb-like side view of PYD filaments in which the middle protomer makes all six required contacts for filament assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then calculated Rosetta interface energies (∆Gs) for each PYD filament (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left), and also determined the ∆Gs for POP•PYD interactions by replacing the center protomer with each POP (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, three honeycombs on the right).

The interface analysis results from other inflammasome PYDs also showed similar symmetric energy landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>, left), suggesting that bidirectional assembly is universal to all PYD filaments. We next noted that the overall ∆Gs for individual PYD filaments were more favorable than those from any putative POP•PYD interactions, which in turn suggested that excess POPs might be necessary to inhibit the assembly of inflammasome PYDs (e.g. the sum of ASC<sup>PYD</sup>•ASC<sup>PYD</sup> interactions on the top half yields ∆G=–35.9, while that of POP1•ASC<sup>PYD</sup> is –24.7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–F</xref>). POP1 showed more favorable overall ∆Gs for ASC<sup>PYD</sup> compared to POP2 or POP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), seemingly supporting the previous report (and sequence homology) that POP1 likely binds ASC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2015</xref>). However, although it was reported that POP2 can inhibit ASC<sup>PYD</sup> more potently than POP1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ratsimandresy et al., 2017</xref>), its ∆Gs were less favorable (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>: POP1•ASCP<sup>YD</sup> = −24.7 vs. POP2•ASC = –0.8 on the top half). POP3, on the other hand, appeared to interact with ASC as favorably as POP1 at the bottom interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; ∆G=–34.3 for POP1•ASC<sup>PYD</sup> vs. ∆G=−34.6 for POP3•ASC<sup>PYD</sup>), suggesting that it could also inhibit the central adaptor.</p><p>For AIM2<sup>PYD</sup>, all three POPs showed comparable overall ∆Gs on the bottom half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which suggested that each of them could target AIM2.

These results in turn suggested that not only POP3, but POP1 and POP2 might also recognize IFI16. It has been speculated that POPs interfere with the recruitment of ASC by the upstream receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Indramohan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Periasamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ratsimandresy et al., 2017</xref>); however, it remains unknown whether they do so by directly inhibiting NLRPs, which are the major class of inflammasome receptors. Our Rosetta analyses here suggest that POP1 could interact with NLRP3<sup>PYD</sup> on the top half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; ∆G=–31.4 for NLRP3<sup>PYD</sup>•NLRP3<sup>PYD</sup> vs. ∆G=−30.5 for POP1•NLRP3<sup>PYD</sup>). However, the interactions between POP2/3 and NLRP3<sup>PYD</sup> appeared much less favorable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similar to NLRP3<sup>PYD</sup>, POP1 again showed more favorable energy scores toward NLRP6<sup>PYD</sup> than POP2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Although establishing the physiological relevance of POPs, these studies have left large voids in understanding their target selection and inhibition mechanisms. Because our in silico analyses did not immediately yield clear explanations for such questions, we set out to test POP•PYD interactions using more direct in cellulo and in vitro methods, focusing on ASC first. When ectopically expressed in HEK293T cells, C-terminally mCherry-tagged ASC<sup>PYD</sup> forms filaments and full-length ASC (ASC<sup>FL</sup>) forms puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matyszewski et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, HEK293T cells do not contain any endogenous inflammasome components or POPs, providing an ideal cellular system for directly tracking their interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matyszewski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we first tested whether co-transfecting C-terminally eGFP-tagged POPs hinders the oligomerization of ASC. Compared to co-transfecting eGFP alone, POP1-eGFP only marginally inhibited the filament assembly of ASC<sup>PYD</sup>-mCherry (≤20% suppression vs. eGFP control; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). By contrast, co-transfecting POP2-eGFP or POP3-eGFP significantly reduced the amount of ASC<sup>PYD</sup>-mCherry filaments, with POP2 being more effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>; note more diffused mCherry signals and reduction in linear filaments in the presence of POP2 and POP3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Monitoring oligomerization of mCherry-labeled ASC in the presence of untagged POPs also corroborated our observations with eGFP-tagged POPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that POP1 may not directly target ASC<sup>PYD</sup>. Moreover, unlike COPs that co-assemble with CARDs into filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2016</xref>), our observations indicate that POPs suppress filament assembly altogether.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>POP1 does not directly inhibit apoptosis-associated speck-forming protein-containing caspase-recruiting domain (ASC).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample fluorescent microscope images of HEK293T cells co-transfected with mCherry-tagged ASC<sup>PYD</sup> (300 ng; crimson) plus eGFP alone or eGFP-tagged pyrin-only-proteins (POPs) (1200 ng; green).

Moreover, no FRET signals were detected between donor-labeled POP1 and acceptor-labeled ASC<sup>PYD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Additionally, the presence of POP1 did not affect the formation of ASC<sup>PYD</sup> filaments when visualized with negative-stain electron microscopy (nsEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). By contrast, both POP2 and POP3 prolonged the initial lag phase of ASC<sup>PYD</sup> polymerization in a dose-dependent manner (up to ~15 min delay in nucleation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), while also moderately affecting the elongation phase (≤20% reduction in the slope; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Together, our in cellulo and in vitro experiments consistently indicate that POP1 is only marginally effective in directly suppressing the polymerization of ASC. We also find that both POP2 and POP3 impede the nucleation of the ASC<sup>PYD</sup> filament.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Re-examining the Rosetta analyses in light of biochemical experiments</title><p>Our biochemical experiments indicated that excess POPs are required to inhibit the polymerization of ASC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which is in agreement with the Rosetta analyses in which no POP•PYD interactions were more favorable than homotypic PYD•PYD interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).

We thus re-examined our Rosetta results in light of our biochemical experimental results, and noted that the interface energy profiles of POP2•ASC<sup>PYD</sup> and POP3•ASC<sup>PYD</sup> are different from that of POP1•ASC<sup>PYD</sup>.

These observations strongly suggest that the role of POP1 is to interfere with the assembly of upstream receptors rather than directly inhibiting ASC (i.e. a ‘decoy’ ASC; targeting ASC or multiple upstream receptors would result in the same phenotype).

Of note, NLRP2<sup>PYD</sup>-mCherry did not form filaments when expressed in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), precluding further investigations despite its high sequence similarity to POP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Indramohan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Periasamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ratsimandresy et al., 2017</xref>).

We reason that being able to modulate two key assembly steps (nucleation and elongation) while requiring excess POPs is well suited for attenuating inflammasome activities without shutting them down altogether.</p><p>Although previous studies showed that POP1 inhibits ASC-dependent inflammasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Almeida et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2015</xref>), its target selection and inhibition mechanism remains poorly understood. Here, we provide new insights into the inhibitory mechanism of POP1. That is, POP1 is only marginally effective in inhibiting the polymerization of ASC<sup>PYD</sup>. However, it is likely to modulate inflammasomes largely through interfering with the oligomerization of upstream PYDs, most notably by halting their elongation. It is noteworthy that the expression of POP1 is predominantly induced by IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Almeida et al., 2015</xref>), a major final product of inflammasome cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broz and Dixit, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is likely that POP1 is part of a negative feedback loop for attenuating excessive inflammasome activities by preventing perpetuation of upstream filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Target selection and mode of inhibition of pyrin-only-proteins (POPs).</title><p>A cartoon summarizing the refined intrinsic target specificity of POPs.

Interestingly, POP2 is reportedly more effective than POP1 in preventing spurious inflammasome activities in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Periasamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ratsimandresy et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, it has remained unclear whether it directly suppresses ASC assembly or those of upstream receptors. We find here that POP2 can indeed potently inhibit the nucleation of ASC<sup>PYD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) while moderately suppressing the oligomerization of select upstream receptors such as AIM2. It is noteworthy that the expression of POP2 is readily induced by a wide variety of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ratsimandresy et al., 2017</xref>). Considering that it primarily targets ASC, we postulate that POP2 would act as the pan-inflammasome inhibitor essential for preventing spurious innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; i.e. decoy receptor as it is most similar to upstream NLRP2<sup>PYD</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>POP3 was identified as a selective inflammasome inhibitor targeting ALRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khare et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to inhibiting the elongation of the AIM2<sup>PYD</sup> filament, we find here that POP3 can robustly inhibit the nucleation of ASC<sup>PYD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), revealing its dual targeting function similar to POP2. We also find that, in principle, POP3 can inhibit the assembly of NLRP<sup>PYD</sup>s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Unlike the other two POPs, POP3 is exclusively induced by interferons (IFNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khare et al., 2014</xref>), a major cytokine family that counteracts IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mayer-Barber and Yan, 2017</xref>). Considering that IFNs also drive the expression of ALRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antiochos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khare et al., 2014</xref>), we postulate that although POP3 is intrinsically capable of inhibiting various inflammasome receptors, the contextual expression would dictate its in vivo targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Design principles for inflammasome inhibition by POPs</title><p>We envision that the nonequilibrium assembly of inflammasome filaments plays a major role in defining the mechanism of regulation by POPs (i.e. kinetically driven without having conceivable off-rates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matyszewski et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, considering that all POP and PYD protomers share the same overall structure (shape complementarity), we reason that any (semi) favorable protein•protein interaction interfaces would allow POPs and PYDs to associate at least transiently (i.e. classic reversible protein•protein interaction equilibrium). However, the more favorable homotypic PYD•PYD interactions would readily outcompete such meta-stable interactions especially when only basal amounts of POPs are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, as indicated from the failure to inhibit ASC<sup>PYD</sup> by POP1, if POPs do not contain any strong unfavorable interactions against target PYDs, homotypic PYD•PYD interactions would still outcompete even excess POPs and lock themselves into irreversible filament assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, when such meta-stable POP•PYD complexes contain at least one very unfavorable interface, excess POPs would then expose a multitude of adverse protein•protein interaction surfaces that would hamper filament assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Also of note, given that POP2 and POP3 can form oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), it is highly likely that multimeric POPs are more effective in preventing the association of inflammasome PYDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We found previously that the recognition between AIM2 and ASC occurs when at least one is filamentous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matyszewski et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is also possible that POPs might preferentially interact with oligomeric PYDs that are not yet fully filamentous (e.g. (pseudo)-nucleation unit), trapping them into nonfunctional states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In closing, a possible caveat of our study is that although our experiments using AIM2<sup>FL</sup>, IFI16<sup>FL</sup>, and NLRP3<sup>FL</sup> are consistent with those from isolated PYDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 1C, 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>), considering that inflammasome receptors contain multiple domains, there could be yet another layer of complexity in POP•inflammasome interactions beyond what we have reported here. It will be also interesting to see to what extent our findings for POP•PYD interactions can be applied to other DD family proteins such as COPs and CARDs. Overall, our multi-disciplinary approach provides an example of how to use in silico predictions judiciously for investigating multipartite protein-protein interactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Rosetta simulation</title><p>The InterfaceAnalyzer script in Rosetta was used to determine the interaction energy (Rosetta energy units, reu) at individual interfaces of the honeycomb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matyszewski et al., 2021</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted a consensus set of essential revisions. Overall our judgement is that the paper is of potential enough importance to be considered for <italic>eLife</italic>, but significant revisions including new experiments are required.</p><p>In this manuscript, Mazanek and colleagues combine computational analysis and in vitro experiments to develop a comprehensive analysis of the ability of pyrin-only proteins (POPs) to inhibit inflammasome assembly. The pyrin domain (PYD) of each POP has a total of six interaction surfaces that can bind to the PYD of different inflammasome components. The results lead the authors to propose that a mixture of favorable and unfavorable interaction surfaces is required for a POP to inhibit a given inflammasome component. The results are potentially important as they may provide a generalizable mechanism by which POPs inhibit inflammasome activation. However, additional experimentation is required to fully justify the authors' model. Indeed, their 'mixed interface' model is not directly tested and the possibility that POPs could inhibit inflammasome signaling by being incorporated into filaments is not ruled out. A limitation of the study is that the authors only measure PYD filament formation and do not actually measure downstream inflammasome activation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors show that the MBP tag affects the oligomerization of POPs. The POPs used in Figures 2A, 3A, and 4A contain a GFP tag which may change the inhibitory effect of POPs on ASC filament formation. Experiments with untagged POPs are therefore required to validate the results.</p><p>2. The authors take the reduction of PYD filamentation as an indication of inhibition, but it is not clear how they ruled out the possibility that POP1 co-assembles into the ASCPYD filaments and inhibits inflammasome formation by repressing the recruitment of Caspase-1 (as POP1 lacks the CARD the effector domain). Thus, some functional assays measuring downstream Caspase-1 activation are required. In addition, the possibility that POP1 and ASC co-assemble could be tested directly with FRET experiments in which one protein is the donor and the other is the acceptor. Without such experiments, the statement in the Discussion &quot;Our investigations here reveal that POPs interfere with the polymerization (nucleation and/or elongation) of various inflammasome filaments without co-assembling, … &quot; does not appear to be justified.</p><p>3. Further computational analysis should be performed to determine if the theory that a combination of favorable and unfavorable interactions is generally applicable. Does this theory account for other PYD/PYD interactions and CARD/CARD interactions? For example, for the AIM2PYD/ASCPYD interface, do they see only a favorable interface or a mixture? How about two unrelated PYDs, such as between AIM2PYD and NLRP3PYD? How about for COPs? How about the homotypic interfaces between the POPs themselves? In addition, as raised by reviewer 3, the authors do not consider at all in this manuscript that there is a seventh interface described for PYDs besides the hexagonal assembly in the filament. This is the homodimer interface seen, e.g., for NLRP3, in the crystal structure of the PYD and in size exclusion chromatography (Bae and Park, 2011; 3QF2). For completeness, the energy scores should be also calculated for this interface. It might well be that POPs associate in this binding mode as heterodimeric assemblies to monomeric PYDs of NLRs or ALRs to regulate their activities. This would be somehow reminiscent of profilin binding to actin, regulating the pool of free G-actin for filament assembly.</p><p>4. To more directly test the mixed-interaction model, the authors should use their Rosetta structural predictions as a guide to introduce mutations into the various POP1/ASC-PYD interfaces to reduce the binding energies of those specific interactions and then test whether the introduction of a single or multiple, weak interactions then allows POP1 to restrict ASC-PYD oligomerization. To further elucidate their mixed interface model, the authors should also address whether the weak interactions need to be on the same 'half' of the interface, e.g., does weakening the 1b and 2b interfaces lead to better disruption of PYD filamentation than a 1b/1a combination mutant?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figures 2A, 3A, and 4A could be complemented with untagged POPs, which may limit the observation of POP expression, but could still tell how they affect ASC filamentation in their physiological form by observing the mCherry signal.</p><p>2. Figure 2-4, panel Es and panel Fs: It should be described in the figure legend that the MBP-tagged ASC protein is used to measure the FRET signal upon TEV cleavage. It should also be noted whether the MBP-tagged POPs are used in these assays, or the proteins w/o tag.</p><p>3. To test the co-assembly model, the FRET assay should be performed with either POP1 or PYD as the donor, and the other protein as the receptor.</p><p>4. An inflammasome functional assay should be performed to test if POP1 inhibits inflammasome activation w/o disrupting ASC filament formation.</p><p>5. If the authors can calculate the AIM2PYD /ASCPYD interface, do they see only a favorable interface or both? How about two unrelated PYDs, such as between AIM2PYD and NLRP3PYD? How about COPs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I believe that this is a strong manuscript with a careful and detailed analysis of the ability of the POPs to disrupt PYD filament formation. However, I believe that there are two critical points that the authors should address.</p><p>First, the authors propose that the mix of strong and weak interactions between the POPs and the various PYDs regulate the ability of the POPs to block PYD filamentation. For example, the authors propose that the reason POP1 fails to restrict ASC-PYD filamentation is due to a lack of weak interactions, whereas both POP2 and POP3 are able to interfere with ASC-PYD oligomerization through a mix of strong and weak interactions. This is an interesting hypothesis, however I believe that it needs to be tested directly.</p><p>In particular, I would like to see the authors use their Rosetta structural predictions as a guide to introduce mutations into the various POP1/ASC-PYD interfaces that reduce the binding energies of those specific interactions and then test whether the introduction of a single, or multiple, weak interactions then allows POP1 to restrict ASC-PYD oligomerization. Additionally, I believe that it may be prudent to generate combinations of mutants along the different interfaces to uncover whether the weak interfaces are required to be on the same facing to disrupt PYD oligomerization – for example, would weakening the 1b and 2b interfaces lead to better disruption of PYD filamentation than a 1b/1a combination mutant? I believe these experiments are necessary for the authors to demonstrate that a combination of strong and weak interfaces is necessary to disrupt PYD filamentation as they propose. Additional mutagenesis of the other POP/PYD interactions may be an appropriate alternative to directly test the proposed mechanism.</p><p>A potential area for clarification on this point is the mechanism through which POP1 fails to regulate ASC PYD oligomerization. Looking at the del(G) calculated for POP1/ASC-PYD interaction the del-del(G) compared with ASC-PYD/ASC-PYD is only ~1. Compared with the POP2/NLRP3-PYD interaction in which POP2 fails to prevent NLRP3-PYD oligomerization and where the del-del(G) is nearly 30, this seems unexpected. Is POP1 becoming incorporated within the ASC-PYD filament? If the authors mix individually labeled POP1 and ASC-PYD protein in their FRET assay do they observe co-oligomerization and or co-localization in their spec assays?</p><p>The second issue I believe that the authors need to address is whether the POPs truly disrupt inflammasome signaling through the mechanisms they propose. While I appreciate the authors' microscopy demonstrating a lack of PYD spec formation in their reconstituted system I believe that they need to demonstrate that the POPs are able to restrict inflammasome activation in a more natural setting. For example, this could be accomplished by transducing the POPs (and/or mutants that are able or unable to restrict PYD oligomerization) into THP1s, prime, and activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and showing a loss of cell death and/or cytokine processing. Of course, it would be outside the scope of this manuscript to expect this for all the inflammasomes and POPs in combination, however, I believe that showing POP-mediated inhibition for at least one inflammasome/POP pair, along with POP mutants to demonstrate the loss of specific interface interactions proposed by the Rosetta calculations are required for the POPs to block inflammasome activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It seems to this reviewer that the authors have written the manuscript in chronological order as they have performed the experiments, which might, however, not be the best way to present their data. I propose to rewrite and reorganize the manuscript, to better make the points. The Discussion is a bit repetitive and seems overwritten. Some shortening, despite adding new ideas and considerations (see below), might be reasonable.</p><p>This reviewer does not understand the scientific rationale regarding the PYD sequence identity and similarity of POPS to either NLRs or ALRs as a measure of their potential regulatory/inhibitory function in the respective inflammasome formation. Think of a protein with a single-point mutation that would abrogate filament formation. It would have the exact same deltaGs in five interfaces but only one is different. If this protein would be added, e.g., in a 1:1000 ratio to wt protein that has been pre-incubated to form filaments, it might stop elongation. This is, for example, how some capping proteins work in the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, the immanent interpretation of the Rosetta calculations of the ASC-POP1 interfaces in Figure 1 showing that POP1 is so similar to ASC-ASC interfaces would be that POP1 could be easily integrated into the ASC filament as a surrogate. I, therefore, disagree with the authors about the statement of the &quot;counterintuitive&quot;-ness: &quot;Moreover, although somewhat counterintuitive at first, further examining Rosetta in silico results in light of our initial biochemical experiments suggested that a combination of favorable and unfavorable interactions underpin the target specificity of POPs.&quot; [Discussion section, page 22 middle, and similar in the Results]. A more balanced consideration here would be favorable.</p><p>In addition to this comment, from the sequence similarity of the PYDs of NLRP3, AIM2, or NLRP6 to ASC-PYD we learn that the degree of sequence homology does not determine or correlate to the ability for homotypic transition and filament elongation.</p><p>Figure 1 is not a good start, particularly, as it is repeated and reversed later in Figure 2 Supplement 2, Figure 3 Supplement 1, and Figure 4 Supplement 1. I suggest putting the entire present Figure 1 into the supplement and rather start with something similar to Figure 2, Supplements 2, and so on, which is more informative. I also wonder if it wouldn't be easier to show the subtractions of the deltaGs (so the δ(deltaGs)) to better visualize the differences in the Rosetta calculations. The idea with the blue and red dots is good, the boundaries (&lt;3.5 dG and &gt;10 dG) seem reasonable, so I would include them from the beginning. Thinking of it, an ideal inhibitor might have 5 blue dots and one red. This would be preferentially in interface I (the largest) on the b-side (the growing direction) and it would ensure assembly but prevent elongation. I suggest to revise the text in light of this consideration.</p><p>The abundance of proteins is a major determinant in the law of mass action, besides the thermodynamic energies of the direct contacts made. The transcriptional control and the protein levels of the POPs might be therefore an important determinant similar to the yields of NLRs and ALRs. The authors reflect on this in the Discussion (&quot;…, excess POPs were necessary to inhibit inflammasome PYDs, especially when an activating ligand was present, …) but the more than 1 stoichiometry required is puzzling and rather points towards a &quot;chaperone-type&quot; function for POPs.</p><p>The authors do not consider at all in this manuscript, that there is a seventh interface described for PYDs besides the hexagonal assembly in the filament. This is the homodimer interface seen, e.g., for NLRP3, in the crystal structure of the PYD and in size exclusion chromatography (Bae and Park, 2011; 3QF2). For completeness, the energy scores should be also calculated for this interface. It might well be that POPs associate in this binding mode as heterodimeric assemblies to monomeric PYDs of NLRs or ALRs to regulate their activities. This would be somehow reminiscent of profilin binding to actin, regulating the pool of free G-actin for filament assembly. This might be indeed an effective way to regulate effector signaling.</p><p>Discussion: &quot;Our investigations here reveal that POPs interfere with the polymerization (nucleation and/or elongation) of various inflammasome filaments without co-assembling, … &quot; Where is this shown, is it from the &quot;%filament&quot; in Figures 2B, D or the level of saturation in Figure 2E? Further: &quot;…, excess POPs were necessary to inhibit inflammasome PYDs, especially when an activating ligand was present …&quot;. Isn't this a strong argument to consider also other interfaces/binding modes than the filament assembly. See the previous comment on profilin-G-actin binding.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Design Principles for Inflammasome Inhibition by Pyrin-Only-Proteins&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Carla Rothlin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor and all three of the original reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers remain interested in the work and consider that it is potentially appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers are satisfied with many of the revisions and in particular agree that you should not be made to extend your observations to CARD-CARD interfaces. However, because you failed to address all the &quot;required&quot; revisions, significant issues remain.</p><p>In particular, after substantive discussion among the reviewers, there remains considerable skepticism about the fundamental model that is being proposed. This skepticism is summarized by one reviewer as follows: &quot;The authors propose that a mixture of favorable and unfavorable interactions is critical in mediating inhibition of filament formation, however, it is unclear if this prediction holds true. For example, looking at Figure 4 and the associated supplemental material the authors find that POP1, POP2, and POP3 can inhibit NLRP6(PYD) filamentation. However, the IC50 varies by nearly 6-fold and more confusingly looking at the energy calculations in Figure S4.1 there does not seem to be a significant difference to explain why this would be. Additionally, if I compare the δ-deltaGs in the NLRP6 calculation with those from AIM2 calculation I cannot see any clear reason why POP3 is the strongest inhibitor of NLRP6 when every interaction is energetically unfavorable compared with the other POP/NLRP6 or NLRP6 homo-interactions. Yet, looking at the inhibition of AIM2, POP3 has the fewest energetically unfavorable interactions but is still the strongest inhibitor. The calculations for POP homotypic interactions supplied in the reviewer response further confound this issue – POP1 shows favorable interactions to form filaments similar to the free energies calculated for ASC and NLRP3, whereas POP2 does not – and yet as the authors acknowledge, POP2, but not POP1 forms filaments. In short, I am not convinced that there is sufficient evidence that the calculated energies are predictive of the behavior of the different POPs… without any experiments that directly address whether the energy calculations are predictive of POP-mediated inhibition, any connection between the calculated Rosetta energies and inhibition are correlative.&quot; The other reviewers tend to concur with this assessment. In order for your paper to be considered for publication we require the following:</p><p>1. You need to explicitly recognize/discuss/acknowledge that NLRs and ALRs contain additional domains beyond the PYD that can modify the energy landscape to create oligomers, and it is vital to consider this aspect as a caveat to your study which focuses on dissociated PYD interactions.</p><p>2. The consensus of the reviewers remains that you need to test your model by employing site-directed mutagenesis. This was a clear requirement in the previous decision letter (point 4), and the reviewers were not convinced by your argument that this is not necessary. One reviewer suggests: &quot;One could easily imagine replacing a favorable interaction with alanine to gently weaken the interaction or with glutamate or other charged residue to break the interface. By taking POP1 and introducing mutations to disrupt one or multiple surfaces the authors could show that these mutants do or do not inhibit filament formation ASC. Alternatively, the authors could introduce mutations into the ASC PYD and determine whether the mutant protein could now act like a POP and block WT ASC filament formation. While I appreciate that doing such a comparison for every POP and PYD in the paper would be excessive, I strongly believe that the authors need to experimentally test their model with at least some site-directed mutants&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81918.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors show that the MBP tag affects the oligomerization of POPs.

The authors take the reduction of PYD filamentation as an indication of inhibition, but it is not clear how they ruled out the possibility that POP1 co-assembles into the ASCPYD filaments and inhibits inflammasome formation by repressing the recruitment of Caspase-1 (as POP1 lacks the CARD the effector domain). Thus, some functional assays measuring downstream Caspase-1 activation are required. In addition, the possibility that POP1 and ASC co-assemble could be tested directly with FRET experiments in which one protein is the donor and the other is the acceptor. Without such experiments, the statement in the Discussion &quot;Our investigations here reveal that POPs interfere with the polymerization (nucleation and/or elongation) of various inflammasome filaments without co-assembling, … &quot; does not appear to be justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We included data showing that POP1 is least effective in inhibiting the NLRP3/nigericin-mediated release of mature interleukin-18 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2E; i.e., a functional assay requested by the reviewer).

Our observation here is also consistent with the report by Ratsimandresy et al. reporting that POP2 is more effective in suppressing ASC/inflammasomes than POP1.</p><p>We also generated fluor-labeled recombinant POP1 and confirmed that there are no discernable FRET signals between donor-labeled POP1 and acceptor-labeled ASCPYD, again supporting that POP1 and ASCPYD do not intermix (Figure 2, Figure Supplement 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Further computational analysis should be performed to determine if the theory that a combination of favorable and unfavorable interactions is generally applicable. Does this theory account for other PYD/PYD interactions and CARD/CARD interactions? For example, for the AIM2PYD/ASCPYD interface, do they see only a favorable interface or a mixture? How about two unrelated PYDs, such as between AIM2PYD and NLRP3PYD? How about for COPs? How about the homotypic interfaces between the POPs themselves?</p></disp-quote><p>We are afraid that the reviewers are asking for future orthogonal studies significantly beyond the scope of the current work. This present manuscript focuses on PYD•POP interactions by studying more than a dozen pairwise interactions using three different methods (<italic>in silico</italic>, recombinant proteins, in cell imaging). We strongly believe that any additional <italic>in silico</italic> predictions need to be validated and (re)interpreted in light of biochemical experiments. Thus, investigating different systems such as CARD•CARD and NLRP•ASC interactions with our rigorous approach would require years’ worth of additional work, especially if they have unique patterns (rules) for themselves. Also of note, there are reports on the co-activation of different inflammasome receptors (e.g., Han et al., Sci. Immun., 2021). We do not yet know whether they directly interact with/regulate one another via PYDs or only communicate with ASC. We refrain from suggesting any interactions or lack thereof without biological/biochemical studies (i.e., beyond the scope of the present manuscript).</p><p>In our recent work (Matyzewski et al., Nat Com, 2021), we did not see any strong unfavorable energy scores between AIM2 and ASC, and our <italic>in silico</italic> approaches helped in identifying the directional interaction between AIM2PYD and ASCPYD filaments. Of note, we do not treat Rosetta energy scores as absolute free energy terms (as they are not), we use them as relative-yet-quantitative measures to guide our investigations. Importantly, our conclusion then was strictly based on our subjects at hand, as is here (any potential differences found in investigating NLRP•ASC interactions would not validate or invalidate our working model for AIM2•ASC).</p><p>We ran Rosetta interface energy analyses on hypothetical homotypic interactions for each POP. Although we refrain from making any claims without conducting extensive biochemical studies, it appears that POP1 lacks the symmetric landscape for “top” and “bottom” halves seen from PYD filaments, which like reflect the lack of filament formation.</p><p>On the other hand, POP2 and POP3 show significantly unfavorable energy scores vs. PYD filaments such as AIM2PYD and ASCPYD. Of note, we do not yet understand how POP2 and POP3 form oligomers. For instance, we do not know whether they oligomerize via different interfaces than those mediate filament assembly in PYDs (Type 1-3).
