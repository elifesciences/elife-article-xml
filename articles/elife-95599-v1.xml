organs (e.g. the heart) can robustly influence the perception of exteroceptive sensations. This interoceptive–exteroceptive interaction has been argued to underlie self-awareness by situating one’s perceptual awareness of exteroceptive stimuli in the context of one’s internal state, but studies probing cardiac influences on visual awareness have yielded conflicting findings. In this study, we presented separate grating stimuli to each of subjects’ eyes as in a classic binocular rivalry paradigm – measuring the duration for which each stimulus dominates in perception. However, we caused the gratings to ‘pulse’ at specific times relative to subjects’ real-time electrocardiogram, manipulating whether pulses occurred during cardiac systole, when baroreceptors signal to the brain that the heart has contracted, or in diastole when baroreceptors are silent. The influential ‘Baroreceptor Hypothesis’ predicts the effect of baroreceptive input on visual perception should be uniformly suppressive. In contrast, we observed that dominance durations increased for systole-entrained stimuli, inconsistent with the Baroreceptor Hypothesis. Furthermore, we show that this cardiac-dependent rivalry effect is preserved in subjects who are at-chance discriminating between systole-entrained and diastole-presented stimuli in a separate interoceptive awareness task, suggesting that our results are not dependent on conscious access to heartbeat sensations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>interoception</kwd><kwd>embodiment</kwd><kwd>brain–heart interaction</kwd><kwd>binocular rivalry</kwd><kwd>binocular vision</kwd><kwd>bistable perception</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024923</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nusbaum</surname><given-names>Howard C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program (1746045)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Veillette</surname><given-names>John P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sensations arising from internal organs like the heart can affect how the brain decides between two mutually incompatible perceptions of the same visual stimulus.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interoceptive sensory input ascending from visceral organs – such as the heart, lungs, and gut – impacts both spontaneous brain activity and that evoked by external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azzalini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Critchley and Harrison, 2013</xref>). Cardiac effects on exteroceptive perception have recently become a subject of intense interest, due in no small part to recent theories that interoception plays an integral role in generating the subjective experience of self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park and Tallon-Baudry, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seth and Tsakiris, 2018</xref>). Early work in this area resulted in the Baroreceptor Hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lacey and Lacey, 1978</xref>), which states that baroreceptors located in the arterial walls respond to the increase in blood pressure following cardiac contraction, and the ascending input from these baroreceptors broadly suppress sensorimotor activity in the central nervous system. While recent reviews have noted the Baroreceptor Hypothesis still motivates much work in the study of interoceptive–exteroceptive integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park and Tallon-Baudry, 2014</xref>), more recent studies have indicated, in contrast, that visual skills such as discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pramme et al., 2014</xref>) and search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pramme et al., 2016</xref>) are <italic>facilitated</italic> when stimuli are presented during cardiac systole. Work focused specifically on basic visual awareness rather than visual skills<italic>,</italic> however, has indeed continued to support the view that conscious access to a visual stimulus is suppressed during systole, and that this suppression is mediated by the insula, which is the primary thalamocortical recipient of baroreceptive input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salomon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salomon et al., 2018</xref>). This discrepancy may be taken to suggest that cardiac inputs to the central nervous system (CNS) are initially suppressive for the earliest stages of visual processing, consistent with the Baroreceptor Hypothesis, but have more heterogenous effects downstream, enabling more complex ‘cardiac gating’ effects such as systolic facilitation of threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garfinkel et al., 2014</xref>) and disgust responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gray et al., 2012</xref>) to visual stimuli. If so, however, the level of processing at which cardiac effects on visual perception may shift from suppressive to faciliatory remains unclear.</p><p>Resolving this ambiguity seems essential for understanding the proposed link between interoceptive–exteroceptive integration and self-awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Park and Tallon-Baudry, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seth and Tsakiris, 2018</xref>). Synchronizing visual stimuli to the heartbeat seems to affect the subjective experience of body ownership, indicating an important role of bodily sensations in carving out which parts of the exteroceptive sensory space belong to oneself – one in which interoceptive sensations provide a ‘ground truth’ point of reference that must originate from one’s own body. For example, causing the color of a virtual body to pulse during cardiac systole facilitates the subjective embodiment of a virtual hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>), a full virtual body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heydrich et al., 2018</xref>), and of a face image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sel et al., 2017</xref>). In turn, changes in perceived embodiment are reflected in the magnitude of the central neural response to heartbeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Similar effects on embodiment can be seen for breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Monti et al., 2020</xref>) and gastric sensations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Monti et al., 2022</xref>). Since, simplistically, the two main ingredients of self-awareness would seem to be <italic>self</italic> and <italic>awareness</italic>, uniform suppression of sensations synchronized to interoceptive stimuli – those that are embodied as <italic>self</italic> – would arguably hinder an organism’s ability to become self-aware. However, whatever adaptive benefits of self-awareness may exist, they must be balanced against the imperative to suppress distracting sensory information from awareness, just as the cortical response to one’s heartbeat sounds appears to be suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Elk et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, bodily sensations generally tend to fade from awareness as one goes about their day unless attention is drawn to them, which itself seems to be a core phenomenological characteristic of bodily self-awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Tsakiris, 2018</xref>). However, it is worth noting that volitional conscious access to one’s heartbeat sensations, while rare in the general population, is associated with improved emotional regulation and mental well-being, indicating that the ability to hold the direct sensory consequences of bodily events into consciousness can serve an adaptive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Füstös et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tsakiris and Critchley, 2016</xref>). In light of these considerations, we posit that the earliest level of sensory processing at which cardiac systole may become, in some contexts, faciliatory should be close enough to the level at which suppression has previously been observed to counter suppressive effects as needed.</p><p>Recent work demonstrating suppressive effects of cardiac input on visual awareness has used continuous flash suppression (CFS), a special case of binocular rivalry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salomon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salomon et al., 2018</xref>), and visual crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salomon et al., 2016</xref>) paradigms to mask stimuli from consciousness, and showed that the threshold for breaking through into awareness is higher in both cases when masked stimuli are entrained to cardiac systole. A commonality between both paradigms is that, at the beginning of each trial, the masked stimulus is just that – masked – and the trial ends when it breaks into awareness. However, theories of consciousness, particularly but not limited to the popular global neuronal workspace theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mashour et al., 2020</xref>), tend to emphasize not just a stimulus’ ability to initially break into consciousness but its ability to suppress competing stimuli so as to remain in consciousness. This sort of visual competition is exemplified by the classic binocular rivalry paradigm, in which incongruent stimuli are presented to subjects’ two different eyes, and the brain resolves the conflict by switching back-and-forth between the two competing images rather than merging them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmel et al., 2010</xref>). While reflecting the same mechanism of interocular suppression as the previously used CFS paradigms, the durations of dominance and suppression for the rival stimuli are the cumulative product of the feedforward drive ascending from the optic nerve, lateral inhibition between eyes, and feedback from higher-level visual or cross-modal areas such as in directed attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, CFS breakthrough times are theoretically influenced primarily by modulation of the feedforward drive, rather than by lateral inhibition or consciously directed attention.</p><p>Thus, we designed an experiment in which we entrained dynamically ‘pulsing’ rivalrous stimuli to systolic and diastolic cardiac phases, cueing pulses based on subjects’ electrocardiogram (ECG) in real time. The Baroreceptor Hypothesis would predict that the stimulus entrained to systole would spend more time suppressed and, conversely, less time dominant, as cortical activity would be suppressed each time that stimulus pulses. Indeed, such a finding would be consistent with the previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salomon et al., 2016</xref>) and replicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salomon et al., 2018</xref>) suppression of stimuli entrained to cardiac systole in the CFS paradigm; this would suggest systolic modulatory effects do not become facilitative until a higher level of processing. An effect in the opposite direction – as we actually observe – would indicate that, at this early stage of visual processing, lateral inhibitory or top–down feedback mechanisms are sufficient to overcome the suppression effect observed in CFS. To differentiate between these two mechanisms, we then assess whether our main finding persists in those subjects who are at-chance at a heartbeat discrimination task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cardiac binocular rivalry task.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) As in a typical binocular rivalry paradigm, incongruent gratings were presented to the left and right eyes, causing the subjects’ percept to alternate between the competing images.

Note that, while the estimated 9.48% population prevalence closely agrees with the 9.26% of subjects who were significantly above-chance via a Binomial test in our sample, the mixture model still assigns substantial probability to an above-chance perceiver performing worse than that frequentist cutoff (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), illustrating why interpreting a frequentist null result would be inappropriate in this case.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Bayesian mixture model of interoceptive accuracy.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Observed accuracies on the heartbeat discrimination task are modeled as a mixture between an at-chance Binomial distribution and an above-chance Beta-Binomial distribution, the conditional posterior predictive likelihoods of which are shown.

In such an interpretation, this lateral inhibition is what would potentiated by baroreceptive input in our rivalry task. Interestingly, this could occur merely as a function of lateral inhibition occurring simultaneously to the broad cortical suppression conjectured in the original version of the Baroreceptor Hypothesis, increasing the total amount of inhibitory neurotransmitter in the post-synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lacey and Lacey, 1978</xref>). Thus, the same broad cortical suppression could have a suppressive or faciliatory effect on any given stimulus <italic>depending on context</italic>.</p><p>However, this explanation – while intriguing – raises the very issue that prevents us from making such an inference by comparison to past cardio-visual studies that used CFS. In the CFS paradigm used in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salomon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Salomon et al., 2018</xref>), the mask stimulus is updated at a rate of 10 Hz to maintain suppression over time, and so new mask stimuli do appear several times each systolic phase. If lateral inhibition is indeed potentiated during systole as we suggest, and the mask stimulus is always dominant at trial start (which it is), then previous CFS findings could be re-interpreted as reflecting facilitation of the mask stimulus via lateral inhibition rather than direct suppression of the systole-entrained target stimulus via insula-to-visual projections. While this possibility seems to be made less likely by the fact that similar suppression of the systole-entrained stimulus is also observed in visual crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Salomon et al., 2016</xref>), the point remains the same as above: the same neural mechanism <italic>could</italic> result in either facilitation or suppression of a given sensory stimulus, depending on context. Indeed, such context dependency could potentially explain the seemingly conflicting reports from previous studies on cardio-visual interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Critchley and Harrison, 2013</xref>). It may be fruitful for future work to compare cardiac effects across CFS and traditional rivalry paradigms with accompanying neural recordings.</p><p>Interestingly, the faciliatory effect we see on visual dominance does not appear to depend on conscious access to one’s heartbeat sensations, as removing subjects who are above-chance at discriminating which stimulus is synchronized to their heartbeat from our sample does not eliminate the effect. Many effects of cardiac timing on perception and cognition <italic>are</italic> modulated by conscious interoceptive accuracy or awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koreki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sel et al., 2017</xref>), so it would be interesting to test whether interoceptive awareness potentiates the effect further. However, since we only had a handful of subjects in our sample that we could confidently conclude were above-chance heartbeat perceivers, this study cannot answer such a question with any statistical certainty.</p><p>Lastly, this finding may have implications for how we interpret the relationship between visual awareness and bodily self-awareness. A growing body of evidence suggests that visual self-recognition can occur in the absence of conscious awareness, as self-selective neural and behavioral responses can be observed for stimuli presented subliminally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bola et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doradzińska et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Geng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ota and Nakano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pfister et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shafto and Pitts, 2015</xref>) or too early after a stimulus event for subjects to have yet become consciously aware (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Veillette et al., 2023</xref>). If so, self-awareness may result from a first-order awareness of self-referential cognitive processes (<italic>some</italic> of which need not depend on conscious awareness to function), as previously suggested as a possibility by some researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dehaene, 2014</xref>), rather than a higher-level sort of ‘awareness of being aware’ as it may be understood by some cognitive scientists or in popular culture. In such a view – which, to be clear, may be incorrect – then any common factor which facilitates both awareness and perceived embodiment, even if by separate pathways, could be a contributing mechanism that facilitates self-awareness. Considering the present results in light of previous work on embodiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aspell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heydrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sel et al., 2017</xref>), interoceptive–exteroceptive synchrony seems as if it might meet both those criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recruitment</title><p>We recruited 58 subjects (see <italic>Sample size determination</italic>) with self-reported normal color vision from our Psychology Department’s subject pool, which consists of undergraduate students.

Real-time analysis of the ECG data was implemented in Python (see <italic>Data availability</italic>) using Lab Streaming Layer (LSL, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://labstreaminglayer.org/#/">https://labstreaminglayer.org/#/</ext-link>) and LabGraph (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/labgraph">https://github.com/facebookresearch/labgraph</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Facebook Reality Labs, 2021</xref>). After digitizing, ECG data were bandpass filtered to 5–15 Hz, and R-peaks were detected using the Pan-Thompkins algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pan and Tompkins, 1985</xref>), modified from an existing implementation for LabGraph compatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sznajder and Łukowska, 2017</xref>).</p><p>From the estimated R-peak times, we generated stimulus time courses on-the-fly as follows (in both the binocular rivalry task and the cardiac discrimination task). Since our ECG amplifier has a known analog-to-digital conversion latency of roughly 35 ms when acquiring data over LSL, we aimed for pulses of the in-phase/systole stimulus to peak at 175 ms, such that it would actually peak at 210 after each R-peak, following previous work on cardiac synchrony effects on embodiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). This timing coincides with peak systolic blood pressure, when the aortic baroreceptors are most active, and when heartbeats tend to be perceived in interoceptive sensitivity tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brener et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wiens and Palmer, 2001</xref>). The anti-phase/diastole stimulus was delayed relative to the in-phase stimulus by half of the previous R–R interval. Since this delay was variable between heartbeats – thus distinct from a constant phase delay but, on average, still anti-phase. This avoided the impression that one stimulus was leading or lagging, but as a result, the precise cardiac phase (i.e. within diastole) that the anti-phase stimulus peaked varied across subjects, but it nonetheless peaked during diastole for all subjects (see <italic>ECG offline processing and analysis</italic>). Stimulus ‘pulses’ had the shape of a Gaussian bell curve with a scale (i.e. ‘standard deviation’) of 1/16 of a second (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The target stimulus size was updated each time a new ECG sample was acquired (100 Hz), and total processing time to compute the intended stimulus time series was roughly a millisecond. On each screen refresh (60 Hz), the actual stimuli were updated to match their current target size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cardiac binocular rivalry task</title><p>Subjects wore red-blue anaglyph glasses, such that a red image could be presented exclusively to the left eye and a blue image could be presented only to the right eye. The task consisted of two 10-min blocks, in which incongruent gratings (256 × 256 pixels on a 1920 × 1080, 22’ monitor, which subjects viewed from 2 feet away) were presented to opposite eyes, which is well known to result in the centrally perceived image alternating between the two gratings – rather than, say, merging them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmel et al., 2010</xref>). As in a typical binocular rivalry paradigm, the subjects indicated with a button press each time the dominant stimulus switched. One grating would ‘pulse’ – the bars in the grating would briefly increase in width before returning to baseline, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – during cardiac systole and one would pulse anti-phase to the systole pulse, during cardiac diastole (see <italic>ECG acquisition and real-time processing</italic>). In one 10-min block, the red/left grating would be the systole/in-phase stimulus and the blue/right grating would be the diastole/anti-phase stimulus, and in the other block it would be reversed; block order was randomized. The durations during which each grating was dominant were recorded for analysis (see <italic>Behavioral data analysis</italic>). Subjects were not told that the movement of the stimuli was related to their heartbeat until after this block had ended, and the heartbeat discrimination task had begun.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Heartbeat discrimination task</title><p>Our modified heartbeat discrimination task was designed to assess whether subjects would be able to discriminate which of the two stimuli in the rivalry task was entrained to systole versus to diastole, rather than to assess more general interoceptive ability. Thus, we ignored some of the recent developments in improving the validity of heartbeat discrimination tasks for assessing the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brener and Ring, 2016</xref>), and we used a bespoke task in which the manipulation closely matched that in our rivalry task. In particular, subjects saw two circles side-by-side on their screen, and the circles ‘pulsed’ (i.e. transiently increased in radius from 60 to 120 pixels) following the same time course as the gratings in the rivalry task – that is, one during systole and one during diastole (see <italic>ECG acquisition and real-time processing</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). On each of 120 10-s trials, the side of the systole stimulus and that of the diastole stimulus was randomized, and subjects were asked to report which circle was pulsing in synchrony with their heart. The accuracy of each response was recorded for analysis (see <italic>Behavioral data analysis</italic>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral data analysis</title><p>For visualization and estimation of paired differences, the dominance durations for the systole- and diastole-entrained gratings were averaged across all trials and block within each subject. Those measurements, and the bootstrap CIs (10,000 samples) of their paired differences were plotted using the <italic>DABEST</italic> Python package for robust estimation statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho et al., 2019</xref>). We additionally visualize these measurements broken up by whether the grating was presented to the left or the right eye, in case of baseline ocular dominance confounds.</p><p>For statistical inference on dominance durations, we apply a gamma-family GLM with a dummy predictor for cardiac systole to the trial-level data (i.e. each interval, unaveraged), fit using generalized estimating equations in the <italic>statsmodels</italic> package to account for subject-level random effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rotnitzky and Jewell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>). This approach appropriately deals with the approximate gamma distribution that dominance durations in binocular rivalry are known to follow, while remaining robust to violations of parametric assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmel et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We then re-ran the above GLM analysis on only those subjects who were at-chance at the heartbeat discrimination task, so we could assess whether the result from the first GLM would hold for only subjects who could not consciously distinguish which stimulus was in-phase with cardiac systole – and thus whether our results depend on conscious awareness of heartbeat sensations. Since identification of ‘at-chance’ subjects would require interpretation of a null result in a frequentist setting (so we cannot just use a Binomial test), we estimate the probability each subject is at- or above-chance using a Bayesian mixture model, and then we call subjects ‘at-chance’ if there is at least a 95% posterior probability they are indeed drawn from the at-chance distribution (see below).</p><p>In the mixture model, each subject <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>’s number of correct trials <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> is modeled as coming from either an at-chance distribution <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>at-chance</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mtext>Binomial</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>trials</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> or an above-chance distribution <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>above-chance</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mtext>Binomial</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>trials</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, which spans the range <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

(For instance, if the anti-phase stimulus did not peak during diastole, which could occur for a subject with a very fast heart rate, it might be prudent to exclude that subject from analysis – though this did not end up occurring, see <italic>Results</italic>.)</p><p>To this end, we applied the standardized NeuroKit pipeline, as implemented in version 0.2.7 of the <italic>neurokit2</italic> Python package, to delineate cardiac events in the ECG data from both blocks of the rivalry task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Makowski et al., 2021</xref>). In brief, this applies a 0.5-Hz high pass filter to the data, detects QRS complexes (i.e. the Q, R, and S waves that represent the deporalization of the ventricles and contraction of the ventricular muscles) based on the steepness of the absolute derivative of the signal, then R-peaks (i.e. the start of systole) as the local maxima in the QRS complexes, and finally the offset of the T-wave (i.e. end of ventricular systole and the start of diastole) using the discrete wavelet method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martínez et al., 2004</xref>). We then compute the ‘cardiac angle’ at each peak of the entrained stimuli using the same physiologically motivated scaling implemented in the Cardiac Timing Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sherman et al., 2022</xref>); phases of the cardiac cycle are expressed as an angle where π radians is always the R-peak and 0 radians is the offset of the T-wave, such that ‘negative’ angles in the range [−π, 0] occur during systole and ‘positive’ angles in the range [0, π] occur during diastole.</p><p>We then obtain (circular) means for the cardiac angle the synchronous and asynchronous stimuli peak for each subject by bootstrap with 10,000 samples. These are used for a manipulation check to confirm that the mean angle for the systole stimulus is negative for all subjects, and the mean angle for the diastole stimulus is positive for all subjects. We then estimate the group-level mean cardiac angles for both stimuli using a random-effects bootstrap scheme, which accounts for both the population sampling distribution and the within-subject sampling distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chambers and Chandra, 2013</xref>). Group-level bootstrap means and CIs are reported in results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Sample size determination</title><p>Our sample size was initially determined arbitrarily (by time constraints on data collection). However, we did conduct a power calculation to assess whether this convenience sample was sufficiently large to detect a typical cardio-visual effect.

Specifically, the reported study aimed to determine if the effects of cardiac contraction (systole) on binocular rivalry (BR) are facilitatory or suppressive. The main experiment - relying on a technically challenging procedure of presenting stimuli synchronised with the heartbeats of participants - has been conducted with great care, and numerous manipulation checks the authors report convincingly show that the methods they used work as intended. Moreover, the control experiment allows for excluding alternative explanations related to participants being aware of their heartbeats. Therefore, the study convincingly shows the effect of cardiac activity on BR - and this is an important finding. The results, however, do not allow for unambiguously determining if this effect is facilitatory or suppressive (see details below), which renders the study not as informative as it could be.</p><p>While the authors strongly focus on interoception and awareness, this study will be of interest to researchers studying BR as such. Moreover, the code and the data the authors share can facilitate the adoption of their methods in other labs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The study required a complex technical setup and the manuscript both describes it well and demonstrates that it was free from potential technical issues (e.g. in section 3.3. Manipulation check).</p><p>(2) The sophisticated statistical methods the authors used, at least for a non-statistician like me, appear to be well-suited for their purpose. For example, they take into account the characteristics of BR (gamma distributions of dominance durations). Moreover, the authors demonstrate that at least in one case their approach is more conservative than a more basic one (Binomial test) would be.</p><p>(3) Finally, the control experiment, and the analysis it enabled, allow for excluding a multitude of alternative explanations of the main results.</p><p>(4) The authors share all their data and materials, even the code for the experiment.</p><p>(5) The manuscript is well-written. In particular, it introduces the problem and methods in a way that should be easy to understand for readers coming from different research fields.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The interpretation of the main result in the context of the Baroceptor hypothesis is not clear. The manuscript states: The Baroreceptor Hypothesis would predict that the stimulus entrained to systole would spend more time suppressed and, conversely, less time dominant, as cortical activity would be suppressed each time that stimulus pulses. The manuscript does not specify why this should be the case, and the term 'entrained' is not too helpful here (does it refer to neural entrainment? or to 'being in phase with'?). The answer to this question is provided by the manuscript only implicitly, and, to explain my concern, I try to spell it out here in a slightly simplified form.</p><p>During systole (cardiac contraction), the visual system is less sensitive to external information, so it 'ignores' periods when the systole-synchronised stimulus is at the peak of its pulse. Conversely, the system is more sensitive during diastole, so the stimulus that is at the peak of its pulse then should dominate for longer, because its peaks are synchronised with the periods of the highest sensitivity of the visual system when the information used to resolve the rivalry is sampled from the environment. This idea, while indeed being a clever test of the hypothesis in question, rests on one critical assumption: that the peak of the stimulus pulse (as defined in the manuscript) is the time when the stimulus is the strongest for the visual system. The notion of 'stimulus strength' is widely used in the BR literature (see Brascamp et al., 2015 for a review). It refers to the stimulus property that, simply speaking, determines its tendency to dominate in the BR. The strength of a stimulus is underpinned by its low-level visual properties, such as contrast and spatial frequency content. Coming back to the manuscript, the pulsing of the stimuli affected at least spatial frequency (and likely other low-level properties), and it is unknown if it was in phase with the pulsing of the stimulus strength, or not. If my understanding of the premise of the study is correct, the conclusions drawn by the authors stand only if it was.</p><p>In other words, most likely the strength of one of the stimuli was pulsating in sync with the systole, but is it not clear which stimulus it was. It is possible that, for the visual system, the stimulus meant to pulse in sync with the systole was pulsing strength-wise in phase with the diastole (and the one intended to pulse with in sync with the diastole strength-wise pulsed with the systole). If this is the case, the predictions of the Baroceptor Hypothesis hold, which would change the conclusion of the manuscript.</p><p>(2) Using anaglyph goggles necessitates presenting stimuli of a different colour to each eye. The way in which different colours are presented can impact stimulus strength (e.g. consider that different anaglyph foils can attenuate the light they let through to different degrees). To deal with such effects, at least some studies on BR employed procedures of adjusting the colours for each participant individually (see Papathomas et al., 2004; Patel et al., 2015 and works cited there). While I think that counterbalancing applied in the study excludes the possibility that colour-related effects influenced the results, the effects of interest still could be stronger for one of the coloured foils.</p><p>(3) Several aspects of the methods (e.g. the stimuli), are not described at the level of detail some readers might be accustomed to. The most important issue here is the task the participants performed. The manuscript says that they pressed a button whenever they experienced a switch in perception, but it is only implied that there were different buttons for each stimulus.</p><p>Brascamp, J.

The Baroreceptor Hypothesis predicts global suppression of visual cortex during systole (and not during diastole), so the stimulus strength boost yielded by a pulse should be attenuated during systole. Thus, the stimulus that only pulses during systole would have lower stimulus strength (and thus shorter dominance durations) than that which pulses during diastole; however, we observe the opposite pattern in our data, seemingly contradicting the Baroreceptor Hypothesis.</p><p>In typical binocular rivalry paradigms, dominance durations are biased by stimulus strength, but perception remains bistable such that the stronger stimulus is not necessarily dominant at a given time. We see no reason, then, why switching would have to occur every cycle. The dominance durations we see are quite typical of binocular rivalry paradigms, whereas durations shorter than a cardiac cycle would be rather unusual (Carmel et al., 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a binocular rivalry study that uses electrocardiogram events to modulate visual stimuli in real-time, relative to participants' heartbeats.

As we already expand upon in our Discussion, the effects of global (neural) inhibition depend on the preexisting role that inhibition plays in a given neural circuit. The original framing of the Baroreceptor Hypothesis describes baroreceptor activity of uniformly impeding sensory processing (Lacey, 1967; Lacey &amp; Lacey, 1978, American Psychologist), which is contradicted by our present results. This account is often interpreted as implying the effects of baroreceptor activation is inhibitory in terms of neural mechanism (e.g. Rau et al., 1993, Psychophysiology; Edwards et al., 2009, Psychophysiology). Some researchers argue this serves a parallel function to the inhibitory projections from motor to sensory areas during volitional movement, “cancelling” the sensory effects of heartbeats (Van Elk, et al., 2014, Biological Psychology).</p><p>However, baroreceptor activity has also been described as introducing noise into sensory processing rather than inhibiting it directly (e.g. Allen et al., 2022, PLoS Computational Biology). Lacey and Lacey’s own account actually seemed to point toward attention as a mediating mechanism (Hahn, 1973, Psychological Bulletin), with the disproportionate focus on cortical inhibition emerging in the literature over time. All this is to say that, while our results seem to falsify the behavioral predictions of the original Baroreceptor Hypothesis, subsequent versions of that hypothesis that describe an inhibitory neural mechanism, rather than an inhibition of perception per se, could potentially still be compatible with our results. This is a topic we plan to explore in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript addresses a question inspired by the Baroceptor Hypothesis and its links to visual awareness and interoception.

The notion of 'stimulus strength' is widely used in the BR literature (see Brascamp et al., 2015 for a review). It refers to the stimulus property that, simply speaking, determines its tendency to dominate in the BR. The strength of a stimulus is underpinned by its low-level visual properties, such as contrast and spatial frequency content. Coming back to the manuscript, the pulsing of the stimuli affected at least spatial frequency (and likely other low-level properties), and it is unknown if it was in phase with the pulsing of the stimulus strength, or not. If my understanding of the premise of the study is correct, the conclusions drawn by the authors stand only if it was.</p><p>In other words, most likely the strength of one of the stimuli was pulsating in sync with the systole, but is it not clear which stimulus it was. It is possible that, for the visual system, the stimulus meant to pulse in sync with the systole was pulsing strength-wise in phase with the diastole (and the one intended to pulse with in sync with the diastole strength-wise pulsed with the systole). If this is the case, the predictions of the Baroceptor Hypothesis hold, which would change the conclusion of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer 3’s argumentation here. If the pulses decreased, rather than increased, effective stimulus strength, then the present results would indeed be consistent with the Baroreceptor Hypothesis. However, Wade et al. (1984) demonstrated that grating stimuli which pulse in the same manner (i.e. by dynamically varying the spatial frequency of the grating) as in our experiment indeed show increased stimulus strength relative to static stimuli, even if the dynamic stimuli have lower spatial frequency on average (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03203891">https://doi.org/10.3758/BF03203891</ext-link>).</p><p>We admit our results would be stronger had we included a replication of Wade at al. (1984) in our study, but in light of this previous work, our interpretation is indeed supported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Using anaglyph goggles necessitates presenting stimuli of a different colour to each eye. The way in which different colours are presented can impact stimulus strength (e.g. consider that different anaglyph foils can attenuate the light they let through to different degrees). To deal with such effects, at least some studies on BR employed procedures of adjusting the colours for each participant individually (see Papathomas et al., 2004; Patel et al., 2015 and works cited there). While I think that counterbalancing applied in the study excludes the possibility that colour-related effects influenced the results, the effects of interest still could be stronger for one of the coloured foils.</p></disp-quote><p>It is the case that, when we split the data up by eye (and thus by color), we only see statistically significant results for one eye – though the nominal direction of the effect is consistent across both eyes. So it is indeed possible that the effect could be stronger for one of the colored foils, but the present experiment was not designed to be powered to test that cardiac phase-by-color interaction.</p><p>We concur with the Reviewer, however, that our use of counterbalancing excludes color-related effects as an explanation for our main findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Several aspects of the methods (e.g. the stimuli), are not described at the level of detail some readers might be accustomed to. The most important issue here is the task the participants performed. The manuscript says that they pressed a button whenever they experienced a switch in perception, but it is only implied that there were different buttons for each stimulus.</p></disp-quote><p>There were indeed different buttons for each stimulus (i.e. a button to indicate their perception had switched to the red stimulus and another to indicate it had switched to blue).
