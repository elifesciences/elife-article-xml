Here, we describe COV-ID, an approach that combines RT-LAMP with deep sequencing to detect SARS-CoV-2 in unprocessed human saliva with a low limit of detection (5–10 virions). Based on a multi-dimensional barcoding strategy, COV-ID can be used to test thousands of samples overnight in a single sequencing run with limited labor and laboratory equipment. The sequencing-based readout allows COV-ID to detect multiple amplicons simultaneously, including key controls such as host transcripts and artificial spike-ins, as well as multiple pathogens. Here, we demonstrate this flexibility by simultaneous detection of 4 amplicons in contrived saliva samples: SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, human <italic>STATHERIN</italic>, and an artificial SARS calibration standard. The approach was validated on clinical saliva samples, where it showed excellent agreement with RT-qPCR. COV-ID can also be performed directly on saliva absorbed on filter paper, simplifying collection logistics and sample handling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>COVID</kwd><kwd>RT-LAMP</kwd><kwd>testing</kwd><kwd>sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL147123</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Parisha P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Parisha P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Parisha P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008796</institution-id><institution>Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Parisha P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was made possible by an internal Perelman School of Medicine Covid19 Research Fund.

In many countries, non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as school closures and national lockdowns, have proven to be effective, but could not be sustained due to economic and social impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haug et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tian et al., 2020</xref>). Regularly performed population-level diagnostic testing is an attractive solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taipale et al., 2020</xref>), particularly as asymptomatic individuals are implicated in rapid disease transmission, with a strong overdispersion in secondary transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Endo et al., 2020</xref>). Sustained population-level testing can be successful in isolating asymptomatic individuals and decreasing transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larremore et al., 2020</xref>); however, considerable barriers exist to the adoption of such massive testing strategies. Two such barriers are cost and supply constraints for commercial testing reagents, both of which make it impractical to test large numbers of asymptomatic individuals on a recurrent basis. A third major barrier is the lack of ‘user-friendly’ protocols that can be rapidly adopted by public and private organizations to establish high-throughput surveillance screening. In addition, while COVID-19 testing of symptomatic individuals might be effective during the summer season, when other respiratory infections are rare, new strategies are needed to facilitate rapid differential diagnosis between SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in winter. Although the wide availability of self-administered lateral flow tests has greatly facilitated the identification and isolation of active infections, these tests lack the sensitivity of nucleic acid detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brümmer et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Recent adaptations of reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify viral sequence and perform next-generation DNA sequencing have opened promising new avenues for massively parallel SARS-CoV-2 detection. In general, sequencing-based protocols use libraries of amplification primers to tag reads originating from each individual patient sample with a unique index that can be identified and deconvoluted after sequencing, thus allowing pooling of tens of thousands of samples in a single assay. Several methods, including SARSeq, SPAR-Seq, Swab-seq, COVseq, and INSIGHT directly amplify the viral RNA by RT-PCR and simultaneously introduce barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simonetti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloom et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yelagandula et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aynaud et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Mello Malta et al., 2021</xref>). While effective, these methods rely on individual PCR amplification of each patient sample, thus requiring a large number of thermal cyclers for massive scale-up. An alternative approach, ApharSeq, addresses this bottleneck by annealing barcoded RT primers to viral RNA and pooling samples prior to amplification, but the need for specialized oligo-dT magnetic beads might constitute a separate adoption barrier for this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chappleboim et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, methods have been designed to take advantage of the extreme sensitivity and isothermal conditions of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dao Thi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ludwig et al., 2021</xref>), but they require additional manipulation to introduce barcodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dao Thi et al., 2020</xref>) or do not allow for convenient multiplexing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ludwig et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we present COV-ID, a method for SARS-CoV-2 identification based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), which enables large-scale diagnostic testing at low cost and with minimal on-site equipment. COV-ID is a robust method that can be used to test tens of thousands of samples for multiple pathogens with modest reagent costs and 2–4 laboratory personnel, generating results within 24 hr. COV-ID uses unpurified saliva or saliva absorbed on filter paper as input material, thus enabling the massively parallel, inexpensive testing required for population-level surveillance of the COVID-19 pandemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Barcoding and PCR amplification of reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) products.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of COV-ID. Saliva is collected and inactivated prior to RT-LAMP performed with up to 96 individual sample barcoded primers. LAMP reactions are pooled and further amplified via PCR to introduce Illumina adapter sequences and pool-level dual indexes. A single thermal cycler can amplify 96 or 384 such pools and the resulting ‘super-pool’ can be sequenced overnight to detect multiple amplicons from 9,216 or 36,864 individual patient samples (number of reads in parenthesis assume an output of ~450 M reads from a NextSeq 500). (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of the RT-LAMP (step I) of COV-ID. Selected numbered intermediates of RT-LAMP reaction are shown to illustrate how the LAMP barcode, shown in yellow, and the P5 and P7 homology sequences (blue and pink, respectively) are introduced in the final LAMP product. Upon generating the dumbbell intermediate, the reaction proceeds through rapid primed and self-primed extensions to form a mixture of various DNA amplicons containing sequences for PCR amplification. A more detailed version of the LAMP phase of COV-ID, including specific sequences, is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.

RT-LAMP requires 4–6 primers that recognize different regions of the target sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nagamine et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Notomi et al., 2000</xref>) and proceeds through a set of primed and self-primed steps to yield many inverted copies of the target sequence spanning a range of molecular sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The forward inner primer (FIP) and backward inner primer (BIP), which recognize internal sequences, are incorporated in opposite orientation across the target sequence in the final amplified product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the FIP and BIP tolerate insertions of exogenous sequences between their different target homology regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamagishi et al., 2017</xref>). We exploited this flexibility and introduced (1) patient-specific barcodes as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ludwig et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamagishi et al., 2017</xref>) and (2) artificial sequences that allowed for PCR amplification of a small product compatible with Illumina sequencing library construction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This innovation allows us to pool individually barcoded RT-LAMP reactions and amplify them in batch via PCR, while introducing unique P5 and P7 dual indexes in different pools, thus enabling two-dimensional barcoding and dramatically increasing method throughput (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref> for PCR primer sequences). To minimize pool variability, PCR primers can be titrated to 100 nM and pooled PCRs carried out to completion, resulting in each pool being amplified to the same approximate concentration. Uniquely amplified and barcoded pools are mixed into a single ‘super-pool’ that can be sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq or similar instrument (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Combining individual barcodes embedded in the product at the RT-LAMP step with dual indexes introduced at the pool level during the PCR step allows for deconvolution of thousands or tens of thousands of samples in a single sequencing run.</p><p>To determine whether introduction of these exogenous sequences into the primers inhibited the isothermal amplification step, we performed RT-LAMP on inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus using an extensively validated primer set against the N2 region of the nucleocapsid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2021</xref>) including either the conventional BIP and FIP primers or their modified version re-engineered for the COV-ID workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the appearance of the amplified viral product was slightly delayed when using COV-ID primers, all reactions reached saturation rapidly and without detectable amplification of negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Next, we tested whether COV-ID was compatible with RT-LAMP using newly designed primers against a host (human) transcript and whether the second step of COV-ID, direct library construction and indexing via PCR amplification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), yielded the desired product. For this, we designed RT-LAMP primers against the human beta-actin (<italic>ACTB</italic>) transcript that included sequences necessary for COV-ID.

That is, if no human RNA is amplified from a clinical sample, no conclusion can be drawn from a negative test result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babiker et al., 2020</xref>). However, in most tests, viral and human amplicons must be detected separately, resulting in a multiplication of the number of reactions to be performed. We reasoned that the deep sequencing nature of COV-ID would allow for simultaneous detection of viral, human, and other control amplicons, without increasing the number of necessary reactions. In fact, given that the PCR handles inserted in the BIP and FIP are the same for all RT-LAMP amplicons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the same P5 and P7 Illumina primers allow the simultaneous amplification of all RT-LAMP products obtained with COV-ID-modified primer sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

To determine which of the two RT-LAMP primer sets was a better proxy to measure RNA integrity in saliva samples, we assayed for amplification of the respective products in presence or absence of RNase.

Therefore, we utilized <italic>STATH</italic> mRNA as a human control in subsequent experiments.</p><p>We used COV-ID-adapted primer sets for <italic>N2</italic> and <italic>STATH</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) in multiplex on inactivated saliva spiked with a range of SARS-CoV-2 from 5 to 10,000 virions/μL. Subsequently, each RT-LAMP reaction was separately amplified via PCR using a unique P5 and P7 index combination, pooled, quantified, and deep-sequenced to an average depth of 6,000 reads per sample. After read trimming, alignment, and filtering (see Materials and Methods), 76% of reads from saliva COV-ID reactions were informative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In order to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative samples, we calculated the ratio between N2 reads and reads mapping to the human <italic>STATH</italic> control. Using the highest <italic>N2</italic>/<italic>STATH</italic> read ratio in control (SARS-CoV-2 negative saliva) as a threshold, 95% (19/20) of samples with spiked-in virus were correctly classified as positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Using COV-ID, we consistently detected SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples containing as low as 5 virions per µL, a limit of detection comparable and in some cases superior to those of established testing protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Scaling COV-ID to handle higher sample numbers requires pooling samples immediately following RT-LAMP, prior to the PCR step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

We first individually validated each barcode and primer combination by real-time fluorescence and PCR efficiency. Certain barcodes inhibited the RT-LAMP reaction, possibly due to internal micro-homology and primer self-hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Torres et al., 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, out of 32 barcodes tested in 3 separate RT-LAMP reactions (<italic>N2</italic>, <italic>ACTB</italic>, and <italic>STATH</italic>), 25 successfully amplified all three target RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

At the same time, adding to the reactions an artificial substrate for amplification helps minimizing spurious signals as it can ‘scavenge’ viral amplification primers in negative samples. Finally, by providing a baseline amplification even in empty samples, a strategy designed to use an internal calibration control can reduce variance in total amounts of final amplified products across samples, which compresses the dynamic-range of sequence coverage for each patient in a complex pool and, therefore, reduces the risk of inconclusive samples due to low sequencing coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yelagandula et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We reasoned that an internal calibration control approach for LAMP-based quantification would provide similar benefits in the context of COV-ID. To generate a SARS-CoV-2 synthetic calibration standard, we synthesized a fragment of the <italic>N2</italic> RNA that retained all primer-binding regions for RT-LAMP and contained a divergent 7-nt stretch of sequence to distinguish reads originating from the calibration standard from those originating from the natural virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). After confirming that the calibration control template was efficiently amplified via RT-LAMP with the <italic>N2</italic> primer set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), we performed pooled COV-ID on virus-containing saliva in the presence of 20 fg of <italic>N2</italic> synthetic calibration control RNA. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yelagandula et al., 2021</xref>), addition of a constant amount of an internal calibration control across reactions reduced the variability in total read numbers for individual samples in the final pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). As discussed above, a narrower range in sequencing output across samples in a pool optimizes the utilization of sequencing reads, and ultimately lowers the cost per sample. Including the internal calibration control in the normalization strategy resulted in lower levels of false positive signal from negative samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This is likely because in cases where very few <italic>STATH</italic> reads were obtained, possibly due to degradation of host RNA in the saliva sample, the resulting small denominator inflated the <italic>N2</italic>/<italic>STATH</italic> ratio even for SARS-CoV-2 signal that was low in absolute terms and likely spurious.</p><p>Thus, these data show that synthetic standards are compatible with the COV-ID workflow and provide a means to stabilize total amplification and read allocation per sample, while also offering an additional calibration control to better estimate the viral load in samples where the endogenous <italic>STATH</italic> mRNA might be below detection due to improper collection or handling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Validation of COV-ID on clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples</title><p>To evaluate the scalability of COV-ID, we analyzed 120 clinical RNA specimens purified from NP swab samples collected from patients at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Each barcoded RT-LAMP reaction (COV-ID step I) was grouped in pools of 10 samples per PCR amplification (COV-ID step II), allowing us to estimate the feasibility of the two-dimensional barcoding strategy. Again, COV-ID was in good agreement with quantification of viral RNA via a clinical RT-qPCR assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and was able to distinguish positive from negative patient samples in the same RT-LAMP pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). COV-ID showed inferior sensitivity compared to individual RT-qPCRs, failing to detect 10 samples that displayed signal by qPCR.

Both H1N1 and SARS-CoV-2 were detected above background and the signal correlated with the amount of the respective template added to saliva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Overall, multiplex COV-ID correctly identified samples that contained only SARS-CoV-2 (7/8) or H1N1 (6/8).

We found that of the samples containing both viruses, 16/16 showed positive detection of at least one pathogen (SARS-CoV-2 or H1N1), suggesting the reduced sensitivity of the multiplex assay is due to interference between amplification of the two viral templates.

Many FDA-approved clinical SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests are based on time-consuming and expensive protocols that include RNA purifications and RT-PCR and must be performed by trained personnel in well-equipped laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Woronik et al., 2021</xref>). Point-of-care antigen tests provide a much faster turnaround time and require little manipulation, but they lack in sensitivity compared to tests that detect viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brümmer et al., 2021</xref>). Because of reagent limitations and diagnostic testing bottlenecks, at the beginning of the pandemic symptomatic individuals and individuals particularly vulnerable for infection after exposure were prioritized for diagnostic COVID testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schuetz et al., 2020</xref>). Private organizations, including colleges and universities, circumvented some of these challenges by contracting with private laboratories to establish asymptomatic surveillance testing protocols; however, this is a costly option for population-level surveilling of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.</p><p>Several effective COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and there is a concerted ongoing global vaccination effort, providing a concrete means to end the pandemic. Despite this progress, there are several potential risks that require vigilance: possible COVID-19 transmission in vaccinated individuals, emergence of vaccine-resistant viral variants, and public skepticism of vaccines or faltering compliance with social distancing guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aschwanden, 2021</xref>). For these reasons ongoing testing and surveillance efforts will remain important for the foreseeable future, both to monitor the progress of vaccination in reducing symptomatic cases and to detect emerging variants.</p><p>In order to scale testing to an effective volume and frequency, surveillance tests must demonstrate the following qualities: (1) <underline>sensitivity</underline>, to identify both asymptomatic and symptomatic carriers; (2) <underline>simplicity</underline> in methodology, to be performed in a number of traditional diagnostic laboratories, without specialized equipment; (3) <underline>low cost</underline> and easily accessible reagents; (4) <underline>ease of collection</underline> method; (5) <underline>rapid</underline> turnaround time to allow for isolation and contract tracing; and (6) ability to <underline>co-detect</underline> multiple respiratory viruses, given the overlap in patient symptoms. To this end, we have developed COV-ID, an RT-LAMP-based parallel sequencing SARS-CoV-2 detection method that can provide results from tens of thousands of samples per day at relatively low cost to simultaneously detect multiple respiratory viruses.</p><p>COV-ID features key innovations that make it well-suited to high-throughput testing. First, COV-ID uses a two-dimensional barcoding strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yelagandula et al., 2021</xref>), where the same 96 barcodes are used in each RT-LAMP plate, making it possible to pre-aliquot barcodes in 96-well plates ahead of time and store them at –20°C, simplifying execution of the assay and shortening turnaround times. Second, since RT-LAMP does not require thermal cycling, tens of thousands of samples can be run simultaneously in a standard benchtop-sized incubator or hybridization oven held at 65°C. Third, individual samples are pooled immediately following RT-LAMP; therefore, a single thermocycler has the potential to process up to 96 or 384 RT-LAMP plates, generating 9,216 or 36,864 individually barcoded samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4F, G</xref>). Only 96 unique FIP barcodes are required for this scaling; here, we show that 28 out of 32 LAMP barcodes tested were functional for both <italic>N2</italic> and <italic>STATH</italic>. This proof-of-principle experiment demonstrates the feasibility of generating the library of barcodes required to apply COV-ID to a large population. An additional advantage of sequencing-based approaches, such as COV-ID is that with carefully designed primers it would be possible to recover information about viral variants directly from the sequencing reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Everett et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, another group has used RT-LAMP coupled with molecular beacons to amplify the spike sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and identify the emerging B.1.1.7 variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sherrill-Mix et al., 2021b</xref>), demonstrating the utility of RT-LAMP to capture variant-specific sequence information. Finally, COV-ID can generate ready-to-sequence libraries directly from saliva absorbed onto filter paper, which would allow for major streamlining of the often-challenging logistical process of sample collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, COV-ID libraries for thousands and tens of thousands of samples can be generated with relatively minimum effort in biological laboratories with basic equipment and easily accessible reagents.</p><p>With the average throughput of an Illumina NextSeq 500/550, a relatively affordable next-generation sequencer up to 9,216 (96 RT-LAMPs x 96 pools) can be sequenced at a depth of ~48,000 reads per sample, and up to 36,864 (96 RT-LAMPs x 384 pools) can be sequenced at a depth of ~12,000 reads, which, we showed, is more than sufficient to obtain information about multiple viral and control amplicons. Considering that reagents for one NextSeq run cost ~1,500 U.S. dollars, the theoretical sequencing cost per sample could be as low as $0.04 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). While sequencing instruments are relatively specialized and not ubiquitous, amplified COV-ID DNA libraries could be shipped to remote facilities for sequencing in a cost-effective manner as previously proposed by the inventors of LAMP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ludwig et al., 2021</xref>). In a context where a sequencing instrument is available locally, with optimized sample collection and streamlined logistics results could be turned around within 16 hr. Finally, because of the limited sequence space against which reads must be aligned, computational analysis of the resulting data can be performed in a matter of minutes with optimized pipelines, providing results shortly after the sequencing run has completed.</p><p>Several methods have emerged that harness massively parallel next generation sequencing for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Simonetti et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloom et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yelagandula et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aynaud et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Mello Malta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chappleboim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dao Thi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ludwig et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Credle et al., 2021</xref>), reflecting the desire for novel approaches to address the shortcomings of labor-intensive individual clinical diagnostic testing. COV-ID complements these approaches by providing a method that can screen thousands of individuals with a heated incubator, a single PCR thermocycler and access to a sequencer. COV-ID and existing methods for sequence-based diagnostics each have their strengths and weaknesses and should be carefully evaluated for their suitability in specific cases. While our method demonstrates promise, we note that there remain some points that require optimization prior to successful large-scale application of COV-ID in a population setting, including developing primer sets to sequence the spike of SARS-CoV-2 for use in genomic surveillance of emerging variants, or validating individual RT-LAMP barcodes to ensure optimal throughput.</p><p>COV-ID has a limit of detection of 5–10 virions of SARS-CoV-2 per μL in contrived saliva samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and at least 300 virions/μL in saliva collected from patients in a clinical setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Of note, the limit of detection in clinical saliva specimens is likely lower, but it could not be determined because the lowest viral load of all our positive samples was 300 virions/µL. Importantly, this was also the apparent limit of detection of paper-based COV-ID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The average viral load in saliva for a contagious individual (the target of population-scale surveillance) is still a subject of debate and likely depends on several factors including virus variant. In one study, RT-qPCR-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads averaged 380 copies/µL in saliva samples of infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wyllie et al., 2020</xref>). Some meta analyses indicated no significant difference in viral load at the upper respiratory tract for symptomatic <italic>vs</italic>. asymptomatic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walsh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zuin et al., 2021</xref>), and levels of viral RNA in saliva are in general comparable to those found in NP swabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler-Laporte et al., 2021</xref>). This would suggest that the limit of detection of COV-ID matches and exceeds what is needed to detect viral RNA in saliva of infectious and potentially contagious individuals.</p><p>In conclusion, COV-ID is a flexible platform that can be executed at varying levels of scale with additional flexibility in sample input, making it an attractive platform for surveillance testing. Population-level monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infections will be critical while vaccines are being distributed to the global population, and continued surveillance will likely remain an effective strategy to protect immunocompromised and unvaccinated members in society and within entities and organizations where regular monitoring is critical to social isolation strategies. To that end, effective, low-cost, multiplexed, and readily implementable strategies for surveillance testing, such as COV-ID, are important to mitigate the effects of the current and future pandemics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>RT-LAMP primer design</title><p>Primers against <italic>ACTB</italic> were designed using PrimerExplorerV5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://primerexplorer.jp/e/">https://primerexplorer.jp/e/</ext-link>) using default parameters and including loop primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).</p><p>For COV-ID, priming sequences for PCR were inserted in FIP and BIP primers between the target homology regions (F1c and F2, and B1c and B2, respectively, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers assessment was that, while the approach may make an important contribution to genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, it was unclear if it would deliver the benefits of decreased cost, time, and labor in a real-world situation.</p><p>The main weakness pointed out by both reviewers was that much of the work was done on spiked samples. High throughput on clinical samples was not demonstrated, as only 8 were used.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the type of clinical sample tested, whether saliva or swab, is less important. What the proof of concept would require is at least a &quot;superpool&quot; of several pooled wells, with each well containing the maximum number of samples (or close to it). This way, both pooling steps are tested.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I do not have specific technical concerns, but the methodology is difficult to evaluate with results from only 8 clinical samples. Factors such as differing Ct values, sample quality, and others should be evaluated to see if the approach could be used with high throughput, and this would require at a minimum a &quot;superpool&quot; of several pooled wells with each well containing the maximum number of samples. Participant Ct values should be presented and be correlated to detection. Swab transport media can substitute if saliva is not available. Negative samples should be combined with qPCR confirmed positive samples and false negative and false positive rates determined.</p><p>Given that a fast turnaround time is key to success, the approach proposed by the authors is unlikely to be used except in very large studies with ready access to deep sequencing, in which case they would also have access to a PCR. Where the approach may fill an unmet need is genomic surveillance of the virus in the population which would likely involve reconfiguring the system to sequence spike.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I enjoyed reading this manuscript and was impressed with its potential to make a significant contribution to population-level testing of infectious disease, e.g. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Assuming that you are able to able to address the points in the Public Review, I would be pleased to recommend this manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular, I think it would be very helpful to perform more testing of your method from clinical samples.

Your revised article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The main comment of the Reviewers was to show feasibility with more than 8 clinical samples, given that the reason for the approach was to do high-throughput analysis of clinical samples.</p><p>The authors therefore used 120 clinical samples in an experiment to show that the approach can be scaled up. The results are presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>While the reviewer comments were addressed, the results seem to show that the sensitivity of the approach (rate of false negatives) is considerably inferior to that of qPCR: By counting on panel A of the figure, there are 17 qPCR-positive samples. Thresholding by the highest values of SARS/Spike+1 in the qPCR negative samples (about 0.1), 8 samples out of 17 are above threshold by the authors' approach. Therefore, 9 out of 17 (53%) are false negative.</p><p>Because the sample is imbalanced – many more qPCR negatives relative to positives – the false-positive rate (1-specificity) is not sensitive to false positives and the ROC curves are overly optimistic in describing the result.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that those intending to implement the approach can decide for themselves whether it is right for them, but that these limitations should be clearly stated. The authors can use a Precision-Recall curve which does not consider the false positive rate to quantify the performance of their approach.</p><p>Also, the strategy of an artificial N2 spike-in is not described until later in the MS.

The results presented in Figure 2 - Figure Supplement Figure 2 significantly improve the statistical confidence in the ability of this method to identify positive clinical samples and the ROC plots will allow readers to make their own quantitative judgements of the performance of this method for their own purposes.

For each of 13 pooled PCRs, we combined RT-lamps from up to 10 patient samples. Although the experimenter was blinded at the time of pooling, in retrospect we determined that of the 13 pools 5 contained at least one qPCR-confirmed positive sample mixed with negative samples as shown in the new figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). False negative and false positive rates depend on the Ct threshold chosen for the clinical qPCR to define “true positive”. ROC plots are shown for three potential thresholds (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that a fast turnaround time is key to success, the approach proposed by the authors is unlikely to be used except in very large studies with ready access to deep sequencing, in which case they would also have access to a PCR.</p></disp-quote><p>To analyze thousands or tens of thousands of individual samples per day by qPCR, a lab would need to have access not just to one PCR but to many qPCR instruments. Because the first step of COV-ID, which introduces patient-level barcodes by RT-LAMP, does not require a PCR and can be performed separately, we envision the possibility that the first step could be performed on site or in a minimally equipped satellite lab and the samples could be pooled and sequenced in a central location. This would naturally require more development and logistics, but we think it is an inherent advantage of COV-ID (and to some extent of LAMP-seq).</p><p>We have clarified and discussed these views in the revised discussion (lines 372–4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Where the approach may fill an unmet need is genomic surveillance of the virus in the population which would likely involve reconfiguring the system to sequence spike.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we mention this possibility in the discussion (lines 345–50).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I enjoyed reading this manuscript and was impressed with its potential to make a significant contribution to population-level testing of infectious disease, e.g. during the COVID-19 pandemic.
