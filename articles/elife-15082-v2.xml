identified <italic>Wiz</italic> in a mouse screen for epigenetic modifiers. Due to its known association with G9a/GLP, Wiz is generally considered a transcriptional repressor. Here, we provide evidence that it may also function as a transcriptional activator. Wiz levels are high in the brain, but its function and direct targets are unknown. ChIP-seq was performed in adult cerebellum and Wiz peaks were found at promoters and transcription factor CTCF binding sites. RNA-seq in <italic>Wiz</italic> mutant mice identified genes differentially regulated in adult cerebellum and embryonic brain. In embryonic brain most decreased in expression and included clustered protocadherin genes. These also decreased in adult cerebellum and showed strong Wiz ChIP-seq enrichment. Because a precise pattern of protocadherin gene expression is required for neuronal development, behavioural tests were carried out on mutant mice, revealing an anxiety-like phenotype. This is the first evidence of a role for Wiz in neural function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15082.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15082.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>momme</kwd><kwd>widely interspaced zinc finger motifs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Australia fellowship, 1058345</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitelaw</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Though generally considered a transcriptional repressor, Wiz may also function as a transcriptional activator in the mouse brain and is required for normal behaviour.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An ENU mutagenesis screen for modifiers of epigenetic reprogramming was carried out in the mouse and the lines produced are termed <italic>MommeD</italic>s, <italic>Modifiers of murine metastable epialleles, Dominant</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daxinger et al., 2013</xref>). The screen used a multicopy GFP transgene, under the control of erythroid promoter/enhancer sequences, as a reporter. As this reporter undergoes stochastic silencing among otherwise identical erythroid cells, it is reminiscent of the position effect variegation (PEV) screens used to identify genes with roles in regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henikoff, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fodor et al., 2010</xref>). Male mice with the reporter were treated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and offspring were screened for changes in the percentage of erythrocytes expressing GFP; this was a screen for dominant effects. The mutation underlying the <italic>MommeD30</italic> strain was found to be a single base pair deletion in the gene <italic>Widely interspaced zinc finger motifs, Wiz</italic>. The deletion, of an adenine, causes a frame-shift that introduces a premature stop codon. <italic>Wiz<sup>MommeD30/MommeD30</sup> </italic>embryos die around mid-gestation and heterozygosity for the mutant allele results in approximately half the normal levels of the protein, confirming that <italic>Wiz<sup>MommeD30</sup></italic> is a null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daxinger et al., 2013</xref>). This is the only mouse strain with a mutant form of this gene to be reported.</p><p>Little is known about the role of Wiz in any tissue. The protein is predicted to have 11 C2H2 type zinc finger domains that are unusually widely spaced. Some of them can bind DNA and some of them can mediate protein-protein interactions with the G9a/GLP (G9a-like) histone methyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2015</xref>). The G9a/GLP heterodimer catalyses the methylation of H3K9me1 and H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jenuwein et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tachibana et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2005</xref>), which is associated with transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barski et al., 2007</xref>) and is located on chromatin in broad regions, termed LOCKs (large organized chromatin K9-modifications) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wen et al., 2009</xref>). Work carried out in cell lines has shown that Wiz can stabilize the G9a/GLP complex, mediate its localisation to DNA and is required for maintaining normal global levels of H3K9me2, suggesting a role in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Simon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>It has also been shown that G9a can act as a transcriptional activator, independent of its histone methytransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaturvedi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Purcell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2007</xref>) and it has recently been suggested that WIZ has a role in the activation function of G9a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Simon et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Wiz<sup>MommeD30</sup></italic> was identified in the screen because mice heterozygous for the mutant allele showed decreased expression of the GFP transgene. Here, we show at an independent locus known to be sensitive to the dosage of epigenetic modifiers, the A<italic>gouti viable yellow (A<sup>vy</sup></italic>) allele, that haploinsufficiency for Wiz also results in decreased expression.</p><p>Wiz is expressed highly in the brain, both in the embryo and in the adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsumoto et al., 1998</xref>). As reduced levels of G9a/GLP are known to result in the neurological disease Kleefstra syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kleefstra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Willemsen et al., 2011</xref>), it is possible that reduced levels of Wiz might have neurological consequences. Kleefstra syndrome individuals display a complex range of neurological symptoms, including anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Willemsen et al., 2011</xref>). We decided to study the role of Wiz in the brains of <italic>Wiz<sup>MommeD30</sup></italic> mice. We carried out ChIP-seq and RNA-seq in adult cerebellum, a tissue in which Wiz is expressed at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsumoto et al., 1998</xref>). Our results show that Wiz binds tens of thousands of transcriptional regulatory regions across the genome, some of which decrease in expression in <italic>Wiz<sup>MommeD30/+</sup></italic> tissue. ChIP-seq, with an anti-Wiz antibody, has been reported in a human kidney cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2015</xref>) and there is little overlap with our findings. Our molecular studies prompted us to assess behaviour in heterozygous mutant mice and we found that <italic>Wiz<sup>MommeD30/+</sup></italic> mice display an anxiety-like phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wiz haploinsufficiency increases the probability of silencing the metastable epiallele, <italic>Agouti viable yellow</italic></title><p>Haploinsufficiency for Wiz resulted in an increase in the probability of silencing at the GFP transgene reporter, suggesting a role in transcriptional activation at this locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daxinger et al., 2013</xref>). To test the effect of haploinsufficiency for Wiz at an independent reporter known to be sensitive to the dosage of epigenetic modifiers, we used mice carrying the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele. This strain has been maintained on the C57BL/6J background in a heterozygous state (<italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic>). The coat colour of the mouse can be used as a reporter of transcriptional activity at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duhl et al., 1994</xref>). An active locus results in a yellow coat, a silent locus results in a dark brown coat (called pseudoagouti) and a mottled coat arises when some clusters of cells express the locus and some clusters do not. Male <italic>Wiz<sup>MommeD30/+</sup></italic> mice (maintained on an FVB/NJ background) were crossed to female <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> (pseudoagouti) mice and the coat colours of the offspring were scored at weaning (three weeks). FVB/NJ mice carry a wildtype <italic>Agouti</italic> locus, <italic>A/A</italic>, so ~50% of offspring from these crosses will be <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/A</italic> and differ only at the <italic>Wiz<sup>MommeD30</sup></italic> allele, i.e. <italic>Wiz<sup>MommeD30/+</sup>; Avy/A</italic> or <italic>Wiz<sup>+/+</sup>; Avy/A</italic>. Offspring were genotyped for the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> and <italic>Wiz<sup>MommeD30</sup></italic> alleles.

The bands detected in the wildtype sample (at around 100 kDa) were absent in the sample from the homozygous mutant, consistent with an antibody that is specific for Wiz. A larger ~160 KDa isoform has previously been reported in adult cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsumoto et al., 1998</xref>), and consistent with that report, a band of this size is detected with our antibody in protein extracted from this tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we used an unbiased tandem affinity purification approach and compared mass spectroscopy data with previously published datasets analysing Wiz binding partners. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) with the anti-Wiz antibody and an anti-IgG control antibody was carried out on pooled E13.5 brain tissue (n = 1 pooled sample from 5 individuals) and adult cerebellum (n = 2 biological replicates). Four members of the Wiz-Zfp644-EHMT1-EHMT2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ueda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2015</xref>) were in the top five proteins in the dataset, ranked by peptide count in embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>The cerebellums of four adult male <italic>Wiz<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice were pooled for ChIP-seq; two cerebellums per sample and two biological replicates. The cerebellum was chosen for two reasons; it is a relatively simple tissue in the brain with respect to cell types and it is an ENCODE tissue, enabling comparisons to be made with ChIP-seq data obtained for other chromatin proteins. Library preparation and sequencing were carried out by Active Motif (Carlsbad, USA). Over 30 million reads were generated for each of the two Wiz ChIP-seq datasets and the chromatin Input sample dataset. At least 24 million reads could be aligned to the mouse mm10 genome in all cases, after filtering out PCR duplicates.</p><p>Approximately 40,000 peaks were identified at which the two Wiz-ChIP-seq datasets were significantly enriched compared to the Input control with a p-value of ≤1 × 10<sup>−20</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). A representative Wiz peak and ChIP-qPCR validation at the same locus is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, respectively. To determine where Wiz was bound with respect to genic regions of transcriptionally active and inactive genes, an analysis of overlap with gene promoters and gene bodies was carried out. The peaks were roughly equally distributed across promoters (defined as 2 kb up and downstream of the TSS), intragenic and intergenic regions, despite the fact that promoters comprise only a small fraction of the total mouse genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Consistent with this, the deep sequencing read density across the body of all Ensembl genes (normalized for gene length; see Materials and methods), as well as 2 kb upstream of the TSS (transcription start site) and downstream of the TTS (transcriptional termination site), showed strong enrichment at the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15082.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Wiz binds across the genome and at promoter elements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ChIP-seq was performed for Wiz in the adult male cerebellum, a screenshot is shown of a random Wiz-enriched site (* indicated) with the two ChIP-seq replicates and input, from the ~40,000 significantly enriched peaks.

Shown in their report are representative screen shots of Wiz-ChIP-seq enrichment at the promoter region of seven genes (defined in their study as 5 kb up or downstream of the TSS) where there was a “consensus DNA-binding motif confirmed at the locus”. We examined the DNA sequence surrounding each of these seven genes, in all cases the location of the consensus sequence was at least 5 Kb from either the promoter where the binding was demonstrated or the coordinates of the nearest reported ChIP-seq peak (n = 11,853). Instead, the sequence was located downstream in the body of each gene. After remapping this publically available Wiz ChIP-seq dataset (GSE62616), only one of the seven genes was found to have enrichment at the consensus sequence (i.e. reads mapping directly at the CATTCCATTCCATT motif), in the <italic>SENP5</italic> gene. In this case, reads mapped to a sequence located in a repetitive HSATII satellite element and is likely to be a mapping artefact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Firstly, we show that haploinsufficiency for Wiz results in reduced expression at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele and previous work from our laboratory has shown that half the normal levels of Wiz is associated with reduced expression of a multicopy GFP transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daxinger et al., 2013</xref>). By focussing on neural tissue, we have gone on to show that haploinsufficiency for Wiz results in decreased expression of a number of genes, mainly within gene clusters or adjacent to telomeric repeats in both embryonic brain and adult cerebellum. While any instance of decreased expression could, theoretically, be an indirect effect, our ChIP-seq data suggests otherwise. At most of the sites at which decreased expression is observed, Wiz peaks were detected. Furthermore, analysis of the set of genes with altered expression in adult cerebellum, showed that Wiz was detected at the promoters of those with decreased expression but not at those with increased expression. This suggests that those sites at which reducing the levels of Wiz causes increased expression, i.e. Wiz is acting as a repressor, are indirect effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Wiz might bind directly to DNA</title><p>While Wiz has no recognisable catalytic domains, it does have C2H2-type zinc fingers and these have an unusual widely-spaced configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsumoto et al., 1998</xref>). Most proteins that contain multiple zinc fingers have them in a cluster, with short 'linker' sequences (usually less than 10 amino acids) separating the fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schuh et al., 1986</xref>). Most Wiz zinc fingers are at least 50 amino acids apart. The significance of the large linker configuration remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cléard and Spierer, 2001</xref>). Other zinc finger-containing proteins with this configuration include Zfp292, Rlf and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein Su(Var)3–7 and all of these have been shown to bind DNA in vitro using electromobility shift assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cléard and Spierer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harten et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lipkin et al., 1993</xref>). <italic>Rlf</italic>, like <italic>Wiz</italic>, was identified as an <italic>E(Var)</italic> in the <italic>MommeD</italic> screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daxinger et al., 2013</xref>).

The requirement of these different isoforms is unknown and requires careful, isoform-specific study of Wiz. It is also possible that the three ~100 kDa isoforms represent covalent modifications to the Wiz protein. For example, it is known that G9A can methylate non-histone targets, including Wiz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rathert et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Wiz binding overlaps with CTCF binding in the cerebellum</title><p>Our ChIP-seq studies suggest that in adult cerebellum, Wiz binds at promoters and at sites which CTCF, a recognized transcriptional activator, is also known to bind. Because this study has been carried out in a tissue made up of more than one cell type, peak overlap does not necessarily imply that the two proteins bind together. It could be explained by CTCF binding to these locations in one cell type and Wiz binding in another cell type. Competitive binding with CTCF and the closely related BORIS has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pugacheva et al., 2015</xref>). To our knowledge, Wiz has not been pulled down with antibodies to CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yusufzai et al., 2004</xref>), though a protein-protein interaction is possible in neural cell types where <italic>Wiz</italic> is expressed highly and co-immunoprecipitation of binding partners remains to be tested.</p><p>CTCF has multiple roles in organizing the genome; it is enriched at topologically associated domain boundaries and can mediate interactions between an enhancer and promoter elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>). Broad regions marked by H3K9me2 often contain small ‘euchromatic islands’ that are devoid of H3K9me2, are DNase1 hypersensitive and have CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wen et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study in a number of human cell lines found that reducing WIZ levels resulted in less G9a at CTCF-binding sites across the genome (by carrying out ChIP-seq for G9a) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Simon et al., 2015</xref>). Further work is needed to show mechanistically how CTCF, Wiz and G9a establish chromatin at these euchromatic islands.</p><p>ChIP-seq for WIZ in a human kidney cell line has recently been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bian et al., 2015</xref>) and no overlap with CTCF-binding sites was reported. An in-house antibody (not commercially available) was used. Approximately 11,000 WIZ-enriched regions were detected and the consensus binding site that emerged, CATTCCATTCCATT, is quite different from the one reported here. This sequence was found in only 4.5% of their peaks, whereas the Wiz consensus reported here (Wiz motif 1) was found in 70% of the peaks identified in our study. Remapping of their Wiz ChIP-seq dataset was carried out, and failed to produce the peaks reported except at a repetitive HSATII satellite element, suggesting a mapping artefact. The differences might also be linked to the different cell types used. Resolution of this discrepancy will require the publication of Wiz ChIP-seq datasets with additional anti-Wiz antibodies and in different tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Wiz regulates protocadherin gene expression</title><p>Protocadherin genes are expressed mainly in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kohmura et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu and Maniatis, 1999</xref>) and here we report the involvement of Wiz at protocadherin β genes. CTCF has been shown by others to bind to the promoters and enhancer of this locus, mediating the looping required for the transcription of single protocadherin β genes in single neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). Given that almost all sites in the cerebellum that were bound by CTCF were also bound by Wiz, it is possible that Wiz has a function in chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters. Determining the importance of Wiz in looping will require chromosome conformation capture (3C) analysis in Wiz null cells. Early embryonic lethality precluded testing this in the tissue used in this study.</p><p>The protocadherin cluster exists as a large tandem array. At this locus, heterochromatinisation facilitates single isoform expression in single cells i.e. the silencing of the majority of protocadherin genes in any single cell is associated with heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kawaguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toyoda et al., 2014</xref>); the expressed loci must remain active despite being embedded in heterochromatin and it is possible that Wiz has a role in this scenario. In keeping with this hypothesis, the RNA-seq data presented here suggest that other loci sensitive to Wiz haploinsufficiency include genes located adjacent to telomeres, well known heterochromatic regions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Wiz is required for normal behaviour in the adult mouse</title><p>The importance of epigenetic modifications in neural function is emerging; many enzymes that modify histones and DNA have been found to be critical for development and function of the brain.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.

Robust controls are required to demonstrate that the ChIP signals in this manuscript are Wiz dependent: Although Wiz null mice are lethal, 14d embryos have been published (Daxinger et al., 2013) and these embryos have been used for western in this manuscript. Therefore, the WizMD30/MD30 genotype can be and has to be tested by ChIP and qPCR at validating sites (i.e. about 10 positive and negative sites) and compared to wildtype. As a positive control, both genotypes have to be tested for H3 ChIP or similar at these sites. Data may be presented as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>. Alternatively, in case of technical limitations to &quot;ChIPping&quot; homozygous embryos, Wiz ChIPseq with chromatin of a cell line +/- siRNA against Wiz has to be done to document that ChIP signals are indeed dependent on Wiz. Other suggestions to test this include trying another Wiz antibody by Chip-qPCR or performing some reporter assays (e.g. luciferase assays to test promoter activity with and without Wiz overexpression). Regardless, some test for antibody validation should be performed.</p><p>2) Isbel et al. convincingly argue that the relevant chromosomal region shows a single mutation in the Wiz gene as identified by exome sequencing. Nevertheless, this neglects mutations outside of exons, which potentially may influence the expression of the 48 genes in this chromosomal region (Daxinger et al., 2013) and/or of non-coding RNA. The authors should discuss this potential combined effect of Wiz and of unknown genes.</p><p>3) The manuscript may be strengthened if less emphasis is put on the possible transcriptional activator function of Wiz. The transcriptional effects measured in E13.5 are a convolution of direct and indirect effects. Furthermore, only a handful of genes harboring Wiz binding in their promoter are affected, raising unanswered questions about the underlying mechanisms. With the present data it is difficult to conclude about a direct role of Wiz in transcriptional activation, especially in the absence of any biochemical/mechanistic exploration of the phenomenon. This should be commented on.</p><p>4) It is relevant to consider whether the occupancy of either protein at their shared binding regions depends on the occupancy of the other protein.

The 14 day old embryos mentioned above are grossly abnormal, small (Daxinger et al., 2013) and not suitable for ChIP. Unfortunately, primary cells cultured from these homozygous embryos have limited viability (not shown). To address the issue, we have used an unbiased tandem affinity purification + mass spectroscopy approach to purify the Wiz complexes in wildtype embryonic and adult neural tissues. We identified 45 proteins that were present in anti-Wiz antibody pull down samples and absent in anti-IgG antibody controls. Ranking these by the semi-quantitative number of peptides recovered from embryonic brain, where expression of Wiz is high, shows that four members of Wiz-Zfp644-EHMT1-EHMT2 complex are in the top five proteins identified in the dataset.</p><p>This mass spectroscopy data has now been included as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> and the protocol has been added to the Materials and methods section. The following text has been added to the manuscript:</p><p>“In addition, we used an unbiased tandem affinity purification approach and compared mass spectroscopy data with previously published datasets analysing Wiz binding partners. […] Four members of the Wiz-Zfp644-EHMT1-EHMT2 complex (Ueda et al., 2006, Bian et al., 2015) were in the top five proteins in the dataset, ranked by peptide count in embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).”</p><p><italic>2) Isbel et al. convincingly argue that the relevant chromosomal region shows a single mutation in the Wiz gene as identified by exome sequencing. Nevertheless, this neglects mutations outside of exons, which potentially may influence the expression of the 48 genes in this chromosomal region (Daxinger et al., 2013) and/or of non-coding RNA. The authors should discuss this potential combined effect of Wiz and of unknown genes.</italic></p><p>It is unlikely that mutations inside the linked interval but outside exons are responsible for the effects for two reasons:</p><p>A) The frequency of ENU mutations (~1 mutation/Mb, Daxinger et al., 2013) make this unlikely;</p><p>B) The absence of changes in the transcription of genes in the linked interval (excluding the Wiz gene itself). What was not mentioned in the previously version of the manuscript was the fact that no genes within the linked interval were miss-expressed in any of our mutant RNA-seq datasets. The following paragraph has been added to the Discussion:</p><p>“We previously described a <italic>Wiz</italic> mutation in the <italic>MommeD30</italic> strain (Daxinger et al., 2013). This was the only exonic mutation within the linked interval and in agreement with this being the causative <italic>MommeD30</italic> mutation, RNA-seq data presented here show no other genes within the linked interval were mis-expressed in mutants.”</p><p><italic>3) The manuscript may be strengthened if less emphasis is put on the possible transcriptional activator function of Wiz. The transcriptional effects measured in E13.5 are a convolution of direct and indirect effects. Furthermore, only a handful of genes harboring Wiz binding in their promoter are affected, raising unanswered questions about the underlying mechanisms. With the present data it is difficult to conclude about a direct role of Wiz in transcriptional activation, especially in the absence of any biochemical/mechanistic exploration of the phenomenon. This should be commented on.</italic></p><p>The following sentence has been modified in the Abstract:</p><p>“Wiz is generally considered a transcriptional repressor. Here we provide evidence that it functions as a transcriptional activator.” has been changed to “Wiz is generally considered a transcriptional repressor. Here we provide evidence that it may also function as a transcriptional activator.”</p><p>The following sentence has been modified in the Introduction section:</p><p>“<italic>MommeD30</italic> was identified in the screen because mice heterozygous for the mutant allele showed decreased expression of the GFP transgene, consistent with a role for Wiz as a transcriptional activator.” has been changed to “<italic>MommeD30</italic> was identified in the screen because mice heterozygous for the mutant allele showed decreased expression of the GFP transgene.”</p><p>The following sentence has been modified in the Results section:</p><p>“The effect of haploinsufficiency at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> locus is similar to the effect at the GFP transgene reporter, i.e. reduced levels of Wiz were associated with increased silencing, suggesting that the wildtype protein acts as an activator of transcription.” has been changed to “The effect of haploinsufficiency at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic>locus is similar to the effect at the GFP transgene reporter, i.e. reduced levels of Wiz were associated with increased silencing.”</p><p>We have already commented that effects could be indirect and this remains in the Discussion:</p><p>“While any instance of decreased expression could, theoretically, be an indirect effect…”.</p><p><italic>4) It is relevant to consider whether the occupancy of either protein at their shared binding regions depends on the occupancy of the other protein. How many of the differentially expressed genes are bound by Wiz and CTCF in their promoters, respectively? For the down-regulated genes, how many actually have Wiz/CTCF binding at their TSS?

This shows a direct assessment of Wiz occupancy at each of the genes that are deregulated and is more transparent for the reader. The figure legend has been modified to reflect this.</p><p><italic>5) The title and Abstract are a bit misleading. In their current state they seem to suggest that Wiz specifically binds promoters containing CTCF sites, which is not the case as Wiz binds most CTCF sites as well as most promoters. I suggest rephrasing to reflect the data more appropriately (e.g. &quot;Wiz binds active promoters and CTCF binding sites…&quot;.

The title has been changed from &quot;Wiz binds active promoters containing CTCF binding sites…&quot; to &quot;Wiz binds active promoters and CTCF binding sites…&quot;. The sentence in the Abstract – “…Wiz peaks were found at promoters showing enrichment for the transcription factor CTCF” – has been changed to: “ChIP-seq was performed in adult cerebellum and Wiz peaks were found at promoters and transcription factor CTCF binding sites”. The sentence in the Discussion – “Our ChIP-seq studies suggest that in adult cerebellum, Wiz binds at promoters at which CTCF, a recognized transcriptional activator, is also known to bind” – has been changed to: “Our ChIP-seq studies suggest that in adult cerebellum, Wiz binds at promoters and at sites which CTCF, a recognized transcriptional activator, is also known to bind”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
