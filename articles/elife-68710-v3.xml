membrane protein complex that reversibly couples NADH oxidation and ubiquinone reduction with proton translocation against transmembrane potential. Complex I from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is among the best functionally characterized complexes, but its structure remains unknown, hindering further studies to understand the enzyme coupling mechanism. Here, we describe the single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the entire catalytically active <italic>E. coli</italic> complex I reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs. The structure of this mesophilic bacterial complex I displays highly dynamic connection between the peripheral and membrane domains. The peripheral domain assembly is stabilized by unique terminal extensions and an insertion loop. The membrane domain structure reveals novel dynamic features. Unusual conformation of the conserved interface between the peripheral and membrane domains suggests an uncoupled conformation of the complex. Considering constraints imposed by the structural data, we suggest a new simple hypothetical coupling mechanism for the molecular machine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bioenergetics</kwd><kwd>protein complex</kwd><kwd>ion transport</kwd><kwd>respiratory chain</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>molecular machine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0H5916N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Efremov</surname><given-names>Rouslan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0266.15N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Efremov</surname><given-names>Rouslan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>726436</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Efremov</surname><given-names>Rouslan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dynamic structure of respiratory complex I from mesophilic bacterium is revealed and demonstrates existence of uncoupled conformations in the bacterial complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complex I, NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, is a multi-subunit enzyme found in many bacteria and most eukaryotes. It facilitates transfer of two electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, or its analogues, coupled reversibly with translocation of four protons across the membrane against trans-membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sazanov, 2015</xref>). Structures of the complete complex I from several eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiedorczuk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hunte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kampjut and Sazanov, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>), one thermophilic bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>), and the partial structure of the membrane domain of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>), have been determined.</p><p>The composition of complex I differs significantly between species. Mitochondrial complex I has a molecular weight 1 MDa and comprises more than 35 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wirth et al., 2016</xref>), whereas bacterial analogues are much smaller with molecular weight approximately 500 kDa. Complex I from all characterized species contains homologues of 14 core subunits; seven subunits each assemble into peripheral and membrane arms, joined at their tips and form the complex with a characteristic L-shape.</p><p>The peripheral arm, exposed to the cytoplasm in bacteria or the mitochondrial matrix in eukaryotes, contains binding sites for NADH, ubiquinone, and flavin mononucleotide (FMN) as well as eight or nine iron-sulfur clusters, seven of which connect the NADH and ubiquinone-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sazanov, 2015</xref>) enabling rapid electron transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Verkhovskaya et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The membrane-embedded arm includes a chain of three antiporter-like subunits, NuoL, NuoM, and NuoN (<italic>E. coli</italic> nomenclature is used for the subunits hereafter) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>), which are also found in the Mrp family of multisubunit H<sup>+</sup>/Na antiporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steiner and Sazanov, 2020</xref>). Each antiporter-like subunit contains two structural repeats comprising five transmembrane helices (TMH, TMH4-8, and TMH9-13). TMH7 and TMH12 are interrupted by an extended loop in the middle of the membrane and the helix TM8 at the interface between symmetric motifs is interrupted by the π-bulge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>). Membrane-embedded NuoH mediates interaction with the peripheral arm and also contains five-helix structural repeat found in antiporter-like subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>). Together with subunits NuoB and NuoD it forms an extended ubiquinone-binding cavity (Q-cavity) that stretches from the hydrophobic region of the membrane bilayer to the binding site of the ubiquinone head group (Q-site) found in the proximity of the terminal iron-sulfur cluster N2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The membrane arm features a continuous chain of conserved and functionally important ionizable residues positioned in the middle of the membrane. These are suggested to be involved in proton translocation and its coupling to electron transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>). Attempts to visualize conformational changes in the membrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kampjut and Sazanov, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parey et al., 2018</xref>) have revealed rotation of the cytoplasmic half of TMH3 of NuoJ in mammalian complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agip et al., 2018</xref>) and were associated with active-deactive transition. Recently, proton translocation mechanisms without conformational changes in antiporter-like subunits were suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kampjut and Sazanov, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steiner and Sazanov, 2020</xref>). However, all proposed coupling mechanisms remain largely speculative and require further validation by functional, biochemical, and structural methods.</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic> complex I is among the best functionally characterized complex I homologues. It has been studied using many biophysical and biochemical techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Verkhovskaya and Bloch, 2013</xref>). Combined with the possibility of fast and extensive mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pohl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Verkhovskaya and Bloch, 2013</xref>), it represents a highly attractive system to study the coupling mechanism. However, owing to its fragile and dynamic nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Verkhovskaya and Bloch, 2013</xref>), high-resolution structures of this complex remain limited to a partial structure of the membrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present a single-particle cryo-EM structure of the entire <italic>E. coli</italic> complex I reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs, with the peripheral arm structure solved at 2.1 Å resolution and that of the membrane domain at 3.7 Å.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure</title><p>Twin-strep tag was added to genomically encoded subunit NuoF using a CRISPR-Cas9 based system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Both NADH:Q1 and NADH:DQ activities were sensitive to Q-site-specific inhibitor piericidin-A but were lower than those of the detergent-purified protein supplemented with lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sazanov et al., 2003</xref>) likely reflecting reduced solubility of hydrophobic electron acceptors in the absence or at low concentration of detergent.

These extensions are unique among structurally characterized complex I homologues and have a well-defined structure.

This suggests that these states are either suppressed in the resting state of the bacterial complex or do not occur at all. Conversely, <sup>M</sup>TMH8 displays localized disorder next to the π-bulge, indicating possible involvement of this helix in the structural rearrangements associated with proton translocation, and to our knowledge, this represents the first indication of specific conformational changes in antiporter-like subunits.</p><p>Purified <italic>E. coli</italic> complex I is known to be more flexible and fragile than its homologs from other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morgan and Sazanov, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sazanov et al., 2003</xref>). Our cryo-EM reconstructions reveal the reasons for its high flexibility. The peripheral and membrane arms are mainly rigid, whereas the connection between arms is flexible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The high mobility of the interfacial regions and the relative rotation of the arms disrupts conserved interfacial interactions and exposes Q-cavity to the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This differentiates <italic>E. coli</italic> complex I from its structurally characterized homologs in which the Q-cavity is sealed from the solvent. Thus, we interpret the observed conformation as an uncoupled state.</p><p>The reasons for such conformation are not clear. 3D cryo-EM reconstructions obtained for the detergent-solubilized and the nanodiscs-reconstituted complex I allow us to exclude the air-water interface or the nanodisc as the cause. In turn, the lipid bilayer mimetics provided by detergent micelle or lipid nanodiscs might not be sufficiently close to the native lipid bilayer, causing uncoupling. Alternatively, this conformation may have a functional origin and correspond to a resting state of <italic>E. coli</italic> complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belevich et al., 2017</xref>) analogous to the deactive state in eukaryotic complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babot et al., 2014</xref>).

Moreover, homology modeled <sup>H</sup>HTM1 fits the empty space without steric clashes suggesting that <sup>H</sup>HTM1 is dynamic rather than displaced or unfolded.

It is briefly outlined below with more details provided in Appendix.</p><p>Coupling can be enabled by the formation of a cavity isolated from external protons that is accessible to electron acceptors in their neutral form only. The requirement for a tightly coupled cavity is consistent with high conservation of the interface between the arms. Due to its small size, the redox potential of ubiquinone will be strongly modulated by the extraction/addition of single protons from/to the cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemmer et al., 2011</xref>), and reciprocally, activity of the protons in the cavity will be modulated by the changes of the ubiquinone redox state. Upon ubiquinone reduction, the decreased proton activity is rectified by proton transfer through NuoH from the extracellular compartment as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. This proton transfer is coupled to the transfer of three protons through three antiporter-like subunits in the opposite direction resulting in a net transfer of 2H<sup>+</sup> per 1 e<sup>-</sup>. Consequently, the entire membrane module of complex I functions as a proton antiporter with stoichiometry 1H<sup>+</sup><sub>in</sub>/3H<sup>+</sup><sub>out</sub> and most likely operates by a classical alternating access mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>). The mechanism is applicable to evolutionary-related hydrogenases. It suggests that a pH jump creates a proton motive force between the sealed Q-cavity and periplasmic surface and might be used to trap equilibrium conformations associated with proton translocation by the membrane domain of complex I.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed coupling mechanism in respiratory complex I.</title><p>Ubiquinone reduction decreases the proton potential in the Q-cavity, generating/enhancing potential difference between the Q-cavity and periplasmic space.

In the membrane arm, <sup>M</sup>TMH8 displays dynamics unseen in the other complex I homologues which may reflect conformational flexibility associated with proton translocation. We also observed the relative rotation of the membrane and peripheral arms disrupting the conserved interface and trapping the complex in an uncoupled conformation.

After training, 1,256,734 particles were picked automatically from the complete dataset, extracted in RELION 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>), and imported into cryoSPARC 2.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>). Following 2D classification, six initial models were generated, among which one corresponded to the peripheral arm-only and another corresponded to the complete complex I. Using hetero-refinement, 441,265 and 525,680 particles were assigned to the peripheral arm and complete complex, respectively. Further processing was performed in RELION 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zivanov et al., 2020</xref>). After per-particle CTF estimation and Bayesian polishing, 3D auto-refinement of the complete complex produced a map at an average resolution of 3.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the map was very heterogeneous with the peripheral arm resolved at 3.0–3.6 Å whereas the membrane arm was resolved at over 10 Å.</p><p>To address this heterogeneity, both arms were refined independently using multi-body refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nakane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and the peripheral domain signal was subtracted. After two rounds of 3D classification applied to the membrane domain and nanodisc signal subtraction, a subset of 48,745 particles was 3D refined to an average resolution of 3.6 Å. However, the density map was anisotropic. To improve the reconstruction, the original stack of 525,680 particles was refined against the masked peripheral arm, followed by subtraction of the signal from the peripheral arm. Next, membrane arm map obtained above was filtered to 9 Å and used as an initial model for the 3D refinement of all resulting membrane arm particles. Next, to prevent model bias, the refined map was low-pass filtered to 20 Å and used in the subsequent 3D classification with 10 classes, τ of 12 and 24° local angular search range and 1.8° angular step. The best class (110,258 particles and 8 Å resolution) was auto-refined using the starting model low-pass filtered to 15 Å, which produced the reconstruction to a resolution of 4.4 Å. Next, the nanodisc density was subtracted, which further improved the resolution to 3.9 Å. Following 3D classification without alignment with τ of 40, eight classes, and resolution in the E-step limited to 4 Å, a subset of 37,441 particles was identified, which after auto refinement, produced a density map at an average resolution of 3.9 Å with better resolved peripheral regions. Finally, density modification with the resolve_cryo_em tool available in PHENIX 1.18.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Terwilliger et al., 2020</xref>) improved the resolution to 3.7 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>).</p><p>After multibody refinement of the arms described above, peripheral arm particles with the subtracted membrane arm were 3D classified into 12 classes without alignment using τ of 40 and resolution of the expectation step limited to 4 Å. The best class contained 134,976 particles and was further refined to 2.9 Å resolution.</p><p>A subset of 166,580 particles was selected after a similar 3D classification procedure that was applied to the 441,265 particles of dissociated peripheral arm particles. It was further cleaned from the remaining particles of the complete complex I by 2D classification, resulting in a subset of 151,357 particles that produced a density map to a resolution of 3.0 Å. As the reconstructions of the dissociated and membrane arm-subtracted peripheral arms were virtually identical, both stacks were combined. After two cycles of per-particle CTF refinement, aberration corrections, and Bayesian particle polishing in RELION 3.1, the resolution improved to 2.4 Å. Consecutive density modification in PHENIX further improved the resolution to 2.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>To resolve the conformation of entire complex I, a stack of 525,680 particles was aligned to the peripheral arm using auto-refinement with a mask around the peripheral arm in RELION 3.1. Next, 3D classification without alignment into 30 classes with resolution of the expectation step limited to 20 Å and τ of 4 was performed, followed by auto-refinement of each resulting class, which produced maps to a resolution in the range of 9–20 Å (some of the classes are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Three high-resolution conformations of complete complex I were obtained as follows.

Two of the best classes, consisting of 21,620 and 21,234 particles were refined to 4.6 Å and 4.5 Å, respectively. Following density-modification in PHENIX, the resolution of the maps was improved to 3.3, 3.8, and 3.7 Å, for conformations 1, 2, and 3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>From 13,084 motion-corrected micrographs containing LMNG-solubilized complex I, a subset of 9333 was selected. Next, 1,469,948 particles were picked with crYOLO 1.7.0. After 2D classification in cryoSPARC 3.2.0 792,120 particles were retained. The particles were subjected to 3D auto-refinement in RELION 3.1, followed by focused 3D auto-refinement with a mask around the peripheral arm. Next, focused 3D classification of the peripheral arm into 12 classes with τ = 6, 24° local angular search range and 1.8° angular step resulted in a homogeneous subset of 82,433 particles that after 3D refinement produced a 4.3 Å peripheral arm reconstruction. This stack was used for 3D classification without alignment into 15 classes with τ = 15 and without a mask. 3D auto-refinement of the resulting classes converged to resolution between 6.7–13 Å and revealed large relative movements of the arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Model building</title><p>Peripheral arm subunits constituting NuoB, CD, E, F, G, and I were first homology modeled in the SWISS-MODEL server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>) based on the structure of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> (PDB ID:4HEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>) and were rigid-body fitted into the density map in UCSF Chimera 1.13.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).

This is particularly pronounced in the structures of membrane bound hydrogenases where the cavity formed between peripheral and membrane domains is completely sealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). The necessity of having a tightly coupled cavity explains the high conservation of the subunit interface. Notably, the ubiquinone entrance is situated in the hydrophobic region of the bilayer, suggesting that charged molecules need to go through hydrophobic environment to reach the cavity, which is associated with very high energetic costs, hence even in the presence of such an opening the Q-cavity remains inaccessible to the charges.</p><p>Once bound to the cavity, ubiquinone can exchange electrons with cluster N2. It is well documented that the potential of benzoquinone-hydroquinone couple depends on the pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chambers, 1988</xref>), like that of any redox reaction involving protons, and the potential was shown experimentally to decrease by over 400 mV to below −300 mV upon pH change from 2 to 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordillo and Schiffrin, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemmer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Back of the envelope calculations show that the addition or extraction of a single proton from a cavity with the characteristic dimensions of the Q-cavity alters the activity of protons within the cavity by an equivalent of hundreds of millivolts. Thus, the redox potential of ubiquinone bound within the cavity enclosed from the environment is strongly modulated by the extraction/addition of single protons from/to the cavity. <italic>Vice versa</italic>, reduction or oxidation of ubiquinone/ubiquinol is equivalent to adding/removing proton binding groups to/from the Q-cavity. In this way, ubiquinone serves as a transformer that converts the energy of electrons into the chemical potential of protons in a fully reversible manner. During the forward cycle, ubiquinone reduction decreases proton activity in the cavity, which is rectified by protons entering the cavity and performing work. The question is where do the protons come from and how do they perform the work?</p><p>Multiple proton pathways have been suggested in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Efremov and Sazanov, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kampjut and Sazanov, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Verkhovskaya and Bloch, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). However, they all end up on the intracellular/matrix side of the membrane, which makes it difficult to explain the energy conversion. Instead, we propose that the protons re-protonate ubiquinone through NuoH and/or adjacent trans-membrane subunits from the periplasm as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. The fold of subunit NuoH contains a set of 5 TMH structurally similar to the symmetric module of antiporter-like subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>) such that invariant <sup>H</sup>Glu157 superposes with <sup>M</sup>Glu144.</p><p>We suggest that proton transport through NuoH is coupled to the transport of three protons by the three antiporter-like subunits in the opposite direction such that the entire membrane arm functions as a proton antiporter with a stoichiometry of 1H<sup>+</sup><sub>in</sub>/3H<sup>+</sup><sub>out</sub>. The coupling likely proceeds through a classical alternating access mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jardetzky, 1966</xref>) that involves both the interaction of ionizable residues in the middle of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>) and conformational changes. Four protons are translocated outside in two pumping cycles per one reduced ubiquinone molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>In the proposed model only the equilibrium potentials of NADH, ubiquinone, and electrochemical membrane potential are important for the directionality of the reaction and energy balance as expected for a molecular machine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astumian et al., 2016</xref>). Using the proposed model, the activity of protons in the Q-cavity under equilibrium condition can be easily calculated using Nernst equation with two assumptions: (1) protons reach cavity only from outer space and (2) the electric component of the electrochemical potential on the membrane is the same throughout the membrane including subunit NuoH.

Under these conditions, redox potential of UQ is low and comparable to that of NADH (−320 mV) suggesting that electrons do not ‘lose’ energy upon transfer from NADH to ubiquinone.

In all of them, the cavity formed between the peripheral arm and NuoH homologs is sealed. According to our model, membrane-bound sulfane sulfur reductase (MBS) corresponds to n=2 and may function as a proton pump (assuming it does not translocate other ions) with a stoichiometry of 2H<sup>+</sup>/2e<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). More interesting are the cases of n=1 and 0. The case of n=1 corresponds to membrane-bound hydrogenase (MBH). If the antiporter-like subunit of MBH translocates a single proton, then the complex is not electrogenic. However, since both MBH and MBS are different from complex I in the orientation of their antiporter-containing module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2018</xref>) and are closer in structure to Mrp antiporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steiner and Sazanov, 2020</xref>), it is possible that they translocate monovalent metal ions. In this case, MBH can still couple redox reaction to the generation of electrochemical potential by coupling proton transport inside to Na<sup>+</sup> translocation outside the cell. The case of n=0 corresponds to a complex of the peripheral arm with NuoH. Such a subcomplex is undoubtedly one of the stand-alone evolutionary modules. This suggestion is supported by the differences in its position between complex I and MBH/MBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2018</xref>) and its susceptibility to dissociation from the membrane arm in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baranova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>) as is expected for a late evolutionary addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levy et al., 2008</xref>). Such a complex dissipates proton potential or generates it if the redox reaction is reversed. We can speculate that the initial association of the hydrogen-evolving module with an antiporter may have had an evolutionary advantage with the proton-translocating module serving as a source of protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2018</xref>) biasing H<sub>2</sub> evolution towards the reaction product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyd et al., 2014</xref>), as follows from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>.</p><p>Experiments with engineering <italic>E. coli</italic> complex I lacking subunit NuoL and <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> complex I lacking homologs of subunits NuoM and NuoL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dröse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steimle et al., 2011</xref>) (correspond to n=2 and 1, respectively) both suggested that the engineered complexes were active and for both constructs stoichiometry was estimated as 2H<sup>+</sup>/2e<sup>-</sup>. While NuoL deletion experiments support our model, the NuoL/M deletion clearly contradicts it. Both experiments should be interpreted cautiously, however. Results of NuoL deletion for <italic>E. coli</italic> complex I were not reproducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Verkhovskaya and Bloch, 2013</xref>). In the case of <italic>Y. lipolytica,</italic> the homologs of NuoL/M dissociated from the complex along with another 11 subunits upon deletion of supernumerary subunit NB8M located at the tip of NuoL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zickermann et al., 2015</xref>). Since the proton-translocating modules were not deleted per se, the presence of contaminating amounts of assembled complex I in the preparations that generated observed proton pumping cannot be completely excluded. It is important to note that mutation of the conserved ionizable residues on the interface between NuoN and NuoM, i.e. <sup>M</sup>E144 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Torres-Bacete et al., 2007</xref>) or its counter ion <sup>N</sup>K395 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarneh and Vik, 2003</xref>), result in a completely inactive complex I suggesting that dissociation of subunits NuoL/M also should render complex I inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Verkhovskaya and Bloch, 2013</xref>).</p><p>From our model it follows that complex uncoupling is achieved by opening the Q-cavity to the solvent. It is consistent with an elegant experiments by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cabrera-Orefice et al., 2018</xref> in which locking the conserved <sup>A</sup>TMH1-2 plug with the cysteine bridge reversibly uncoupled the enzyme. Close examination of the crosslinked structure indicates that crosslinking fixes the plug in a conformation rendering the Q-cavity accessible to the solvent.</p><p>The exact proton translocation mechanism within the antiporter-like module is unknown and requires further experimental and computational modeling. Here, we can only speculate that given the high conservation of <sup>H</sup>Glu157, it plays an important role in the coupling and may change its protonation state during the pumping cycle. Thus, it can influence the pK<sub>a</sub> of neighboring ionizable residues. In MBH, an equivalent <sup>M</sup>Glu141 is separated from the closest ionizable <sup>H</sup>Lys409 by distance of 20 Å, which in a hydrophobic environment with a dielectric constant of 10, allow them to mutually modulate the pKa of each other by approximately 1 pH unit, similar to the free energy conserved upon ferredoxin oxidation by the protein complex. This distance is reduced to around 13 Å in MBS and to around 6 Å in complex I, consistent with the proportionally higher free energy of catalyzed reactions. While many questions on the coupling mechanism of complex I remain open, further significant advances might be expected once structures of different conformation associated with proton translocation by membrane arm will be resolved.</p></boxed-text></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68710.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology</institution><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>Vinoth</given-names> </name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>National Centre for Biological Sciences</institution><country>India</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Letts</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of California, Davis</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.04.09.439197">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.09.439197v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

You will find recommendations below, but the key is that the submitted pdb needs to reflect the density you obtain and the quality of the density needs to be clearly stated in the manuscript.</p><p>2) The model that is put forward is interesting but currently not well supported by the data in the paper. The authors need to either move the model discussion to supplementary or include data to support it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript and some figures could be improved for better understanding and several points are given below.</p><p>1) Line 36/37 – sentence 'Mitochondrial complex I has molecular weight 1 MDa.…</p><p>'has a molecular weight of 1 MDa.., whereas bacterial analogues are much smaller with molecular weight of ~500 kDa'.</p><p>2) Line 55-57 – Two term is mentioned here Q-cavity and Q-site. I would assume that they are the same i.e., ubiquonine is bound in the cavity and it interacts with N2 cluster. If they are different then it needs to be clarified.</p><p>3) Line 88 – monodispersed to monodisperse.</p><p>4) The activity assay described (lines 90-95) is only for the electron transfer or reduction of ubiquinone and not the proton translocation. This should be made clear. The sentence 'Furthermore, NADH:Q1.…' says that complex I was intact and catalytically active in a detergent-free environment'. Not sure, detergent-free environment is needed. One would like to think that without detergent the activity should be better or equally good. Please rephrase.</p><p>5) Supplementary figure 2. MSP and ND are used (gel is labelled as MSP and legend has ND). Better to use one of them. Readers not familiar with the terminology might get confused.</p><p>6) Supplementary figure 4 – please add a scale bar for micrograph in panel A.</p><p>7) Figure 1 – legend, please add (transparent gray) after 'the nanodisc density'.</p><p>8) Line 116 – The RMSD atom counts are confusing. the comparison with Thermus has RMSD 6.3 Å over 2593, 4 Å for membrane arm over 1604 atoms and peripheral arm 855 but the number don't add (1604+855 = 2459). Similarly, for comparison with mammalian enzyme. Please check and also rephrase the sentence.</p><p>9) Figure 2 – legend has panel E but the figure has only four. The text has it right. Please correct this.</p><p>10) Line 127 – please also include Agip et al. 2018.</p><p>11) In the text, the description of the soluble domain has been called both peripheral and cytoplasmic arms/domain. It may be useful to keep them uniform.</p><p>12) The paragraph (line 212-217) describing the Q-site stands alone here. Initially, I thought it can be moved elsewhere but it will affect the flow. Instead, it will be useful to add a figure showing this site as a panel in figure 2. (Although, panel 5D shows the Q-cavity).</p><p>13) Line 243 – the reference to Figure 3A can be included here.</p><p>14) Line 281-282 – 'Simultaneously there is sufficient room to accommodate the TM helix within the nanodisc'. The sentence is not clear. Is this to reflect that the TMH1 is disordered due to no space in nanodisc or thinning of membrane. Along these lines, if the TMH1 is mobile, would signal subtraction and focused classification around this region help to understand the dynamics of this helix.</p><p>15) Lines 303-307 – Please rephrase the sentences, they are complex and confusing.</p><p>16) Figure 4C is referred in few different places but there is no panel in the figure. I guess it is 4B. Please check and correct. Please improve the panel B in figure 4. One suggestion – to show the <italic>E. coli</italic> map + model in one panel and the overlay of <italic>E. coli</italic> and Thermus in another.</p><p>17) For reconstitution of the enzyme into lipid nanodiscs, was extra lipids added or the lipid that was used during purification (0.003%) is the sole source of lipid.

Now, the text reads as follows:</p><p>“Together with subunits NuoB and NuoD it forms an extended ubiquinone-binding cavity (Q-cavity) that stretches from the hydrophobic region of the membrane bilayer to the binding site of the ubiquinone head group (Q-site) found in the proximity of the terminal iron-sulfur cluster N2 (Baradaran et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Line 88 – monodispersed to monodisperse.</p></disp-quote><p>The language has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The activity assay described (lines 90-95) is only for the electron transfer or reduction of ubiquinone and not the proton translocation.

The depth of nanodisc is the same next to <sup>H</sup>TMH1 as in the other regions of the membrane arm. Based on additional reconstructions obtained in detergent and taking into consideration the comments of referee #2, we revised this paragraph and moved it to the end of discussion and now on lines 427-433 it reads as follows:</p><p>“<sup>H</sup>TMH1 is exposed to the lipid environment and the width of the nanodisc next to <sup>H</sup>TMH1 is similar to other regions around the membrane arm (Video 1).

To improve clarity, we removed the reference to Girnkova et al. 2010 from the Results section. Girnkova et al. 2010 is still referenced in Materials and methods where it is clearly refers to production of MSP2N2 (line 524):</p><p>“The membrane scaffold protein MSP2N2 was expressed and purified following a published protocol (Grinkova et al., 2010).”</p><p>During the reconstitution no addition lipids were added. This is now clarified as follows (line 525):</p><p>“Purified, lipid-containing complex I preparation at 520 nM concentration was mixed with 10.4 µM MSP2N2 (1:20 protein:MSP molar ratio, no additional lipids were added during reconstitution) and incubated for 1 hour at 4°C.”</p><p>The optimal amount of MSP2N2 was determine empirically because lipids concentrate together with detergent during protein concentration and their final concentration was not known. Therefore, the ratio is given as protein:MSP rather than lipid:MSP ratio. Assuming that most of lipids are retained by concentrator, the estimated lipid:MSP molar ratio is around 135:1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) Supplementary figure 2 – the peak (green rectangle) was used for Mass photometry as well as cryoEM. In the mass photometry (panel C), there is still empty ND. Why this should be?</p></disp-quote><p>Reconstitution of complex I into lipid nanodiscs resulted in around 10-fold molar excess of empty nanodiscs as compared to those containing complex I. Due to nanodiscs heterogeneity, subsequent separation by gel filtration had a limited efficiency and some larger, empty nanodiscs were still present in the final protein preparation. We now mention this in the legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 2:</p><p>“(C) Mass photometry of the reconstituted complex I pooled form the main gel filtration peak. Left: a representative mass histogram showing two main peaks: ‘Empty’ nanodiscs at 95 kDa that co-elutes with complex I during size-exclusion chromatography and the nanodisc-reconstituted complex I at 713 kDa.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Phenix density modification for cryoEM is used in all the maps and there is an increase in resolution (along expected lines). Is this just on number or was there a real improvement in the quality of the maps.

The current map shown must be the den mod map?) of the final post-processed and den mod maps, in particular the distal end of membrane arm will be interesting (as the local resolution is poor around that region).</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience, success of phenix density modification is reconstruction-depended. For our complex I maps, nominal resolution has improved by a few tenth of Å after density modification (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). The density quality improved as well. It was particularly spectacular for high-resolution map of peripheral arm, but less efficient in the regions resolved at lower resolution. To illustrate it, we added additional panels to the Figure 1—figure supplement 6 that show maps before and after the modification.</p><p>To clarify that density modified maps were used, we mentioned it on the lines 109 and 115 of the Results section in the revised manuscript and in the legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><p>The RELION non-modified half-maps and masks used for Post Processing in RELION were deposited to EMDB for each reconstruction along with the density-modified map.
