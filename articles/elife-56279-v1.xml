threat to biodiversity, agricultural production and human health. Invasions are often dominated by one or a small number of genotypes, yet the underlying factors driving invasions are poorly understood. The chestnut blight fungus <italic>Cryphonectria parasitica</italic> first decimated the North American chestnut, and a more recent outbreak threatens European chestnut stands. To unravel the chestnut blight invasion of southeastern Europe, we sequenced 230 genomes of predominantly European strains. Genotypes outside of the invasion zone showed high levels of diversity with evidence for frequent and ongoing recombination. The invasive lineage emerged from the highly diverse European genotype pool rather than a secondary introduction from Asia or North America. The expansion across southeastern Europe was mostly clonal and is dominated by a single mating type, suggesting a fitness advantage of asexual reproduction. Our findings show how an intermediary, highly diverse bridgehead population gave rise to an invasive, largely clonally expanding pathogen.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cryphonectria parasitica</kwd><kwd>fungal pathogen</kwd><kwd>invasive species</kwd><kwd>population genomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>170188</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prospero</surname><given-names>Simone</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Pierre Mercier pour la science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Croll</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The chestnut blight fungus has successfully established an intermediary, diverse European bridgehead population, giving rise to a highly invasive clonal lineage spreading across southeastern Europe.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past century, a multitude of invasive species have emerged as threats to forest and agricultural ecosystems worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Santini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wingfield et al., 2010</xref>). Increased human activities, such as global trade, enabled invasive species to cause economic damage through reduced agricultural production, degradation of ecosystems, and negative impacts on human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Marbuah et al., 2014</xref>). A key group of invasive species in forests are fungal pathogens, which are often accidentally introduced via living plants and plant products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rossman, 2001</xref>). To successfully colonize a new environment, fungal pathogens have to overcome several invasion barriers including effective dispersal abilities, changes in available hosts, competition with other fungi, and niche availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gladieux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hayes and Barry, 2008</xref>). This may be achieved with plastic phenotypic changes followed by rapid genetic adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Garbelotto et al., 2015</xref>). The invasive potential is also influenced by pre-adaptation arising outside of the invasion zone. Pre-adaptation can be a critical factor for environmental filtering by abiotic or host-related factors in the new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Krasnov et al., 2015</xref>). As the number of initial founders is often low, invasive populations are frequently of low genetic diversity, which reduces adaptive genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allendorf and Lundquist, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, many fungal plant pathogen invasions were successful despite low genetic diversity within founding populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fontaine et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Raboin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wuest et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A major model explaining the successful expansion of invasive populations despite low initial genetic diversity is the so-called bridgehead effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lombaert et al., 2010</xref>). In this model, highly adapted lineages emerge through recombination among genotypes established in an area of first introduction. Hence, the primary introduction serves as the bridgehead for a secondary and more expansive invasion. Although the bridgehead effect has been proposed as a scenario for many biological invasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">van Boheemen et al., 2017</xref>), empirical evidence for the creation of highly adaptive genotypes within bridgehead populations is still largely missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertelsmeier and Keller, 2018</xref>). An alternative explanation suggests that primary bridgehead populations simply serve as repeated sources of inoculum for secondary invasions without selecting for the invasive (i.e., adapted) genotypes in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertelsmeier and Keller, 2018</xref>). This alternative scenario implies that initial populations are already composed of genotypes adapted to the new environment or have high phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gladieux et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vuković et al., 2019</xref>). A conceptually similar model to the bridgehead effect was proposed for bacteria, where the success of epidemic clones would be contingent on the generation of recombinants in the original populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Smith et al., 1993</xref>). Dissecting whether invasive species were pre-adapted to the new environment or gained adaptation through a bridgehead effect is crucial for effective containment strategies, but requires a deep sampling of genotypes during the early invasion process.</p><p>The pace of adaptive evolution leading to successful invasions is determined by several life history traits including the mating system (i.e., sexual, asexual, or mixed). Sexual reproduction can potentially promote the emergence of more virulent strains through the reshuffling of genetic variants, enhancing invasive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Philibert et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, a switch to asexual reproduction can limit genetic diversification and adaptive potential in newly introduced species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Drenth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Taylor et al., 2015</xref>). However, the low availability of mating partners at the invasion front can be a major cost for sexual reproduction. To avoid the cost of mate search, invasive fungal pathogens often switch from sexual to predominantly asexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Heitman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Suehs et al., 2004</xref>). Consequently, asexual reproduction can promote rapid colonization and dissemination of adapted genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gladieux et al., 2011</xref>). Beyond invasive species, many fungal pathogens undergo asexual reproduction during the colonization of habitats, but they switch to sexual reproduction for the production of survival propagules prior to unfavorable environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schoustra et al., 2010</xref>). Populations of some highly successful invaders, such as the ascomycete <italic>Ophiostoma novo-ulmi</italic> causing Dutch elm disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Paoletti et al., 2006</xref>), or the oomycete <italic>Phytophthora ramorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Grünwald et al., 2012</xref>), are dominated by a single mating type. Low diversity in invasive lineages may be breached by secondary invasions introducing the opposite mating type as observed in <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> in Europe. Prior to the 1980s, only the presence of the A1 mating type was clearly established, followed by the secondary introduction of the A2 mating type leading to sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mariette et al., 2016</xref>). Introgression from closely related species can also reintroduce a missing mating type. <italic>O. novo-ulmi</italic> acquired the missing mating type from <italic>O. ulmi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brasier and Webber, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Paoletti et al., 2006</xref>). Although switches in reproductive modes can be a key factor for invasion success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Philibert et al., 2011</xref>), mechanisms underlying such switches remain poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Billiard et al., 2012</xref>). Beyond the impact on genetic diversity, reproductive modes are often tied to specific environmental adaptations including the mode of spore dispersal. Sexual spores are often highly durable and can be wind dispersed over long distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Philibert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rigling and Prospero, 2018</xref>). Even rare long-distance dispersal events can contribute to the geographic expansion of invasive pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prospero and Cleary, 2017</xref>). In contrast, asexual spores serve mostly short distance dispersal in fungal pathogens with mixed reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mehrotra, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prospero and Cleary, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Some invasive pathogens were discovered to harbor specific characteristics in the architecture of the genome, which may have facilitated the generation of adaptive genetic variation. For instance, genomes of <italic>Ophiostoma</italic> species causing Dutch elm disease show signals of frequent hybridization and introgression events, giving rise to lineages with increased virulence or growth at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hessenauer et al., 2020</xref>). Genomes of a number of crop pathogens including the oomycete <italic>P. infestans</italic> and the fungal pathogens <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic> and <italic>Zymoseptoria tritici</italic> show compartmentalization into gene-dense and gene-poor regions with virulence factor being preferentially encoded in gene-poor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frantzeskakis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Torres et al., 2020</xref>). The gene-poor regions are enriched in transposable elements (TEs), and the encoded virulence factors (i.e., effectors) show epigenetic regulation, rapid sequence turnover, and weak phylogenetic conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fouché et al., 2018</xref>). In pathogen systems such as <italic>Cryptococcus gattii</italic> or <italic>P. infestans</italic>, copy number variation (CNV) has created highly successful outbreak lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Knaus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Steenwyk et al., 2016</xref>). Beyond potential roles in adaptation, the genome structure of plant pathogens is likely influenced by neutral processes including migratory bottlenecks possibly affecting the activity of TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Oggenfuss et al., 2020</xref>). Whether virulence factors are associated with genome compartmentalization and how chromosomal rearrangements could underpin the creation of invasive pathogen genotypes remain largely unknown.</p><p>The ascomycete <italic>Cryphonectria parasitica</italic> (Murr.) Barr. is the causal agent of chestnut blight, a lethal bark disease of <italic>Castanea</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rigling and Prospero, 2018</xref>). The pathogen is native to eastern Asia and was first observed in 1904 in North America on the American chestnut (<italic>Castanea dentata</italic>). In the following years, the disease rapidly spread throughout the distribution range of <italic>C. dentata</italic>, causing the vast decimation of this native tree species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Elliott and Swank, 2008</xref>). In 1938, the fungus was first detected on the European chestnut (<italic>Castanea sativa</italic>) near Genoa (Italy) and is now established in all major chestnut-growing countries in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rigling and Prospero, 2018</xref>). The damage to the European chestnut may have been reduced by the presence of the <italic>Cryphonectria hypovirus 1</italic> (CHV1), which acts as a biological control agent of chestnut blight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rigling and Prospero, 2018</xref>). The virus can be transmitted both vertically to asexual spores (conidia) or horizontally through hyphal anastomoses between virus-infected and virus-free strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heiniger and Rigling, 1994</xref>). Hyphal anastomoses are controlled by a vegetative compatibility system, and the virus spreads most effectively between strains of the same vegetative compatibility type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cortesi et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Population genetic analyses showed that the invasion of Europe occurred through multiple introductions both from native populations in Asia and from populations in North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dutech et al., 2012</xref>). Invasive European <italic>C. parasitica</italic> populations are characterized by lower vegetative compatibility diversity than North American and Asian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Milgroom and Cortesi, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, European populations exhibit lower recombination rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dutech et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">González-Varela et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Prospero and Rigling, 2012</xref>). Mating in <italic>C. parasitica</italic> is controlled by a single mating type (MAT) locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Marra and Milgroom, 2001</xref>), and natural populations can reproduce both sexually and asexually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Marra et al., 2004</xref>). Previous analyses of southeastern European <italic>C. parasitica</italic> populations based on sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers suggested that the region was largely colonized by a single and likely asexual lineage also identified as S12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Milgroom et al., 2008</xref>). The lineage belongs to the vegetative compatibility type EU-12. Within the distribution range of the lineage, sexual structures (i.e., perithecia) are rarely found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Milgroom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sotirovski et al., 2004</xref>). Based on SCAR marker and field records, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Milgroom et al., 2008</xref> suggested that the invasive S12 lineage originated in northern Italy and subsequently spread across southeastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avolio, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biraghi, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buccianti and Feliciani, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Karadžić et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Myteberi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Robin and Heiniger, 2001</xref>). However, due to the low molecular marker resolution and challenges in relying on observational data, the origin, invasion route, and genetic diversification of <italic>C. parasitica</italic> in southeastern Europe remain largely unknown.</p><p>In this study, we sequenced complete genomes of a comprehensive collection of European <italic>C. parasitica</italic> strains with a fine-scaled sampling throughout the S12 invasion zone. Based on high-confidence genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we identified the most likely origin and recapitulated the invasion process across southeastern Europe. We show that the invasive <italic>C. parasitica</italic> lineage arose through an intermediary, highly diverse bridgehead population. During the expansion, the lineage became dominated by a single mating type but retained the ability to reproduce sexually.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide polymorphism analyses of global <italic>C. parasitica</italic> isolates</title><p>We analyzed complete genomes of 230 <italic>C. parasitica</italic> isolates covering the global chestnut blight distribution range, as well as the European outbreak region of the invasive S12 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Isolates were sequenced at a mean depth of 8–53× to detect high-confidence genome-wide SNPs. A region of 179,501–2,084,312 bp on scaﬀold 2 was associated to the mating type locus based on association mapping p-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We removed SNPs within the mating type-associated region to avoid confounding genetic structure with mating type divergence. We retained 80,700 SNPs and performed a principal component analysis (PCA) and constructed a SplitsTree phylogenetic network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>).

The largest cluster contained the majority of sequenced European isolates, including the S12 lineage, as well as all North American and two Georgian isolates (cluster CL1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The folded site frequency spectrum (SFS) for each of the three groups contained a large fraction of singletons, suggesting a population expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We used the software <italic>dadi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gutenkunst et al., 2009</xref>) to identify the best fitting model considering no population size change or a single instantaneous population size change, as well as more complex models represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). For the isolates outside the main European/North American group, we found support for a recent population expansion (CL2–CL4 clusters, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, for both clusters, the best Akaike information criterion (AIC) value was obtained for modeling a simple instantaneous expansion (AIC of 70.4 and 115.4 for the CL3+CL4 and CL2, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The second-best model was a more complex version of an expansion scenario including an initial bottleneck followed by exponential growth (AIC of 75.0 and 152.7 for the ‘bottlegrowth’ model, for the CL3+CL4 and CL2, respectively). However, for the large European/North American CL1 cluster, despite removing all but a single isolate of the S12 lineage, parameter optimization was not successful for any model or any randomly drawn initial parameters (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This is likely explained by the unusual frequency spectra.

Despite the high level of genetic diversity, we found no evidence for geographic structure. Moreover, we found no clustering of isolates belonging to the same vegetative compatibility type with the exception of some EU-01, EU-02, and EU-12 (S12) genotypes of predominantly Balkan origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Our findings confirm the clear limitation of these markers as proxies for diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ježić et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, vegetative compatibility type diversity impacts mycovirus transmission dynamics and remains, hence, a relevant population trait.

To avoid a bias by the deep sampling of the S12 lineage, we excluded all but one of the S12 MAT-1 isolates (see 'Materials and methods'). We used RAiSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alachiotis and Pavlidis, 2018</xref>) to produce a composite score of selective sweep signals and identified two strong outlier loci. Despite no clear demographic model fitting the genomic data of the focal population, we nevertheless attempted to control for potential demographic history effects. We performed 10,000 simulations of a population under three different models without selection: no population size change (i.e., constant), expansion, and bottleneck. This was followed by a genome-wide selection scan on the simulated datasets using RAiSD. We assessed above what µ values selection signals are most likely exceeding effects by demographic events. The highest values of µ were obtained for the simulations with the expansion scenarios (µ = 37). Consequently, we used this value as a conservative threshold to identify the most robust signatures of selection. Two outlier loci obtained in the selection scan on the observed data have µ values above 37. The strongest sweep locus was located at the boundary of the mating type locus on scaffold 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The second sweep locus was detected on scaffold 1 and encompassed an ∼120 kb locus at positions 2099–3309 kb.

Thus, to dissect the genetic ancestry of S12, we performed a coancestry matrix analysis using fineSTRUCTURE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lawson et al., 2012</xref>) considering all isolates of the major European/North American cluster (CL1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), including the S12 lineage (<italic>n</italic> = 197).

The large number of identified clusters likely stems from the presence of multiple small groups of highly related individuals beyond the S12 lineage. Furthermore, populations only showed weak geographic structuring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The highest level of coancestry for any given S12 isolate was found within the S12 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

Here, we generated a de novo identification and annotation of TEs for the <italic>C. parasitica</italic> genome. We found that 12% of the genome was composed of TEs with striking variation along the assembled scaffolds (i.e., quasi-chromosomes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In particular, regions on scaffold 2 matching the mating type locus are highly enriched in TEs, suggesting that the large non-recombining region has undergone substantial degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, the vegetative incompatibility (<italic>vic</italic>) loci are located in regions devoid of TEs. In fungal pathogens, effector genes and TEs are often co-localized in fast-evolving compartments of the so-called ‘two-speed genome’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dong et al., 2015</xref>). However, the <italic>C. parasitica</italic> genome shows no apparent compartmentalization into gene-sparse and gene-rich regions. We used machine learning to predict secreted proteins most likely acting as effectors to manipulate the host. In contrast to other plant pathogens, effector gene candidates showed no tendency to localize in gene-sparse regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Non-repressed TEs can potentially create additional copies in the genome, leading to intra-species variability in TE content. To detect such TE activity, we performed genome-wide scans of <italic>C. parasitica</italic> isolates for presence or absence of TEs based on split read and target site duplication information. At loci with detectable TE presence/absence polymorphism, we found an over twofold variation in total TE counts across all isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The total TE count variation among the genetically diverse non-S12 isolates (North America and Europe only, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) was larger than the clonal S12. Nevertheless, the count of TE insertions at polymorphic TE insertion sites ranged between 12 and 52 among S12 isolates, which was surprisingly high given their recent emergence and extremely high similarity across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Across TE insertion loci, we found only a marginally significant difference in the TE frequency among S12 compared to non-S12 isolates (p=0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is in strong contrast to segregating SNPs. We found pairwise differences of 0–45 SNPs among S12 isolates and 0–3770 among non-S12 isolates (test statistic t-test mean difference p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). For a direct comparison of TE and SNP diversity, we assessed the coefficient of variation (CV) of normalized TE and SNP counts. For TEs, we found a CV = 0.24 for S12 and CV = 0.33 for non-S12 isolates. For SNPs, we found a CV = 0.007 for S12 and CV = 0.69 for non-S12. Hence, our findings indicate a higher TE diversity among isolates compared to SNP diversity within the S12 lineage. We found that 44% and 49% of the polymorphic TE insertion sites are specific to the S12 and non-S12 group of isolates, respectively. Given the much more recent origin of the S12 lineage, this suggests increased TE activity since the emergence of the S12 lineage contributing to the creation of de novo genetic variation.

Deep sampling of recent invasive genotypes showed that the secondary invasion in southeastern Europe was caused by a single, highly homogeneous lineage consisting nearly exclusively of a single mating type. Given the likely origin from the European gene pool with clear evidence for sexual reproduction, the invasive lineage likely transitioned from biparental mating populations to a single mating type. The spread across southeastern Europe left no clear geographic imprint. This lack of genetic differentiation along the invasion route may be due to high levels of gene flow after the initial colonization or a very rapid spread from the center of origin to multiple locations across southeastern Europe. We show that ongoing TE activity created unexpected levels of insertion polymorphism within the invasive lineage. In addition, the lineage carries a distinct gene deletion and duplication profile compared to the European and North American pool of <italic>C. parasitica.</italic></p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The establishment of a European bridgehead population</title><p>Central and southeastern European <italic>C. parasitica</italic> populations likely originated from North American lineages. Clusters of European and North American genotypes were largely overlapping. Shared genotype clusters between the continents are consistent with historic gene flow from North America to Europe. These genome-scale analyses are consistent with previous findings documenting multiple North American introductions into Central Europe, but also directly from Asia to Western Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Demené et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dutech et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Milgroom et al., 1996</xref>). Our results show that Central and southeastern European <italic>C. parasitica</italic> populations were largely established from North American sources alone consistent with previous studies. We were unable to sufficiently sample the North American source populations, and, hence, demographic history analyses of North American and European populations remained inconclusive. However, the high diversity at the genetic level with polymorphism at the level of SNPs, TEs, and CNV, as well as at the level of vegetative compatibility types, suggests that Europe was repeatedly colonized over the past century. Although genetic diversity could also have accumulated in situ in Europe, the establishment of a large set of genotypes and vegetative compatibility types seems diﬃcult to explain with population age alone. Sexual recombination between the three most common vegetative compatibility types in Europe (i.e., EU-01, EU-02, and EU-05; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Robin and Heiniger, 2001</xref>) could not account for the observed vegetative compatibility-type diversity. Observational records date the first introductions into Europe to the 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Robin and Heiniger, 2001</xref>). Hence, based on the observed genetic diversity, a scenario of repeated introductions of different vegetative compatibility types since the 1930s seems most plausible.</p><p>Within Europe, populations from southern Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia are highly diverse and have nearly balanced mating type ratios. We also found no clear genetic structure according to vegetative compatibility types. This strongly suggests frequent outcrossing and population admixture, consistent with reports of perithecia in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ježić et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Prospero et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Prospero and Rigling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Trestic et al., 2001</xref>). Low vegetative compatibility-type diversity in most European <italic>C. parasitica</italic> populations was thought to have contributed to low population admixture within Europe compared to Asia and North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cortesi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dutech et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Prospero and Rigling, 2012</xref>). However, our genome-wide analyses revealed frequent and ongoing in situ admixture in Europe. Thus, vegetative compatibility-type diversity does not necessarily underpin population admixture frequency and genetic diversity in sexually recombining populations. Our findings show that in asexually reproducing populations, such as in the S12 lineage, genotypes tend to cluster according to vegetative compatibility types.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Emergence of an invasive lineage from a European bridgehead</title><p>The invasive lineage S12 most likely arose from existing genotypes established in Europe. The closest genotypes to the dominant S12 MAT-1 were S12 MAT-2 isolates found in Bosnia, Kosovo, and southern Italy. Analyses based on a coancestry matrix identified populations from Bosnia, Croatia, Switzerland, and Georgia, but also Spain sharing the highest ancestry with the S12 lineage. Although we cannot exclude the existence of yet undescribed genetic diversity in North American populations, our results strongly indicate that introductions from outside of Europe are unlikely to explain the emergence of S12. The lineage carries a unique set of copy number variants compared to other European genotypes underlining the observation of a recombinant S12 genotype. Furthermore, the emergence of S12 was accompanied by a striking evolutionary transition from mixed mating type populations to single mating type outbreak populations. Human activity may have contributed to the shift toward single mating type populations. Shipments of infected chestnut seedlings from Northern Italy and other trading activities could have disseminated the invasive lineage further South. This would have exposed the pathogen to the geographically more fragmented chestnut forests typically found in southeastern Europe where asexuality or selfing may be advantageous in the absence of mating partners. Although <italic>C. parasitica</italic> is able to produce asexual conidia in large quantities, these specific spores are thought to be mainly splash dispersed by rain over short distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Griffin, 1986</xref>). Accounting for occasional dispersal by birds or insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Heald and Studhalter, 1914</xref>), conidia dispersal is unlikely to contribute substantially to the colonization of new areas. Moreover, human-mediated dispersal could have introduced the lineage to other regions including the Iberian Peninsula and Georgia.</p><p>Despite the loss of a mating type in the S12 lineage, we found limited evidence for reticulation indicating at least low levels of recombination. If mating in <italic>C. parasitica</italic> follows the canonical process found in many ascomycetes, isolates of opposite mating type are required. Hence, S12 isolates of mating type MAT-1 may sporadically mate with rare S12 isolates of mating type MAT-2, which are comparatively more diverse. The emergence of the opposite mating type at low frequency could be the result of recombination with other genotypes and subsequent backcrossing. Combined with experimental evidence, we show that the dominant S12 mating type MAT-1 has retained the ability for sexual reproduction. Furthermore, in Bosnia, Croatia, Italy (Sicily), and Turkey, the S12 lineage coexists with other genotypes (i.e., vegetative compatibility types EU-01 and EU-02) of both mating types, potentially enabling sexual recombination and diversification in situ. The invasive S12 lineage was potentially pre-adapted to the southeastern European niche as we traced the origins to a likely bridgehead population located in southern Switzerland, northern Italy, or the northern Balkans. Niche availability and benefits associated with asexual reproduction to colonize new areas may have pre-disposed the European <italic>C. parasitica</italic> bridgehead population to produce a highly invasive lineage. Such potential pre-adaptation to the southeastern European environmental conditions, as well as reduced niche availability, may also explain why genotypes belonging to the S12 lineage have rarely been found elsewhere in Europe.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Expansion and mutation accumulation within the invasive lineage</title><p>The S12 lineage diversified largely through mutation accumulation as nearly all high-confidence SNPs were identified as singletons. Mutation accumulation in the absence of substantial recombination resulted in star-like phylogenetic relationships. We found a surprisingly high degree of differentiation among S12 genomes at the level of TE insertion polymorphism. Hence, active transposition of TEs is an important factor in diversifying the invasive lineage and possibly underpin future adaptive evolution. We found no evidence for a preferential association of candidate effector genes with TEs. Even though genome compartmentalization is a feature in many fungal genomes, the association of effector genes with repeat-rich regions is not consistent among pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Torres et al., 2020</xref>). Necrotrophic pathogens like <italic>C. parasitica</italic> often rely less on effector-based gene-for-gene interactions and tend to deploy toxins or cell-wall degrading enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Friesen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Torres et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>C. parasitica</italic> has recently experienced a loss of genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and cell-wall degradation, which may have reduced exposure to the host immunity system and increased virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Stauber et al., 2020</xref>). The lack of genes with confirmed pathogenicity functions largely prevents thorough investigations on factors facilitating virulence evolution (e.g., epigenetic silencing or sequence rearrangements).</p><p>Analyses of allele frequency spectra suggested that the broader European <italic>C. parasitica</italic> populations effectively removed the most deleterious mutations through purifying selection. In contrast, the S12 lineage shows strong skews toward very low minor allele frequencies of all mutation categories. Interestingly, we found a broader spread in allele frequencies for nearly neutral mutations in the S12 lineages. This suggests that despite the largely clonal population structure deleterious mutations can still be removed through low levels of recombination and purifying selection. Using accumulated mutations as markers to retrace the spatial expansion of the invasive S12 lineage, we found no indication for a step-wise geographic expansion along potential invasion routes. A lack of genetic clustering across southeastern Europe may be a consequence of high levels of potentially human-mediated gene flow frequently introducing new genotypes over large distances. However, the lack of geographic structure could also have its origins from substantial population bottlenecks during the spread of S12 across southeastern Europe. Finally, the largely clonal lineage may also become exposed to processes such as Muller’s Ratchet fixing deleterious mutations over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Felsenstein, 1974</xref>).</p><p>We show how a highly invasive fungal pathogen lineage in Europe can emerge from an intermediate, genetically diverse bridgehead population in Europe. This is in line with the self-reinforcement invasion model where initial introductions promote secondary spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertelsmeier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Garnas et al., 2016</xref>). However, empirical evidence for adaptation in bridgehead populations is often elusive. Additionally, human activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banks et al., 2015</xref>) and host naivety of the European chestnut could have contributed substantially to the rapid spread without the need for diversification and adaptation in the bridgehead population. To date, there is no evidence for the emergence of tolerance or resistance against <italic>C. parasitica</italic> in European chestnut populations. However, fungal virulence may be severely reduced by the naturally occurring or artificially introduced parasitic mycovirus CHV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rigling and Prospero, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, mycovirus spread is most efficient in asexual <italic>C. parasitica</italic> populations such as the invasive S12 lineage. This is because isolates of the same lineage lack vegetative incompatibility barriers among each other. The mycovirus has been reported in southeastern Europe where it shows population structure in contrast to the fungal host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bryner and Rigling, 2012</xref>). Our study included only CHV1-free S12 isolates, hence potential associations of viral load, genetic identity, and geographic structure remain to be investigated. Outcrossing populations often harbor many different vegetative compatibility groups slowing viral transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Robin and Heiniger, 2001</xref>). Hence, the presence of the mycovirus may confer a selective advantage to retain sexual cycles and diversify vegetative compatibility types. In turn, diversification may reduce the evolutionary advantage of the invasive lineage over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Samples of <italic>C. parasitica</italic></title><p>A total of 230 <italic>C. parasitica</italic> were sequenced.

For this, the reference genome was first split into 800 bp overlapping kmers that were re-aligned to the reference using blasr (-m 5 -noSplitSubreads -minMatch 15 -maxMatch 20 -advanceHalf -advanceExactMatches 10 -fastMaxInterval -fastSDP -aggressiveIntervalCut -bestn 10) to identify duplicated windows (python3 0.2.Kmer_Link.py ref.genome.kmer.aln 800 ref.genome.800.window.link). The resulting windows were then used to calculate the NRD for each isolate from the aligned reads (bam format) in 800 bp windows (Individual.Process.sh -b $bam -h ${i% .bam} -d ref.genome.800.window.link -s scaﬀold_1). For all further analyses, we used the read depth normalized for the absolute copy number and GC content of each sample (RD_normalized output). Given the observed distribution of the NRD across all isolates, we considered windows with NRD &gt;1.6 to be duplicated and windows with NRD &lt;0.4 as deleted considering the 5th and 95th percentiles of the normalized read coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). To investigate the relative diversity within the S12 and non-S12 groups, we resampled 80 random isolates from each lineage 100 times and investigated SNP, TE, and CNV diversity. We quantified the minor allele frequency spectrum in each of the two groups and tested for the group effect (S12 vs. non-S12) on the genetic diversity using Fisher's exact tests in R. We simulated datasets using 2000 resampling replicates to generate expectations for random distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Mating experiments</title><p>The ability of <italic>C. parasitica</italic> isolates belonging to S12 with mating type MAT-1 to sexually outcross with isolates of opposite mating type was assessed in an inoculation experiment. For this, we randomly selected four S12 and one non-S12 isolate with mating type MAT-1, as well as five isolates of opposite mating type MAT-2 from populations in Italy (Nebrodi), Kosovo (Molliq), and Bosnia (Konic, Vrnograč, Projsa) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). All isolates of both mating types belonged to the vegetative compatibility type EU-12, and mating pairs were only formed between isolates from the same geographic source populations. As substrate for the pairings, 40-mm-long segments of dormant chestnut (<italic>C. sativa</italic>) stems (15–20 mm in diameter) were split longitudinally in half. The wood pieces were autoclaved twice and placed onto sterile Petri dishes (90 mm diameter), which were filled with 1.5% water agar to enclose the pieces. Mating pairs were inoculated on opposite sides of each halved stem with three replicates per pairing. The inoculated plates were then incubated at 25°C under a 16 hr photoperiod (2500 lux) for 14 days. After 2 weeks, mating was stimulated by adding 5 mL sterile water to the plates to suspend and distribute the conidia produced by both isolates over the stem segment. Any excess water was subsequently removed and the plates were incubated at 18°C under an 8 hr photoperiod (2500 lux). After 5 months of incubation, perithecia formation was assessed under a dissecting microscope. To confirm successful outcrossing, single perithecia were carefully extracted from the stromata and crushed in a drop of sterile distilled water. The resulting ascospore suspensions were plated on PDA and incubated at 25°C for 24–36 hr. Afterwards, single germinating ascospores were transferred to PDA and incubated in the dark for 3–5 days at 25°C. DNA was then extracted from 10 mg of lyophilized mycelium using the kit and instructions by KingFisher (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All single ascospore cultures were screened for mating types by performing a multiplex PCR following the protocol described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cornejo et al., 2019</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Ursula Oggenfuss for helpful comments on a previous manuscript version.

Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Vincent Castric as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #4, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Anna-Liisa Laine (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional analyses are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Stauber and colleagues have analysed complete genomes of 188 natural isolates of the chesnut pathogen <italic>Cryphonectria parasitica</italic> across Europe. The results confirm previous accounts that the recent invasion in south-eastern Europe involved a single clonal lineage. The invasive lineage was closely related to nearby European lineages, where outcrossing was predominant. This is in line with the “bridgehead population” hypothesis suggesting that the invasive lineage arose in situ rather than through secondary introduction. In spite of very low nucleotide diversity, the invasive lineage shows some variation in TE content and indels overlapping genic sequences. The manuscript is generally well written and easy to follow.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide an explicit demographic model</p><p>– The current study follows a previous analysis (Milgroom et al., 2008) that had largely clarified the invasion scenario in this species. As the manuscript currently stands, the additional insight gained from having sequenced complete genomes is not clearly explained. In particular, beyond the better &quot;marker resolution&quot; as compared to the SCARS markers, polymorphism data gained from complete genomes should enable a comprehensive demographic reconstruction of the invasion scenario. This demographic scenario should then be used as a baseline for all diversity and divergence patterns reported. More generally, a more formal hypotheses testing framework is necessary throughout the paper, as several assertions are made based on the simple observation of patterns, without associated statistical tests.</p><p>– This demographic model is especially important for the analysis of natural selection signatures, since these signals are strongly dependent upon specifics of the demographic history.</p><p>– Finally, the sweep analysis is based on the non-S12 samples only, so it is unclear how sweeps in the recombinant strains relates to the broader issue of adaptation in the invasive lineage.</p><p>2) Modify general framing of the study</p><p>– The study presents the scenario under the &quot;bridgehead population effect&quot;, but Maynard-Smith et al., 1993, developed a model of epidemic clones, where a successful clone emerges and expands from a recombinant background. While the model was formulated for bacteria, it is similar to the bridgehead effect mentioned here, and should at least be cited and briefly discussed.</p><p>– The Abstract claims that the study is aimed to &quot;unravel the mechanisms underpinning the invasion&quot; and to identify the &quot;underlying factors driving invasion&quot;, but the results actually provide little insight on these mechanistic aspects, beside clarifying the invasion scenario. At least the underlying hypotheses for these claims should be made more explicit (see below).</p><p>– The Introduction covers nicely aspects of adaptation and the importance of genetic diversity. There are indeed examples of invasive events that are triggered by limited genetic diversity, but on the other hand, the analysis by Philibert and colleagues (2011) identified sexual reproduction as one of the three key traits predicting the invasion success of forest pathogens. While it is important to understand the specific event leading to the emergence of an invasive strain, the Introduction could expand a bit on what are the properties of populations that are likely to lead to such events in the first place.</p><p>– The Introduction would benefit from some ecological insight. Sexual vs. asexual strategies have ecological consequences relevant for invasive success beyond levels of genetic diversity or mating costs. Sexual vs. asexual life-history stages often vary for example in survival ability during unfavorable environmental periods, in their dispersal abilities, and in environmental cues that trigger germination.</p><p>3) Better integrate the genomic analyses</p><p>– The structural variation analysis is poorly connected to the main aims of the paper. For instance, the “two-speed genome” hypothesis is interesting, but it is unclear how it fits in the questions addressed in the study. More generally, a precise formulation of hypotheses for the genomic aspects would be needed, as these aspects are presently absent from the Introduction section.</p><p>– This part of the manuscript also critically lacks statistical support. For instance, the following assertions “The total TE count variation among the […] non-S12 isolates was larger than the clonal S12 isolates”, “Genes tend to overlap duplications rather than deletions and TEs tend to overall deletions rather than duplications” and “Scaffold 4 and 6 were overall rich in duplications and scaffolds 6 and 7 were rich in deletions” need to be supported by statistical tests.</p><p>– Finally, the manuscript repeats at several places that there is a strong contrast between the much lower nucleotide diversity in S12 vs non-S12, but a comparable amount of diversity in TE presence/absence. While this is a potentially interesting observation (raising the question of how TE polymorphisms may behave differently from SNPs), again without formal testing it is currently impossible to evaluate the reality of this contrast.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Emergence and diversification of a highly invasive chestnut pathogen lineage across south-eastern Europe&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, the manuscript still suffers from two main shortcomings that need to be addressed, and that are listed below. Please note that we want to see this work published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>– The main concern was the lack of a demographic scenario, possibly confounding the selection analysis. The authors now use the dadi package to calculate the likelihood of three demographic scenarios (stable, bottleneck, expansion) in sets of samples clustered by PCA. However, beside the fact that the Materials and methods and Results are not presented in sufficient details (what exact models were implemented, which parameters do they entail, how were likelihoods compared, what are the values of the ML parameter estimates ?), the demographic reconstruction performs very poorly in the cluster containing the focal European accessions. The reasons for this should at least be discussed (could it be due to the inclusion of a large number of clonal lineages distorting the SFS, in particular S12 ? if so, is there a possibility to remedy this situation ?). This limitation should also be much more clearly acknowledged throughout the manuscript, especially with regard to the selection analysis (Figure 6D).</p><p>– The results are still difficult to follow because each analysis is presented in turn, such that the text goes back and forth between the different geographical scales considered. I strongly recommend to 1) start with “global” analyses to identify the four main clusters, 2) then go for the specific analysis of the European cluster, including evidence for recombination, the challenges in attempting to reconstruct its demographic history, and ensuing selection analysis, and finally 3) provide the detailed focus on the invasive S12 lineage, including the co-ancestry analysis, the evidence for recombination within S12, the specific derived variants, TEs and SV they carry, the attempt to reconstruct its possible invasion route and the retention of mating competence. I think this would improve readability by a lot.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Emergence and diversification of a highly invasive chestnut pathogen lineage across south-eastern Europe&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

One important issue remains though with the demographic analysis:</p><p>– As pointed in the previous decision letter, obtaining strictly identical maximum likelihood values for all three demographic models implemented is quite unexpected. Unfortunately, the manuscript currently lacks essential details to understand why this happened. For instance, how many iterations of the likelihood optimization process were used (i.e. was the &quot;maxiter&quot; parameter in dadi set to a high enough value to reach convergence ?), how many independent replicates were run ? starting from which (different) initial values ? what parameter bounds were specified ? All these important details are essential but they are lacking from the Materials and methods section. Providing a complete table of all parameters used, along with the dadi input file is essential so that readers can reproduce the analysis.</p><p>– I could also not find anywhere in the manuscript how the likelihoods were compared. By a likelihood ratio test ? If so, how were differences in parameter numbers among models taken into account ?</p><p>– It is possible that after performing these additional optimization steps the model still fails to converge simply because the unusual shape of the SFS cannot be explained by demography alone, especially in the first cluster. But even in that case it would be essential to report how this conclusion was reached, and to explicitly mention this fact by stating &quot;lack of convergence&quot; in Figure 2 (rather than the strictly identical likelihood values).</p><p>Finally, the Discussion contains an assertion that is not supported by the results: &quot;…we found evidence of a demographic expansion consistent with the spread to North America…&quot;. In fact, the North-American samples all belong to cluster 1, where the demographic reconstruction is problematic, so this sentence should be rephrased.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56279.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Provide an explicit demographic model</p><p>– The current study follows a previous analysis (Milgroom et al., 2008) that had largely clarified the invasion scenario in this species.

To more accurately assess the impact on the pathogen diversity after the arrival in Europe, we added samples across the global distribution range including from China, South Korea, Japan and the USA (n = 25 add for a total set of genomes in the study of 230). We believe that the US source population is still under-sampled, however the additional samples provide now a more robust framework to estimate the demography of this species and the history of the European colonization. The new samples are now integrated in the first part of the analyses, before focusing specifically on the S12 lineage. Figures and tables were updated accordingly.</p><p>Demographic modelling: We performed demographic modelling as requested to provide a more formal framework to investigate the history of the European invasion. Analyzing the global set of isolates (excluding all but one S12 clonal genotype). Our analyses on the global collection showed signatures of recent population expansions consistent with the spread to the United States and more recently Europe. We could not find a good-enough fit in the narrower group of European/North American isolates, as the observed folded site frequency spectrum (SFS) of the European/North American group is W-shaped, instead of a steadily decline curve (as found in the simulated data). This unusual frequency spectrum likely stems from many quasi-clones from several groups and inbreeding. We show now all demographic model fits in Figure 2.</p><p>The selection analyses in the non-S12 European population has now also been revised to use demography as a baseline thus increasing the confidence that the genomic signatures observed in this analysis are indeed due to selection. Notably, we used simulated populations under constant size, bottleneck, expansion scenarios, to determine a threshold above which signals can confidently be assigned to selection in the <italic>C. parasitica</italic> data set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Finally, the sweep analysis is based on the non-S12 samples only, so it is unclear how sweeps in the recombinant strains relates to the broader issue of adaptation in the invasive lineage.</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed performed the selection analyses on the European population. Our rationale was to identify recent signatures of selection important for the colonization of the European habitats. Performing the selection scans on the clonal set of genotypes of the S12 would not be possible due the very high degree of linkage disequilibrium and extremely low diversity. We have previously performed an analysis on the frequency spectrum of the accumulated mutations and their putative impact. We found low-frequency deleterious mutations segregating in the S12 lineage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Modify general framing of the study</p><p>– The study presents the scenario under the &quot;bridgehead population effect&quot;, but Maynard-Smith et al., 1993, developed a model of epidemic clones, where a successful clone emerges and expands from a recombinant background.

Even after excluding S12 genotypes, the pairwise genetic distances between genotypes are somewhat bimodal with some fairly close genotypes of possible clonal origin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This limitation should also be much more clearly acknowledged throughout the manuscript, especially with regard to the selection analysis (Figure 6D).</p></disp-quote><p>We now state more explicitly the limitation of the demographic reconstruction with regard to the selection analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The results are still difficult to follow because each analysis is presented in turn, such that the text goes back and forth between the different geographical scales considered. I strongly recommend to 1) start with “global” analyses to identify the four main clusters, 2) then go for the specific analysis of the European cluster, including evidence for recombination, the challenges in attempting to reconstruct its demographic history, and ensuing selection analysis, and finally 3) provide the detailed focus on the invasive S12 lineage, including the co-ancestry analysis, the evidence for recombination within S12, the specific derived variants, TEs and SV they carry, the attempt to reconstruct its possible invasion route and the retention of mating competence. I think this would improve readability by a lot.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this suggestion. We have now changed the order of the Results to:</p><p>– Global analyses: Identification of clusters</p><p>– Demographic analyses: for global and European cluster (including challenges for demographic reconstruction)</p><p>– European analyses: phylogenetic network, recombination and selection analyses</p><p>– S12 analyses: Coancestry, TE and SV, variants in S12 and retention of mating competence</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This revision is a lot clearer, and most of our previous comments have been convincingly dealt with. One important issue remains though with the demographic analysis:</p><p>– As pointed in the previous decision letter, obtaining strictly identical maximum likelihood values for all three demographic models implemented is quite unexpected. Unfortunately, the manuscript currently lacks essential details to understand why this happened. For instance, how many iterations of the likelihood optimization process were used (i.e. was the &quot;maxiter&quot; parameter in dadi set to a high enough value to reach convergence ?), how many independent replicates were run ? starting from which (different) initial values ? what parameter bounds were specified ? All these important details are essential but they are lacking from the Materials and methods section. Providing a complete table of all parameters used, along with the dadi input file is essential so that readers can reproduce the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We are now stating more clearly in the Materials and methods section what parameters were used for demographic inference, including the number of iterations, the number of independent replicates and parameter bounds. We have also updated the Supplementary file 2, which now also includes the initial parameters and AIC values for model comparisons. Moreover, data sets and scripts for demographic analyses (including the genetic dataset) can now also be found at: https://github.com/crolllab/datasets (link also added to the Materials and methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I could also not find anywhere in the manuscript how the likelihoods were compared. By a likelihood ratio test ? If so, how were differences in parameter numbers among models taken into account ?</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for this comment. We have now implemented the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for model comparisons. This is now clearly stated in the Materials and methods sections. Moreover, we provide a full list of AIC values for all models in Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is possible that after performing these additional optimization steps the model still fails to converge simply because the unusual shape of the SFS cannot be explained by demography alone, especially in the first cluster. But even in that case it would be essential to report how this conclusion was reached, and to explicitly mention this fact by stating &quot;lack of convergence&quot; in Figure 2 (rather than the strictly identical likelihood values).</p></disp-quote><p>We now state more explicitly that no parameter optimization was reached for the CL1 cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the Discussion contains an assertion that is not supported by the results: &quot;…we found evidence of a demographic expansion consistent with the spread to North America…&quot;. In fact, the North-American samples all belong to cluster 1, where the demographic reconstruction is problematic, so this sentence should be rephrased.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree and have decided to delete the sentence entirely.</p></body></sub-article></article>
