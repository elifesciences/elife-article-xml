We, and others, have previously identified hundreds of genes that change their isoform expression upon T cell activation via alternative splicing; however, how these changes link activation input with functional output remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate how costimulation of T cells through the CD28 receptor impacts alternative splicing in T cells activated through the T cell receptor (TCR, CD3) and find that while CD28 signaling alone has minimal impact on splicing, it enhances the extent of change for up to 20% of TCR-induced alternative splicing events. Interestingly, a set of CD28-enhanced splicing events occur within genes encoding key components of the apoptotic signaling pathway; namely caspase-9, Bax, and Bim. Using both CRISPR-edited cells and antisense oligos to force expression of specific isoforms, we show for all three of these genes that the isoform induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation promotes resistance to apoptosis, and that changes in all three genes together function combinatorially to further promote cell viability. Finally, we show that the JNK signaling pathway, induced downstream of CD3/CD28 costimulation, is required for each of these splicing events, further highlighting their co-regulation. Together, these findings demonstrate that alternative splicing is a key mechanism by which costimulation of CD28 promotes viability of activated T cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lynch</surname><given-names>Kristen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 GM140978</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blake</surname><given-names>Davia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Alternative splicing of multiple apoptotic genes is enhanced by CD28 costimulation to promote cell survival.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alternative splicing is a co-transcriptional process that consists of the regulated inclusion of exonic or intronic regions of the pre-mRNA transcript during RNA processing. In human cells, almost all multi-exon genes express multiple mRNA isoforms as a result of alternative splicing and these isoforms often exhibit differential degradation or translation rates, localization patterns, or even encode for proteins with differing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baralle and Giudice, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braunschweig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ule and Blencowe, 2019</xref>). Consequently, differences in the ratio of isoforms generated by alternative splicing can impact overall cellular activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baralle and Giudice, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ule and Blencowe, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Some of the best characterized examples of how alternative splicing can switch protein activity and cellular function come from the apoptosis signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blake and Lynch, 2021</xref>). Apoptosis is an immunologically silent form of cell death in which cells undergo shrinkage, phosphatidylserine exposure on the extracellular membrane, DNA fragmentation, and cellular blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elmore, 2007</xref>). Triggering of apoptosis by cell-extrinsic factors is initiated by the activation of death receptors on the cell surface, such as Fas (CD95) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guicciardi and Gores, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Strasser et al., 2000</xref>). Notably, skipping of exon 6 of the gene encoding FAS is a commonly observed pattern of alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izquierdo et al., 2005</xref>). This skipping of exon 6 removes the transmembrane domain and results in a soluble form of FAS that is secreted to the extracellular environment and functions as a dominant negative competitor to block FAS ligand-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Alternative splicing also regulates the activity of members of the two major protein families, Caspases and BCL2 proteins, that mediate downstream signaling pathways downstream of FAS leading to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czabotar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin and El-Deiry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McIlwain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Strasser et al., 2000</xref>). Caspases are cysteine proteases, while BCL2 family members are made up of pro- and anti-apoptotic players that work in balance to control mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czabotar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). Upon oligomerization of death receptors, pro-caspase 8 is recruited to the intracellular domain of the death receptor, which promotes its dimerization and cleavage to the active Casp8 form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guicciardi and Gores, 2009</xref>). Activated Casp8 then cleaves and activates downstream effector caspases to induce cell death, as well as cleaving the BCL2 family member, Bid, to produce the cleavage product tBid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). tBid, in turn, promotes intrinsic signaling events that culminate in the breakdown of the mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and the subsequent release of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> through the pore formation of effector BCL2 family proteins, Bax and Bak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ly et al., 2003</xref>). Some BCL2 family proteins like Bim (also called BCL2L11) can promote the Bax and Bak activity, while others, like an isoform of Bcl-x, can inhibit MOMP events. Like FAS, the gene encoding Bcl-x is alternatively spliced to produce two isoforms: Bcl-xS, which promotes the activity of Bax and apoptosis, and a longer isoform, Bcl-xL that inhibits Bax activity and thus is anti-apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevens and Oltean, 2019</xref>). Bax and Bim also have reported alternatively spliced isoforms; however, the functional relevance of these is less well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blake and Lynch, 2021</xref>). Finally, once released from the mitochondria, cytosolic cytochrome <italic>c</italic> activates the enzymatic activity of the initiator caspase-9, through formation of the apoptosome, which then also cleaves the aforementioned effector caspases to promote apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McIlwain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh et al., 2019</xref>). Caspase-9 activity is also regulated by alternative splicing, as skipping of the exons encoding the large catalytic domain of caspase-9 result in a dominant negative form of the protein that inhibits apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seol and Billiar, 1999</xref>). Therefore, regulating the isoform expression of apoptotic molecules such as FAS, Bcl-x, and caspase-9 is a critical mechanism cells use to control their sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli.</p><p>Regulation of apoptosis is particularly critical for the development and function of human T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krammer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhan et al., 2017</xref>). During negative selection in the thymus, self-reactive thymocytes undergo apoptosis to promote tolerance to self (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Penninger and Mak, 1994</xref>). Induction of apoptosis also limits the inflammatory activity of T cells during the contraction phase of immune perturbance, through the mechanism of activation-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krammer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhan et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, sub-optimal induction of the T cells often arrests cells in a state known as anergy, in which cells become unresponsive to further stimuli and subsequently undergo apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fathman and Lineberry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lechner et al., 2001</xref>). Anergy is known to be induced through the stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) in the absence of costimulation of the CD28 receptor. By contrast, when the TCR is normally activated by recognizing foreign peptides presented by an antigen presenting cell (APC), the APC also induces costimulation of CD28, which acts together with TCR engagement to activate a signal transduction cascade to stimulate the T cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fathman and Lineberry, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watts, 2010</xref>). CD28 costimulation enhances the expression of many genes in activated T cells to a level greater than that achieved via engagement of the TCR alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diehn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watts, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Genes regulated by CD28 costimulation include the pro-proliferative and pro-survival cytokine IL2, and the anti-apoptotic isoform Bcl-xL described above. Current models hold that increased expression of IL2 and Bcl-xL is a primary mechanism by which CD28 costimulation prevents anergy and induces survival and proliferation of effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diehn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watts, 2010</xref>). However, the potential contribution of CD28 costimulation to regulate cell survival through alternative splicing has not been explored. More generally, while it is well established that stimulation of T cells leads to extensive changes in alternative splicing, the only study thus far to investigate the specific contribution of CD28 signaling to alternative splicing used microarrays, an older technology not optimized for quantifying splicing, and results were not confirmed by orthogonal assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butte et al., 2012</xref>). One apoptosis-related gene shown to conclusively undergo splicing regulation upon T cell activation is FAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izquierdo et al., 2005</xref>); however, it is unknown if this splicing event is impacted by CD28 costimulation. Therefore, the degree to which CD28 costimulation generally regulates alternative splicing, and the functional contribution of alternative splicing broadly to the control of apoptosis in T cells, both remain largely unknown.</p><p>Here, we investigate the role of CD28 costimulation by high-depth RNA-sequencing in primary CD4+ T cells, stimulated through the TCR with or without CD28. We find that while TCR stimulation alone is sufficient to induce changes in splicing, CD28 costimulation greatly amplifies the extent of this change for 10â20% of splicing events, analogous to the impact of CD28 signaling on gene expression. We further show that CD28 signaling enhances alternative splicing of several Bcl-2 family members and caspases that are critical regulators of apoptosis, and we demonstrate that the splicing events enhanced by CD28 costimulation increase cellular resistance to apoptotic stimuli. Finally, we show that costimulation coordinately regulates the splicing of caspase-9, Bax, and Bim through the JNK signaling pathway and these alternative splicing of these genes cooperatively enhance cell survival. Therefore, we conclude that CD28 costimulation promotes cell survival not only by enhancing the transcriptional program induced by TCR signaling, but also by promoting the expression of anti-apoptotic isoforms via regulated alternative splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Temporal regulation of alternative splicing in primary human CD4+ T cells controls a distinct set of genes than are regulated by expression</title><p>To better understand the breadth and dynamics of alternative splicing changes following T cell activation, we sought to characterize global alternative splicing changes induced at early and late timepoints following T cell stimulation, as well as to determine the impact of CD28 costimulation on splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first isolated primary human CD4+ CD45RO- T cells from three healthy human donors, varying in age and gender, with &gt;90% (CD4+) and &gt;85%(CD45RO) purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-C</xref>). These cells were then stimulated in culture with either anti-CD28, anti-CD3, or anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies for either 8 or 48 hr to analyze early and late alternative splicing changes. Following stimulation, total RNA was isolated from cells and subjected to poly(A) selected RNA-sequencing to a depth of 65 million read per sample, which allows for rigorous quantification of splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Potential variability of T cell activation between human donors was controlled for by the expression of the activation marker, CD69, which is routinely used to measure the robustness of T cell activation, and IL2 expression, which is well characterized to be enhanced by the presence of CD28 costimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diehn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watts, 2010</xref>). Importantly, by flow cytometry, CD69 was consistently upregulated between donors when T cells were stimulated by either CD3 or CD3/CD28 for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, IL2 expression was enhanced to a similar extent in all donors in the context of CD28 costimulation when compared to CD3 stimulation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also carried out differential gene analysis to quantify and confirm that the number of genes that are differentially expressed in our dataset is comparable to the numerous other datasets recently published. Indeed, we are able to detect over 1600 and 2100 genes that are differentially expressed by CD3 and CD3/CD28 conditions at 48 hr of T cell stimulation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D-E</xref>), consistent with other studies demonstrating that CD28 signaling enhances the expression of a subset of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diehn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Watts, 2010</xref>). In addition, we observe clear upregulation of many genes that are described to have increased expression upon T cell activation, like interferon gamma and TNF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Temporal regulation of alternative splicing in primary human CD4+ T cells controls a distinct set of genes than are regulated by expression<bold>.</bold></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experimental set-up for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).

In the MAJIQ analysis the abundance of any given splicing pattern (isoform) relative to the total is quantified as percent spliced isoform (PSI), with changes in isoform abundance between conditions quantified as a deltaPSI or dPSI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). At 8 hr of stimulation, MAJIQ identifies 223, 405, and 423 significant alternative splicing changes (&gt;10% dPSI, &gt;95% probability in at least two of three donors) in the CD28, CD3, and CD3/CD28 stimulation conditions, respectively. Upon 48 hr of stimulation, the number of significant alternative splicing changes increased to 566, 1277, and 1195 alternative splicing changes in the CD28, CD3, and CD3/CD28 stimulation conditions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The usage of a 10% dPSI cut-off to define significant splicing changes is based on previous studies demonstrating this cut-off to identify splicing changes that are highly validated by orthogonal methods and also suggests a meaningful biological phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). We also excluded the possibility that our identified stimulation-induced splicing events were dependent on skewed PSI distributions that exist prior to stimulation as we observe no strong biases of the distribution of unstimulated PSI values for those splicing events that exhibit stimulation-induced changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, we observe an overall high correlation (Pearson &gt;0.5) in the splicing induced by either CD3 or CD3/CD28 across in all donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). By contrast, the splicing changes observed upon stimulation with CD28- alone are much more variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel). To ensure focus on the most robust and reproducible changes, our subsequent studies are restricted to splicing events induced by CD3 or CD3/CD28 that met the threshold criteria (&gt;10% dPSI, &gt;95% probability) in at least two of three donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>) while we have disregarded events induced by CD28 alone for the rest of the analysis due to overall low correlation rates between donors.</p><p>In all cases, the predominant splicing pattern observed upon T cell stimulation was differential inclusion of a cassette exons, as has typically been observed in other studies of signal-induced splicing regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F, G</xref>). Other common patterns of splicing were also observed, such as differential use of alternative 5â and 3â splice sites. Finally, approximately 30% of all splicing changes observed were non-binary/complex events, consistent with other studies using MAJIQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, in line with other global transcriptome studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agosto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shinde et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>), we detect only a minimal overlap between genes regulated by at the level of expression and those regulated by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1I</xref>). Therefore, alternative splicing regulates a unique set of genes upon T cell activation, which have the potential to regulate T cell function independently of effects on transcript abundance.</p><p>Having established a reliable set of splicing changes at individual conditions and timepoints, we next sought to investigate changes in splicing regulation over time by selecting those splicing events that are significant at 48 hr of CD3/CD28 T cell stimulation and plotting the degree of splicing change (dPSI) at 48 hr against the detected amount of change at 8 hr of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1H</xref>). We then categorized the differential trends seen between timepoints, namely: events that are upregulated by 8 hr and return to baseline or beyond by 48 hr (âEarly/Transient Changesâ), events that are upregulated by 8 hr and sustained at 48 hr (âEarly/Sustained Changesâ), and events that are not changing until 48 hr of stimulation (âLate Changesâ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâG</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Interestingly, most events display âLate Changesâ patterns and are enriched for gene ontology (GO) categories that involve RNA metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1J</xref>). The next biggest subset are events that are âEarly/Sustained Changesâ are enriched for GO terms that mostly involve RNA splicing and processing categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1K</xref>). Alternative splicing events that are âEarly/Transientâ are not enriched for any specific GO categories. Therefore, splicing events that exhibit different patterns of behavior between 8 and 48 hr of T cell activation are clearly distinct and may regulate different aspects of T cell biology. We note that overall gene expression follows a similar pattern, in that over 80% of genes that change expression at 48 hr do not show notable increases in expression at earlier (8 hr) timepoints. Interestingly, we identify over 300 genes encoding RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that exhibit differential expression following costimulation, including 60 genes that change rapidly upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It is likely that some, if not many, of these changing RBPs drive the changes in splicing we observe; however, analysis of sequences surrounding the regulated splicing events failed to identify any enriched motifs corresponding to binding sites for the changing RBPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The lack of clear motif enrichment likely reflects a complex network of regulation as discussed below (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CD28 enhances a subset of alternative splicing events upon primary human CD4+ T cell activation</title><p>Beyond temporal differences, we are also interested in the impact of CD28 costimulation on splicing. As discussed above, despite the clear impact of CD28 on transcription, the role of CD28 costimulation on splicing regulation in primary human CD4+ T cells remains largely unstudied. The number of genes in which we observe alternative splicing upon T cell activation is roughly similar with or without CD28 costimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, we find that CD3/CD28- and CD3-induced splicing changes are generally correlative at 8 hr of stimulation (R<sup>2</sup> mostly &gt;0.5), with even greater correlation at 48 hr (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.75) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâD</xref>). These results suggest that there is not a broad requirement for costimulation in splicing regulation during CD3 engagement of T cells. However, to determine if CD28 costimulation might have an impact on a subset of splicing events, we calculated the ratio between the extent of splicing changed induced by CD3/CD28 vs. CD3 alone (CD3/CD28 dPSI/CD3 dPSI) to analyze the effects of costimulation at the individual splicing event level. To prevent CD3-induced splicing events with a very low dPSI (&lt;1%) from skewing the ratio quantification, we normalized all CD3-induced dPSI values of &lt;1% to 1%. Interestingly, at 8 hr, 24% of alternative splicing events have a CD3CD28/CD3 dPSI ratio greater than 2, suggesting that the amount to which these splicing events are regulated is markedly enhanced by CD28 costimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). By 48 hr we observe a smaller effect of costimulation, with only ~7% of alternative splicing events exhibiting a CD3CD28/CD3 dPSI ratio greater than 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We note that alternative splicing events regulated by CD28 costimulation are largely those for which CD3 induces a change in splicing between 1% and 25% dPSI, therefore CD28 signaling produces a robust splicing change primarily for events that exhibit minimal changes with CD3 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We also note that most of the splicing events regulated by costimulation at 8 hr are subsequently downregulated by 48 hr of stimulation (i.e. âEarly/Transientâ), while most of the costimulation-enhanced events observed at 48 hr are âLate Changingâ events and not regulated at 8 hr of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the spectrum of splicing events regulated by CD28 costimulation at 8 and 48 hr following T cell stimulation are distinct from one another, rather than CD28 costimulation simply âspeeding upâ the change in splicing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CD28 enhances a subset of alternative splicing events upon primary human CD4+ T cell activation.</title><p>(<bold>AâB</bold>) Dot plots displaying correlation trends of splicing changes induced by anti-CD3 and anti-CD3CD28 antibodies in stimulated human primary CD4+ CD45RO- T cells in their respective timepoints.

To begin to understand how CD28 costimulation might directly impact splicing, we asked if the expression of any RBPs is induced by CD28. While we donât observe any RBPs whose expression is clearly impacted by CD28 at 8 hr, we identify 49 RBP-encoding genes that are expressed at least twice as highly upon CD28 costimulation than is observed downstream of CD3 engagement alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C, D</xref>). Notably, for at least two of these RBPs with known splicing regulatory activity, SRSF1 and hnRNPA2B1, we observe enrichment of their cognate binding motif around CD28-enhanced alternative splicing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We acknowledge that more RBPs may be regulated by CD28 costimulation through post-transcriptional or post-translational mechanisms. Therefore, further analysis is necessary to determine if unaccounted RBPs could also bind to enriched motif sequences and confer CD28-induced splicing changes. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that CD28 signaling impacts gene expression in activated T cells not only through induced expression but also via direct impact of alternative splicing, and this latter effect is likely driven by increased activity of a subset of splicing regulators, including SRSF1 and hnRNPA2B1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Splicing events enhanced by CD28 costimulation include those in genes involved in controlling apoptosis</title><p>In the case of induced transcription, CD28 costimulation increases the expression of several genes involved in T cell proliferation and effector function, thus providing a mechanistic basis for at least some of the requirement for costimulation to achieve a full T cell immune response. Importantly, we find that genes that exhibit CD28-induced alternative splicing in the analysis above also include genes with critical roles in T cell function. For example, at 8 hr CD28 costimulation increases the production of the full-length isoforms of BPTF, STRADA, and TAB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-C</xref>), all proteins that have the potential for influencing maintenance of T cell numbers and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yin et al., 2012</xref>) or NF-kB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin et al., 2004</xref>).

Notably, out of 14 additional splicing events in known apoptotic genes that were quantified by MAJIQ in our data, the genes Bim, Bax, and caspase-1 displayed the largest splicing changes (&gt;20% dPSI) upon 48 hr of primary CD4+ T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which we confirmed by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâE</xref>). Moreover, in each of these three cases, as for caspase-9, we observe a decreased expression of the longer isoform upon T cell activation and this change is at least somewhat enhanced by CD28 costimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâE</xref>). The splicing event within Bim includes three isoforms, Bim(EL), Bim(L), and Bim(S), that are discriminated by the variable inclusion of intron 2b and exon 3c, which encode the N-terminal region of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Bax splicing involves the decreased inclusion of exon 3 in activated T cells, which encodes the BH3 domain of the protein, necessary for its oligomerization and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Lastly, the splicing event within caspase-1 identified in our MAJIQ analysis represents a novel intron retention event in the 3âUTR region of the transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This change in the 3âUTR correlates with reduced caspase-1 protein expression, suggesting the potential for translation regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). Critically, caspase-9, Bim, Bax, and caspase-1 are not significantly regulated at the level of gene expression upon T cell activation, although other apoptotic-related genes such as FasLG, Fas, and Bcl-x do exhibit increased expression at 48 hr after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boise et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunner et al., 1995</xref>). However, the splicing changes in at least caspase-9 and Bim do result in an increase in the abundance of the smaller protein isoforms while the contribution of splicing changes to regulate protein isoforms of Bax and caspase-1 remain unclear. The differences in the extent of detected protein changes may reflect differences in the kinetics of splicing of caspase-9, Bim, Bax, and caspase-1, in which Bax is the most delayed response following T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Activation-induced alternative splicing of apoptotic genes promotes T cell survival</title><p>Similar to caspase-9, Bim and Bax are well documented to regulate intrinsic signaling events within the apoptosis signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), thus we hypothesized that the splicing of these events all might control cell survival following T cell activation. To test this hypothesis and better understand the phenotypic impact of splicing events in T cells, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to force an increase in the activation-induced (i.e. smaller) isoform of caspase-9, Bim, or Bax within Jurkat T cells, by deleting the corresponding genomic region of one allele of each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Each cell line was incubated with titrating amounts etoposide or camptothecin for 6 hr, with an additional late timepoint of 24 hr. Camptothecin and etoposide are both DNA topoisomerase inhibitors that induce DNA damage and are well characterized to induce apoptosis signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferraro et al., 2000</xref>). Strikingly, the Casp9ÎE3-6(-/+) cell line presented robust resistance to apoptosis induction compared to wildtype cells in the presence of etoposide and camptothecin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).

As a complementary method to specifically confirm inhibition of apoptosis as the mechanism by which the Casp9ÎE3-6(-/+), BimÎE2b-2c(-/+), and BaxÎE3(-/+) cell lines exhibit reduced cell death, we quantified the levels of caspase-3/7 cleavage and MOMP activity in the presence of camptothecin and etoposide inhibitors.

In summary, increased abundance of the shorter isoform of caspase-9, Bim, and Bax increases cell survival upon apoptotic induction with camptothecin and etoposide.</p><p>The above experiments with the modified cell lines test the individual contribution of modulating isoforms of caspase-9, Bax, and Bim on apoptosis; however, upon activation of primary CD4+ T cells, the splicing of all three of these genes occurs in concert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We therefore wanted to ask if the increased abundance of the shorter isoform of caspase-9, Bax, and Bim produce additive effects to regulate cell survival. To this end, we transfected Jurkats with antisense morpholino oligos (AMOs) to block splice sites near caspase-9, Bim, and Bax alternative splicing events. Upon transfection in Jurkats cells, the longer isoform of caspase-9, Bim, Bax, decreased in abundance, as quantified by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The decreased abundance of the longer isoform of caspase-9, Bim, and Bax is reflective of the trend seen upon primary CD4+ T cell activation and in the CRISPR-modified cell lines engineered to express less of the longer isoforms. As a negative control, Jurkats were also transfected with an AMO targeting an alternative exon within MKK7, which we have characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). We also controlled for specificity and off-target effects between AMOs by quantifying splicing of genes that the AMOs are not expected to regulate and observed no significant cross-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Activation-induced alternative splicing of apoptotic genes promotes T cell survival.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Jurkats were individually transfected with antisense morpholino oligos (AMOs) that targeted splicing events within caspase-9, Bim, Bax, and MKK7 (negative control) genes, and rested for 48 hr, then subjected to low-cycle RT-PCR analysis to quantify splicing changes within each gene.

Notably, when Jurkat T cells are transfected with all three AMOs (caspase-9, Bim, Bax) at once, there is a significant decreased fold change (FC) in early dying cells compared to cells individually transfected with caspase-9, Bax, and Bim AMOs. By contrast, cells transfected with 10 nmol of MKK7 AMOs, to reflect the concentrations of AMOs individually transfected into cells, or 30 nmol, which reflects the final concentration of three AMOs transfected together, did not have a significant impact on cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). To further test the model that the enhancement of splicing induced by CD28 is important to reach a threshold for resistance to apoptosis, we repeated the AMO experiment with a lower dose of oligomer to achieve a smaller change (two- threefold smaller dPSI) in splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Strikingly, this reduced change in splicing was insufficient to yield any individual or additive effect on resistance to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>While it is difficult to draw a direct one-to-one comparison between the absolute change in splicing and resistance to apoptosis in primary T cells versus Jurkat cells due to general differences in cell physiology, these data provide strong support for a threshold effect between alternative splicing and apoptosis. Specifically, the CRISPR mutants demonstrate that robust changes in splicing of caspase-9, Bim, and Bax lead to resistance to apoptosis; while the low-dose AMO data demonstrate that individual or small changes in the splicing of caspase-9, Bim, and Bax have little impact on apoptosis. Only once a threshold of splicing change is reached in multiple genes is resistance to apoptosis observed. In sum, we conclude that coordinated and robust removal of critical domains in caspase-9, Bim, and Bax by alternative splicing, as observed upon activation of T cells by CD3 and CD28, is required to achieve a combinatorial enhancement of cell survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>JNK signaling coordinates regulation of caspase-9, Bim, and Bax</title><p>Previous studies in our lab have focused on identifying specific signaling pathways downstream of TCR stimulation that regulate splicing changes within T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heyd and Lynch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, one of these studies demonstrated that Bax alternative splicing in primary CD4+ T cells is dependent on the JNK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, JNK signaling in T cells has been shown to be enhanced by costimulation of CD28, compared to CD3 alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Su et al., 1994</xref>). Thus, the requirement for JNK signaling is consistent with the enhancement of alternative splicing of Bax we observe upon CD28 costimulation. Consistent with the coordinated regulation of alternative splicing of apoptotic genes, we find that JNK activity is also required for the alternative splicing of caspase-9 and Bim upon T cell activation, while inhibition of other kinases have a weaker or more inconsistent effect on splicing of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AâC</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>JNK signaling coordinates regulation of caspase-9, Bim, and Bax.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Primary CD4+ CD45RO- T cells isolated from three human donors were individually incubated with inhibitors for 1 hr and then stimulated with anti-CD3CD28 antibodies for 48 hr.

The abundance of CELF2 does not change appreciably upon stimulation of CD4+ T cells, however PTBP1 mRNA increases threefold upon CD3 or CD3/CD28 stimulation, while the mRNA encoding SRSF5 decreases twofold under these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Moreover, motifs consistent with the binding sites for CELF2 (<named-content content-type="sequence">CCTGCC</named-content>/<named-content content-type="sequence">GCCTGG</named-content>), PTBP1 (CTTCTCC), and SRSF5 (AGGCAGAA) are enriched in or around exons that are enhanced by CD28 costimulation at 48 hr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), which include caspase-9, Bim, and Bax. Therefore, we predict that at least a subset of the splicing regulatory proteins CELF2, PTBP1, and SRSF5 coordinately control apoptotic-related splicing events in T cells. However, as we are not able to deplete these proteins in primary CD4+ T cells, and the Jurkat cell line does not recapitulate activation-induced splicing of the apoptotic genes, additional model systems will need to be developed to fully confirm this prediction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Changes in alternative splicing induced upon T cell stimulation represent a dynamic genetic regulatory process that influences T cell biology and effector responses. Notably, our lab and others have found that approximately 10â15% of alternatively spliced genes undergo isoform abundance changes upon T cell activation. Here, we demonstrate that 10â20% of these changes are further enhanced by CD28 costimulation, with CD28 exhibiting a greater impact on splicing changes induced rapidly after stimulation (8 hr) as compared to later (48 hr). Critically, we show that a subset of splicing events influenced by the presence of CD28 costimulation occur in genes encoding the apoptosis signaling mediators, caspase-9, Bim, and Bax, and the isoforms upregulated by CD28 costimulation within these genes promote T cell survival upon stimulation. Together, these data indicate that CD28 costimulation regulates a network of alternative splicing events within the apoptosis signaling pathway to increase cell survival upon T cell stimulation.</p><p>Our analysis of the temporal and CD28 dependence of alternative splicing regulation downstream of T cell activation mirrors previous findings regarding transcriptional control. Specifically, for both splicing and gene expression, we find a greater extent of changes at later timepoints following activation as opposed to early. At least for splicing, genes which display different patterns of temporal regulation also exhibit differential GO enrichment analysis, suggesting that splicing events are regulated temporally so as to regulate different aspects of T cell biology and effector functions. Moreover, CD28 costimulation largely influences quantitative rather than qualitative changes in transcription and splicing; with the greatest impact in both cases observed at early timepoints following activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diehn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riley et al., 2002</xref>). In other words, CD28 costimulation does not broadly lead to changes in the identity of genes undergoing alternative splicing or transcriptional activation, rather enhances the changes induced by signaling through the TCR, especially early in the time course. This impact of CD28 on gene expression is consistent with the fact that CD28 engagement isnât absolutely required for most signaling pathways downstream of T cell activation, rather enhances the degree to which several signaling pathways are induced. Importantly, however, despite similar patterns of regulation, the overlap of genes significantly regulated by differential expression and genes significantly regulated by splicing display a very minimal overlap. Therefore, splicing and transcription regulate distinct gene populations, a finding which further illustrates the need to specifically study splicing changes in T cells in order to understand the full complement of gene and protein expression changes that accompany and drive immune responses.</p><p>Given that CD28 costimulation regulates T cell survival, cytokine production, and proliferation, we were particularly excited to find that one of the most strongly CD28-induced splicing changes occurs in the apoptotic regulator, caspase-9. In addition, genes encoding several other apoptosis-related proteins, namely Bim, Bax, and Casp1, also exhibited CD28-enhanced splicing. Several studies have demonstrated that death signaling is regulated by changes in isoform expression due to alternative splicing, particularly in Fas/CD95 and Bcl-x in T cells and caspase-9 in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goehe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izquierdo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shultz et al., 2010</xref>). However, the role of alternative splicing of Bim and Bax has not been confirmed, nor has caspase-9 alternative splicing been shown to influence apoptosis in T cells. Moreover, a large caveat of previous studies is that the phenotypic roles of the differential isoforms were experimentally validated through artificial expression systems, despite ample evidence that overexpression of isoforms within apoptosis signaling genes can lead to confounding results. For example, basal versus overexpression of the long isoform of cFLIP, cFLIP(L), correlates with a differential apoptotic phenotype within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsuchiya et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, in this study we sought to test the apoptotic function of the spliced isoforms at basal expression levels and ratios, by using heterozygous CRISPR editing and splice-blocking oligonucleotides.</p><p>Strikingly, these studies reveal that the smaller isoforms of caspase-9, Bim, and Bax, which are upregulated upon T cell stimulation, display an anti-apoptotic phenotype in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). From a mechanistic point of view, the impact of splicing on caspase-9 function we observe is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that removal of the catalytic domain with skipping of exons 3â6 results in a dominant negative form of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goehe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seol and Billiar, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shultz et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, skipping of exon 3 of Bax removes the BH3 domain, which is essential for the homo- and hetero-dimerization of Bax to induce permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diaz et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, the short isoform of Bax cannot promote apoptosis. By contrast, how splicing of Bim leads to protection from apoptosis in T cells is less clear. Indeed, overexpression studies in non-hematopoietic cells has suggested that the smaller isoforms of Bim are more potent inducers of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">OâConnor et al., 1998</xref>). However, given that regulators of apoptosis have been shown to bind to the N-terminus of Bim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luciano et al., 2005</xref>), which is the part of the protein regulated by splicing, we consider it likely that the smaller isoforms of Bim expressed at their endogenous level alter the stoichiometry of interaction between BCL-family members in T cells in a manner that blocks or fails to promote apoptosis.</p><p>Importantly, in addition to the individual contributions of alternative splicing of caspase-9, Bim, and Bax to controlling cell survival, we also find these splicing events work in combination to further enhance the anti-apoptotic phenotype when modulated simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We find that a commonality between these splicing events is the dependency on JNK signaling following costimulation. However, we note that each splicing event is also regulated by other signaling pathways downstream of TCR signaling, and that there is extensive cross-talk between signaling pathways and RBPs in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinez and Lynch, 2013</xref>). Therefore, the full spectrum of events that may play a role in regulating caspase-9, Bim, and Bax AS events needs further elucidation. Since the alternative splicing of caspase-9, Bax, and Bim occur in the same temporal and JNK-dependent manner following costimulation of primary T cells stimulation at 48 hr, we conclude that these splicing events form a network to enhance T cell survival in primary human CD4+ T cells. Moreover, the fact that these splicing events are also all enhanced by the presence of CD28 costimulation demonstrates that CD28 costimulation increases cell survival and prevents anergy, not only through enhanced expression of IL2 and Bcl-xL as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esensten et al., 2016</xref>), but also through synergistic regulation of alternative splicing.</p><p>Given the typical combinatorial nature of splicing regulation, we predict that multiple RBPs and mechanisms likely contribute to the temporal and CD28-enhanced regulation of splicing during the activation of primary CD4+ T cells. Consistent with this prediction, we identified numerous RBPs that exhibit differential expression in a temporal and/or CD28-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Moreover, for a subset of these RBPs we find enriched binding motifs around regulated splicing events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Future studies will be needed to disentangle the complex network of signaling events and RBPs that regulate specific subsets of genes during T cell activation.</p><p>In summary, we identify here differential temporal trends in alternative splicing between early and late T cell activation. In addition, we define a subset of splicing events that are enhanced by CD28 costimulation, including in the genes encoding caspase-9, Bax, Bim, and Casp1, and identify the signaling pathways and RBPs that may coordinate these CD28-enhanced splicing events. Most importantly, our data demonstrate the functional significance of CD28-enhanced splicing changes, as the resulting changes in expression of the apoptosis signaling proteins caspase-9, Bax, and Bim induced by splicing promote T cell survival upon induction of apoptosis signaling, and likely contribute to the CD28-induced survival of primary CD4+ T cells upon T cell activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CASP9</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#842</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BCL2L11</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#10018</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BAX</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#581</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CASP1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#834</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wildetype Jurkat T cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lynch and Weiss, 2000</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JSL1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Clonal population of Jurkat T cells</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Casp9ÎE3-6<break/>(-/+)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line generated by CRISPR/CAS9 system</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BimÎE2b-2c<break/>(-/+)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line generated by CRISPR/CAS9 system</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">and BaxÎE3<break/>(-/+)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line generated by CRISPR/CAS9 system</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pSpCas9(BB)â2A-GFP (PX458)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plasmid #48138</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Construct to transfect cells with Crispr guide RNAs</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary Human CD4+ T cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Human Immunology core at the University of Pennsylvania</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">CD4+ T cells enriched from apheresis product</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-human CD69-PE (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biolegend</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Ediotrs, and the evaluation has been overseen by Douglas Black as the Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.

Using CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from human donors, cells were stimulated with anti-CD28, anti-CD3, and combined anti-CD3/28 antibodies. RNA was then isolated at 2 time points, sequenced, and analyzed for changes in spliced isoform ratios. T Cell Receptor stimulation alone via anti-CD3 is known to induce the anergic state resulting from suboptimal stimulation, while CD28 costimulation with CD3 induces many genes to a higher level of expression similar to stimulation by antigen-presenting cells. Analyzing the splicing responses to these stimuli, the authors find that CD28 costimulation also enhances the splicing changes that accompany T cell activation. A subset of these splicing targets encode apoptotic regulators including Caspase-9, Bax, and Bim. They show that forced expression of the isoforms that are increased by costimulation results in reduced apoptosis in Jurkat cells treated with apoptotic inducers. Using kinase inhibitor treatments they show that <italic>Jnk</italic> kinase activity is required for the splicing changes in the three apoptotic regulators. Apoptotic regulators have long been known to often be expressed in pairs of pro- and anti-apoptotic isoforms. The reviewers all agreed that demonstration of how a program of these splicing changes contributes to immune responses is significant to the understanding of both apoptosis and T cell biology. The results generally support the conclusions, although the extent to which the quantitative changes in splicing induced by CD28 co-stimulation contribute to anergy suppression is not fully clear.</p><p>Most important Issues.</p><p>1. In Figures 5A and D, the splicing changes for Casp9 and Bim appear to be substantially larger than expected for a heterozygous mutation. The longer isoforms coming from a wildtype allele are absent. The authors should assess whether the CRISPR protocol has not inactivated the second alleles in these cells. Ideally, they will be able to isolate additional clones that do express a 50:50 mix of isoforms. Alternatively, they will need to assess how the complete shift to one isoform affects their conclusions â see point 2 below.</p><p>2. Additional concerns come from the magnitude of the splicing changes induced by CD28 costimulation compared to the splicing changes that were induced in individual transcripts by Crispr and antisense oligos. The proposed model is that CD28 co-stimulation prevents anergy not only through enhanced expression of IL2 and BCl<sup>-</sup>xL, but also through synergistic regulation of alternative splicing. However, some alternative splicing events selected as candidate mediators of the biological effects also exhibit some change upon activation of CD3 alone. It is a question of whether the additional splicing changes induced by CD28 costimulation are sufficient to explain the CD28-mediated anergy suppression. For example, Figures 4B-E show examples in which co-stimulation by CD28 vs CD3 alone induces PSI changes of approx. 0.2 vs 0.07 (Caspase 9), 0.2 vs 0.15 (Bim, not statistically significant), 0.13 vs 0.10 (Bax) or 0.35 vs 0.22 (Caspase 1, close to statistical significance). When these events are modulated in Figures 5 and 6 to assess their biological effects, the PSI changes upon CRISPR gene editing or AMO treatment are typically much larger (e.g. 0.4 for Caspase 9, 0.7 for Bim). While it is clear that these alternative splicing events can influence T cell viability, it is less clear that the extra push induced on these splicing changes by CD28 co-stimulation makes a significant contribution to anergy suppression. Given the authors' model, they should consider titrating the AMOs to achieve changes in PSI similar to those observed upon CD28 co-stimulation and verify that they still collectively make a difference in cell viability.</p><p>Additional Points.</p><p>3. The initial analysis in Figure 1D would be strengthened by additional quantitative information about the distribution of alternative splicing changes. This might help explain why the overall numbers of altered splicing events do not change much for CD3/CD28 costimulation compared to CD3 alone. The authors set a threshold of &gt;10% dPSI to be considered a significant event. It would be helpful to know how many of these start at 0-10 PSI prior to stimulation, how many start at 10-20 PSI, 20-30 PSI, etc., and how these binned distributions change between different stimuli. In Figure 1E the overlap between splicing changes across donor samples is rather limited; is the overlap higher if the threshold dPSI values are increased to consider larger numbers of splicing changes? The authors define the value PSI as &quot;percent spliced isoform&quot; but in the figures, it is not always clear which isoform is being measured. The term PSI was originally defined as &quot;percent spliced in&quot; and referred to one exon or segment of mRNA rather than an entire isoform, which might have several sites of alternative splicing. It may be that the analysis tools used by the authors define PSI by isoforms. There are some advantages to this but they need to then define the isoform being measured. It appears that it is usually an exon-included isoform, but is confusing because several of the RNAs being analyzed have multiple splicing events changing and are not just simple exon inclusion events.</p><p>4. Î PSI values after CD3/CD28 costimulation are compared to those after CD3 stimulation alone by taking the ratio. In Figure 2EF, histograms are presented plotting numbers of genes against Î´ PSI ratios. This yields a peak at 1 indicating that most genes show no difference in their splicing change between the two stimuli. Of primary interest are genes showing greater splicing change after CD28 costimulation and these are seen trailing up from the peak to values ranging from 2 to 80 fold. Since the maximum Î´ PSI is 100%, the genes with high fold changes are presumably starting at very low PSI values to get an 80-fold change. It is not clear whether some of these large values are the result of taking the ratio of two very small numbers and are thus not indicative of a major change in PSI. From Figure 2AB, it appears that some are large changes in PSI but it should be made clearer how many changes are like this, perhaps by discussing how Î´ PSI cut-offs affect the observed changes. For example, they might examine the dPSI ratio distributions after separating the splicing events into bins based on the CD3 dPSI.</p><p>5. The authors should provide a list of the RNA binding proteins that are upregulated under various conditions. It is not in the referenced Supplemental Table 2. How were the enriched motifs connected to particular proteins? It appears they could be binding sites for several possible factors, besides the ones proposed. In Figure 2G, there appears to be a typo â do they mean hnRNP A1B2 or A2B1?</p><p>6. In Figure 3 it would be helpful to note the starting PSI value from unstimulated cells for each gene.</p><p>7. Figure 4F: A quantification of the changes in protein levels should be presented.</p><p>8. Figure 6: it is unclear why the AMO directed against the junction of exon 3 with intron 3 in CASP9 should cause skipping of all exons between 3 and 6 and thus lead to splicing between exons 2 and 7. It would be helpful to show an analysis of the patterns of splicing induced by this AMO in the region. More generally, the effects of combining AMOs in panels B and C are described as synergistic. It appears that the effects of combining AMOs with etoposide (panel B) are additive rather than synergistic. The combined AMOs also reduce camptothecin-mediated cell death, but puzzlingly the individual AMOs seem to stimulate the camptothecin effect (in contrast with the CRISPR results from Figure 5). These results need a better description.</p><p>9. In Figure 7, the exons all appear sensitive to <italic>Jnk</italic> inhibition, but their responses to other kinase inhibitors are quite distinct. The argument that they share a common regulatory pathway seems overstated. Given that the kinase inhibitor data are just an initial result and inconclusive, the authors should consider whether these data make a critical contribution to the manuscript or could be left out, pending a more thorough analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80953.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Blake and colleagues examine programs of alternative splicing controlled during T cell activation. Using CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from human donors, cells were stimulated with anti-CD28, anti-CD3, and combined anti-CD3/28 antibodies. RNA was then isolated at 2 time points, sequenced, and analyzed for changes in spliced isoform ratios. T Cell Receptor stimulation alone via anti-CD3 is known to induce the anergic state resulting from suboptimal stimulation, while CD28 costimulation with CD3 induces many genes to a higher level of expression similar to stimulation by antigen-presenting cells. Analyzing the splicing responses to these stimuli, the authors find that CD28 costimulation also enhances the splicing changes that accompany T cell activation. A subset of these splicing targets encode apoptotic regulators including Caspase-9, Bax, and Bim. They show that forced expression of the isoforms that are increased by costimulation results in reduced apoptosis in Jurkat cells treated with apoptotic inducers. Using kinase inhibitor treatments they show that Jnk kinase activity is required for the splicing changes in the three apoptotic regulators. Apoptotic regulators have long been known to often be expressed in pairs of pro- and anti-apoptotic isoforms.

Data from these second clones are shown in a revised Supplemental Figure 6. Although these still donât have a 50:50 mix, the second Bim clone does express more of the long isoforms. Unfortunately, despite multiple attempts and the screening of a large number of clones we have not been able to isolate another CASP9 heterozygous clone, perhaps due to the larger deletion (~10 kb) and repair that is required for this gene editing. As detailed more below we have modified our description of the results and conclusions to clarify that our model is that splicing of these genes form a continuum of isoform expression that contributes to a continuum of survival. Consistent with this combinatorial model we also note that the resistance to survival of the CASP9 heterozygote is greater than that observed with the other clones; indeed almost 100%. Thus, if splicing was this extreme upon CD28 co-stimulation, no further additive effect of Bim and Bax AS would be needed. Finally, while we donât have a clear explanation for why the CASP9 clone expresses so little of the full length isoform, the AMO experiment described below provides an important orthogonal assay to support our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As show in a new Supplemental Figure S9B, we have performed the suggested AMO titration experiment, and find that when the splicing change is reduced ~2-3 fold (similar to the difference in dPSI induced by CD28), we no longer observe any individual or additive impact on apoptosis. This threshold effect is consistent with the competitive nature of the pro- and anti- apoptotic forms of these genes induced by splicing, such that it is the balance of these two activities that can flip a switch to ultimately determine survival versus apoptosis.</p><p>We note that we would not expect a direct one-to-one relationship between the absolute dPSI or change in dPSI and resistance to apoptosis in the primary T cells versus Jurkat cells, due to general differences in cell physiology. Nevertheless, the data from the Jurkat cells provide strong support for (1) a correlation between the extent of alternative splicing and resistance to apoptosis as well as (2) a multiple-hit model in which altering several apoptotic pathway components promotes survival. These conclusions are both consistent with our proposed model that the increase in splicing induced by CD28 costimulation contributes to the overall resistance to apoptosis and anergy that is observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional Points.</p><p>3.

The results of the analysis suggested is now shown in a new Supplemental Figure S3. Importantly, while we see some bias in the starting PSI among changing events at 8 hours, there is no such bias at 48 hours. Therefore, we conclude that neither our analysis nor the biology of the splicing regulation can be explained by skewed PSI distributions that exist prior to stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1E the overlap between splicing changes across donor samples is rather limited; is the overlap higher if the threshold dPSI values are increased to consider larger numbers of splicing changes?</p></disp-quote><p>While we understand the reviewerâs suggestion, we are hesitant to alter our dPSI threshold. Increasing the threshold would further limit the number of splicing changes, and likely reduce the overlap given the variability inherent to human subject. Decreasing the threshold (which we believe is what the reviewer meant) would certainly increase the number of changes and increase the overlap, but from previous studies we know this would also increase the percentage of false positives and decrease the validity of our results. We have now added clarification in the text for our choice of threshold. We also note that biological variability of splicing changes is expected between human donors, in accordance to published literature (e.g. Park et al., Am J Hum Genet 2018, Amoah et al., Genome Res 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors define the value PSI as &quot;percent spliced isoform&quot; but in the figures, it is not always clear which isoform is being measured.
