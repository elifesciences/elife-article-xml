Here, we explore whether a cryptic pocket in the Interferon Inhibitory Domain (IID) of viral protein 35 (VP35) of Zaire ebolavirus aids its ability to bind double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). We use simulations and experiments to study the relationship between cryptic pocket opening and dsRNA binding of the IIDs of two other filoviruses, Reston and Marburg. These homologs have nearly identical structures but block different interferon pathways due to different affinities for blunt ends and backbone of the dsRNA. Simulations and thiol-labeling experiments demonstrate that the homologs have varying probabilities of pocket opening. Subsequent dsRNA-binding assays suggest that closed conformations preferentially bind dsRNA blunt ends while open conformations prefer binding the backbone. Point mutations that modulate pocket opening proteins further confirm this preference. These results demonstrate that the open cryptic pocket has a function, suggesting cryptic pockets are under selective pressure and may be difficult to evolve away to achieve drug resistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cryptic pocket</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>protein dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM152085</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>Gregory R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000152</institution-id><institution>NSF Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2218156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>Gregory R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AI157079</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cruz</surname><given-names>Matthew A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cryptic pocket is critical for one of the VP35 protein's functions and therefore is likely under selective pressure.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cryptic pockets have garnered significant attention, particularly for their potential as drug targets, but it remains unclear whether they play a role in protein function. Cryptic pockets are pockets that are not observed in the experimentally obtained structure of a protein but form due to thermal fluctuations in the native structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowman and Geissler, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knoverek et al., 2019</xref>). They are an interesting class of protein dynamics as they are increasingly being explored as drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horn and Shoichet, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wenthur et al., 2014</xref>). Allosteric modulators that target cryptic pockets provide many advantages over orthosteric drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guarnera and Berezovsky, 2020</xref>). Cryptic pockets can provide a means to target proteins that appear to be undruggable due to a lack of potential binding pockets in experimentally-derived snapshots of the protein, as is often the case with protein-nucleic acid interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meller et al., 2024</xref>). Furthermore, they allow non-competitive regulation, higher specificity due to greater variation of pocket dynamics within protein families than variation in active or functional sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meller et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chio et al., 2015</xref>), and the possibility of enhancing and not just inhibiting function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hart et al., 2017</xref>). However, successfully drugging a cryptic pocket would create a selective pressure for the organism to evolve protein variants that lack the pocket to achieve drug resistance. If cryptic pockets are happenstantial features that have no functional significance, then evolving them away could be trivial. On the other hand, it could be impossible to evolve away a cryptic pocket if the pocket is an inevitable consequence of the protein’s topology. Alternatively, it could be difficult to evolve away from a cryptic pocket if the open state plays a functional role. To explore these possibilities, it would be useful to study the conservation of cryptic pockets across protein variants.</p><p>While there are several examples of functional protein dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fraser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saavedra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher et al., 2022</xref>), studying cryptic pockets and assessing their functional relevance has been challenging. Cryptic pockets have largely been identified serendipitously when inhibitor-bound structures of proteins are solved and show the inhibitor binds in a cryptic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allingham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cimermancic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vajda et al., 2018</xref>). While finding such structures proves the existence of cryptic pockets, it does not provide a facile means to quantify the probability of pocket opening or study the effects of sequence variation on pocket opening in the absence of a ligand. Enhanced sampling simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zimmerman and Bowman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oleinikovas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Limongelli et al., 2010</xref>) and experimental techniques such as room temperature crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraser et al., 2011</xref>), T-jump spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2017</xref>), T-jump crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wolff et al., 2023</xref>), and thiol labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2015</xref>) have been used to study protein dynamics, including cryptic pocket opening, and provide an opportunity to assess the conservation of these structural features.</p><p>Here, we explore the functional significance of a cryptic pocket that we recently discovered in VP35 protein from Zaire ebolavirus, which is the virus that causes the disease commonly known as Ebola. VP35 plays an essential role in filovirus immune evasion by binding dsRNA that is formed during replication of the viral genome to prevent these nucleic acids from being discovered by host innate immune receptors such as RIG-I and MDA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cárdenas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dilley et al., 2017</xref>). The dsRNA binding affinity of the IID is a significant determinant of virulence, making it an appealing therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woolsey et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leung et al., 2010a</xref>). Though a few studies have attempted to find small molecule drugs to target this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Glanzer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2014</xref>), none have resulted in a successful drug discovery campaign. The IID interacts with RNA via flat surfaces that are often difficult to drug, with some going as far as calling these surfaces ‘undruggable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hopkins and Groom, 2002</xref>). We discovered a cryptic pocket in VP35 that allosterically controls dsRNA binding, thereby providing a potential means to target this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>). However, targeting this pocket would be of little utility if the pocket is just happenstance and the virus can easily evolve resistance by acquiring mutations that prevent the pocket from opening without any fitness cost. Therefore, it is important to understand if the cryptic pocket has a functional role that may be under selective pressure and make the evolution of drug resistance more difficult.</p><p>To explore the functional relevance of this cryptic pocket, we used a combination of simulations and experiments to study the relationship between cryptic pocket opening and dsRNA binding in the IIDs of two other filoviruses, Reston ebolavirus (Reston) and Marburg marburgvirus (Marburg). Zaire binds to dsRNA blunt ends, thereby blocking RIG-I binding to the RNA. It can also bind to the backbone to block MDA5 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leung et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edwards et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramanan et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, Marburg binds the backbone but not the blunt ends, thereby blocking MDA5 binding but is unable to block RIG-I binding to shorter blunt-ended RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramanan et al., 2012</xref>). Reston is known to bind both blunt ends and the backbone of the RNA but is a slightly weaker inhibitor of the interferon response than Zaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leung et al., 2010b</xref>). However, it is difficult to explain these differences given that the crystal structures of all three variants are essentially identical in both their RNA-bound and free forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and all three variants have high sequence similarity in residues directly interacting with dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramanan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Crystal structures of the RNA-bound and unbound states of all three VP35 interferon inhibitory domain s (IIDs) are nearly identical.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystal structures of Zaire IID alone (3FKE, brown) and bound to 8 bp dsRNA (3L25, gray) show that both the blunt end and backbone binding poses of Zaire are nearly identical to the unbound (apo) structure.

We first ran 8 μs of simulation of each variant using a goal-oriented adaptive sampling algorithm called FAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zimmerman and Bowman, 2015</xref>) that balances between broad exploration of conformational space and focusing data acquisition on conformations with more open pockets. We then built a Markov State Model (MSM) of each homolog from these simulations and used the centers as seeds for long MD simulations on the Folding@home distributed computing platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Voelz et al., 2023</xref>). We collected a total of 126 and 124 μs of data for Reston and Marburg IIDs. Then we built a new MSM for each variant that incorporates the data from Folding@home. The cryptic pocket observed in Zaire IID occurs as the helix spanning residues 305–309 moves away from the alpha helical domain. Therefore, we characterize pocket opening based on the distance between residues 236 and 306 in Zaire, which corresponds to residues 225 and 295 in Reston and Marburg. For the sake of brevity, unless mentioned otherwise, we will use Reston and Marburg numbering going forward. We thus obtain the probability distribution of the distance between residues 225 and 295 based on the equilibrium probability of each structure in the MSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Simulations predict the probability of pocket opening is lowest in Reston and highest in Marburg.</title><p>Each curve is the probability distribution of the distance between two residues that serves as a proxy for pocket opening.

Furthermore, Marburg opens more widely than the other variants, as judged by reaching larger distances between residues 225 and 295 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> insets). We also performed CARDS analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh and Bowman, 2017</xref>) on the Marburg and Reston IID simulations to compare to the allosteric network obtained for Zaire IID using this analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similar to Zaire IID, we observe a community of residues around the pocket. We also observe that this community is strongly connected to the green and orange communities that contain residues that interact with dsRNA, indicating that the pocket opening could be affecting dsRNA binding in these homologs as well. However, we also note that the strength of communication both within and between these communities differs between the homologs suggesting that pocket opening has varying influence on the dihedrals of the RNA binding residues in the homologs. Furthermore, the differences in pocket opening have an interesting correspondence to the fact that Marburg prefers to bind the dsRNA backbone, while Reston and Zaire bind both blunt ends and the backbone. We, therefore, hypothesized that open pocket conformations preferentially bind the backbone while closed conformations preferentially bind blunt ends.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Thiol labeling experiments confirm Marburg has the highest probability of opening and Reston the lowest</title><p>As a first test of our computational predictions, we used thiol labeling to experimentally measure the probability that the cryptic pocket is open in each IID homolog. In these experiments, we measure the rate of covalent modification of a cysteine in the cryptic pocket, as we have done previously with β-lactamases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knoverek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Porter et al., 2019a</xref>) and Zaire IID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>). In these experiments, 5,5’-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), or DTNB, is added to the protein sample. In the presence of an oxidized (solvent-exposed) thiol group of a cysteine residue, the disulfide bond between the two TNB molecules breaks, and one TNB molecule attaches to the cysteine via a disulfide bond. The free TNB molecule left from this reaction absorbs light at 412 nm. Therefore, when a cysteine buried inside a pocket is exposed to solvent as the pocket opens, we observe an exponential increase in absorbance at a rate that depends on the opening and closing rates of the pocket. We quantify this using the Linderstrøm-Lang model (see Materials and methods). We focus on thiol labeling of cysteine 296 as its solvent exposure is correlated with the extent of pocket opening (as measured by the distance between residue 225 and 295) in our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B and C</xref>), whereas the solvent exposures of other cysteines are not correlated with pocket opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Thiol labeling of C296 confirms that the cryptic pocket in Marburg has the highest probability of being open, while Reston has the lowest probability of opening.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Plots of the distance between residues 225 and 295 vs. the Solvent Accessible Surface Area (SASA) of (<bold>A</bold>) C296 of Reston interferon inhibitory domain (IID), (<bold>B</bold>) C307 of Zaire IID, (<bold>C</bold>) C296 of Marburg IID.

These correspond to probabilities of pocket opening of 0.072, 0.292, and 0.839 for Reston, Zaire, and Marburg, respectively. Therefore, in agreement with our computational prediction, we observe the highest probability of pocket opening in Marburg, followed by Zaire and Reston in that order.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Binding to different length RNAs suggests closed conformations preferentially bind dsRNA blunt ends while open conformations prefer binding the backbone</title><p>To test our prediction that more open homologs prefer the backbone while more closed ones preferentially bind the blunt ends, we used a fluorescence polarization assay to quantify the affinity of the homologs to different length dsRNA substrates, thereby varying the number of backbone binding sites available. Briefly, we use dsRNA labeled with fluorescein on one 5’ end and titrate in varying concentrations of the proteins into a fixed concentration of the RNA (100 nM). Free RNA emits depolarized light upon excitation with polarized light due to its fast rotation, whereas bound RNA emits polarized light. Recording the fluorescence polarization throughout the titration gives us the fraction of RNA bound to the protein. Particularly, we used a short 8 bp RNA to get an accurate measure of binding to the blunt ends and the same 8 bp RNA with a 2-nucleotide overhang on the 3’ ends to get an accurate measure of the binding to the backbone alone. Structural studies on these homologs suggest that the backbone binding mode has a footprint of three nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leung et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leung et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramanan et al., 2012</xref>).

Therefore, we also performed measurements with a longer 25 bp RNA with and without a 2 nucleotide overhang on the 3’ ends to get an accurate measure of any cooperativity in the backbone binding. To accurately account for multiple protein molecules binding to a single molecule of dsRNA, we used a one-dimensional lattice binding model to fit the experimental data (see Materials and methods). This model allows nearest-neighbor cooperativity between all binding modes.

As described above, the equilibrium constants for pocket opening vary over a range of about 80-fold between the three homologs. In contrast, each of the dissociation constants between either open or closed protein and the blunt ends or backbone of dsRNA varies by no more than a factor of about sevenfold between the homologs. We also do not observe large differences in the magnitude of the cooperativity parameters between the homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The interaction between the closed state and the blunt ends of dsRNA is far stronger than the interaction of either the closed state or the open state for the backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). There is also negative cooperativity between two closed structures binding the backbone at adjacent positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As a result, homologs with low probabilities of pocket opening predominantly bind the blunt ends and their binding curves are left-shifted compared to more open homologs. Homologs with a higher probability of pocket opening are less likely to bind the blunt ends, despite the high affinity of the closed state for blunt ends, since the open state is incompatible with blunt end binding. The interaction between the open state and the backbone (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft12">\begin{document}$K_{D,\,backbone}^{open}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) is about two orders of magnitude stronger than that of the closed state (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math><tex-math id="inft13">\begin{document}$K_{D,backbone}^{closed}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) for all three homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). There is also strong positive cooperativity between a protein in the open state binding the backbone alongside either a closed or open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As a result, homologs with high probabilities of pocket opening, like Marburg, predominantly bind the backbone and have right-shifted binding curves compared to more closed variants. Interestingly, most of the proteins that do bind the backbone are in the open state even for homologs where pocket opening is rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). For example, about 80% of the backbone is covered by Reston proteins in the open state even though the equilibrium constant for pocket opening (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft14">\begin{document}$K_{oc}$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) is 0.061±0.008, which corresponds to a probability of cryptic pocket opening of 0.057, the lowest of the three homologs. It is also noteworthy that crystal structures capture the closed state bound to the backbone but not the open state, suggesting that the crystallization conditions may shift the equilibrium in favor of the closed state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Point mutations that alter the probability of pocket opening also induce differential binding to blunt ends versus the backbone</title><p>As a further test of our model, we next sought to identify point mutations that modulate the probability of pocket opening and assess if they have the expected impact on backbone versus blunt end binding. While the sequence of Marburg IID differs significantly from Reston and Zaire IIDs with a sequence identity of 42% and 45%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), the sequences of Reston and Zaire IID are 88% identical and 94% similar. Particularly, substitutions between these homologs are all distal to the RNA-binding interfaces and all the residues known to make contacts with dsRNA from structural studies are identical. Therefore, we reasoned that comparing these two homologs would help us identify minimal substitutions that control pocket opening probability and allow us to study its effect on dsRNA binding with minimal perturbation of other factors. Of these substitutions, one causes an interesting structural difference between Zaire and Reston IIDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leung et al., 2010b</xref>). Residue P280 in Reston IID results in a formation of an alpha helix, where an alanine in the same structural position (A291) in Zaire IID results in a disordered loop. This disordered loop forms a hinge that rotates as the pocket opens, and we reasoned this motion may be inhibited by the structure the proline induces in Reston. Therefore, we hypothesized that mutating the alanine in Zaire IID to a proline would result in a reduced probability of opening the pocket and a stronger preference for binding dsRNA blunt ends. This hypothesis is supported by our past work showing that the substitution A291P in Zaire IID reduces the probability of pocket opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruz et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, we propose that mutating the proline in Reston to an alanine should increase the probability of pocket opening and enhance the binding to the dsRNA backbone.</p><p>As expected, introducing A291P into the Zaire IID leads to a reduced probability of pocket opening in both simulations and thiol labeling experiments, while introducing P280A into the Reston IID leads to an increased probability of pocket opening. FAST simulations performed on these variants indeed showed an increased probability of opening the pocket in Reston IID P280A and a decreased probability in Zaire IID A291P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The pocket also opens more widely in Reston IID P280A than Wild Type (WT) Reston IID. As before, examining the solvent exposure of the cysteines observed in simulation shows that while exposure of C296 (C307 in Zaire) is correlated with pocket opening, that of other cysteines is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We followed this up with the thiol labeling assay and assigned labeling rates to cysteines by labeling point mutations of individual cysteines to serines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observe that both cysteines in Reston IID P280A labeled faster than WT Reston IID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In comparison, both cysteines in Zaire IID A291P labeled slower compared to WT Zaire IID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Fits to the Linderstrøm-Lang model show a 26-fold increase in the equilibrium constant for C296 exposure in Reston IID P280A compared to Reston IID WT and a 36-fold decrease in Zaire IID A291P compared to Zaire IID WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We observed only moderate differences in the stability of Reston IID WT and Reston IID P280A under urea denaturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

This parameter seems to buffer the effect of the increased affinity of the open state to the backbone. This inherent trade-off also suggests that shifting the equilibrium too drastically in favor of the open conformation would not be beneficial for binding to the backbone. Particularly, Reston P280A is more open than WT Reston, but its binding curves for the overhang substrates are right-shifted compared to WT. This suggests that though the open pocket conformations bind better to the backbone, increasing the fraction of open conformation in solution has a negative effect on the overall backbone binding. To understand this, we calculated the fraction of the RNA backbone covered by the open and closed states of the various homologs and mutants for different lengths of RNA based on the binding parameters obtained from the fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We see that in all cases, a much larger proportion of the backbone is covered by the open states than by the closed states. This suggests that while it is necessary to have some ability to open the pocket, increasing the probability of opening has no added benefit for backbone binding. Meanwhile, Zaire A291P is more closed and prefers to bind the blunt ends more than the WT protein. This is reflected by its binding curve for the blunt ended substrates being left-shifted compared to WT. Overall, these results show a strong correspondence between the probability of pocket opening and the relative affinities of the VP35 IID for different binding sites on dsRNA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Single amino acid substitutions that alter the probability of pocket opening also induce differential binding to blunt ends and the backbone.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Binding of Zaire A291P interferon inhibitory domain (IID) (empty black circles), wild-type (WT) IID (solid red triangles), WT Zaire IID (solid black circles), Reston P280A IID (empty red triangles), WT Marburg IID (blue squares) to fluorescently labeled (<bold>A</bold>) 8 bp blunt ended RNA (<bold>B</bold>) 8 bp RNA with two nucleotide overhangs on 3’ ends (<bold>C</bold>) 25 bp blunt ended RNA (<bold>D</bold>) 25 bp RNA with two nucleotide overhangs on 3’ ends.

Specifically, we have shown that VP35 preferentially binds the blunt ends of dsRNA when the cryptic pocket is closed but preferentially binds the backbone when the pocket is open. As a result, variants where the pocket tends to be closed are better at blocking RIG-I from binding dsRNA, whereas VP35 variants that are open more often are better at blocking MDA5. This model explains differences in the RNA binding behaviors of the Zaire, Reston, and Marburg variants of VP35 that were difficult to explain based on crystal structures of the proteins. Moreover, it predicts how point mutations that alter the probability of cryptic pocket opening will alter the relative affinity of a VP35 protein for the backbone versus the blunt ends of dsRNA. More importantly, cryptic pockets are not just happenstance, as they can have a functional role. This finding suggests that cryptic pockets are under selective pressure. As a result, it shouldn’t be trivial for viruses or cells to evolve resistance to drugs that target cryptic pockets by acquiring mutations that prevent pocket opening. Future studies on other proteins will help to establish if these findings are generally true or are limited to a subset of cryptic pockets. In the meantime, efforts to target the cryptic pocket in VP35 are warranted given the evidence that this pocket has a functional role that should prevent Zaire ebolavirus from acquiring mutations that give rise to drug resistance by preventing the pocket from opening.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations and analysis</title><p>Simulations for Reston IID and Marburg IID were initiated from the apoprotein models of PDB 3L2A (Reston IID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leung et al., 2010b</xref>) and 4GHL (Marburg IID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramanan et al., 2012</xref>) and run with Gromacs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Van Der Spoel et al., 2005</xref>) using the amber03 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duan et al., 2003</xref>) and TIP3P explicit solvent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>) at a temperature of 300  K and 1  bar pressure, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hart et al., 2016</xref>).

We analyzed the sum of the residuals squared obtained from these fits across all five variants used in this study to obtain the binding site sizes that produce the best fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This analysis showed that the best fit was obtained for the blunt end and both backbone binding site sizes all being three nucleotides each. Using a threshold of five times the minimum sum of the residuals squared, we note that binding site sizes ranging from one to four nucleotides for the end binding, 3–5 nucleotides for the closed state binding to the backbone, and three to four nucleotides for the open state binding to the end produce comparable fits.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that the major conclusions of the study hold true for varying binding site sizes in this range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>).

This reviewer's expertise lies in biased and unbiased molecular dynamics simulations and structural biology. Hence, while this reviewer can overall understand the results for thiol-labeling and RNA-binding assays, this review will not assess the quality of these biochemical assays and will mainly focus on the modelling results.</p><p>Overall, the authors present important findings to reveal how the intrinsic dynamics of proteins can influence their binding to molecules and, hence, their functions. They have used extensive biased simulations to characterize the opening of a pocket which was not clearly seen in experimental results - at least when the proteins were in their unbound forms. Biochemical assays further validated theoretical results and linked them to RNA binding modes. Thus, with the combination of biochemical assays and state-of-the-art Molecular Dynamics simulations, these results are clearly compelling.</p><p>Beyond the clear qualities of this work, I would like to mention a few points that may help to better contextualize and rationalize the results presented here.</p><p>- First, both the introduction and discussion sections seem relatively condensed. Extending them to, for example, better describe the methodological context and discuss the methodological limitations and potential future developments related to biased simulations may help the reader get a better idea of the significance of this work.</p><p>- The authors presented 3 homologs in this study: IIDs of Reston, Zaire, and Marburg viruses. While Zaire and Reston are relatively similar in terms of sequence (Figure S1). The sequences clearly differ between Marburg and the two other viruses. Can the author indicate a similarity/identity score for each sequence alignment and extend Figure S1 to really compare Marburg sequence with Reston and Zaire? Can they also discuss how these differences may impact the comparison of the three IIDs? This may also help the reader to understand why sometimes the authors compare the three viruses and why sometimes they are focusing only on comparing Zaire and Reston.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for raising this point and we agree that additional details about the sequence comparison provide more context for the choices of substitutions we made. Therefore, we have updated Fig S1 to include a detailed pairwise comparison of all the IID sequences including the percentage sequence similarity and identity. We have also added the following sentences to the results section where we first introduced the substitutions between Zaire and Reston IIDs</p><p>“While the sequence of Marburg IID differs significantly from Reston and Zaire IIDs with a sequence identity of 42% and 45% respectively (Fig S1), the sequences of Reston and Zaire IID are 88% identical and 94% similar. Particularly, substitutions between these homologs are all distal to the RNA-binding interfaces and all the residues known to make contacts with dsRNA from structural studies are identical. Therefore, we reasoned that comparing these two homologs would help us identify minimal substitutions that control pocket opening probability and allow us to study its effect on dsRNA binding with minimal perturbation of other factors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In this work, the authors mentioned the cryptic pocket but only illustrated the opening of this pocket by using a simple distance between residues (Figure 2) and a SASA of one cysteine (Figure 3). In previous work done by the authors (Cruz et al. , Nature Communications, 2022), they better characterized residues involved in RNA binding and forming the cryptic pocket. Thus, would it be possible to better described this cryptic pocket (residues involved, volume, etc ..) and better explain how, structurally speaking, it can affect RNA binding mode (blunt ends vs backbone) ?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need for clarification on the residues involved in RNA binding and pocket opening and the mechanism linking them. We have performed the CARDS analysis on Reston and Marburg IID simulations as we had done on Zaire IID simulations in Cruz et al, 2022. The results are shown in Fig S3 and discussed in the main text in the first results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- As a counter-example, the authors used C315 for SASA calculation and thiol labeling (Figure 3). This cysteine is mainly buried as seen by SASA for Reston and Marburg and thiol labelling (Figure 3 E,G,H). Would it be possible to also get thiol labeling rates for Cystein 264 in Reston and its equivalent to see a case where the residue is solvent exposed?</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown the SASA for C264 from the simulations in Fig S4 and the thiol labeling rates for all 4 cysteines in Reston IID in Fig S6. Comparing these rates to the rates of all 4 cysteines obtained for Zaire IID (Fig 4 in Cruz et Al, 2022), we observe that the rates for C264, which is expected to be exposed are significantly faster than those of C315 which is largely buried in all variants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I strongly support here the will of the authors to share their data by depositing them in an OSF repository. These data help this reviewer to assess some of the results produced by the authors and help to better understand the dynamics of their respective systems. I have just a few comments that need to be addressed regarding these data: o While there are data for WT Reston and Marburg, there is no data for Zaire. Is this because these data correspond to the previous work (Cruz et al. 2022) (in this case, it would be good to make this clear in the main text) or is it an omission? o There is no center.xtc file in the Marburg-MSM directory o There is no protmasses.pdb in the Reston-MSM directory</p><p>- In general, if possible, it would be good to use the same name for each type of file presented in each directory to help a potential user understand a bit more how to use these data.</p><p>- If possible, adding a bit more of metadata and explanations on the OSF webpage would be very beneficial to help find these data. To help in this direction, the authors may have a look to the guidelines presented at the end of this article: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90061">https://elifesciences.org/articles/90061</ext-link></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the omissions from the OSF repository. We have added the missing files and followed a uniform naming convention. We have also added documentation in the metadata section of the OSF repository to help others use the data.</p><p>Indeed, the simulation data used for Zaire IID is available on the OSF repository corresponding to Cruz et al. 2022 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/5pg2a">https://osf.io/5pg2a</ext-link>. We have also clarified this in the data availability section of the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor point:</p><p>In Figure 2, there is a slight bump for the 225-295 distance around 1 nm for Reston. Can the author comment it ? As these results are based on long AS, even if very small, do the authors think this population is significant?</p></disp-quote><p>Comparing the probability distributions obtained from bootstrapping the frames used to calculate the MSM equilibrium probabilities (Revised Fig1), we observe that the bump for the Reston IID distribution is persistent in all bootstraps indicating that it might indeed be significant. This is also consistent with our observation that the cysteine 296 does get fully labeled in our thiol labeling experiments, albeit significantly slowly compared to the other homologs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I recommend that the authors implement moderate revisions prior to the publication of this research article, addressing the identified weaknesses (see below).</p><p>The authors should provide a rationale for their selection of the amber03 force field (Duan et al., JCTC 24, 1999-2012, 2003) for molecular dynamics simulations, particularly given the availability of more recent and optimized versions of the AMBER force fields. These newer force fields may offer improved parameterization for biomolecular systems, potentially enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the simulation results.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose the Amber03 force field because it has performed well in much of our past work, including the original prediction of the cryptic pocket that we study in this manuscript. The results presented in this manuscript also demonstrate the predictive power of Amber03.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, while the authors utilized solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) for cryptic pocket analysis, volume-based approaches may be more suitable for this purpose. Several studies (e.g., Sztain et al. J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2021, 61, 7, 3495-3501) have demonstrated the utility of volume analysis in identifying and characterizing cryptic pockets. The authors could consider incorporating such methodologies to provide a more comprehensive assessment of pocket dynamics.</p><p>The authors propose that the cryptic pocket is not merely a random structural feature but functions as an allosteric regulator of dsRNA binding. To further substantiate this claim, an in-depth analysis of this allosteric effect using for instance network analysis could significantly enhance the study. Such an approach could identify key residues and interaction networks within the protein that mediate the allosteric regulation. This type of mechanistic insight would not only provide a stronger theoretical framework but also offer valuable information for the rational design of therapeutic interventions targeting the cryptic pocket.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need for clarification on the molecular mechanism linking the opening of the cryptic pocket to RNA binding. We have performed the CARDS analysis on Reston and Marburg IID simulations as was done on Zaire IID simulations in Cruz et al, 2022. The results are shown in Fig S3 and discussed in the main text in the first results section. Briefly, we do find a community (blue) comprising the pocket residues in Reston and Marburg IIDs as we did in Zaire. Similarly, we find that many of the RNA binding residues fall into the orange and green communities as in Zaire. However, there are differences in exactly which residues are clustered into which of these two communities. There are also differences in how strongly connected these communities are in the three homologs. Therefore, while we can conclude that pocket residues likely have varying influence on the RNA binding residues in the homologs, it is hard to say exactly what that variation is from this analysis alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>- MD simulations: All simulations were initialised from the 3 crystal structures, is it correct? In all cases, RNA ds was not included in simulations, right? Were crystallographic MG ions in the vicinity of the binding site included? these are known to influence structural dynamics to a large extent.</p></disp-quote><p>All simulations were indeed initialized using only protein atoms from the crystal structures 3FKE, 4GHL, and 3L2A. Therefore, crystallographic Mg ions were not included in the simulations. However, we do agree with the reviewer and think that the effect of parameters such as salt concentration, specifically Mg ions which are known to be important for the stability of dsRNA, on the pocket opening equilibrium merits detailed study in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2: Would it be possible to perform e.g. a block error analysis and show the statistical errors of the distributions?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that showing the statistical variation in the MSM equilibrium probabilities is important for comparing the different distributions. Therefore, we have updated Figs 2 and 5 to show the distributions obtained from MSMs constructed using 100 and 10 random samples of the data respectively to indicate the extent of the statistical variability in the MSM construction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- More detailed structural biology experiments (such as NMR or HDX-MS) could potentially shed more light on the differential behaviour of the three different homologs, providing more evidence for the presence of the cryptic pocket.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that NMR and HDX-MS are powerful means to study dynamics and are actively exploring these approaches for our future work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
