Using mouse brain slice recording and computational modeling of synaptic transmission, we found that substantial glutamate is maintained in the UBC synaptic cleft, sufficient to modify spontaneous firing in OFF UBCs and tonically desensitize AMPARs of ON UBCs. The source of this ambient glutamate was spontaneous, spike-independent exocytosis from the MF terminal, and its level was dependent on activity of glutamate transporters EAAT1–2. Increasing levels of ambient glutamate shifted the polarity of evoked synaptic responses in ON UBCs and altered the phase of responses to in vivo-like synaptic activity.

Glutamate is then cleared within milliseconds from the synaptic cleft by diffusion and the activity of excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). Rapid glutamate removal is essential to maintain brief and reliable transmission. By contrast, unipolar brush cells (UBCs) of the cerebellar cortex transform brief mossy fiber (MF) excitation into a prolonged postsynaptic current due to the persistence of glutamate in the synapse for hundreds of milliseconds after synaptic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>). The unusually long lifetime of glutamate at this synapse may be due to a barrier to diffusion caused by the convoluted dendritic brush (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>), perhaps combined with a relatively low expression of EAATs. Due to these constraints, removal of glutamate is not only slow, but might also be incomplete. If so, the mechanism of synaptic transmission would be quite unique at this synapse, with transmission being mediated by elevations in free glutamate above a significant baseline level, while always maintaining a near equilibrium of transmitter with receptors.</p><p>At some synapses, ambient neurotransmitter can induce tonic currents (also called background or standing currents). For example, cerebellar granule cells have a tonic inhibitory current due to ambient GABA-activating extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaneda et al., 1995</xref>). At other synapses, tonic activation of high-affinity NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sah et al., 1989</xref>) and metabotropic receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandrowski et al., 2003</xref> have been reported. We investigated whether ambient glutamate and tonic currents are a prominent feature of the MF to UBC synapse, given the unusual time course of glutamate signaling that characterizes this synapse.</p><p>This question was of particular interest because tonic glutamate receptor currents could have profound effects on cerebellar activity. UBCs are spontaneously active in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruigrok et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simpson et al., 2005</xref>), and their axons terminate in multiple MFs that likely coordinate the firing of numerous granule cells and their parallel fibers. Thus, in addition to more typical intrinsic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diana et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Russo et al., 2007</xref>), tonic glutamate currents at a single UBC could control the UBCs’ spontaneous firing rate and therefore the activity of downstream neurons.</p><p>Here we report that a physiologically significant level of ambient glutamate is indeed present at the MF to UBC synapse, where it controls spontaneous firing by tonic mGluR2 activation and regulates phasic postsynaptic currents by partially desensitizing AMPA receptors (AMPARs). The source of the ambient glutamate is not action potential-evoked release, but is due to spontaneous vesicle fusion, and its level is regulated by EAATs. Indeed, stimulating the MF to UBC synapse with in vivo-like frequency patterns shows that EAATs control the phase delay of firing between MF input and UBC output that likely coordinates the activity of hundreds of parallel fibers and may play a role in cerebellar learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ambient glutamate is regulated by EAATs</title><p>EAATs play an important role in synaptic transmission by removing glutamate from the synapse after vesicular release. At the MF to granule cell synapse, EAATs limit the exposure to glutamate spillover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiGregorio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Overstreet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2003</xref>). At the same cerebellar glomeruli, MFs release glutamate onto ON UBCs and OFF UBCs, which, respectively, give a net inward and outward current response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>), and EAATs limit the duration of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and reduce AMPAR desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). The outward current results from mGluR2-activated K<sup>+</sup> conductance while inward current results from AMPAR. We tested the hypothesis that EAATs control <italic>ambient</italic> glutamate levels at the MF to UBC synapse by making whole-cell recordings from UBCs in lobe X (nodulus) of mouse cerebellum. ON or OFF UBC subtypes were differentiated by their response to pressure ejection of glutamate (1 mM, puff) via a second pipette or electrical stimulation of presynaptic MFs. In all experiments, GABA<sub>A</sub>, glycine and mGluR1 receptors were blocked (see Materials and methods). In these and some previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>), we did not observe synaptic activation of mGluR1, despite the sensitivity of the cells to agonists of these receptors.</p><p>In the first set of experiments, we reasoned that blockade of EAATs should elevate ambient glutamate, leading to tonic inward or outward currents, depending on the UBC subtype and its complement of receptors. In OFF UBCs, bath application of EAAT inhibitor DL-TBOA (50 µM) caused an outward shift in holding current that was blocked by mGluR2 antagonist LY341495 (1 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), consistent with EAATs limiting ambient glutamate and thus tonic mGluR2 receptor activation. Antagonist application made the holding current inward relative to control, presumably because of a tonic AMPAR-mediated current. In addition to an outward shift in holding current, the mGluR2-mediated outward currents became smaller in the presence of DL-TBOA, suggesting that ambient glutamate activated synaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EAATs prevent glutamate accumulation at rest.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) OFF UBC responding to 50 Hz 10 × 10 V electrical stimulation of white matter every 20 s.

In both sets of experiments, the EC50 value for the EAAT subtype with a lower affinity for the drug was used as the first concentration, in order to fully block high-affinity EAATs while preserving partial activity of the lower affinity EAATs. Then by subsequently increasing the drug concentration the contributions of EAATs with differing affinities for the antagonists could be separated. For example, a low concentration of TFB-TBOA (0.3 µM) blocks EAAT1 and 2 completely, while a higher concentration will additionally block EAAT3 completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shimamoto et al., 2004</xref>). (<bold>A</bold>) Application of 0.3 µM TFB-TBOA, which likely blocks EAAT1 and EAAT2 completely, increased the tonic inward current. Raising the concentration to 2 µM to additionally block EAAT3 had no significant effect on the holding current. Application of GYKI blocked the tonic inward current induced by TFB-TBOA. n = 6. The data are relative to the application of the drug indicated by the arrowheads, with the break in data correcting for the variable time between drug applications. (<bold>B</bold>) Effect of TFB-TBOA on currents evoked by 50 Hz 10 X synaptic stimulation. There was no significant change in the synaptic currents between the two concentrations of TFB-TBOA. The synaptic currents evoked by 50 Hz stimulation were almost entirely outward in both concentrations of TFB-TBOA, relative to the tonic current. This reversal of the direction of the current is due to synaptically released glutamate desensitizing AMPARs that are open at rest due to their activation by ambient glutamate. (<bold>C</bold>) Summary of the effects of low and high concentrations of TFB-TBOA and DL-TBOA. The low concentration of TFB-TBOA that likely blocked EAAT1 and EAAT2 accounted for ~93% of the shift in holding current. Increasing the TFB-TBOA concentration to additionally block EAAT3 did not have a significant effect (p=0.970). (<bold>D</bold>) DL-TBOA will block EAAT2 and 3 completely at 50 µM, but only completely block EAAT1 at a higher concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shimamoto et al., 1998</xref>). Both concentrations of DL-TBOA increased the inward holding current, which suggests that EAAT1 and EAAT2 both contribute to glutamate uptake at this synapse. Application of 50 µM DL-TBOA, which likely blocks EAAT2 and EAAT3 completely, had a large effect on the tonic current. Raising the concentration to 300 µM to additionally block EAAT1 also increased the tonic inward current. The inward current induced by DL-TBOA was carried by AMPARs, as it was blocked by GYKI n = 5. The plots are relative to the application of the drug indicated by the arrowheads. (<bold>E</bold>) Effect of DL-TBOA on currents evoked by 50 Hz 10X synaptic stimulation. (<bold>F</bold>) The low concentration of DL-TBOA which is presumed to block EAAT2 and EAAT3 only accounted for 59% of the total shift in holding current.

DL-TBOA now caused an inward shift in holding current, blocked by the AMPAR antagonist GYKI53655 (GYKI, 50 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). In addition to tonic inward AMPAR current, increased ambient glutamate caused three other effects, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2017</xref>): (1) the steady-state inward current during synaptic stimulation decreased and in many cases shifted outward, as in the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, (2) the slow EPSC, after stimulation lengthened in duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Fi</xref>), and (3) the fast (phasic) EPSC amplitudes were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Fii</xref>).

Trains of glutamate transients were generated using a 3D diffusion equation (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balmer and Trussell, 2021</xref>) and applied to the model AMPARs. This equation was simpler to implement than sums of exponential decays; both approaches could account well for an initial fast decay of transmitter followed by a very slow decay expected from large synaptic spaces. The resulting current was compared to data recorded from UBCs, and parameters of the diffusion equation were then varied until an excellent fit between model and data was obtained for both fast and slow components of the synaptic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This approach revealed that the slow EPSC at the end of the train increased as the glutamate concentration at the receptors fell from &gt;1 mM to the peak of the steady-state dose–response curve (32 µM), and then decayed slowly over hundreds of milliseconds as the concentration gradually decreased below 32 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Importantly, the glutamate transients could not generate currents that fit the data recorded in the absence of EAAT blockers unless we incorporated a low level of ambient glutamate into the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). The error values of the fits (square norm between the fit and the data) were reduced 44.5 ± 24.0% (mean ± SD) by the addition of the ambient glutamate parameter and produced currents that fit the data significantly better (paired t-test, p&lt;0.001). Simulations lacking ambient glutamate consistently showed relatively small slow currents as compared to the experimental records, despite matching the dose–response for exogenous application of glutamate. The model predicts that in order for the characteristic slow EPSC to be produced, not only must glutamate persist at the synapse for hundreds of milliseconds after synaptic release, but a background level of ~5 µM glutamate must be present prior to synaptic stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>).</p><p>Having established a glutamate time course that accounts for control data, we then explored how the time course was changed by DL-TBOA. Synaptic responses were recorded in nine UBCs, before and after application of DL-TBOA. For all data, the model was first fit to control data to establish the glutamate transients predicted with EAATs active. Then, responses in DL-TBOA from these same cells were fit by varying only two parameters, the ambient glutamate concentration and the amount of glutamate released. It should be emphasized that the number of glutamate molecules ‘released’ refers to the number available for diffusion and binding to receptors; EAATs capable of rapidly buffering glutamate will reduce the effective amount of release, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diamond and Jahr, 1997</xref>). For five of the cells, simply increasing ambient glutamate concentration and glutamate released generated simulated AMPAR currents that reproduced the major effects of DL-TBOA in our experiments, including the outward shift of the steady-state current during the stimulation train and a longer duration slow EPSC at the cessation of stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H,I</xref>). For these cases, ambient glutamate was increased 2.4-fold, from 4.7 ± 2.7 µM to 11.2 ± 7.6 µM (mean ± SD) and glutamate molecules released were increased 2.3-fold. In three other cells, increasing maximum conductance (i.e. number of receptors) 1.7 ± 0.5 fold (mean ± SD) was also required to modify the glutamate transient to produce a current that fit the DL-TBOA condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that in some cases, glutamate released does not, under normal conditions, reach all receptors on the cell and that when EAATs are blocked, spillover to additional receptors may occur.</p><p>The model thus predicts that EAATs do not fully remove transmitter from the synapse at rest, but instead reduce ambient transmitter to a low micromolar level. Based on the estimate of 5 µM ambient glutamate, only 54.2% of AMPAR are free of agonist prior to spike-driven release from the MF terminal, with the remainder bound to at least one agonist molecule. Following exocytosis, EAATs restrict the amount of glutamate that reaches AMPARs. When EAATs are blocked, there is a large increase in ambient glutamate and in glutamate available from exocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ambient glutamate causes a tonic outward current in OFF UBCs</title><p>The model predicted that micromolar levels of ambient glutamate persist and shape the synaptic currents in ON UBCs. This persistence of glutamate is surprising given that studies documented only low nanomolar levels at other synapses, due to the efficacy of EAAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Herman and Jahr, 2007</xref>). We therefore tested the model’s prediction by investigating whether ambient glutamate is present at the UBC synapse in the absence of EAAT blockers. For OFF UBCs, where mGluR2 receptors activate outward currents, ambient glutamate would be expected if application of an mGluR2 antagonist shifted the holding current inward. To isolate the mGluR2-mediated current, these experiments were done in the presence of a selective non-competitive antagonist of mGluR1 (JNJ16259685). A commonly used antagonist of mGluR1 (LY367385) was not used, as it was found to additionally act as an agonist of mGluR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a trace recorded from a voltage-clamped OFF UBC; outward deflections are inhibitory responses to MF stimulation. As expected, LY341495 not only blocked the synaptically evoked outward currents, but also shifted the holding current inward, consistent with blockade of a tonic outward current mediated by mGluR2 receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Only OFF UBCs had such a tonic outward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>), despite both UBC subtypes’ expression of the inhibitory mGluR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaarsma et al., 1995</xref>), presumably because ON UBCs have significantly less mGluR2-GIRK-mediated current than OFF UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borges-Merjane and Trussell, 2015</xref>). Current clamp was then used to characterize the effects of tonic outward current on firing activity in OFF UBCs. UBCs are spontaneously active in vivo and in vitro, firing spikes without synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruigrok et al., 2011</xref>), and glutamate released from MF serves to either increase or decrease this spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the presence of the mGluR2 antagonist, the frequency of spontaneous firing increased significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Therefore, ambient glutamate at OFF UBC synapses tonically activates mGluR2 receptors and reduces spontaneous spike rate, presumably lowering transmitter release at UBC axon terminals onto granule cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Small tonic AMPAR currents in ON UBCs caused by ambient glutamate</title><p>We next investigated the effect of ambient glutamate on AMPARs. In the experiment with an ON UBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), bath application of AMPAR antagonist NBQX blocked the evoked inward current and shifted the baseline current outward, consistent with blockade of a tonic inward current. In OFF UBCs, there was no effect of AMPAR antagonists on baseline current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Across the population of ON UBCs, there was a small, but significant effect of the antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). However, the illustrated example was an uncommonly large effect; the tonic AMPAR current was typically just a few picoamperes. This small current may be an underestimate, given that during these relatively long recordings UBCs typically become increasingly leaky, which would oppose the blocking effect of NBQX on a small inward current. However, in current-clamp recordings, the spike rate was not consistently affected by the AMPAR antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E,F</xref>), unlike the case for mGluR2 block in OFF UBCs. It is possible that ambient glutamate at the ON UBC synapse is low compared to OFF UBCs, despite the predictions of the model. Alternatively, however, it may be that micromolar levels of ambient glutamate were present, but did not conduct significant tonic inward current because of partial AMPAR desensitization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>AMPAR desensitization caused by ambient glutamate</title><p>Cyclothiazide (CTZ), an allosteric modulator of AMPARs that inhibits desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Partin et al., 1993</xref>), was used to test whether ambient glutamate leads to tonic AMPAR desensitization. If true, CTZ application would shift the baseline current inward as receptors transition from the desensitized state to the open state. Indeed, in both ON and OFF UBCs, 100 µM CTZ caused a striking inward shift in baseline current that was blocked by NBQX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). The current was larger and noisier during CTZ than control and was blocked NBQX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), consistent with increased channel activity caused by CTZ relieving AMPARs from their desensitized state. CTZ may have presynaptic effects that could induce glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Diamond and Jahr, 1995</xref>). Accordingly, the same experiment was done with cerebellar granule cells, which receive the same MF inputs as UBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balmer and Trussell, 2019</xref>). Despite sharing MF presynaptic input and having similar AMPAR subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kinney et al., 1997</xref>), an effect of CTZ on baseline current was not observed in granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>), and thus the effect of CTZ on UBCs is unlikely to be due to the drug’s effect on the MF terminal.

Indeed, synaptic currents in UBCs were significantly larger after relief of desensitization by CTZ, in some cases strikingly so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). On average, the amplitude of the first EPSC in the train doubled, and the charge evoked by the train increased ninefold, principally due to increase in current between each EPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), and the decay constant of the slow EPSC lengthened from 265 ± 72 ms to 416 ± 110 ms (mean ± SD, paired t-test, p=0.002, n = 6). The broadened EPSCs evoked by a brief stimulation indicates that elevated glutamate persists at the synapse for seconds, but does not typically evoke a current because AMPARs return to their tonic desensitized state. The slow decay in CTZ is consistent with the prolonged time course for recovery from AMPAR desensitization following transmitter release at the UBC synapse, assayed with either paired synaptic stimuli or glutamate uncaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2017</xref>), confirming that glutamate lingers in the synaptic cleft for hundreds of milliseconds.

Spontaneous firing of MFs only rarely occurs in acute slices, so action potential-evoked release of glutamate from the MF input to the UBC can be ruled out as the source of ambient glutamate. To test whether spillover into the UBC brush from other spontaneously active neurons in the slice contributes to the tonic glutamate current, TTX was used to block action potential-evoked transmitter release, with the expectation that this manipulation should then reduce the size of the tonic current. TBOA was first applied to increase the ambient glutamate to enhance sensitivity of the test. These experiments were conducted in the presence of strychnine, SR99531, JNJ16259685, and MK-801 to isolate mGluR2 and AMPAR currents.</p><p>In OFF UBCs, application of 1 µM TTX had no effect on the tonic current, and 1 µm LY341495 blocked an ambient mGluR2 current, similar to its effects in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Thus, the tonic current in OFF UBCs is not dependent of action potential firing. By contrast, in ON UBCs, TTX did block a tonic inward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). However, UBCs have a persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current that could underlie the effect of TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Russo et al., 2007</xref>). GYKI53655 (50 µM) was initially applied to block AMPARs prior to applying TTX in order to test whether TTX had a direct effect on a Na<sup>+</sup> channel conducting a tonic inward current. We found that application of TTX blocked an inward current whose amplitude was the same whether or not GYKI was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>), indicating that the sole effect of TTX was to block a persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current. Moreover, TTX had little effect on glutamate puff-evoked mGluR2 currents in OFF UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) or AMPAR currents in ON UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

What prevents UBCs from sensing nearby MF inputs? In order to address this question, we examined the effect of EAAT blockade on the number of synaptic inputs, as measured by changes in response amplitude following increments in stimulus voltage. A challenge in the experiment is that slow ON or OFF currents are best detected after train stimulation, and at intermediate stimulus voltages, each axon might not be consistently activated during the train. Therefore, single stimuli were delivered after broadening presynaptic action potentials and increasing transmitter release with 1 mM TEA in the bath to block a portion of voltage-gated K-channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2014</xref>). To focus on the response of AMPARs, all other synaptic receptors present in UBCs were blocked and QX314 was added to the pipette solution to prevent postsynaptic spikes.</p><p>Of eight UBCs, seven had only a single, sharp increment in EPSC amplitude upon increase in stimulation intensity, suggesting that most ON UBCs only respond to the glutamate released from a single MF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

After adding DL-TBOA, not only was the response tremendously prolonged, but also the majority of this slow component could be evoked without an accompanying fast EPSC, suggesting that in DL-TBOA, glutamate from a second, more distant MF activates AMPAR on this UBC. Thus, EAATs isolate UBCs from spillover from neighboring MF terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). By extension, it can be inferred that ambient glutamate is both produced and sensed by a given terminal and is restricted to that synaptic region by EAATs.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>EAATs regulate synaptic integration by UBCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of AMPAR-mediated EPSC in 1 mM TEA.

In control conditions (left) glutamate is released from the mossy fiber (MF), detected by the receptors on the UBC, then removed from the synaptic cleft by astrocytes (A). When glutamate transporters are inhibited, not only does ambient glutamate build up (blue background), but glutamate released from neighboring synapses is sensed and integrated as slow rising and slow decaying synaptic currents.

The peak rate of the stimulus was defined as 90°, and the slowest rate was 270°. In control conditions, ON UBCs typically fired both at onset and offset of the stimulus cycle. Because there were two response periods per stimulus cycle, the onset and offset, the sine function fit to the PSTH in control conditions had close to two cycles per stimulus period (1.70 ± 0.29 cycles [mean ± SD]; note the two peaks in the fit to the control PSTH in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). In DL-TBOA, the sine function fit had closer to one cycle per stimulus period (1.10 ± 0.13 cycles), a significant change due to the cell firing during the entire slow stimulation period (paired t-test, p&lt;0.0001, n = 9). Moreover, the peak of the offset response shifted toward the lowest stimulation rate (control: 205.9 ± 15.6° [mean ± SD], DL-TBOA: 282.9 ± 21.5°, paired t-test, p&lt;0.0001, n = 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

However, the anatomical and molecular composition of glomeruli differs among target cells, being particularly suited to glutamate accumulation in UBCs. For example, very slow AMPAR EPSCs are a distinctive feature of UBCs as opposed to other MF targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, we observed the tonic glutamate current in UBCs, but not in granule cells. Even mEPSCs were smaller and slower in UBCs vs granule cells. One possibility is that the ultrastructure of synapses formed between MF terminals and granule cells vs UBCs might underlie the observed physiological differences. Electron microscopy reveals very different ultrastructure of these synaptic contacts. The distance between the release sites and the postsynaptic receptors of UBCs may also be greater than granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diño et al., 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Diño et al., 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu-Friedman and Regehr, 2003</xref>). The location of glial cell processes that position EAATs near synapses must almost certainly differ between the cell types, given their different dendritic morphologies. Finally, diffusion barriers specific to the convolutions of the dendritic brush or to extracellular matrix molecules could slow diffusion and increase ambient glutamate.</p><p>It is surprising that, despite having enormous postsynaptic densities, UBCs have small-amplitude MF-evoked EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mugnaini et al., 1994</xref>). Our data reveal that one reason for small EPSCs is tonic desensitization caused by ambient glutamate. Relieving desensitization with CTZ increased the fast EPSC amplitude more than twofold. Notably, CTZ also causes an increase in the AMPAR-mediated EPSC of granule cells, without causing a tonic inward current and this difference may be due to the UBC having a dendritic structure that is more restrictive to glutamate diffusion than the granule cell dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>MFs as the source of ambient glutamate</title><p>In the cerebellar granular layer, the only glutamatergic axon terminals are MFs (whether extrinsic or ‘intrinsic’ MF terminals of the UBCs themselves). The source of ambient glutamate can be most clearly attributed to MF release in experiments where mEPSCs were detected, as they are clearly the result of vesicles being released directly onto postsynaptic AMPA receptors of the recorded UBC. Exocytic glutamate release from astrocytes remains a possibility, although a controversial one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazargani and Attwell, 2016</xref>). Postsynaptic release of glutamate from the dendrites of UBCs has not been previously described, although the presence synaptic vesicles in UBC dendrites has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mugnaini et al., 1994</xref>), and if functional, could provide an additional minor source of glutamate. It should be noted that in our recordings the postsynaptic cell was dialyzed with a glutamate-free solution, which may limit availability of postsynaptic glutamate for vesicles. For these reasons, we favor the simplest interpretation that MFs are the main source of glutamate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>What concentration of glutamate produces tonic current?</title><p>Glutamate receptors vary in their affinities: mGluRs can be activated by relatively low concentrations of glutamate (low micromolar range) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conn and Pin, 1997</xref>) and AMPARs, which mediate the majority of phasic excitatory transmission in the CNS, require higher concentrations for maximal activation (~32 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raman and Trussell, 1992</xref>). Consistent with their high affinity for glutamate, mGluR2 were tonically activated by ambient glutamate. Indeed, we found that OFF UBCs, whose synaptic responses are dominated by mGluR2 currents, showed tonic inhibition by ambient glutamate.</p><p>By contrast, AMPARs desensitize and therefore contribute less to tonic current. ON UBCs had a ~3 pA AMPAR-mediated tonic current, consistent with a ~5 µM steady-state glutamate concentration predicted by our model. Notably, ON UBCs receive primary vestibular afferents that fire constantly at high rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balmer and Trussell, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldberg and Fernandez, 1971b</xref>). Thus, with a higher level of MF activity, the ambient glutamate concentration may be even higher in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Graded transmission</title><p>Together with previous studies, our current results suggest that the MF to ON UBC synapse operates quite differently from classical glutamatergic synapses with respect to the buildup and removal of glutamate during synaptic transmission. At conventional glutamatergic synapses, exocytosis raises glutamate levels in the cleft rapidly, and this elevated glutamate is quickly removed by diffusion and uptake or buffering by EAATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clements et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diamond and Jahr, 1997</xref>). Thus, the typical postsynaptic cell integrates these extremely brief chemical events to produce stable ongoing responses by generating long-lasting synaptic currents or potentials. As with most synapses, action potentials at presynaptic MF terminals elicit exocytosis and a sharp rise in glutamate at subsynaptic membrane. However, several features of the ON UBC synapse lead to an AMPAR response dictated more by slowly changing levels of transmitter than by postsynaptic integration of brief pulses of glutamate. These features are as follows: (1) persistence of transmitter, (2) receptors not localized immediately beneath the release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zampini et al., 2016</xref>), (3) cleft structure and EAAT localization favoring accumulation of glutamate and its gradual removal, (4) the entry and recovery of AMPARs from desensitization tracks nonlinearly these gradual changes in transmitter. Thus, postsynaptic currents slowly increase and decay in proportion to changes in the frequency of presynaptic spikes in a nonlinear manner that is governed in part by the activity of EAATs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Astrocytes may control the excitability of UBCs by regulating EAATs</title><p>Control of ambient glutamate would be expected to profoundly regulate synaptic transmission. One such control point could be EAATs, which are extremely dense on the processes of astrocytes near synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tzingounis and Wadiche, 2007</xref>). EAAT1–2 contribute to the uptake of glutamate at the UBC synapse, and both are presumed to be expressed by glial cells and not neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothstein et al., 1994</xref>). The MF-UBC synapse is exquisitely sensitive to levels of ambient glutamate dictated by EAAT function. By controlling the density or activity of EAATs, astrocytes could regulate both tonic and phasic glutamate currents at this synapse. Astrocytic regulation of EAATs could be a mechanism by which glial cells influence synaptic transmission that does not require release of a transmitter.</p><p>Our study also highlighted an additional important role of EAATs besides limiting ambient glutamate and controlling decay time of synaptic responses. In the absence of EAAT activity, spillover between nerve terminals was great enough to produce ‘extra’ EPSCs in a given neuron. While each UBC had a primary, fast, and slow EPSC from its innervating mossy terminal, blockade of EAATs resulted in additional slow EPSCs likely from transmitter released from terminals on neighboring UBCs or granule cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These data suggest the possibility that regulation of EAAT expression might alter the effective convergence ratio to each UBC, that is the number of axons producing functional postsynaptic responses for that cell. Such changes could alter multimodal integration of signals in the cerebellum, dependent on the information carried by adjacent nerve terminals.</p><p>It should be noted that the data presented here that demonstrate the influence of ambient glutamate on synaptic integration and spiking activity utilized the ability to experimentally increase ambient glutamate. To further explore the role of ambient glutamate at this synapse, technical advances that would allow the experimental reduction of ambient glutamate are warranted, such as over-expression of glutamate transporters or buffers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Responses of UBCs to vestibular-like synaptic input</title><p>One can predict how UBCs might respond to head movement by examining their firing response to synaptic input that mimics in vivo MF activity.

In contrast, granule cells receiving the same input would be expected to maintain the velocity signal by increasing and decreasing firing along with the changing rate of the input MF.

Recordings were performed from cerebellar lobe X, within 6 hr of preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>During recordings, slices were perfused with recording ACSF using a peristaltic pump (Ismatec) at 2–3 ml/min and maintained at ~34°C with an inline heater (SH-27B, Warner Instruments). All experiments were done in the presence of 5 μM SR-95531 and 0.5 μM strychnine. The recording set up was composed of a Zeiss Axioskop 2 FS Plus microscope with Dodt gradient contrast optics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dodt et al., 2002</xref>), with 10× and 60× (water immersion) Olympus objectives. UBCs were initially identified by soma size or GFP fluorescence, but intracellular recording solution always contained 5 μM Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide sodium salt (Life Technologies). Thus, in whole-cell mode, UBCs were easily identifiable by morphology after dye dialysis. Patch electrodes were pulled with borosilicate glass capillaries (OD 1.2 mm and ID 0.68 mm, World Precision Instruments), with an upright puller (PC10, Narishige).</p><p>For whole-cell recordings, intracellular recording solution contained (mM): 113 K-gluconate, 9 HEPES, 4.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, 14 Tris–phosphocreatine, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.3 Tris–GTP (adjusted to 290 mOsm with sucrose), pH 7.2–7.25. All recordings were corrected for a −10 mV junction potential. For data acquisition, we used a Multiclamp 700B amplifier and pClamp nine software (Molecular Devices). Signals were sampled at 20–50 kHz using a Digidata (1440A, Molecular Devices) analog–digital converter board. Current signals in voltage clamp were acquired with 5–10× gain and low-pass filtered at 10 kHz, with further filtering applied offline. Stimulation artifacts have been removed for clarity. Patch pipette tip resistance was 5–8 MΩ; series resistance was compensated with correction 20–40% and prediction 50–70%, bandwidth 2 kHz. Membrane potential was held constant at −70 mV in voltage-clamp experiments.</p><p>Electrical stimulation was performed using a concentric bipolar electrode (CBBPC75, FHC) placed in the white matter of the sagittal cerebellar slice. Some fraction of synaptic responses may be due to the activation of MF terminals of UBCs’ axons, in addition to the extrinsic MFs that make up the majority of the white matter. Stimuli were evoked using a stimulus isolation unit (Iso Flex, A.M.P.I.) delivering 100–250 μs duration pulses of 0–90 V.

Parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s2sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>) were adjusted to account for the steady-state dose–response curve, rate of decay of the fast initial EPSC in a train, the rate of decline of the amplitude of fast EPSCs during the train, the relative amplitude of the peak fast EPSC vs the peak slow current after the train, and the rise and decay time of the slow current. The key feature yielding a non-monotonic dose–response relationship was the differences in the rates governing entry and exit of D1-2 vs D3-4. Alterations in rates of opening and closing of the different open states could also generate a fall-off in current at high agonist concentrations, but also distorted fast deactivation to an unacceptable degree.</p><p>The AMPAR kinetic model was implemented using NMDL in NEURON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balmer and Trussell, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carnevale and Hines, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hines and Carnevale, 2000</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_005393">SCR_005393</ext-link>). AMPAR conductance (<italic>g</italic>) was calculated from the occupancy of four open states (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s2sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>).

We chose to simply apply a Q10 (temperature coefficient) of 2.4 for all rates in the kinetic model for the following reasons: Multiplication by a single factor that equally affected all transition rates between states of an AMPAR model was sufficient to fit temperature-dependent changes of AMPAR currents at the Calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Postlethwaite et al., 2007</xref>). Association and dissociation rate constants are temperature independent for acetylcholine receptors, which are similar in structure to AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupta and Auerbach, 2011</xref>). By increasing both the binding and unbinding constants by the same value, the association and dissociation rate constants remain unchanged, but the transitions between states are sped. This increased the rise and decay rates of fast synaptic currents and had no effect on the dose–response curves.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Glutamate transient prediction</title><p>Glutamate time courses were generated and used to stimulate the model synapse.

The other variables remained constant: volume fraction (α = 0.21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nicholson and Phillips, 1981</xref>), diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic> = 0.33 cm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nielsen et al., 2004</xref>), and tortuosity (λ = 1.55) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbour and Häusser, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nicholson and Phillips, 1981</xref>). The diffusion profile generated by this equation has a slowly decaying tail that is characteristic of a hyperbolic curve, which in this application approximates the slow exit of glutamate out of the synaptic cleft. Although the equation produced synaptic current models that fit the experimental data well, it remains a rough approximation due to assumptions of a single point of release and single point of detection (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balmer and Trussell, 2021</xref> for model code). Glutamate time courses from individual release events were added linearly to generate trains. No presynaptic depression was assumed. The other parameter of the model that was varied to optimize the fit was the maximal conductance of the AMPARs, which approximates the number of receptors present. The fitting procedure returned an average value for r of 1.23 ± 0.36 μm, which includes receptors located both near sites of exocytosis and also far (and therefore only activated by pooling of transmitter). This result is consistent with the proposal of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zampini et al., 2016</xref> that many receptors at this synapse are activated by glutamate diffusing some distance from sites of release.</p><p>The leak current (baseline) of the experimentally recorded trace was also adjusted to correct for leak channels not implemented in the model that may have been active in the cell, as well as other typical sources of leak that accompany whole-cell recordings. Experimental traces were averaged across 5–10 trials, low-pass filtered (1 kHz), and the stimulation artifacts were blanked. Simulated glutamate transients were optimized by least-square fitting the simulated synaptic current to experimentally isolated AMPAR currents using NEURON’s Praxis package (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_005393">SCR_005393</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by National Institutes of Health (NIH) Grants NS028901, R35NS116798, and DC004450 (PI: LOT); F31 DC012454 and NL Tartar Trust Fellowship (PI: CBM); F32 DC014878, K99 DC016905, and Hearing Health Foundation Emerging Research Grant (PI: TSB); and P30 DC005983 (PI: Gillespie, Peter).

evidence that a physiologically significant level of ambient glutamate is present at a synapse in the cerebellum, where it controls spontaneous firing and regulates phasic postsynaptic currents. The ambient glutamate is the result of spontaneous vesicle fusion and not action potential-evoked release. These synapses are virtually always exposed to a significant level of glutamate unlike classical fast synapses, which has a powerful impact on neuronal firing patterns. This regulatory mechanism endows these synapses with unique functional properties.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Incomplete removal of extracellular glutamate controls synaptic transmission and integration at a cerebellar synapse&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alain Marty (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>In the current study Balmer et al. showed that ambient glutamate in the synaptic cleft tonically activates ionotropic and metabotropic receptors in UBC cells in the cerebellum. This is quite different from the typical glutamatergic synapse where synaptic responses rapidly rise and fall. Ambient glutamate responses described in the current manuscript exist in the absence of action potentials in the presynaptic neurons and result from spontaneous vesicular glutamate release. The level of ambient glutamate, which is set by glutamate transporters in the synaptic cleft, endows the neurons with a complex signalling mechanism via the regulation of the length and polarity of postsynaptic responses. The observed change in postsynaptic currents is much slower than changes in the frequency of presynaptic spikes. The authors illustrate the functional complexity of this synaptic reposes by showing that ambient glutamate can shift the phase of responsiveness of UBC cells to periodic stimulation.</p><p>As you will see in the detailed reviews below, all three reviewers were unanimous to praise the rigorous experimental design and the high quality of the experimental data. The authors' conclusions are solidly built on their findings and fully supported by the data presented. While there is general enthusiasm for this study, the modelling data presented on Figure 2. was identified as the weakest point of the manuscript. Reviewers raised several critical points related to model. They also find that this is not a critical element of the study and suggest that the authors either move this figure to a supplementary figure or remove it completely.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Balmer et al. investigates the effect of extracellularly accumulating glutamate at MF-UBC synapses in the cerebellum. The authors found that glutamate accumulating in the synaptic cleft influenced the spontaneous firing rate of OFF cells and desensitized AMPA receptors in ON cells. They identified the source of ambient glutamate as spontaneous, AP-independent release from MF terminals. mGluR2-medated tonic current was present in OFF cells, and tonic desensitization of AMPA currents was observed in ON cells.</p><p>The study investigates differences in ON and OFF cells and identifies dominant glutamate mediated tonic currents in both groups suggesting the presence of ambient glutamate at these synapses. The authors also show that these tonic currents could alter firing properties and hence could significantly impact downstream network function.</p><p>The study offers novel insights into the presence of tonic currents in UBCs mediated by ambient glutamate. This is an important component of the functional landscape shaping firing patterns in this network. The study is carefully planned and executed.</p><p>The focus of the study is the presence and role of tonic currents that are mediated by ambient glutamate that is the result of AP-independent release. There is an inherent logical difficulty here since the presence of these tonic currents have been convincingly demonstrated, but the “ideal” experiments investigating the role of these currents (i.e. isolating and selectively removing tonic currents) in synaptic integration and spiking is technically very difficult. The authors use the TBOA experiments in their functional experiments, but these experiments will only allow them to draw conclusions about the role of EAATs in signal integration without having direct insights into the role of ambient glutamate in the cleft. This disconnect is expected, but the manuscript could be improved to make this issue clearer to the reader.</p><p>The study is a logical continuation of the authors previous papers (Balmer et al., 2017 and Borges-Merjane and Trussel, 2015). This means that there is some unavoidable overlap between the experiments even if the focus is quite distinct here. The Discussion could benefit from a more in-depth investigation of how the current and previous findings combine at the functional level. For example, it would be interesting to see a detailed discussion on the relationship between the CTZ experiments presented here on Figure 4 and uncaging experiments on Figure 3 of Balmer et al.</p><p>The authors suggest that the most likely source of glutamate driving the tonic currents is from MF terminals. The authors should elaborate on the level of certainty they have in this and outline the alternatives.</p><p>UBCs terminate not only on granule cells but also on other UBCs, potentially forming a chain of interconnected UBCs (Dorp and De Zeeux, 2015). Could the synaptic inputs investigated by the authors be disynaptic?</p><p>Figure 3A shows an extreme example, the average tonic AMPA current is ~3pA and this small current is explained by AMPA-R desensitization. One of the authors' point in the Discussion is about how desensitization leads to a smaller tonic current. May be a more typical example in Figure 3A would better illustrate the main findings.</p><p>Figure 8 is focused on ON cells. In these cells tonic currents seems to be rather small due to AMPA-R desensitization, while the mGluR2-medated tonic outward current in OFF cells is larger. What happens in OFF cells?</p><p>Figure 8 The firing of the neuron is a result of interactions between synaptic and intrinsic conductance. Blockade of EAATs with TBOA (and therefore increase in ambient glutamate) affects both a tonic current and the evoked synaptic current. Can the authors tease apart these two effects? In presence of TBOA, the baseline firing of the neuron in absence of synaptic stimulation is increased due to augmented inward tonic current. First, it would be important to know how the baseline membrane potential was adjusted (or were recordings performed at resting Vm?). Second, how much did the baseline firing change after TBOA application, due to the increased tonic inward current? Third, and most importantly, the authors should test whether artificially increasing the baseline firing of the neuron through somatic current injection (and recapitulating the effects of TBOA on basal firing rates) can mimic the effect of TBOA on the firing rate during the synaptic stimulation protocol. Overall, this would provide reassurance that all effects can be attributed to EAATs blockade as the authors suggest.</p><p>Figure 6F, right panel: the NBQX trace is almost completely hides the control trace. Perhaps use the same indicators [(1) control, (2) CTZ, (3) NBQX] as on the left panel.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In recent years the Trussell group has produced several interesting papers examining the mechanisms of synaptic transmission in MF-UBC synapses. In the present work, it is shown that under basal conditions, there is enough ambiant glutamate to significantly activate ionotropic and metabotropic receptors at these synapses. Furthermore, the authors convincingly show that the basal glutamate is provided by the continuous supply linked to spontaneous vesicular release from resting MF terminals. Finally, in a spectacular final figure, the authors present intriguing data suggesting that ambient glutamate may shift the phase of responsiveness of the UBC cells to periodic stimulation. This leads to the very interesting suggestion that the UBC to GC relay may shift the phase of the incoming cerebellar sensory input in a flexible manner.</p><p>The design and execution of the experiments are excellent, and the conclusions of the paper are both novel and justified.</p><p>My only substantial criticism concerns the treatment of glutamate diffusion in the glomerulus. In both Introduction and Discussion, the authors say that glutamate escape out of the glomerulus may occur slowly, on a time scale of 100s of ms. But their actual diffusion model, that is used in the Results section, does not incorporate a separate, slow phase representing glutamate exit out of the glomerulus. Rather, it treats glutamate diffusion as a single process that is homogeneous in space, with global slowing factors reflecting volume fraction and tortuosity. This results in an apparent contradiction that should somehow be addressed, at least with a caveat sentence when presenting the diffusion model, saying that this model is only a rough approximation.</p><p>I have listed below specific suggestions that should be taken into consideration when revising the manuscript.</p><p>1) Glutamate diffusion model:</p><p>Whereas the AMPAR activation is modelled in detail (Figure 2A), the diffusion of glutamate is described by a highly simplified model (diffusion equation). This model does not attempt to incorporate the complicated MF terminal geometry, which is understandable. However, it may be oversimplified, as all glutamate sources are considered equivalent, and the diffusion process is homogeneous in space.</p><p>Incorporating crevices in the model, as was done by Nielsen et al. (2004), results in the prediction of two phases of glutamate concentration decay, with a slow phase reflecting glutamate escape once the glutamate concentration has equilibrated within the glomerulus. A biphasic glutamate decay model was likewise developed by Barbour et al. (1994) at PF-PC synapses. Such a biphasic decay could help interpreting the time course of mEPSCs. Specifically, it is possible that the slow time constant of mEPSC decay could reflect a slow component of glutamate concentration decay (escape out of the glomerulus), rather than a low value for channel resensitization rates, as it presently appears from Supplemental Table 1.</p><p>The possibility of a slow glutamate escape would give a likely mechanistic interpretation for the finding of a significant basal glutamate concentration inside the synaptic cleft. By contrast, this conclusion of the paper is presumably difficult to reconcile with the monotonic glutamate decay assumed, given the scarcity of recorded mEPSCs.</p><p>Again, I do not suggest developing a realistic diffusion model based on glomerulus morphology: this would be a huge task that would require the introduction of many geometric parameters that are presently unknown. But the authors should acknowledge in their modelling section the possibility that glutamate concentration decay could be biphasic, and that this could be an explanation for the slow phase of mEPSC decay.</p><p>2) mGluR1 activation by basal glutamate?</p><p>When reading the section on effects of basal glutamate in ON UBCs, the question arises as to whether mGluR1s would be activated in addition to AMPARs. Was this examined? Even if the results were negative, it would be good to mention them for completeness.</p><p>3) Figure 6:</p><p>This figure has two parts: panels A-E describe mEPSCs in UBCs, and F-H describe combined bafilomycin/CTZ suggesting that the source of ambient glutamate is vesicular. It is the second part which is most directly relevant to the paper. While describing mEPSCs is valuable -and may yield important clues on glutamate diffusion, see above-, the fact that mEPSCs are present in these cells does not represent a surprise. In view of the above the authors should consider keeping only parts F-H as main text figure, and downgrading parts A-E as an additional supplementary figure.</p><p>4) Model of Figure 8:</p><p>In the analysis of Figure 8E-F, the control response is modelled as a second harmonic of the MF spike modulation, while the response in TBOA is modelled as a first harmonic. But looking at the data in D-E, it appears that modelling the control response as a second harmonic is rather arbitrary. The amplitude of the second wave is much smaller than that of the first one, indicating that the true period remains the driving period. Looking at the raw data in D, it appears that the black spikes are roughly synchronized with the driving signal, except for a small delay, whereas the red spikes are almost opposite in phase with respect to the driving signal. This interpretation could be conveyed by performing a first harmonic fit to the black data as well as to the red data in E. Fitting the black histogram in E with a first harmonic would considerably simplify the presentation of the next panel (F). Presently panel F is almost impossible to understand. It is unclear what the radius in F represents (probably the firing rate for the second harmonic was doubled; but this is hard to justify). It is also unclear how the arc circles joining black and red dots were obtained. And it is unclear why the phase chosen for the black dots corresponds to the second peak in E rather than to the first one.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study shows how glutamate transporters limit activation of glutamate receptors at ON and OFF UBCs. The experiments show quite convincingly that glutamate transporters regulate ambient glutamate levels and synaptic glutamate diffusion dynamics. ON and OFF UBCs serve as controls for each other in various experiments, enabling the authors to distinguish effects on ambient and evoked transmitter levels. Further experiments show that ambient glutamate is due to spontaneous vesicle release and that transporters influence physiologically relevant UBC signaling. The experiments appear rigorously performed and are clearly presented. My primary concern is with the kinetic model used to estimate the glutamate concentration.</p><p>The authors estimate the glutamate concentration time course using a kinetic model of AMPA receptors. The experimental bases for model parameters are not described thoroughly and raise many questions. The authors note that parameters were tuned to match whole-cell responses recorded from dissociated UBCs (Lu, et al., 2014), experiments in which glutamate was applied to the whole cell with relatively slow exchange times (estimated by the authors to be 50 ms). These methods are likely inadequate to constrain many of the parameters in the model. As just one example, the authors determine that the glutamate binding rate at room temperature to a single binding site is 2×108 s<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, which is certainly within theoretical diffusion limits but, as far as I know, is 10 times faster than any previous estimates and cannot be derived reliably from the cited whole-cell data. This is likely to be an important issue, because a higher binding rate would confer higher sensitivity in non-equilibrium conditions. I do not suggest that the authors undertake an entire kinetic analysis of UBC AMPA receptors, but I would ask that they add more detail supporting the rate constants and how much the model's behavior (beyond the non-monotonic dose-response) relies on specific values. I would also suggest that the model constitutes the weakest part of the paper and distracts somewhat from an otherwise pleasing flow of nice physiological experiments. I would suggest that the model is not necessary and, if retained, might function better as a discussion point at the end.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63819.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As you will see in the detailed reviews below, all three reviewers were unanimous to praise the rigorous experimental design and the high quality of the experimental data.

Where disynaptic responses were apparent, they were characterized by longer delays and jitter in the onset of the fast AMPA EPSC. If the stimulus electrode in the white matter was activating UBC soma, the trains of responses would almost certainly trigger spike bursts, and therefore bursts of EPSCs. One possibility is that the electrode stimulated UBC axons that had been severed from their soma, but these are not so likely to populate the white matter containing cerebellar input fibers.

These two are manifestations of a single effect, which is activation of the receptors by accumulated glutamate. Thus, they are not separable.

For AMPAR, activation and desensitization.</p><p>“…know how the baseline membrane potential was adjusted”. We added a sentence to Materials and methods to indicate that bias current was applied to keep the resting membrane potential constant. Small currents, on the order of 20 pA would be sufficient to lead to depolarization block.

The excellence of the fits across diverse time scales (ms to seconds), we believe, is supportive of the parameters of the kinetic model.</p></body></sub-article></article>
