‘homeostatic synaptic plasticity’. We previously showed that a presynaptic protein, the small GTPase <italic>Rab3a</italic>, is required for full expression of the increase in miniature endplate current amplitudes following prolonged blockade of action potential activity at the mouse neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in vivo, where an increase in postsynaptic receptors does not contribute. It is unknown whether this form of <italic>Rab3a</italic>-dependent homeostatic plasticity at the NMJ shares any characteristics with central synapses. We show here that homeostatic synaptic plasticity of mEPSCs is impaired in mouse cortical neuron cultures prepared from <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and mutant mice expressing a single-point mutation of <italic>Rab3a</italic>, <italic>Rab3a Earlybird</italic> mice. To determine if <italic>Rab3a</italic> is involved in the well-established homeostatic increase in postsynaptic AMPA-type receptors (AMPARs), we performed a series of experiments in which electrophysiological recordings of mEPSCs and confocal imaging of synaptic AMPAR immunofluorescence were assessed within the same cultures. We found that the increase in postsynaptic AMPAR levels in wild-type cultures was more variable than that of mEPSC amplitudes, which might be explained by a presynaptic contribution, but we cannot rule out variability in the measurement. Finally, we demonstrate that <italic>Rab3a</italic> is acting in neurons because only selective loss of <italic>Rab3a</italic> in neurons, not glia, disrupted the homeostatic increase in mEPSC amplitudes. This is the first demonstration that a protein thought to function presynaptically is required for homeostatic synaptic plasticity of quantal size in central neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homeostatic synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>synaptic scaling</kwd><kwd>mEPSCs</kwd><kwd>Rab3a</kwd><kwd>AMPA receptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01s5ya894</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01NS057228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engisch</surname><given-names>Kathrin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first demonstration that a protein thought to function presynaptically (<italic>Rab3a</italic>) is required for homeostatic, activity-dependent synaptic plasticity of quantal size in central neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most studied phenomena triggered by prolonged activity blockade is the increase in amplitudes of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in neurons. First demonstrated in cultures of dissociated cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>) and spinal cord neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O’Brien et al., 1998</xref>), the compensatory response to prolonged loss of activity has been dubbed ‘homeostatic synaptic plasticity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pozo and Goda, 2010</xref>). These first two studies provided evidence that glutamate receptors were also increased after prolonged inactivity, via an increased response to exogenously applied glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>) and increased immunofluorescent labeling of GluA1 receptors at synaptic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O’Brien et al., 1998</xref>). The increase in synaptic AMPA receptors after activity blockade has been confirmed with immunofluorescence in multiple studies of hippocampal and cortical cultures treated with TTX, including (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wierenga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jakawich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tatavarty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xu and Pozzo-Miller, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubes et al., 2022</xref>). It is now well accepted that the homeostatic increase in mEPSC amplitudes in neurons is due to an increase in postsynaptic AMPA receptors.</p><p>In our previous work, we found that a TTX cuff applied for 48 hr around the sciatic nerve in mice led to an increase in the amplitude of the miniature endplate currents (mEPCs) recorded in tibialis anterior muscles. Surprisingly, and unlike at central synapses, we could find no evidence that the acetylcholine receptor levels at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) were increased in the TTX-cuff treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). This result led us to search for presynaptic molecules that might homeostatically regulate the presynaptic quantum. In previous studies in chromaffin cells, we identified the small GTPase <italic>Rab3a</italic>, a presynaptic vesicle protein, as a regulator of synaptic vesicle fusion pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), so we examined whether deletion of <italic>Rab3a</italic> (<italic>Rab3a<sup>−/−</sup></italic>) might prevent homeostatic upregulation of mEPC amplitude at the NMJ. The results were clear: the homeostatic increase in mEPC amplitude induced by the TTX cuff was strongly reduced in the <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse and was completely abolished in the <italic>Earlybird</italic> mutant (<italic>Rab3a<sup>Ebd/Ebd</sup></italic>), which has a single-point mutation in <italic>Rab3a</italic> that causes a shift toward early awakening due to a shorter circadian period, that is more dramatic than that of the <italic>Rab3a</italic> deletion mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kapfhamer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). These results led us to conclude that the homeostatic increase in mEPC amplitude at the NMJ is a presynaptic phenomenon.</p><p>It has remained somewhat of a mystery what the role of <italic>Rab3a</italic> is in synaptic transmission. The <italic>Rab3a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse has minimal phenotypic abnormalities, with evoked synaptic transmission and mEPSCs essentially normal in hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>). At the <italic>Rab3a<sup>−/−</sup></italic> NMJ, reductions in evoked transmission were detected, but only under conditions of reduced extracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coleman et al., 2007</xref>). There are some modest changes in short-term plasticity during repetitive stimulus trains, with increased depression observed in response to moderate frequencies in hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Geppert et al., 1994</xref>) and at the mammalian NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coleman and Bykhovskaia, 2009</xref>), but increased facilitation in response to high frequency stimulation at the mammalian NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coleman and Bykhovskaia, 2010</xref>). The most dramatic effect of loss of <italic>Rab3a</italic> is the abolishment of a presynaptic form of long-term potentiation at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse that is induced by 25 Hz stimulation in the presence of NMDA blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weisskopf et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castillo et al., 1997</xref>). Our result that prolonged inactivity-induced plasticity of mEPC amplitude at the mammalian NMJ is disrupted with loss of function of <italic>Rab3a</italic> further cements a role for <italic>Rab3a</italic> in activity-dependent plasticity of synaptic strength. However, a crucial question that remains is whether the TTX-cuff induced effect on the amplitude of the spontaneous synaptic current at the NMJ shares underlying mechanisms with central synapses. We set out to answer this question for the more well-studied phenomenon of homeostatic plasticity of mEPSCs in dissociated mouse cortical neurons prepared from wild-type, <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and <italic>Rab3a<sup>Ebd/Ebd</sup></italic> mice treated with TTX for 48 hr. We show here that homeostatic synaptic plasticity of mEPSC amplitude was strongly reduced in cultures from <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and completely abolished in cultures from <italic>Rab3a<sup>Ebd/Ebd</sup></italic> mice, supporting a shared mechanism with the NMJ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We previously reported that mixed cultures of cortical neurons and glia prepared from postnatal day 0 to 2 mouse pups responded to a block of action potential-mediated activity by a 48-hr TTX treatment with an increase in mEPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanes et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we asked the question whether cortical cultures prepared from mice lacking the small GTPase <italic>Rab3a</italic> or expressing a point mutation of <italic>Rab3a</italic>, <italic>Rab3a</italic> Earlybird, have an altered homeostatic plasticity response to a prolonged loss of network activity. The <italic>Rab3a</italic> Earlybird mutation was discovered in a mutagenesis screen in mice for genes involved in the rest–activity cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kapfhamer et al., 2002</xref>). In that study, the authors concluded that the Earlybird mutation was likely dominant-negative, as the shift in circadian period was substantially more dramatic than that observed in the <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. As described in the Introduction, the effects of loss of <italic>Rab3a</italic> have been modest, so we included experiments using the <italic>Rab3a</italic> Earlybird mutant mice to see if there would be a more robust phenotype, and in doing so, strengthen our conclusions based on the <italic>Rab3a</italic> deletion mice. To obtain <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Rab3a<sup>Ebd/Ebd</sup></italic> homozygotes, we established two mouse colonies of heterozygous breeders with cultures prepared from pups derived from a final breeding pair of homozygotes. Although we backcrossed <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> with <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/</sup><italic><sup>Ebd</sup></italic> for 11 generations, clear differences in mEPSC amplitudes in untreated cortical cultures for the two wild-type strains (see below) and in calcium current amplitudes in adrenal chromaffin cells for the two wild-type strains (unpublished obs.) remained. Therefore, throughout this study, there are two <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or ‘wild-type’ phenotypes.</p><p>We found that loss of <italic>Rab3a</italic> greatly impaired the homeostatic increase after activity blockade. Example current traces of spontaneously occurring mEPSCs recorded from pyramidal neurons in untreated (CON) 13–14 DIV cortical cultures and sister cultures treated with 500 nM TTX for 48 hr prepared from wild-type and <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in the <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> colony are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, respectively.

In contrast, in cultures prepared from <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, the average mEPSC amplitude was not significantly increased, for 25 untreated cells and 26 TTX-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, 13.6 ± 0.1 vs. 14.3 ± 0.6 pA). We found that TTX treatment also resulted in an increase in mEPSC frequency in cultures prepared from <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> (CON, 2.26 ± 0.37 s<sup>–1</sup>; TTX, 4.62 ± 0.74 s<sup>–1</sup>).

In contrast, homeostatic plasticity of mEPSC amplitude has been attributed to an increase in postsynaptic receptors on the surface of the dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O’Brien et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>).

Is <italic>Rab3a</italic> required for the homeostatic increase in surface AMPA-type glutamate receptors that has been confirmed by multiple studies (see Introduction)?</p><p>In some studies of homeostatic synaptic plasticity, it has been found that application of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptor-specific inhibitor reversed the homeostatic increase in mEPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ju et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thiagarajan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sutton et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that the <italic>TTX-induced increase</italic> in mean mEPSC amplitude was nearly identical in a set of 11 CON and 11 TTX-treated cells before and after treatment with 1-naphthyl acetyl spermine trihydrochloride (NASPM), a synthetic analogue of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptor inhibitor philanthotoxin (before NASPM, CON 12.9 ± 3.5 pA; TTX, 17.5 ± 3.1 pA; after NASPM, CON 11.9 ± 2.6 pA; TTX 16.1 ± 3.5 pA). This result indicates that the TTX-induced increase in mEPSC amplitude does not depend on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable receptors, since the effect of TTX clearly remained when their presence was removed by acute NASPM application. We do not think that there was any technical issue with the NASPM application, because overall, mEPSC amplitudes were reduced modestly in both untreated and TTX-treated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, CON, before NASPM, 12.9 ± 3.5 pA; after NASPM, 11.9 ± 2.6 pA; TTX, before NASPM, 17.5 ± 3.1 pA; after NASPM, 16.1 ± 3.5 pA). Furthermore, NASPM consistently reduced mEPSC frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, CON, before NASPM, 1.84 ± 0.55 s<sup>–1</sup>; after NASPM, 1.56 ± 0.53 s<sup>–1</sup>; TTX, before NASPM, 4.40 ± 3.51 s<sup>–1</sup>; after NASPM, 2.68 ± 2.25 s<sup>–1</sup>). Similar to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, frequency is significantly increased after TTX treatment (p = 0.04), but this difference is no longer significant after NASPM application (p = 0.20). One explanation for the effect on frequency is that there are synaptic sites that express only homomers of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (GluA2-lacking AMPARs); mEPSCs from these sites would be expected to be completely blocked by NASPM (see cartoon description in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, left). We cannot rule out an alternative explanation, that presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors normally enhance release probability, and NAPSM prevents this action. The magnitude of the frequency reduction following acute NASPM appears to be greater after TTX treatment, suggesting that loss of activity could promote the establishment of synaptic sites that contain only Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable receptors. However, these new sites do not appear to contribute to the increase in mEPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The lack of effect of NASPM rules out the contribution of homomeric Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors GluA1, GluA3, and GluA4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hollmann et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnashev et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jonas and Burnashev, 1995</xref>), as well as Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable forms of Kainate receptors GluA5 and GluA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koike et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2009</xref>) to homeostatic synaptic plasticity.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Homeostatic plasticity of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitudes in mouse cortical cultures treated with TTX for 48 hr was unchanged by acute inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors by NASPM (20 µm).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Box plot comparison of the TTX effect on mEPSC amplitudes in the same pyramidal neurons before and after application of 20 µM NASPM (<italic>N</italic> = 11 cells from three cultures; Pre-NASPM, CON: 12.9 ± 1.1 pA; TTX: 17.5 ± 0.9 pA; post-NASPM, CON: 11.9 ± 0.8 pA; TTX: 16.1 ± 1.0 pA).

Since mEPSCs necessarily report synaptic levels of receptors, we used VGLUT1 immunofluorescence to identify synapses on pyramidal primary apical dendrites labeled with MAP-2 immunofluorescence. We focused on the primary dendrite of pyramidal neurons as a way to reduce variability that might arise from being at widely ranging distances from the cell body or from inadvertently sampling dendritic regions arising from inhibitory neurons. In addition, it has been shown that there is a clear increase in response to glutamate in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (top) shows two pyramidal neurons, one from an untreated culture on the left, and one from a TTX-treated culture on the right, prepared from <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice. To measure characteristics of synaptically located GluA2 receptor clusters, we zoomed in on the primary dendrite (region in white rectangle). The zoomed regions for single confocal sections of the selected area are shown below and contain pairs of VGLUT1- and GluA2-immunofluorescent clusters indicated by white trapezoidal frames. A dendrite typically required ~10 confocal sections to be fully captured, and the total number of synaptic pairs for all the sections imaged on a dendrite averaged 20 (20.4 ± 6.5 (SD); range, 11–38) so this is an atypically high number of pairs within a single section; these particular dendrites and sections were selected for illustration purposes. In addition to the synaptic pairs, we observed many GluA2-immunofluorescent clusters not associated with VGLUT1 immunofluorescence (a few are indicated with white arrows), most probably extrasynaptic receptors. There were also GluA2-positive clusters present outside of MAP2-positive dendrites, which may be located on astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 1999</xref>). Finally, GluA2-immunofluorescent clusters close to VGLUT1 immunofluorescence but not located along any apparent MAP2-positive neurites suggest the presence of axon–axonal contacts, although VGLUT1 has also been detected in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ormel et al., 2012</xref>). Only sites that contained both VGLUT1 and GluA2 immunofluorescence close to the primary MAP2-positive dendrite or a secondary branch along this primary dendrite were selected for analyses. In the experiment from which these images were collected, we analyzed the distance from the cell body for each synapse. The average distance from the cell body, for dendrites from the untreated cell, was 38.5 ± 2.8 µm; for the TTX-treated cell, it was 42.4 ± 3.2 µm (p = 0.35, Kruskal–Wallis test). Since the greatest distance from the cell body is set by the outer limit of the zoom window, and that window was placed adjacent to the cell body, distances in other experiments would be in this same range.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Identification of synaptic GluA2 receptor immunofluorescence on primary dendrites of pyramidal neurons in high-density mouse cortical co-cultures prepared from <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice.</title><p>(Top) Non-zoomed single confocal sections collected with a 60X oil immersion objective of recognizably pyramidal-shaped neurons, presumed to be excitatory neurons, selected for synaptic GluA2 analysis.

To reduce the necessity for many cultures, we chose to pair experiments in the same cultures by recording mEPSCs from one set of coverslips and processing another set of coverslips from the same culture for immunofluorescence. We also wanted to determine if the homeostatic response of mEPSC amplitudes varied from culture to culture, and if so, whether the GluA2 receptor levels varied in parallel. We completed this matched paradigm of physiology and immunofluorescence for three cultures prepared from <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice. We first present the results as means for each culture, for control and TTX-treated dishes, for mEPSC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Levels of GluA2 immunofluorescence at synaptic sites were quantified by the size of the GluA2-immunofluorescent receptor cluster, because this showed the greatest response to activity blockade; the average intensity value, and the integral of intensity values across the area of the cluster, are included in a summary of the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Three of three cortical cultures showed an increase in mean mEPSC amplitude after TTX treatment. In contrast, one of the same three cultures showed a decrease in mean GluA2 receptor cluster size, suggesting that the decrease in receptor levels in Culture #3 was not due to a lack of homeostatic effect on mEPSC amplitudes in that culture. Because there was a clear trend toward increased GluA2 receptor cluster size, but the receptor response appears more variable, we performed immunofluorescence measurements on two additional cortical cultures, both of which showed modest increases after TTX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Because the average number of synaptic sites identified in the primary dendrites in three cultures was 20.4, we also took 20 mEPSC samples from each cell, the 21st to the 40th mEPSC recorded, to minimize any differences in variability between GluA2 receptors and mEPSCs that might be due to a difference in sampling.

This result indicates that the homeostatic response averaged across the 3 cultures was very similar to, but slightly smaller than, that of the dataset presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The mean for size of GluA2-immunofluorescent receptor clusters showed a trend toward higher values after activity blockade (18.1%) that was of similar magnitude to the mEPSC amplitude increase (19.7%), but did not reach statistical significance for three cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) or five cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

These results suggest that normal function of the synaptic vesicle protein <italic>Rab3a</italic> is required for the homeostatic increase of mEPSC amplitude in cortical cultures.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Is <italic>Rab3a</italic> acting in the presynaptic cell to cause homeostatic increase in mEPSC amplitude?</title><p>The impetus for our current study was two previous studies in which we examined homeostatic regulation of quantal amplitude at the NMJ. An advantage of studying the NMJ is that synaptic ACh receptors are easily identified with fluorescently labeled α-bungarotoxin, which allows for very accurate quantification of postsynaptic receptor density. We were able to detect a known change due to mixing 2 colors of α-bungarotoxin to within 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Using this model synapse, we showed that there was no increase in synaptic AChRs after TTX treatment, whereas mEPC increased 35% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). We further showed that the presynaptic protein <italic>Rab3a</italic> was necessary for full upregulation of mEPC amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). These data strongly suggested <italic>Rab3a</italic> contributed to homeostatic upregulation of quantal amplitude via a presynaptic mechanism. With the current study showing that <italic>Rab3a</italic> is required for the homeostatic increase in mEPSC amplitude in cortical neuron cultures, one interpretation is that in both situations, <italic>Rab3a</italic> is required for an increase in the presynaptic quantum.</p><p>The presynaptic quantum, or the amount of transmitter released during a single fusion event, is an important contributor to quantal size. The amount of transmitter released during vesicle fusion can be affected by the kinetics of the fusion pore opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). We previously used amperometric measurements in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells to show loss of <italic>Rab3a</italic> increased the occurrence of very small amplitude fusion pore feet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Paired with our finding that there is an increase in the occurrence of very slow-rising, abnormally shaped mEPCs at the NMJ of <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, our data suggest that small synaptic vesicles may have a fusion pore step under certain circumstances (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiang et al., 2018</xref>). If activity blockade causes an increase in mEPSC amplitude due to a more rapid opening of a fusion pore, or a larger fusion pore conductance, it is possible that <italic>Rab3a</italic> is required for this modulation.</p><p>Another way to increase the presynaptic quantum is to increase levels of the transmitter transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daniels et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Gois et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hartman et al., 2006</xref>). However, we found that immunofluorescence for the glutamate transporter, VGLUT1, was not increased after activity blockade under our experimental conditions. A similar lack of increase in VGLUT1 levels, relative to synapsin, was previously observed in hippocampal cultures treated with NBQX, an AMPA receptor blocker (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilson et al., 2005</xref>). Taken together with our findings, it appears that there is not strong evidence that the amount of VGLUT1 at synapses is a contributing factor to the increase in mEPSC amplitude in neuronal cultures after activity blockade with TTX.</p><p>Finally, the amount of transmitter released by a vesicle could be increased due to larger vesicle size. Larger vesicle diameter has been observed following activity disruption in multiple paradigms, including ocular deprivation, cortical ablation, and immobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawana et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lloret and Saavedra, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheresharov et al., 1978</xref>).

An increase in volume has been shown to increase miniature endplate junctional current amplitude at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karunanithi et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Rab3a</italic> could be required for an activity-dependent increase in vesicle size, but the increase in diameter needed for a 25% increase in transmitter, and therefore mEPSC amplitude (~3%), would be difficult to detect.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Is <italic>Rab3a</italic> acting on postsynaptic receptors to cause an increase in mEPSC amplitude?</title><p>In neurons, the increase in mEPSC amplitude following block of activity was not due to increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable GluA1 homomers because acute NASPM application was unable to reverse the TTX-induced increase in amplitude. While we found that the effect of TTX treatment on mEPSC amplitude and GluA2 receptor levels was of similar magnitude, the effect on GluA2 receptor levels was not statistically significant for the pooled datasets acquired in the same three cultures, nor in a larger dataset containing an additional two cultures. In light of the extensive literature documenting increases in GluA1 or GluA2 receptors, or both, after activity blockade, the less than convincing increase in GluA2 receptor levels in the current work came as a surprise. The reason for the lack of significance was that the increase in receptors was more variable. We are aware of three possible explanations for greater variability. (1) The number of synaptic sites sampled was smaller for the imaging dataset. This was because we limited our analysis to synaptic receptors on the primary dendrite, where a clear increase in sensitivity to exogenously applied glutamate was demonstrated (see Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>). To address this issue, we limited our sample size of mEPSCs in the matched experiments to the same number per cell as the mean sample size per cell for imaging, but there was still a discrepancy in the effect of TTX on mEPSCs versus receptors. (2) The small sample of only three cultures was not enough to reveal the increase in receptors. We attempted to address this by adding two more cultures. Although both additional cultures showed small increases in GluA2 receptor cluster size, when cells from these cultures were included in the pooled dataset, the p-value was not substantially improved. A remaining possibility is: (3) The complexity involved in processing cultures for immunofluorescence introduces variability that obscures the true effect. One can get around technical issues related to immunofluorescence processing by performing Western blots, but then any changes detected could be due to upregulation of extrasynaptic receptors.</p><p>What remains unclear is why our data were impacted by the variability inherent in immunofluorescence measurements, but data of other studies were not. Some other studies have used the number of synaptic sites or puncta as the sample size (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ibata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).

We found only a single study that had comparable sample sizes for receptors and mEPSC amplitudes, and the p-value was &lt;0.01 for mEPSC amplitudes (<italic>n</italic> = 9 and 10 cells for CON and TTX, respectively), but five times higher (&lt;0.05) for receptor data (<italic>n</italic> = 13 and 14 cells for CON and TTX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xu and Pozzo-Miller, 2017</xref>). This single example is consistent with our suggestion that measurements of changes in receptors after activity blockade are more variable than measurements of mEPSC amplitudes. In sum, the lack of a robust increase in receptor levels leaves open the possibility that there is a presynaptic contributor to quantal size in mouse cortical cultures. However, the variability could arise from technical factors associated with the immunofluorescence method, and the mechanism of <italic>Rab3a</italic>-dependent homeostatic plasticity could be presynaptic for the NMJ and postsynaptic for cortical neurons.</p><p>Increased receptors likely contribute to increases in mEPSC amplitudes, but because we do not have a significant increase in GluA2 receptors in our experiments, it is impossible to conclude that the increase is lacking in cultures from <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons. Furthermore, without additional experiments targeting <italic>Rab3a</italic> deletion to the pre- or post-synaptic compartment, we cannot rule out that <italic>Rab3a</italic> is regulating homeostatic plasticity in mouse cortical cultures by acting postsynaptically on receptor trafficking.

To determine the role of <italic>Rab3a</italic> in homeostatic plasticity in mouse cortical cultures, we employed two distinct genetic mouse strains with altered <italic>Rab3a</italic> function. <italic>Rab3a</italic> deletion mice were generated as follows: <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> heterozygous mice descended from the <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> strain obtained from Jackson Laboratories B6;129S-<italic>Rab3atm1Sud</italic>/J (strain #: 002443) were bred and genotyped as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kapfhamer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), and maintained as a colony using multiple heterozygous breeding pairs. Homozygous <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mouse pups were obtained by breeding <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> pairs and <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> pairs, respectively, so that the pups were the first-generation progeny of a homozygous mating. This protocol minimizes the tendency of multiple generations of <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> homozygous breedings to produce progeny that are more and more genetically distinct. <italic>Rab3a<sup>Ebd/Ebd</sup></italic> mice were identified in an EU-mutagenesis screen of C57BL/6J mice, and after a cross to C3H/HeJ, were backcrossed for 3 generations to C57BL/6J (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kapfhamer et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/</sup><italic><sup>Ebd</sup></italic> heterozygous mice were bred at Wright State University and genotyped in a two-step procedure: (1) a PCR reaction (forward primer: TGA CTC CTT CAC TCC AGC CT; reverse primer: TGC ACT GCA TTA AAT GAC TCC T) followed by (2) a restriction digest with enzyme Bsp1286I (New England Biolabs) that distinguishes the Earlybird mutant by its different base-pair products. <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice were backcrossed with <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice from the Earlybird heterozygous colony for 11 generations in an attempt to establish a single wild-type strain, but differences in mEPSC amplitude and adrenal chromaffin cell calcium currents persisted, likely due to genes that are close to the <italic>Rab3a</italic> site, resulting in two wild-type strains: (1) <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> from the <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/−</sup> colony, and (2) <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> from the <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/</sup><italic><sup>Ebd</sup></italic> colony.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Primary culture of mouse cortical neurons</title><p>Primary dissociated cultures of mixed neuronal and glia populations were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanes et al., 2020</xref>).

Each culture was prepared from the cortices harvested from two animals; neonates were not sexed. Cortices were collected in chilled Neurobasal-A media (Gibco) with osmolarity adjusted to 270 mOsm and supplemented with 40 U/ml DNAse I (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The tissues were digested with papain (Worthington Biochemical) at 20 U/ml at 37°C for 20 min followed by trituration with a sterile, fire-polished Pasteur pipette, then filtered through a 100-µm cell strainer and centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 2 min. After discarding the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in room temperature Neurobasal-A media (270 mOsm), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for glia growth, and 2% B-27 supplement to promote neuronal growth (Gibco), L-glutamine, and gentamicin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Neurons were counted and plated at 0.15 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/coverslip onto 12 mm coverslips pre-coated with poly-<sc>L</sc>-lysine (BioCoat, Corning). This plating density produces a ‘high-density’ culture characterized by a complex mesh of neuronal processes criss-crossing the field of view, completely filling the space between cell bodies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We found in preliminary experiments that an increase in mEPSC amplitude in mouse cortical cultures was inconsistent when cell density was low, likely due to lower levels of baseline activity, although it is a limitation of this study that we did not directly measure activity levels in cultures prepared from <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup>, <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, or <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>Ebd/Ebd</sup> mice, and therefore do not know if differences in results are due to differences in activity levels.

Recordings were taken from pyramidal neurons, which were identified visually by a prominent apical dendrite; images were taken of all cells recorded from. Cells were continuously perfused with a solution consisting of (in mM): NaCl (115), KCl (5), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (2.5), MgCl<sub>2</sub> (1.3), dextrose (23), sucrose (26), HEPES (4.2), pH = 7.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006</xref>). On the day of recording, the osmolarity of the media from the cultures was measured (normally 285–295 mOsm) and the perfusate osmolarity was adjusted to match the culture osmolarity to protect against osmotic shock to the neurons. To isolate glutamatergic mEPSCs, TTX (500 nM) and picrotoxin (50 μM) were included in the perfusion solution to block action potentials and GABAergic currents, respectively. The NMDA receptor antagonist, APV, was not included in the perfusion solution because in pilot studies, all mEPSCs were blocked by 10 µM CNQX and 50 µm picrotoxin, demonstrating no APV-sensitive mEPSCs were present (data not shown).

Osmolarity was adjusted to 10 mOsm less than the perfusion solution osmolarity, which we have found improves success rate of achieving low access resistance recordings.

The presence of the edited GluA2 subunit disrupts both the Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability and the sensitivity to JSTX and related substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blaschke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bochet et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jonas and Burnashev, 1995</xref>). Therefore, 20 µM NASPM is expected to completely block AMPA receptors containing GluA1, GluA3, or GluA4 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hollmann et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burnashev et al., 1992</xref>), or the Kainate receptors containing GluA5 or GluA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koike et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2009</xref>), but be ineffective against any heteromer or homomer containing GluA2 subunits. Because the effect of the spider toxins and their analogs is use-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herlitze et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iino et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koike et al., 1997</xref>), NASPM was applied with a depolarizing high K<sup>+</sup> solution (25 mM KCl, 95 mM NaCl) which we expected to trigger release of glutamate and opening of glutamate-activated receptors, allowing entry of NASPM into the pore. Baseline recordings were performed for 2 min in our standard perfusate, followed by perfusion of NASPM + High K<sup>+</sup> solution for 45 s, and then perfusion of a NASPM only solution for 5 min, after which recording was recommenced for 5 min (because we found in pilot experiments that frequency was reduced following NASPM application).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of mEPSCs</title><p>mEPSCs were manually selected using Mini Analysis software (Synaptosoft), a standard program used for mEPSC event detection and analysis. Records were filtered at 2 kHz using a low-pass Butterworth filter prior to selection. The program detection threshold was set at 3 pA but the smallest mEPSC selected was 4.01 pA. A fully manual detection process means that the same criterion (‘does this <italic>look</italic> like an mEPSC?’) is applied to all events, not just the false positives or the false negatives, which prevents the bias from being primarily at one end or the other of the range of mEPSC amplitudes. It is important to note that when performing the MiniAnalysis process, the researcher did not know whether a record was from an untreated cell or a TTX-treated cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunofluorescence, microscopy, and data analysis</title><p>Primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons were grown for 13–14 DIV. Antibodies to GluA2 (mouse ab against N-terminal, EMD Millipore) were added directly to live cultures at 1:40 dilution, and incubated at 37°C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 45 min. Cultures were rinsed three times with PBS/5% donkey serum before being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After 3 rinses in PBS/5% donkey serum, cultures were incubated in CY3-labeled donkey-anti-mouse secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature, rinsed in PBS/5% donkey serum, permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, and incubated in chick anti-MAP2 (1:2500, AbCAM) and rabbit anti-VGLUT1 (1:4000, Synaptic Systems) for 1 hr at room temperature in PBS/5% donkey serum. After rinsing with PBS/5% donkey serum, coverslips were incubated with 488-anti chick and CY5-anti rabbit secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature, rinsed, blotted to remove excess liquid, and inverted on a drop of Vectashield (Vector Labs). Coverslips were sealed with nail polish and stored at 4°C for &lt;1 week before imaging. All secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch and were used at 1:225 dilution.</p><p>Coverslips were viewed on a Fluoview FV1000 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 60x oil immersion, 1.35 NA objective. Once a pyramidal neuron was identified and a single confocal section of the cell acquired (see top, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), Fluoview 2.1 software was used to zoom in on the primary dendrite (5X) and a series of confocal sections were taken every 0.5 µm. Images were analyzed offline with ImagePro 6 (Cybernetics). The composite image was used to locate synaptic sites containing both VGLUT1 and GluA2 immunoreactivity in close apposition to each other and to the primary dendrite or a secondary branch identified with MAP2 immunoreactivity. An area of interest (AOI) was manually drawn around the GluA2 cluster in the confocal section in which it was the brightest. The AOIs for a dendrite were saved in a single file; the AOI number and the confocal section it was associated with were noted for later retrieval. For quantification, AOIs were loaded, an individual AOI was called up on the appropriate section, and the count/measurement tool was used to apply a threshold. Multiple thresholds were used, 400–550, but we found that within a given experiment, the magnitude of the TTX effect was not altered by different thresholds; therefore, all data presented here use a threshold of 450. Pixels within the cluster that were above the threshold were automatically outlined, and size, average intensity, and integral of the outlined region saved to an Origin2020 (OriginLab) file for calculating mean values. For analyzing VGLUT1 sites, previous AOIs were examined, and if not directly over the VGLUT1 site, moved to encompass it (this happened when GluA2 and VGLUT1 were side by side rather than overlapping). The threshold was 200 for all VGLUT1 data except <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup> Culture #1, where the threshold was 400. There was no threshold that worked for both that culture and the other cultures, with too much of the background regions being included for Culture #1 with a threshold of 200, and too little of the synaptic site area being included for the other cultures with a threshold of 400.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>In our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanes et al., 2020</xref>), we described the characteristics of homeostatic plasticity of mEPSC amplitudes in mouse cortical cultures using multiple mEPSC amplitude quantiles from each cell to create datasets with thousands of samples. We compared the cumulative distribution functions for mEPSC amplitudes in untreated versus TTX-treated cultures, as well as sorting the values from smallest to largest, and plotted TTX values versus control values in the rank order plot first described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref> to demonstrate synaptic scaling. Finally, we plotted the ratio of TTX values/control values versus control values to show that the ratio, which represents the effect of TTX, increased with increasing control values, which we termed ‘divergent scaling’. Here, we wanted to avoid the inflation of sample size caused by pooling multiple mEPSCs per cell. To statistically compare the effects of TTX in cultures of wild-type mice, <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, and <italic>Rab3a<sup>Ebd/Ebd</sup></italic> mutant mice, or, WT–WT, WT–KO, and KO–WT neuron–glial cultures, we performed a two-way ANOVA, followed by a Tukey test, and used the p-value for each specific situation, for example, CON versus TTX for <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>+/+</sup>; CON versus TTX for <italic>Rab3a</italic><sup>−/−</sup>, and so on. The overall means are presented ± SEM in the text, and p-values are displayed above each plot, with <italic>N</italic> = the number of cells. For the characteristics of synaptic GluA2 receptor clusters and VGLUT1 sites in imaging experiments, <italic>N</italic> = the number of dendrites (one dendrite was sampled for each cell), and statistical comparisons were made with the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test. Although we quantified three characteristics of the GluA2 clusters and VGLUT1 sites: size, average intensity, and integral, we have not corrected p-values for multiple comparisons. Means are presented as box plots + data, with the box at 25 and 75 percentiles, whiskers at 10 and 90 percentiles, a dot indicating the mean, and a line indicating the median. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, mEPSC amplitudes were measured within the same cell before and after NASPM application, so a paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare the pre- and post-NASPM mEPSC amplitudes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>, the mean mEPSC amplitude for untreated and TTX-treated coverslips in the same culture is compared with a paired <italic>t</italic>-test. Statistics were computed and plots were created using Origin2020 (OriginLab).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the policies of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Wright State University (Animal User Protocols: 789, 901, 982, and 1082 for mouse breedings, and 796, 906, and 1011 for neuronal cultures).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-90261-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

The major finding is that TTX incubation for 48 hours does not induce an increase in the amplitude of excitatory synaptic miniature events in neuronal cortical cultures derived from Rab3A KO and Rab3A Earlybird mutant mice. NASPM application had comparable effects on mEPSC amplitude in control and after TTX, implying that Ca2+-permeable glutamate receptors are unlikely modulated during synaptic scaling. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed no significant changes in GluA2 puncta size, intensity, and integral after TTX treatment in control and Rab3A KO cultures. Finally, they provide evidence that loss of Rab3A in neurons, but not astrocytes, blocks homeostatic scaling. Based on these data, the authors propose a model in which neuronal Rab3A is required for homeostatic scaling of synaptic transmission, potentially through GluA2-independent mechanisms.</p><p>The major finding - impaired homeostatic up-scaling after TTX treatment in Rab3A KO and Rab3 earlybird mutant neurons - is supported by data of high quality. However, the paper falls short of providing any evidence or direction regarding potential mechanisms. The data on GluA2 modulation after TTX incubation are likely statistically underpowered and do not allow drawing solid conclusions, such as GluA2-independent mechanisms of up-scaling.</p><p>The study should be of interest to the field because it implicates a presynaptic molecule in homeostatic scaling, which is generally thought to involve postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor modulation. However, it remains unclear how Rab3A participates in homeostatic plasticity.</p><p>Major (remaining) point:</p><p>(1) The current version of the abstract only includes the results on GluA2 immunofluorescence and mEPSC amplitude modulation after TTX treatment in control cultures, and a requirement for Rab3A in neurons instead of astrocytes. The major findings, including the block of the mEPSC amplitude increase upon TTX treatment in Rab3KO/EB mutants, are not mentioned. The abstract should be revised so that it reflects all major findings, potentially at the expense of citing previous work by the authors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90261.5.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>First, I would like to thank the authors for the response. I acknowledge that the authors show in previous studies that Rab3A acts from the presynaptic side at the NMJ, and that is, as the authors indicate, their impetus for the current study. However, mechanisms observed at a completely different type of synapses cannot be used as an argument for conclusions here. The authors also acknowledge that they should restrict their conclusions to the data in the current study, and they are merely proposing interpretations. Then perhaps they should restrict these interpretations to the discussion rather than make this claim in the abstract (lines 44-47). Here the authors ask whether Rab3A is involved in the homeostatic increase of postsynaptic AMPARs, am I understanding it correctly that their conclusion for this question is &quot;increase in AMPAR levels in WT cultures is more variable than those in mEPSCs so that it is impossible to determine if Rab3A is involved at all&quot;? If so, then this question has not been answered and should not be regarded as one of the main conclusions with the data presented here. It also remains unclear to me how this piece of inconclusive data serves the main objective of the study.</p><p>The authors state at the end that the current study is just an extension of their previous work, and therefore their interpretations here further support the idea that Rab3A is acting presynaptically. I would argue that it is the conclusive data, rather than interpretations that lack concrete evidence, that support ideas and models. I think that we would all agree that immunostaining measurements can be very variable. However, if the authors are determined to use this approach to answer one of their major questions, then perhaps one way to significantly strengthen their conclusions is to find ways to somewhat overcome this technical limitation.</p><p>Finally, I thank the authors for addressing other minor concerns of mine.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90261.5.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This manuscript presents a number of interesting findings that have the potential to increase our understanding of the mechanism underlying homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP). The data broadly support that Rab3A plays a role in HSP, although the site and mechanism of action remain uncertain.</p><p>The authors clearly demonstrate the Rab3A plays a role in HSP at excitatory synapses, with substantially less plasticity occurring in the Rab3A KO neurons. There is also no apparent HSP in the Earlybird Rab3A mutation, although baseline synaptic strength is already elevated. In this context, it is unclear if the plasticity is absent, already induced by this mutation, or just occluded by a ceiling effect due the synapses already being strengthened. Occlusion may also occur in the mixed cultures, when Rab3A is missing from neurons but not astrocytes. The authors do appropriately discuss these options. The authors have solid data showing that Rab3A is unlikely to be active in astrocytes, Finally, they attempt to study the linkage between changes in synaptic strength and AMPA receptor trafficking during HSP, and conclude that trafficking may not be solely responsible for the changes in synaptic strength during HSP.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work adds another player into the mechanisms underlying an important form of synaptic plasticity. The plasticity is likely only reduced, suggesting Rab3A is only partially required and perhaps multiple mechanisms contribute. The authors speculate about some possible novel mechanisms, including whether Rab3A is active pre-synaptically to regulate quantal amplitude.</p><p>As Rab3A is primarily known as a pre-synaptic molecule, this possibility is intriguing and novel for this system. However, it is based on the partial dissociation of AMPAR trafficking and synaptic response, and lacks strong support. On average, they saw similar magnitude of change in mEPSC amplitude and GluA2 cluster area and integral, but the GluA2 data was not significant due to higher variability. It is difficult to determine if this is due to biology or methodology - the imaging method involves assessing puncta pairs (GluA2/VGlut1) clearly associated with a MAP2 labeled dendrite. This is a small subset of synapses, with usually less than 20 synapses per neuron analyzed, which would be expected to be more variable than mEPSC recordings averaged across several hundred events. However, when they reduce the mEPSC number of events to similar numbers as the imaging, the mESPC amplitudes are still less variable than the imaging data. The reason for this remains unclear. The pool of sampled synapses is still different between the methods and recent data has shown that synapses have variable responses during HSP. Further, there could be variability in the subunit composition of newly inserted AMPARs, and only assessing GluA2 could mask this (see below). It is intriguing that pre-synaptic changes might contribute to HSP, especially given the likely localization of Rab3A. But it remains difficult to distinguish if the apparent difference in imaging and electrophysiology is a methodological issue rather than a biological one. Stronger data, especially positive data on changes in release, will be necessary to conclude that pre-synaptic factors are required for HSP, beyond the established changes in post-synaptic receptor trafficking. Specific deletion of Rab3A from pre-synaptic neurons would also be highly informative.</p><p>Other questions arise from the NASPM experiments, used to justify looking at GluA2 (and not GluA1) in the immunostaining. First, there is a strong frequency effect that is unclear in origin. One would expect NASPM to merely block some fraction of the post-synaptic current, and not affect pre-synaptic release or block whole synapses. But the change in frequency seems to argue (as the authors do) that some synapses only have CP-AMPARs, while the rest of the synapses have few or none. Another possibility is that there are pre-synaptic NASPM-sensitive receptors that influence release probability. Further, the amplitude data show a strong trend towards smaller amplitude following NASPM treatment (Fig 3B). The p value for both control and TTX neurons was 0.08 - it is very difficult to argue that there is no effect. And the decrease on average is larger in the TTX neurons, and some cells show a strong effect. It is possible there is some heterogeneity between neurons on whether GluA1/A2 heteromers or GluA1 homomers are added during HSP. This would impact the conclusions about the GluA2 imaging as compared to the mEPSC amplitude data.</p><p>To understand the role of Rab3A in HSP will require addressing two main issues:</p><p>(1) Is Rab3A acting pre-synaptically, post-synaptically or both? The authors provide good evidence that Rab3A is acting within neurons and not astrocytes. But where it is acting (pre or post) would aid substantially in understanding its role.

The reviewers’ main point is that we have not shown a lack of upregulation of postsynaptic receptors in mouse cortical cultures. We want to stress that we agree that postsynaptic receptors are upregulated after activity block in neuronal cultures. However, the reviewers are not acknowledging that we have previously presented strong evidence at the mammalian NMJ that there is no increase in AChR after activity blockade, and therefore the requirement for Rab3A in the homeostatic increase in quantal amplitude points to a presynaptic contribution. We agree that we should restrict our firmest conclusions to the data in the current study, but in the Discussion we are proposing interpretations. We have added the following new text:</p><p>“The impetus for our current study was two previous studies in which we examined homeostatic regulation of quantal amplitude at the NMJ. An advantage of studying the NMJ is that synaptic ACh receptors are easily identified with fluorescently labeled alpha-bungarotoxin, which allows for very accurate quantification of postsynaptic receptor density. We were able to detect a known change due to mixing 2 colors of alpha-BTX to within 1% (Wang et al., 2005). Using this model synapse, we showed that there was no increase in synaptic AChRs after TTX treatment, whereas miniature endplate current increased 35% (Wang et al., 2005). We further showed that the presynaptic protein Rab3A was necessary for full upregulation of mEPC amplitude (Wang et al., 2011). These data strongly suggested Rab3A contributed to homeostatic upregulation of quantal amplitude via a presynaptic mechanism. With the current study showing that Rab3A is required for the homeostatic increase in mEPSC amplitude in cortical cultures, one interpretation is that in both situations, Rab3A is required for an increase in the presynaptic quantum.”</p><p>The point we are making is that the current manuscript is an extension of that work and interpretation of our findings regarding the variability of upregulation of postsynaptic receptors in our mouse cortical cultures further supports the idea that there is a Rab3Adependent presynaptic contribution to homeostatic increases in quantal amplitude.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Koesters and colleagues investigated the role of the small GTPase Rab3A in homeostatic scaling of miniature synaptic transmission in primary mouse cortical cultures using electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. The major finding is that TTX incubation for 48 hours does not induce an increase in the amplitude of excitatory synaptic miniature events in neuronal cortical cultures derived from Rab3A KO and Rab3A Earlybird mutant mice. NASPM application had comparable effects on mEPSC amplitude in control and after TTX, implying that Ca2+-permeable glutamate receptors are unlikely modulated during synaptic scaling. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed no significant changes in GluA2 puncta size, intensity, and integral after TTX treatment in control and Rab3A KO cultures. Finally, they provide evidence that loss of Rab3A in neurons, but not astrocytes, blocks homeostatic scaling. Based on these data, the authors propose a model in which neuronal Rab3A is required for homeostatic scaling of synaptic transmission, potentially through GluA2-independent mechanisms.</p><p>The major finding - impaired homeostatic up-scaling after TTX treatment in Rab3A KO and Rab3 earlybird mutant neurons - is supported by data of high quality. However, the paper falls short of providing any evidence or direction regarding potential mechanisms. The data on GluA2 modulation after TTX incubation are likely statistically underpowered, and do not allow drawing solid conclusions, such as GluA2-independent mechanisms of up-scaling.</p><p>The study should be of interest to the field because it implicates a presynaptic molecule in homeostatic scaling, which is generally thought to involve postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor modulation. However, it remains unclear how Rab3A participates in homeostatic plasticity.</p><p>Major (remaining) point:</p><p>(1) Direct quantitative comparison between electrophysiology and GluA2 imaging data is complicated by many factors, such as different signal-to-noise ratios. Hence, comparing the variability of the increase in mini amplitude vs. GluA2 fluorescence area is not valid. Thus, I recommend removing the sentence &quot;We found that the increase in postsynaptic AMPAR levels was more variable than that of mEPSC amplitudes, suggesting other factors may contribute to the homeostatic increase in synaptic strength.&quot; from the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not removed the statement, but altered it to soften the conclusion. It now reads, “We found that the increase in postsynaptic AMPAR levels in wild type cultures was more variable than that of mEPSC amplitudes, which might be explained by a presynaptic contribution, but we cannot rule out variability in the measurement.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the data do not directly support the conclusion of GluA2-independent mechanisms of homeostatic scaling. Statements like &quot;We conclude that these data support the idea that there is another contributor to the TTX- induced increase in quantal size.&quot; should be thus revised or removed.</p></disp-quote><p>This particular statement is in the previous response to reviewers only, we deleted the sentence that starts, “The simplest explanation Rab3A regulates a presynaptic contributor….”. and “Imaging of immunofluorescence more variable…”. We deleted “ our data suggest….consistently leads to an increase in mEPSC amplitude and sometimes leads to….” We added “…the lack of a robust increase in receptor levels leaves open the possibility that there is a presynaptic contributor to quantal size in mouse cortical cultures. However, the variability could arise from technical factors associated with the immunofluorescence method, and the mechanism of Rab3A-dependent plasticity could be presynaptic for the NMJ and postsynaptic for cortical neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>I thank the authors for their efforts in the revision. In general, I believe the main conclusion that Rab3A is required for TTX-induced homeostatic synaptic plasticity is wellsupported by the data presented, and this is an important addition to the repertoire of molecular players involved in homeostatic compensations. I also acknowledge that the authors are more cautious in making conclusions based on the current evidence, and the structure and logic have been much improved.</p><p>The only major concern I have still falls on the interpretation of the mismatch between GluA2 cluster size and mEPSC amplitude. The authors argue that they are only trying to say that changes in the cluster size are more variable than those in the mEPSC amplitude, and they provide multiple explanations for this mismatch. It seems incongruous to state that the simplest explanation is a presynaptic factor when you have all these alternative factors that very likely have contributed to the results. Further, the authors speculate in the discussion that Rab3A does not regulate postsynaptic GluA2 but instead regulates a presynaptic contributor. Do the authors mean that, in their model, the mEPSC amplitude increases can be attributed to two factors- postsynaptic GluA2 regulation and a presynaptic contribution (which is regulated by Rab3A)? If so, and Rab3A does not affect GluA2 whatsoever, shouldn't we see GluA2 increase even in the absence of Rab3A? The data in Table 1 seems to indicate otherwise.</p></disp-quote><p>The main body of this comment is addressed in the General Response to Reviewers. In addition, we deleted text “current data, coupled with our previous findings at the mouse neuromuscular junction, support the idea that there are additional sources contributing to the homeostatic increase in quantal size.” We added new text, so the sentence now reads: “Increased receptors likely contribute to increases in mESPC amplitudes in mouse cortical cultures, but because we do not have a significant increase in GluA2 receptors in our experiments, it is impossible to conclude that the increase is lacking in cultures from Rab3A<sup>-/-</sup> neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also question the way the data are presented in Figure 5. The authors first compare 3 cultures and then 5 cultures altogether, if these experiments are all aimed to answer the same research question, then they should be pooled together. Interestingly, the additional two cultures both show increases in GluA2 clusters, which makes the decrease in culture #3 even more perplexing, for which the authors comment in line 261 that this is due to other factors. Shouldn't this be an indicator that something unusual has happened in this culture?</p><p>Data in this figure is sufficient to support that GluA2 increases are variable across cultures, which hardly adds anything new to the paper or to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>A major goal of performing the immunofluorescence measurements in the same cultures for which we had electrophysiological results was to address the common impression that the homeostatic effect itself is highly variable, as the reviewer notes in the comment “…GluA2 increases are variable across cultures…” Presumably, if GluA2 increases are the mechanism of the mEPSC amplitude increases, then variable GluA2 increases should correlate with variable mEPSC amplitude increases, but that is not what we observed. We are left with the explanation that the immunofluorescence method itself is very variable. We have added the point to the Discussion, which reads, “the variability could arise from technical factors associated with the immunofluorescence method, and the mechanism of Rab3A-dependent homeostatic plasticity could be presynaptic for the NMJ and postsynaptic for cortical neurons.”</p><p>Finally, the implication of “Shouldn’t this be an indicator that something unusual has happened in this culture?” if it is not due to culture to culture variability in the homeostatic response itself, is that there was a technical problem with accurately measuring receptor levels. We have no reason to suspect anything was amiss in this set of coverslips (the values for controls and for TTX-treated were not outside the range of values in other experiments). In any of the coverslips, there may be variability in the amount of primary anti-GluA2 antibody, as this was added directly to the culture rather than prepared as a diluted solution and added to all the coverslips. But to remove this one experiment because it did not give the expected result is to allow bias to direct our data selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors further cite a study with comparable sample sizes, which shows a similar mismatch based on p values (Xu and Pozzo-Miller 2007), yet the effect sizes in this study actually match quite well (both ~160%). P values cannot be used to show whether two effects match, but effect sizes can. Therefore, the statement in lines 411-413 &quot;... consistently leads to an increase in mEPSC amplitudes, and sometimes leads to an increase in synaptic GluA2 receptor cluster size&quot; is not very convincing, and can hardly be used to support &quot;the idea that there are additional sources contributing to the homeostatic increase in quantal size.”</p></disp-quote><p>We have the same situation; our effect sizes match (19.7% increase for mEPSC amplitude; 18.1% increase for GluA2 receptor cluster size, see Table 1), but in our case, the p value for receptors does not reach statistical significance. Our point here is that there is published evidence that the variability in receptor measurements is greater than the variability in electrophysiological measurements. But we have softened this point, removing the sentences containing “…consistently leads and sometimes...” and “……additional sources contributing…”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would suggest simply showing mEPSC and immunostaining data from all cultures in this experiment as additional evidence for homeostatic synaptic plasticity in WT cultures, and leave out the argument for &quot;mismatch&quot;. The presynaptic location of Rab3A is sufficient to speculate a presynaptic regulation of this form of homeostatic compensation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed all uses of the word “mismatch,” but feel the presentation of the 3 matched experiments, 23-24 cells (Figure 5A, D), and the additional 2 experiments for a total of 5 cultures, 48-49 cells (Figure 5C, F), is important in order to demonstrate that the lack of statistically significant receptor response is due neither to a variable homeostatic response in the mEPSC amplitudes, nor to a small number of cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>(1) Line 214, I see the authors cite literature to argue that GluA2 can form homomers and can conduct currents. While GluA2 subunits edited at the Q/R site (they are in nature) can form homomers with very low efficiency in exogenous systems such as HEK293 cells (as done in the cited studies), it's unlikely for this to happen in neurons (they can hardly traffic to synapses if possible at all).</p></disp-quote><p>We were unable to identify a key reference that characterized GluA2 homomers vs. heteromers in native cortical neurons, but we have rewritten the section in the manuscript to acknowledge the low conductance of homomers:</p><p>“…to assess whether GluA2 receptor expression, which will identify GluA2 homomers and GluA2 heteromers the former unlikely to contribute to mEPSCs given their low conductance relative to heteromers (Swanson et al., 1997; Mansour et al., 2001)…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lines 221-222, the authors may have misinterpreted the results in Turrigiano 1998. This study does not show that the increase in receptors is most dramatic in the apical dendrite, in fact, this is the only region they have tested. The results in Figures 3b-c show that the effect size is independent of the distance from soma.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3 in Turrigiano et al., shows that the increase in glutamate responsiveness is higher at the cell body than along the primary dendrite. We have revised our description to indicate that an increase in responsiveness on the primary dendrite has been demonstrated in Turrigiano et al. 1998.</p><p>“We focused on the primary dendrite of pyramidal neurons as a way to reduce variability that might arise from being at widely ranging distances from the cell body, or, from inadvertently sampling dendritic regions arising from inhibitory neurons. In addition, it has been shown that there is a clear increase in response to glutamate in this region (Turrigiano et al., 1998).”</p><p>“…synaptic receptors on the primary dendrite, where a clear increase in sensitivity to exogenously applied glutamate was demonstrated (see Figure 3 in (Turrigiano et al., 1998)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 309-310 (and other places mentioning TNFa), the addition of TNFa to this experiment seems out of place. The authors have not performed any experiment to validate the presence/absence of TNFa in their system (citing only 1 study from another lab is insufficient). Although it's convincing that glia Rab3A is not required for homeostatic plasticity here, the data does not suggest Rab3A's role (or the lack of) for TNFa in this process.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the paragraph in the Discussion that addresses the glial results, to describe more clearly the data that supported an astrocytic TNF-alpha mechanism: “TNF-alpha accumulates after activity blockade, and directly applied to neuronal cultures, can cause an increase in GluA1 receptors, providing a potential mechanism by which activity blockade leads to the homeostatic upregulation of postsynaptic receptors (Beattie et al., 2002; Stellwagen et al., 2005; Stellwagen and Malenka, 2006).”</p><p>We have also acknowledged that we cannot rule out TNF-alpha coming from neurons in the cortical cultures: “…suggesting the possibility that neuronal Rab3A can act via a non-TNF-alpha mechanism to contribute to homeostatic regulation of quantal amplitude, although we have not ruled out a neuronal Rab3A-mediated TNF-alpha pathway in cortical cultures.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript presents a number of interesting findings that have the potential to increase our understanding of the mechanism underlying homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP). The data broadly support that Rab3A plays a role in HSP, although the site and mechanism of action remain uncertain.</p><p>The authors clearly demonstrate that Rab3A plays a role in HSP at excitatory synapses, with substantially less plasticity occurring in the Rab3A KO neurons. There is also no apparent HSP in the Earlybird Rab3A mutation, although baseline synaptic strength is already elevated. In this context, it is unclear if the plasticity is absent, already induced by this mutation, or just occluded by a ceiling effect due to the synapses already being strengthened. Occlusion may also occur in the mixed cultures when Rab3A is missing from neurons but not astrocytes. The authors do appropriately discuss these options. The authors have solid data showing that Rab3A is unlikely to be active in astrocytes, Finally, they attempt to study the linkage between changes in synaptic strength and AMPA receptor trafficking during HSP, and conclude that trafficking may not be solely responsible for the changes in synaptic strength during HSP.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work adds another player into the mechanisms underlying an important form of synaptic plasticity. The plasticity is likely only reduced, suggesting Rab3A is only partially required and perhaps multiple mechanisms contribute. The authors speculate about some possible novel mechanisms, including whether Rab3A is active pre-synaptically to regulate quantal amplitude.</p><p>As Rab3A is primarily known as a pre-synaptic molecule, this possibility is intriguing. However, it is based on the partial dissociation of AMPAR trafficking and synaptic response and lacks strong support. On average, they saw a similar magnitude of change in mEPSC amplitude and GluA2 cluster area and integral, but the GluA2 data was not significant due to higher variability. It is difficult to determine if this is due to biology or methodology - the imaging method involves assessing puncta pairs (GluA2/VGlut1) clearly associated with a MAP2 labeled dendrite. This is a small subset of synapses, with usually less than 20 synapses per neuron analyzed, which would be expected to be more variable than mEPSC recordings averaged across several hundred events. However, when they reduce the mEPSC number of events to similar numbers as the imaging, the mESPC amplitudes are still less variable than the imaging data. The reason for this remains unclear. The pool of sampled synapses is still different between the methods and recent data has shown that synapses have variable responses during HSP. Further, there could be variability in the subunit composition of newly inserted AMPARs, and only assessing GluA2 could mask this (see below). It is intriguing that pre-synaptic changes might contribute to HSP, especially given the likely localization of Rab3A. But it remains difficult to distinguish if the apparent difference in imaging and electrophysiology is a methodological issue rather than a biological one. Stronger data, especially positive data on changes in release, will be necessary to conclude that pre-synaptic factors are required for HSP, beyond the established changes in post-synaptic receptor trafficking.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the concern that the lack of increase in receptors is due to a technical issue, please see General Response to Reviewers, above. We have also softened our conclusions throughout, acknowledging we cannot rule out a technical issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other questions arise from the NASPM experiments, used to justify looking at GluA2 (and not GluA1) in the immunostaining. First, there is a strong frequency effect that is unclear in origin. One would expect NASPM to merely block some fraction of the post-synaptic current, and not affect pre-synaptic release or block whole synapses. But the change in frequency seems to argue (as the authors do) that some synapses only have CP-AMPARs, while the rest of the synapses have few or none. Another possibility is that there are pre-synaptic NASPM-sensitive receptors that influence release probability. Further, the amplitude data show a strong trend towards smaller amplitude following NASPM treatment (Fig 3B). The p value for both control and TTX neurons was 0.08 - it is very difficult to argue that there is no effect. The decrease on average is larger in the TTX neurons, and some cells show a strong effect. It is possible there is some heterogeneity between neurons on whether GluA1/A2 heteromers or GluA1 homomers are added during HSP. This would impact the conclusions about the GluA2 imaging as compared to the mEPSC amplitude data.</p></disp-quote><p>The key finding in Figure 3 is that NASPM did not eliminate the statistically significant increase in mEPSC amplitude after TTX treatment (Fig 3A). Whether or not NASPM sensitive receptors contribute to mESPC amplitude is a separate question (Fig 3B). We are open to the possibility that NASPM reduces mEPSC amplitude in both control and TTX treated cells (p = 0.08 for both), but that does not change our conclusion that NASPM has no effect on the TTX-induced increase in mEPSC amplitude. The mechanism underlying the decrease in mEPSC frequency following NASPM is interesting, but does not alter our conclusions regarding the role of Rab3A in homeostatic synaptic plasticity of mEPSC amplitude. In addition, the Reviewer does not acknowledge the Supplemental Figure #1, which shows a similar lack of correspondence between homeostatic increases in mEPSC amplitude and GluA1 receptors in two cultures where matched data were obtained. Therefore, we do not think our lack of a robust increase in receptors can be explained by our failing to look at the relevant receptor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To understand the role of Rab3A in HSP will require addressing two main issues:</p><p>(1) Is Rab3A acting pre-synaptically, post-synaptically or both?

Without these data, we can only speculate that the Rab3A-dependence of homeostatic plasticity of quantal size in cortical neurons may be similar to that of the neuromuscular junction, where it cannot be receptors. We have added to the Discussion that the mechanism of Rab3A regulation of homeostatic plasticity of quantal amplitude could different between cortical neurons and the neuromuscular junction (lines 448-450 in markup,). Establishing a way to co-culture Rab3A-/- and Rab3A+/+ neurons in ratios that would allow us to record from a Rab3A-/- neuron that has mainly Rab3A+/+ inputs (or vice versa) is not impossible, but requires either transfection or transgenic expression with markers that identify the relevant genotype, and will be the subject of future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2): Rab3A is also found at inhibitory synapses.
