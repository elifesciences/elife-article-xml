To obtain a three-dimensional structure, a thin film of an aqueous solution containing the protein of interest must be cooled so rapidly that water molecules do not crystallise but form amorphous ice. Within this layer, ideally not much thicker than the particle itself, the particles must be partitioned in random orientations. The prevailing method for making thin specimens suitable for cryo-EM has not changed substantially since its introduction several decades ago: a filter paper is pressed against one or both sides of a fenestrated support film spanning a metallic mesh grid across which a droplet of the biological sample is suspended, and then rapidly plunged into a liquid cryogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrian et al., 1984</xref>). A recognised shortcoming of this method is that a reproducibly thin and consistently uniform ice layer can often not be achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carragher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armstrong et al., 2020</xref>). Frequently, time-consuming parameter optimisation is required to find conditions suitable for high-resolution imaging, and these conditions are typically different for each sample. Even if such conditions are found, additional problems encountered in practice include preferential orientation of particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noble et al., 2018</xref>), preferential interaction of particles with the support film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyerson et al., 2014</xref>) and partial denaturation of particles due to exposure to the large air-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Donaldson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glaeser and Han, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glaeser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noble et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DâImprima et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The inefficiency of current cryo-EM sample preparation approaches to yield reproducible results has led major efforts to explore different ways to make uniformly thin films, including the development of self-wicking grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2018</xref>), spraying small-volume droplets onto holey support films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rubinstein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kontziampasis et al., 2019</xref>) and direct thin film dispensing onto cryo-EM grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnold et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravelli et al., 2020</xref>). These developments have increased the speed of sample preparation and reduced the required sample volume by orders of magnitude. Perhaps surprisingly though, the core design of fenestrated EM grid supports has remained largely unchanged. Despite the accelerated sequence from sample deposition to vitrification, the exposure of particles to the air-water interface inherent to grid-based sample supports continues to pose a major obstacle for robust sample preparation workflows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klebl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glaeser, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The detrimental effects of an air-water interface could be avoided entirely if the sample were encapsulated within an enclosure made of a substrate sufficiently electron-transparent for high-contrast imaging of weak phase objects. Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LP-EM) has been widely applied to image liquids inside the vacuum of an electron microscope by enclosing them in liquid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peckys et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nishiyama et al., 2010</xref>). Microfabrication of LP-EM sample cells has drawn on advances in semiconductor-manufacturing processes, in particular the use of free-standing silicon nitride (SiN) membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ciarlo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ring et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gorelick et al., 2019</xref>). This approach has also been successfully employed for room temperature LP-EM of biological macromolecular specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mirsaidov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cameron Varano et al., 2015</xref>). To render liquid cells mechanically robust against elastic deformation caused by the pressure differential between the fluid-filled cell and the vacuum in the microscope column, LP-EM cells contain relatively thick (â¼30â50 nm) SiN membranes, whose additional scattering contributes structural noise that limits the attainable resolution.</p><p>In vitrified samples, the solidified water behaves as an ultra-viscous fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angell, 2002</xref>). In this case, elastic deflection of fluidic cells under a pressure difference is negligible, which offers opportunities for employing much thinner cells and membranes. Inspired by this prospect, we set out to design a nanofluidic sample cell for cryo-EM imaging. By miniaturising a sample-containing volume into a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) with ultrathin SiN membranes, we fabricated a cryo-EM sample support that allows cryo-EM imaging from picoliter sample volumes. We demonstrate the performance of this device by high-resolution 3D structure determination of three protein model systems, apoferritin, T20S proteasome, and tobacco mosaic virus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A nanofluidic sample support for cryo-EM imaging</title><p>To address common issues in cryo-EM grid preparation such as poor reproducibility of ice thickness, the destructive effect of the air-water interface and to broaden the scope of cryo-EM applications with the unique design flexibility of MEMS technology, we developed a novel cryo-EM sample support using nanofabrication techniques. We used a sacrificial polysilicon process for fabrication of a device featuring nanofluidic channels for controlled cryo-EM sample preparation and imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The nanochannels are enclosed by ultrathin membranes made from silicon-rich nitride (SiN<sub>x</sub>) that allow for transmission of the electron beam when a thin film containing the sample is encapsulated in the space between them. The core design of this device, which we refer to as cryoChip, consists of a 2 Ã 2 mm silicon base with 100 Âµm thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). A hollow microcantilever extends over the side of the chip base for sample application via capillary action. An aperture in the center of the silicon base exposes a 50 Ã 50 Âµm free-standing SiN<sub>x</sub> membrane containing parallel rows of nanochannels that are connected to the central supply and exit channels via multifurcations. Transversal silicon oxide layers provide mechanical stability and generate a regular grid of observation windows that are 6 Ã 4 Âµm in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Each observation window exposes a segment of the nanochannel for TEM imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). CryoChips differ in several fundamental aspects from grid-based sample supports: Instead of wicking a suspended droplet to a liquid film thin enough for transmission imaging, sample thickness in cryoChips is controlled by the geometry of electron-transparent nanochannels itself. The closed channel architecture avoids the air-water interface, which is replaced by a solid-liquid interface between the SiN<sub>x</sub> membrane and the sample solution. With minimal adaptions, cryoChips are fully compatible with the most frequently used cryo-EM sample carrier cartridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A nanofluidic sample support for cryo-EM.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the MEMS-based cryoChip.

In standard blotting-based sample preparation, parameters such as blot force and time, absorbent properties of the filter paper, as well as relative humidity and temperature of the sample environment need to be tightly controlled. Despite the availability of robotic vitrification systems, achieving good reproducibility of these parameters has remained difficult and substantial across-grid and grid-to-grid variation of ice quality are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carragher et al., 2019</xref>). MEMS-based nanofabrication provides a means to control sample thickness directly through channel geometry, obviating the need for a particular sample environment and optimisation of blotting conditions. To quantify the reproducibility of ice thickness in cryoChip nanochannels, we first determined the average thickness of the silicon nitride layer by replicating the SiN<sub>x</sub> deposition and etching protocol employed for device fabrication on a blank wafer area. Using ellipsometry we measured a film thickness of 9.5 Â± 0.2 nm for the final SiN<sub>x</sub> layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We then filled the chip and used zero-loss imaging to determine the thickness of ice-filled nanochannels from the ratio of the integrated intensity of the zero-loss peak <italic>I<sub>0</sub></italic> relative to the integral of the whole spectrum <italic>I</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). From the zero-loss log ratio of a SiN<sub>x</sub> area adjacent to the nanochannel (0.89) and the geometric film thickness determined by ellipsometry (19 nm, corresponding to the combined thickness of top and bottom membrane), we calculated the mean free path for inelastic scattering (IMFP) at 300 keV in SiN<sub>x</sub> as 163 nm, from which we estimate a combined water-equivalent thickness of 39 nm for the two SiN<sub>x</sub> membranes forming the nanochannel assuming an IMFP of 320 nm for vitreous ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yesibolati et al., 2020</xref>). We next mapped the apparent and absolute ice thickness at each image position. The channels display a concave profile in cross-section, leading to a gradient with a maximum thickness of ~100 nm at the channel wall and 0 nm at the channel center. These estimates are in agreement with those obtained from a tomographic reconstruction from the same image area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We evaluated the consistency of nanochannel geometry both across individual cryoChips and between different chips. The precision of the sacrificial layer deposition in the fabrication process permits tight control over the maximum channel height. The width of the nanochannels is consistent across individual chips, but can range from 650 nm to 1000 nm between different chips which we attribute to process variability and/or the chip position on the wafer during fabrication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rapid, loss-less preparation of cryo-EM samples via microcantilevers</title><p>To facilitate filling of the device from nanoliter sample droplets, we designed a hollow microchannel cantilever that allows sample application via spontaneous capillary flow without requirement for external appliances. The hollow microchannel cantilever extends only 100 Âµm over the chip base. To allow efficient targeting of the cantilever, we built a loading station consisting of a microvolume positive displacement syringe mounted on a linear XYZ precision stage, as well as top and side-view cameras to monitor the approach of the nozzle and filling process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The syringe nozzle is translated into close vicinity of the cantilever tip and a nanoliter droplet is formed. Manual handling of the syringe and the geometry of the nozzle currently limit the minimum droplet volume to about 10â40 nL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The cantilever is then dipped into the nanodroplet. Upon contact with the cantilever tip, a small sample volume is drawn into the cantilever by capillary forces and subsequently distributed across the central nanochannels via the multifurcation connected to the entry microchannel (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2âvideo 2</xref>). From the geometry of the overall channel design, we estimate the total filling volume to be ~4 pL (see Materials and methods), which is about six orders of magnitude less compared to typical sample volumes of conventional blotting-based methods. Residual sample of the filling droplet can be readily recovered.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sample preparation with cryoChips.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Manual filling station with side view and top view microscope, microvolume glass syringe, xyz precision stages for translation of the syringe and a mount for tweezers holding a cryoChip.

We observed the movement of the liquid front to be proportional to the square root of time, which is in accordance with classical Washburn kinetics for capillary flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Washburn, 1921</xref>). Filling is rapid and complete filling of the entry channel proceeds at an average of ~1 mm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The filling speed is fast at the beginning and slows down with progression of the liquid front, as predicted by the Washburn equation. We found similar behaviour across the chips that were analysed, suggesting that we can achieve high channel-to-channel reproducibility during fabrication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The entire filling process can be executed in a lab environment without humidity control and there is no further requirement for parameter optimisation other than sample concentration. After sample filling, the chip can be transferred to any manual or robotic vitrification device for flash cooling in liquid cryogen. In our experiments, the total time from filling to vitrification was approximately 10 s. This process could be readily accelerated by integrating the filling mechanism directly on a vitrification system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Automated cryo-EM data collection with cryoChips</title><p>The checkerboard pattern from the silicon oxide layers on the observation membrane structures the nanochannel array into a regular grid of 30 observation squares, each comprising a segment of an individual nanochannel and flanking areas of the SiN<sub>x</sub> membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). Due to the different layout of the cryoChip, standardised data acquisition protocols established for holey support film substrates cannot be applied without modification. To develop an automated data acquisition strategy for cryoChips, we first acquired a grid map of the entire observation membrane using SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>).

We used virtual maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schorb et al., 2019</xref>) generated from medium magnification images to accurately realign to the acquisition points during high-magnification acquisition. For each of the acquisition points, three images were acquired radially around the midpoint using beam-image shift, resulting in up to 540 images per cryoChip.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Automated data acquisition with cryoChips.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) TEM image of the observation membrane with five nanochannels.

The low magnification maps revealed that most observation squares were suitable for data collection. We occasionally observed partially broken or cracked membranes. Observation squares in such areas were omitted for data collection. Micrographs for all three specimens showed good image contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). To examine the compatibility of cryoChips with the condition to form vitreous ice, we evaluated the fraction of images containing crystalline ice by manual inspection for the presence of ice rings or crystalline reflections in the computed power spectra from all images. This led to a fraction of 86% (815/945), 75% (91/121), and 52% (43/82) of images that we classified as containing vitreous ice for ApoFtn, T20S and TMV respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

It is possible that the fraction of vitreous images is underestimated since we did not discriminate between ice features originating from surface contamination and those originating from crystalline ice in the nanochannels. To investigate whether non-vitreous images are a result of inefficient vitrification or phase transition to cubic ice during exposure, we analysed a subset of images classified as icy. From a maximum intensity projection of all power spectra of all images, we find evidence for hexagonal ice indicating incomplete vitrification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

This effect is equivalent to an apparent increase in ice thickness, which even for particles in the thinnest parts of the nanochannel may lead to an (apparent) ice thickness significantly greater than the size of the particle itself. This is undesirable because it leads to a corresponding loss of useful signal in the image, thereby reducing image contrast. To test whether this additional scattering limits our ability to extract high-resolution signal for particle alignment, we used automatic particle picking in cryoSPARC 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) to extract particles (segments for TMV) and performed 2D classification. For all three specimens, we observe high-contrast 2D class averages with visible features indicative of secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4âfigure supplement 6</xref>), suggesting that images contain sufficient contrast for high-resolution structure determination. To probe the resolution limit of data collected using the cryoChip, we merged data from three chips filled with ApoFtn acquired on a Titan Krios equipped with a post-GIF K2 camera and processed it in a standard single-particle analysis workflow. We used 2D and 3D classification to select a final set of 21,238 particles (O symmetry) from 815 micrographs and after 3D refinement obtained a reconstruction at an overall resolution of 3.0 Ã displaying visible side chain densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c/d</xref>). The reference model for 3D alignment was generated from the data itself using the stochastic gradient descent method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that the quality of data collected from cryoChips is sufficient to allow initial model generation even for samples considered difficult for reference model generation. To demonstrate the versatility of cryoChips for structure determination from a variety of biological specimens, we also processed the datasets for TMV and T20S proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4âfigure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4âfigure supplement 6</xref>). These datasets were collected on a JEOL JEM3200-FSC with a K2 detector and yielded 3D reconstructions with overall resolutions of 3.7 Ã and 5.4 Ã obtained from 14,238 segments (20 asu/segment) and 5750 particles (D7), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The quality of a dataset is often quantified from a plot of the inverse-squared resolution as a function of the number of particles used in the 3D reconstruction. The slope of this function is related to a B-factor that describes the width of a Gaussian dampening function in reciprocal space used to model the loss of high-resolution information in particle images owing to a combined effect of performance-reducing factors related to the sample, data collection and instrumentation, and data processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>). We quantified the B-factors for each of the three datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). For comparison, we also acquired datasets for ApoFtn and T20S on conventional holey carbon supports with the same acquisition parameters, yielding reconstructions at an overall resolution of 2.4 and 3.2 Ã (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4âfigure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This leads to B-factors of 217 Ã<sup>2</sup> vs. 178 Ã<sup>2</sup> for ApoFtn and 490 Ã<sup>2</sup> vs. 328 Ã<sup>2</sup> for T20S determined for cryoChip and holey carbon datasets, respectively. We also note a consistent upward shift of the offset for holey carbon B-factor plots compared to those from cryoChips, consistent with the differences in overall signal-to-noise ratio caused by additional scattering from the SiN<sub>x</sub> membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Beam-induced specimen motion is comparable to standard cryo-EM supports</title><p>Beam-induced motion is a major factor limiting the achievable resolution of 3D reconstructions. The highest rate of change in particle position is typically largest at cumulative exposures below ~4e<sup>-</sup>/Ã<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vinothkumar and Henderson, 2016</xref>), coinciding with the frames where the sample is yet least affected by radiation damage and high-resolution signal is best preserved. The fast read-out rates of direct electron detection technology have made it possible to acquire cryo-EM data as dose-fractionated movies where the total exposure is subdivided into a series of individual frames. To reduce information loss, alignment of these frames can be used to determine the overall inter-frame movement of the specimen in the micrograph during the exposure and then correct for this motion before summation of the frame stack. To investigate beam-induced sample movement in cryoChips, we computed and analysed the alignment trajectories for the ApoFtn dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). The calculated traces show that movement is largely unidirectional, but clusters into several distinct directions of motion. To further investigate the trajectories, we separated them either by chip or by the beam-image shift condition corresponding to the shot position in the multishot acquisition scheme for each acquisition point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For each of the chips analysed, we observe three clusters of directional motion, each associated with one of the three shot positions. While the precise origin for this clustering needs further investigation, we suggest that different thickness and geometry of the confined ice layer in the subregions for each of the multishot positions may lead to preferential directionality of specimen movement, possibly combined with microlensing effects resulting from adjacent exposures that induce the build-up of semi-static charge on the non-conductive SiN<sub>x</sub> membrane.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Comparison of beam-induced motion for cryoChip and reference datasets from conventional sample preparation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Whole-frame motion trajectories of dose-fractionated movies during exposure with 63 e<sup>-</sup>/Ã<sup>2</sup> from three different cryoChips.

The closed sample environment of the cryoChip avoids the problems of an air-water interface, but the large surface-to-volume ratio of the nanochannels forms an extensive solid-liquid interface between the SiN<sub>x</sub> surface and the particle solution. We performed tomographic reconstructions of protein-loaded cryoChips to investigate particle distributions inside the nanochannels. The tomographic reconstructions confirm the overall geometry of the channels with an estimated height in cross-section ranging between 0 and 100 nm and a channel width of ~750 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a/b</xref>). In all cases, we find the majority of particles close to or associated with the SiN<sub>x</sub> membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6âvideo 1</xref>). Analysis of the orientation distribution showed increased abundance of views along the fourfold rotation axis for ApoFtn, indicating preferential alignment of particles with the SiN<sub>x</sub> membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, we find preferential abundance of side views for T20S particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4âfigure supplement 6</xref>). We did not observe convincing correlation of preferred orientations with the molecular electrostatic potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>). We note that the current analysis is limited to particles with internal symmetry for which preferred orientations are less problematic. Further investigation will be required to conclude whether systematic effects for preferred protein adsorption to the solid-liquid interface exist and need to be addressed. Micrographs from datasets of all three specimen display particle densities exceeding those expected from conventional cryo-EM grids prepared with the same specimens and sample concentrations. To quantify this concentration effect, we estimated the particle concentration in the nanochannels by segmenting and counting ApoFtn particles, and measuring the channel volume from the reconstructed tomogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We find 1483 ApoFtn particles within a 9.4 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> nm<sup>3</sup> volume, equivalent to a concentration of 262 ÂµM or 126 mg/mL assuming 480 kDa molecular mass. This is a 37-fold increase in concentration compared to the initial sample concentration of 3.4 mg/mL. Interaction with the solid-liquid interface at the SiN<sub>x</sub> channel walls thus strongly affects the effective sample concentration in the nanochannels. Similar concentration effects have also been reported for traditional sample preparation methods, such as repeated sample application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Snijder et al., 2017</xref>) and in the presence of very thin ice for which densely packed protein monolayers have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yip et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Tomographic reconstruction of a cryoChip nanochannel filled with ApoFtn.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview image of tomogram area of a nanochannel segment filled with ApoFtn.

All existing approaches to cryo-EM sample preparation rely on the ill-controlled formation of thin ice layers across fenestrated support films, which results in poor reproducibility and may detrimentally affect particle distribution, orientation and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DâImprima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noble et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glaeser and Han, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glaeser, 2018</xref>). Recent improvements to the support grids and to how the sample is applied have begun to address these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DâImprima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Naydenova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnold et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drulyte et al., 2018</xref>). Despite these advances important issues remain, most prominently the hydrophobic environment of the air-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klebl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glaeser, 2021</xref>). Here, we have shown that MEMS-based nanofluidic chips in which the sample is enclosed and protected from the air-water interface within electron-transparent nanochannels provide a viable alternative for cryo-EM sample preparation that mitigates some of the prevalent issues observed for grid-based sample supports. We demonstrated that biological specimens in cryoChips can be successfully vitrified and that the thickness uniformity of the ice layer can be reproducibly controlled by channel geometry. We found the width and height of the nanochannels to be highly consistent across individual cryoChips, providing uniform imaging conditions for all parts of a chip.</p><p>The most widely applied methods for cryo-EM sample preparation currently require ~3 ÂµL of sample volume per grid. Assuming a final liquid film of 20â100 nm thickness spanning a 3.05 mm EM support grid, the required sample volume for imaging is only 1.5â7.0 fL, which is nine orders of magnitude less than the initial sample volume. Several recent developments are trying to reduce this gap: The Chameleon/Spotiton instrument eliminates sample waste from the blotting step by applying nanoliter sample volumes onto self-wicking grids via a piezo-electric droplet dispenser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, the VitroJet and Cryo-writer (pin-)print sub-nanoliter volumes directly onto a small area of the cryo-EM grid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnold et al., 2017</xref>). The cryoChip presented here further reduces the required sample volume by 1000-fold to only a few picoliters, approaching the practical minimum for liquid handling in cryo-EM structure determination. The cantilever-based sample application efficiently drives chip filling via capillary action, thus allowing essentially loss-less cryo-EM sample preparation. Together with the highly reproducible sample thickness we expect these properties to accelerate developments towards full automation of the cryo-EM sample preparation process. Notably, sample preparation using cryoChips does not require humidity control and is compatible with any standard plunger available in cryo-EM laboratories.</p><p>Using cryoChip supports, we demonstrated ab initio structure determination for three different test specimen resolved at resolutions suitable for mechanistic interpretation even from datasets with a comparatively small set of particles. The diversity in shape, size, and physico-chemical properties of the macromolecular complexes suggests that cryoChip sample preparation should be applicable for routine cryo-EM imaging of a wide variety of different macromolecular targets. Several aspects bear potential for future improvement. Despite our predictions from heat transfer simulations, we observed that between 10% and 40% of images contain non-vitreous ice. Several factors may contribute to this discrepancy. Firstly, it is possible that cryogen is displaced by the chip base upon entering the cryogen, preventing complete wetting of the chip; or that air is trapped in the depression on the chip base below the free-standing observation membrane, preventing contact with the coolant and impeding heat transfer from the nanochannels. Secondly, the observation membrane is located at the chip center which could affect probability of vitrification, consistent with the spatial distribution of isotherms reported for standard holey film grids during immersion cooling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kasas et al., 2003</xref>). Parameters for existing plunging instruments have been optimised to maximise vitrification efficiency for holey film supports and it is conceivable that different plunging speed or depth, or jet-based cooling, may be more appropriate for cryoChips.</p><p>In standard cryo-EM sample preparation using holey support grids, the blotting process leaves a very thin layer of sample that can be imaged with high contrast and minimal secondary scattering from the particle-embedding ice layer. In cryoChips, the concave cross-sectional shape of the nanochannel produces a defined thickness gradient within which particles naturally partition into monolayers according to their molecular dimensions in the thinner parts of the channel, thus minimising background scattering from surrounding ice. The sample confinement in cryoChip nanochannels, however, comes with the penalty of additional incoherent scattering from the enclosing SiN<sub>x</sub> membranes, which results in reduced image contrast compared to ideal samples. By quantifying the additional scattering from the nanochannel membranes as an effective increase in ice thickness, we estimate the minimal scattering mass of particles that can still be successfully detected and aligned under these conditions to ~200 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henderson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). This should render cryoChips suitable for imaging a wide range of relevant protein targets for cryo-EM structure determination.</p><p>Apart from incoherent scattering contributions by the SiN<sub>x</sub> membrane, several other factors may currently limit resolution: Firstly, spectral properties of structural noise contributed by the SiN<sub>x</sub> membranes are different from those of vitreous ice, and secondly, there may be interference of signal from SiN<sub>x</sub> membranes and particles located at different focal heights within the nanochannel that may affect accuracy of CTF estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tichelaar et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). It is possible that assumptions on image statistics in current 3D reconstruction algorithms are sub-optimal for particles from cryoChips and improvements could be gained with modified software.</p><p>Another general problem in cryo-EM is the degradation of image quality through electron radiationâinduced particle movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McMullan et al., 2009</xref>). Beam-induced movement is assumed to be the result of a complex combination of radiolysis, charge build-up around the irradiation area and mechanical stress release during irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glaeser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brilot et al., 2012</xref>). Several of these factors are of relevance for cryoChips. First, nanochannels are closed volumes implying that molecular hydrogen formed as a product of electron-beam induced radiolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aronova et al., 2011</xref>) cannot escape. Trapped gas may lead to pressure build-up inside the nanochannel and ultimately specimen movement. Second, SiN<sub>x</sub> is a poor conductor (resistivity &gt;10<sup>14</sup> <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Î©</mml:mi><mml:mo>â¢</mml:mo><mml:mi>cm</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> at room temperature), suggesting that impaired charge dissipation could affect the observed specimen movement. While we found overall specimen movement in cryoChips to be higher than for modified support films, the residual particle displacement is not limiting for ~2 Ã reconstructions and hence in a range suitable for high-resolution map interpretation.</p><p>Tomographic reconstructions of sample-filled nanochannels showed that proteins preferentially partition to the solid-liquid interface of the nanochannel surface. This is consistent with observations using modified EM grids that contain surface substrates spanning the holey support film (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DâImprima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Naydenova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russo and Passmore, 2014</xref>). While this may appear to raise issues similar to adsorption at the air-water interface, the nature of the interaction with these surfaces is fundamentally different. The air-water interface is hydrophobic and adsorption of proteins to the interface can drive partial or complete unfolding to minimise the free energy of interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glaeser, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DâImprima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noble et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, similar to oxidised graphene, the polar SiN<sub>x</sub> surface is hydrophilic and adsorption of proteins is primarily mediated by the zeta potential of the interfacial electrical double layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Norde, 1986</xref>). Consistently, for the three cases we investigated we do not observe that this interaction promotes denaturation or aberrant structural changes. It is entirely possible that the charge distribution between the molecular electrostatic potential and at the solid-liquid interface could promote preferential alignment and hence carry the risk of systematic bias in particle orientation. For the cases studied we did not find evidence for pronounced preferred orientation and could not identify strong correlation of enriched views with the molecular electrostatic potential.</p><p>We also observed that the strong interaction at the solid-liquid interface effectively concentrates the solute particles in the nanochannels, consistent with observations for other substrates providing solid-liquid interfaces such as hydrogenated graphene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russo and Passmore, 2014</xref>). While this is principally beneficial for concentrating dilute protein solutions to particle densities suitable for imaging, it also affects design considerations for the filling channels. In early design iterations of the cryoChips that featured narrow filling and exit channels, we observed apparent depletion of the protein sample before it reached the observation nanochannels. This effect was further aggrevated with samples containing high surface charge densities. We attribute this to the very large surface-to-volume ratio of nanochannels, which we suspect may bear the risk to deplete solute proteins through interactions with the SiN walls in the filling channel, thus gradually reducing the free protein concentration in solution as they travel towards the observation membrane. The increased diameter of the filling channel in the current cryoChip design substantially improved the efficacy for reaching suitable particle concentrations in the nanochannels of the observation membrane. With solid-liquid interfaces gaining importance also for existing cryo-EM supports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DâImprima et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Naydenova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naydenova et al., 2020</xref>), further studies are needed to reveal the detailed dynamics and underlying mechanisms of particle adsorption to such interfaces, and to systematically investigate their effects on particle integrity and orientation.</p><p>Just as continuous developments have pushed the limit of achievable contrast and residual specimen movement for holey support films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naydenova et al., 2020</xref>), we expect that similar progress can be attained for nanofluidic supports by further improvements in electron transparency, as well as electrical and thermal conductance of the enclosing materials. We anticipate that ongoing developments will eventually allow approaching resolutions and conditions realised for ideal samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We predict that the cryoChip is only the beginning of a range of future cryo-EM supports building on MEMS technology. Several immediate improvements can be achieved with minor modifications to our current design. Currently the observation membrane is 50 Âµm x 50 Âµm, representing less than 0.1% of the entire chip area. The imaging area can be readily extended by additional observation membranes, thus allowing fully automated collection of thousands of images with uniform ice thickness from a single chip. Parallel arrangements of observation membranes with separate filling channels will allow screening different samples on the same chip. Beyond this, the versatility of nanofabrication technology opens up possibilities to facilitate a range of new cryo-EM applications by bridging lab-on-a-chip approaches with structural biology. These include possibilities for on-chip mixing, parallelised high-throughput screening for structure-based drug discovery, time-resolved experiments, on-chip purification of complex protein mixtures and the combination of structure determination with biophysical measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

fabrication</title><p>The cryoChip is fabricated using a wafer-scale surface micromachining process. The fluidic components, such as hollow cantilevers, thick-walled supply- and exit channels, and thin-walled nanochannels, are all formed by sacrificial polysilicon etching techniques. The fabrication process starts on a 4 inches, &lt;100&gt;-oriented silicon wafer of 380 Âµm thickness. The wafer is locally thinned from the backside to form silicon membranes with a thickness of 180 Âµm, in which later the cryoChip membrane will be formed. The backside processing is performed by anisotropic wet etching of silicon in a 25% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution at 75Â°C. A 50-nm-thick stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) layer is used as the masking material for the KOH etch. After the KOH etching the masking layer is removed in concentrated hydrofluoric acid (HF 49%). On the locally thinned wafer, a 300-nm-thick silicon oxide layer is deposited in a low-pressure chemical vapour deposition (LPCVD) oven by pyrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). The silicon oxide layer is patterned by buffered hydrofluoric acid (BHF). Silicon oxide is removed from an area where ultra-thin walled observation nanochannels will be formed. On the patterned substrate, an 11-nm silicon-rich nitride (SiN<sub>x</sub>) layer is deposited by LPCVD. This low-stress SiN<sub>x</sub> layer serves as a bottom wall of the TEM observation windows, which will be created later. Next, a sacrificial layer of polysilicon with a thickness of 300 nm is deposited by LPCVD. This relatively thick polysilicon layer will be used to create the supply- and exit channels and a large fluidic channel inside the hollow cantilevers. The deposited polysilicon layer is patterned by tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). The layer is removed from a region where later the observation nanochannels will be formed. After the TMAH patterning, another sacrificial polysilicon layer with a thickness of 100 nm is deposited by LPCVD The thickness of the second sacrificial layer determines the height of the small fluidic channels and the height of the TEM observation windows. On the other hand, the aggregate thickness of the first and the second polysilicon layer, which is 400 nm in our design, determines the height of the larger fluidic channels. After the deposition, sacrificial polysilicon is patterned by TMAH etching to define an outline of the fluidic channels. A rather thin thermally grown silicon oxide layer (40 nm) is used as an etching mask. It should be noted that both large (400 nm) and small (100 nm) fluidic channels are etched at the same time. The underetching of the mask, due to an isotropic nature of the TMAH etch process, is used to reduce the width of the fluidic channels in which the TEM observation windows will be formed. After patterning of the fluidic channels, the second silicon-rich nitride layer is deposited by LPCVD. The 11-nm-thick low-stress SiN<sub>x</sub> layer will define a top wall of the TEM observation windows. Thereafter, a 300-nm-thick silicon oxide layer is deposited by TEOS pyrolysis. A multilayer of SiN<sub>x</sub> and silicon oxide will form the walls of the hollow cantilevers and some fluidic channels. The relatively large thickness of these walls provides mechanical stability of these components. After patterning of the second TEOS layer in BHF the TEM observation windows are completely defined. Subsequently, the TEOS/SiN<sub>x</sub>/SiN<sub>x</sub>/TEOS multilayer is etched by reactive ion etching (RIE). In this processing step, the contour of the chip and the hollow cantilevers are patterned. After the RIE etching, an access to the bulk silicon is created. By using Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) the bulk silicon is etched from the front side to a depth of 150 Âµm. Finally, the wafer is placed in a 25% TMAH solution heated at 90Â°C. During the TMAH etching, sacrificial polysilicon is removed through the access holes and the fluidic channels are created. These temporary access holes are automatically sealed after final drying of the samples. At the same time, the bulk silicon is exposed to TMAH. A part of the bulk silicon underneath the TEM observation window is removed creating a suspended membrane with integrated thin-walled fluidic nanochannels. The bulk underneath the cantilevers is also removed and the cantilevers are released. During the TMAH etching the backside of the wafer remains unprotected. Due to the removal of silicon the cryoChip is further thinned down to its final thickness of 100 Âµm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Filling volume</title><p>The filling volume entering the chip through the cantilever was estimated from the chip geometry. The supply microchannel is about 1 mm long, 0.4 Âµm high, and 4 Âµm wide, which results in an estimated volume of ~2 pL. The five nanochannels for imaging are 50 Âµm long, ~750 nm wide, and 100 nm high, which (assuming a parabolic profile) yields an aggregate volume of 6.25 fL, negligible compared to the microchannel volume. Assuming the liquid fills the entire entry microchannel and exit microchannel, the total filling volume is ~4 pL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>SEM imaging and FIB</title><p>SEM imaging of cryoChips was performed on a Helios G4 CX DualBeam FIB/SEM system (ThermoFisher Scientific) at Ã35,000 magnification using the TLD detector.

Grayscale SEM images were coloured in Adobe Photoshop according to the schematic representations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Thickness measurements of silicon nitride</title><p>For thickness determination of the ultrathin silicon nitride layer surrounding the nanochannels, we deposited a silicon-rich nitride layer on a dummy wafer using the same deposition parameters as used for cryoChip fabrication. The dummy wafer was annealed at 1100Â°C. Next, the wafer was etched for 1 min in HF 1% solution (âetch 1â). In our fabrication process, the HF 1% dip is used to remove a native oxide layer from silicon prior to the TMAH etchings. Then the dummy wafer was etched in TMAH 25% solution at 90Â°C (âetch 2â). The same etching time is used in our fabrication process to release the samples. The thickness of the SiN<sub>x</sub> layer after deposition and both etching steps was measured on 25 positions of the wafer by ellipsometry.</p><p>For thickness determination by energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM), we acquired images of a filled nanochannel at 8000x magnification (4.706 Ã/pixel) on a JEOL JEM3200-FSC operated at 300 kV (K2 detector) with and without a 20 eV slit (centered at 0 eV) inserted below the omega filter. Images were recorded on a Gatan K2 direct electron detector.

A 10 Î¼L positive displacement microvolume glass syringe (Hamilton) was mounted on a xyz translation stage for precise position control of a sample droplet relative to the sample application cantilever of a cryoChip. Two Toolcraft USB-microscopes (Conrad Electronics GmbH, Germany) were used for a top and side view of the filling process with video acquisition control on a computer. The transparent front cap was removed from the microscopes to increase the working distance. Both microscopes were mounted on an xy translation stage to orient the field of view. All experiments were done under ambient conditions without temperature or humidity control. A cryoChip was gripped on its edge with tweezers and positioned on a metal bearing for rapid and reproducible positioning in the field of view. Approximately 0.2 ÂµL of sample was aspirated with the microvolume syringe. The syringe tip was dried with a tissue to avoid wetting of the tip during droplet extrusion. The syringe was mounted on the loading station and a small droplet of ~10-40 nL was extruded from the syringe. Using the xyz stage, the droplet was brought into contact with the cantilever tip. Within seconds, the liquid fills the entry microchannel, the nanochannels and parts of the exit microchannel. The liquid in the syringe was typically sufficient to fill many chips by drying the tip again with a tissue and extruding a new droplet. We did not observe a change in hydrophilic character of the cryoChip or reduction in chip filling capacity over a period of several month. Approximately 2-3 s after immersing the cantilever tip into the sample droplet, the tweezer with the chip was removed from the loading station and transferred on a Leica EM GP2 vitrification robot set to 20Â°C. The plunger was set to blot for zero seconds and the chip was plunged immediately into liquid ethane kept at -180Â°C. The time between removing the tweezer and chip from the filling station and plunge freezing was ~10 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electron cryo-tomography</title><p>A cryoChip with ApoFtn at 3.4 mg/mL concentration was prepared as described above and stored in liquid nitrogen until imaging.

Patch-motion correction and patched CTF estimation was followed by manual curation of micrographs to remove images with visible ice reflections in the power spectra, retaining 815 micrographs. Particles were picked with the blob-picker and subjected to 2D classification to obtain a picking reference. The reference was low-pass filtered to 20 Ã and was used to pick 318,058 ApoFtn particles.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Nikolaus Grigorieff as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor.

We followed the suggestion of the reviewer and analysed the spectral properties of SiN. In Figure 6 âfigure supplement 2 we compare Fourier spectra of the 19 nm SiN membranes next to the nanochannels, containing only SiN and no ice or protein and Fourier spectra from ice-filled nanochannels with 9.5 nm SiN top and bottom membranes. Unlike amorphous carbon for which scattering power monotonically decreases with increasing spatial frequency, for SiN we find a broad scattering peak centred around 1/3.9 Ã<sup>-1</sup>, indicating correlations in the local structure of the amorphous SiN. These spectra also illustrate the interference of Thon ring modulations from the indepentently scattering top and bottom membranes, leading to nodes in the overall CTF that may affect accurate CTF estimation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is there a reason for not choosing a membrane protein as one of the application examples?

We did not explore these in the current report as we had no such sample available and experimental opportunities were limited due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploring the utility of cryoChip as sample support for a broad range of biological specimen will be an important direction in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Page 1: It might be better to delete &quot;to about 30 Ã&quot; at the end of the paragraph since it is difficult to isolate the cause of this limited resolution to the membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed this part of the sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4: Could the authors show an apoferritin class average along the 3-fold axis? If they do not see one, they should point this out as this would indicate a &quot;preferred orientation&quot; problem.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included all 2D class averages of ApoFtn in Figure 4 âfigure supplement 4. We do not see a class average precisely aligned along the three-fold axis, but we do see class averages representative of orientations different from that aligned along the 4-fold axis. The orientation distribution plot in Figure 4 âfigure supplement 4 indicates, as stated in the manuscript, a slight overrepresentation of views along the 4-fold axis, which is similarly frequently observed for this specimen on conventional sample supports.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Page 6: The authors should explain the difference between the B-factor and the Debye-Waller factor.</p></disp-quote><p>We realise that the original sentence on p.6 was confusing and have rephrased it as follows:</p><p>âThe slope of this function is related to a B-factor that describes the width of a Gaussian dampening function in reciprocal space. This B-factor is used to model the loss of high-resolution information in particle images owing to a combined effect of performance-reducing factors related to the sample, data collection, and data processing (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Page 6: The authors state that the observed B-factors are in the range of what is observed in other studies. However, in studies of apoferritin, TMV and proteasomes, the B-factors are typically much smaller. Presumably, the B-factors depend primarily on the blurring (beam-induced motion) of the sample, and not so much on the background added by the SiN membranes. The authors should discuss why their B-factors are higher than those observed in other studies of these samples, and also why the proteasome reconstruction is so much worse than the other two reconstructions.</p></disp-quote><p>To investigate this point further, we also acquired reference datasets for ApoFtn and T20S on conventional holey carbon support films on the same microscope and using the same acquisiton settings. The results of these experiments are summarised in a new Figure 4 âfigure supplement 7/Supplementary Table 2. As correctly assumed by the reviewer, we find the B-factors for cryoChip datasets to be higher than for the refernce datasets from holey carbon supports. A comparative analysis of the motion trajectories for both EM supports underpins the assumption that this difference is predominantly related to an increase in overall beam-induced motion for cryoChips (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 7b,c). One additional difference we observe is a consistent upward shift of the B-factor plots for the holey carbon datasets. The slope of the Bfactor plot represents the information decay as a function of spatial frequency, while the offset of the curve is related to the overall signal-to-noise ratio in the data. The upward shift of the B-factor plots for data from holey carbon films is thus consistent with a increase in image contrast for these data compared to data acquired on cryoChips. We added the following paragraph to the Results section:</p><p>âFor comparison, we also acquired datasets for ApoFtn and T20S on conventional holey carbon supports on the same microscope and with the same acquisition parameters, yielding reconstructions at an overall resolution of 2.4 and 3.2 Ã (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 7, Supplementary Table 2). We computed B-factor plots for all datasets resulting in B-factors of 217 Ã2/178 Ã2 for ApoFtn and 490 Ã2/328 Ã2 for T20S determined for cryoChip and holey carbon datasets, respectively. We also note a consistent upward shift of the offset for B-factor plots from holey carbon compared to those from cryoChips, consistent with the differences in overall signal-to-noise ratio caused by additional scattering from the SiNx membranes.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 6: As the authors point out, the tomogram suggests that particles adhere to the solid-liquid interface. Does this lead to a depletion of particles in cavities that are located further away from the filling cantilever? If the authors have data to answer this question, this might be useful to show.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not observe obvious differences in concentration throughout the nanochannels. In earlier chip iterations not reported in the manuscript, which featured shorter supply and exit channels, we observed a gradient of particle depletion from the start towards the end of the observation channels, suggesting adherence of particles to the solid-liquid interface (as conjectured by the reviewer, and also mentioned in the original discussion (p.10)). In the current version of the cryoChip, the liquid passes through a 1 mm long entry channel with a larger cross-section, is then drawn through the observation cavities, and exits into a 1 mm of exit channel with large cross-section. We assume that drawing a large enough volume through the cavities will lead to saturation of the solid-liquid interfaces in the cavity walls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Page 9: The authors state that they do not observe denaturation of their samples at the solid-liquid interface. They should describe what they expect a denatured sample to look like, and how they would detect this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we do not have definite proof for the absence of sample denaturation. We base our statement on indirect evidence from the absence of 2D classes representing partial complexes (e.g. proteasomes with less than 14 units, or broken apoferritin shells). The fact that we achieve high-resolution 3D reconstructions from a significant fraction of overall particles further suggests that denaturation cannot be a very prominent phenomenon at least for the samples studied here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Congratulations â excellent work!</p><p>If you have any data about how long your chips can retain their hydrophilic character during storage before use, this may be a valuable addition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not systematically tested this, but have been reusing cryoChips over a period of &gt;6 months after storage in the lab without further precautions and did not find evidence for reduced filling capacity over this period. We have added the following sentence to the Methods section:</p><p>âWe did not observe a change in hydrophilic character of the cryoChip, or reduction in chip filling capacity over a period of several months.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Concerning the ice in the samples, the authors should not quantify how many images had vitreous ice, because most images had. Instead, the authors should quantify how many images shows ice crystals, in addition to the vitreous areas. Is that cubic or hexagonal ice?</p></disp-quote><p>Our way of categorising images into non-vitreous/vitreous was chosen because it is a typical part in our processing workflow for any cryo-EM dataset, where we usually exclude images with strong ice reflections in their Fourier spectra. This might lead to exclusion of too many images, as some might have crystalline surface ice contamination, or only partial crystallinity.</p><p>We analysed some of the micrographs categorised as containing crystalline ice (summarised in Figure 4 âfigure supplement 3) and show that they are almost entirely crystalline. For a subset of images, we tried to discriminate whether the ice is cubic or hexagonal. Pure hexagonal ice has 7 diffraction rings between 4 and 1.6 Ã resolution, whereas cubic ice has three diffraction rings, the locations of which conincide with those of the (002), (110) and (112) hexagonal ice rings. We used the strong (100) reflection at 3.90 Ã to uniquely identify hexagonal ice. All images had a strong (100) reflection corresponding to hexagonal ice; due to the overlap of cubic ice reflections with the hexagonal lattice and the weak intensity of (102) and (103) reflections in Fourier spectra computed from images, we cannot confidently say whether the images do also contain cubic ice. For a global analysis, we computed a maximum intensity projection of all Fourier spectra from the entire ApoFtn dataset to collect all ice reflections combined in a single Fourier spectrum. A rotational average of this spectrum displays a strong (100) reflection at 3.90 Ã. In view of these data, we suggest that most likely explanation for non-vitreous areas is that the cooling rate at some parts of the observation membrane was too slow to enable glass transition, and that the predominant ice type is hexagonal. As discussed, we cannot exclude that non-vitreous areas contain a mix of hexagonal and cubic ice, but suggest that this is less likely as it would require heating of the specimen above the glass transition temperature during handling, or during exposure.</p><p>We added the following sentences to the Results section on p.7:</p><p>âTo investigate whether non-vitreous images are a result of inefficient vitrification or phase transition to cubic ice during exposure, we analysed a subset of images classified as icy. From a maximum intensity projection of all power spectra of all images, we find evidence for hexagonal ice indicating incomplete vitrification (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 3).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does it melt rapidly during imaging (as surface contamination sometimes does), or is it stable under the bean and therefore in the bulk sample?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we examined Fourier spectra of a subset of videos from the ApoFtn dataset as a function of exposure and did not observe significant intensity changes for ice reflections (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 3b). This favours a scenario in which the ice reflections originate from crystalline ice in the channels and not from surface ice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
