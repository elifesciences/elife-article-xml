In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying taste perception have been extensively studied, revealing a complex and highly specialized system for detecting different tastants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Montell, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shrestha and Lee, 2023b</xref>). Sour taste has been shown to play an important role in determining feeding preferences and mediating aversive responses to noxious compounds. Sour taste is evoked by the hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) in acidic compounds, regulating dietary intake and pH balance. In mammals, low pH is detected by proton channels like otopetrin 1 (Otop1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, otopetrin-like A (OtopLA), a conserved proton channel, is proposed to be necessary for acid sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganguly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mi et al., 2021</xref>). Previous research indicates that taste perception of sourness involves protons, anions, and concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rimal et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Insects employ various sensory mechanisms to detect chemicals in their environment. Olfactory organs (antennae and maxillary palps) detect volatile chemicals, while non-volatile chemicals are sensed through gustatory organs like labella, legs, wing margins, and ovipositors. The labellar hairs and pegs play a crucial role in feeding. Each hemisphere of the labellum contains 31 sensilla, categorized by length into long (L-type), intermediate (I-type), and short types (S-type). These sensilla house gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), mechanosensory neurons, and supporting cells. Several chemosensory receptors, including ionotropic receptors (IRs), pickpocket (PPK) ion channels, transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels, and gustatory receptors (GRs), facilitate chemical detection. Receptors like alkaliphile (alka) and OTOP1 are involved in alkaline taste sensation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tian et al., 2023</xref>). GRs and IRs are associated with the perception of various chemicals, with specific GRs and IRs identified for different compounds like sugars, carboxylic acids, vitamins, and metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shrestha et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shrestha and Lee, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stanley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>). For example, IR25a and IR76b have recently been identified as coreceptors for taste identification, playing a novel role in perceiving salts such as sodium and calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaeger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), metals such as zinc and other heavy metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>), amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aryal et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ganguly et al., 2017</xref>), carboxylic acid and fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen and Amrein, 2017a</xref>), and vitamin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shrestha et al., 2023a</xref>). IR7a, originally known as an acetic acid sensor, has been discovered to function as a cadmium sensor, whereas IR47a acts independently of bitter GRNs in the perception of heavy metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2023</xref>). IR56b, expressed in ppk23<sup>+</sup> neurons, governs aversion to Zn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 2022</xref>) and is also involved in the perception of low salt from sweet-sensing GRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dweck et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have characterized IR7c as a high-salt sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDowell et al., 2022</xref>), IR56d as a low-hexanoic acid sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pradhan et al., 2023</xref>), and IR25a and IR76b in the labellum as essential to detect attractive carboxylic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shrestha and Lee, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stanley et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, ingested food first contacts dendritic processes in the taste sensilla in the pharynx. The axons project to distinct parts of the subesophageal zone (SEZ) responsible for taste sensation in the flyâs brain. Despite their importance, few studies have explored the physiological responses of pharyngeal GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Dahanukar, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we focus on investigating the molecular mechanism of attractive acid taste in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Lactic acid (LA), citric acid (CA), and glycolic acid (GA) are used as test compounds in behavioral screens. LA is known to be palatable and to extend lifespan, whereas CA and GA are energy sources found in citrus fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Massie and Williams, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rabinowitz and EnerbÃ¤ck, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rimal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stanley et al., 2021</xref>). Behavioral and physiological assays have shown that sweet-sensing GRNs on the labellum mediate the appetitive preference of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> toward low concentrations of carboxylic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shrestha and Lee, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stanley et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show that mutations in pharyngeal IRs result in reduced preference or aversion to LA, CA, and GA, indicating the essential role of these IRs in mediating the attraction to low acid concentrations. Peripheral (both labellar and pharyngeal) taste sensation of all three acids relies on broadly tuned IR25a and IR76b receptors, but IR51b is essential for their internal perception. Additionally, IR94a and IR94h are also essential for pharyngeal perception of CA and GA in the pharynx. These findings highlight a unique mechanism of sour taste perception, where external and internal organs have distinct roles in sensing acid taste.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IRs are indispensable for attracting organic carboxylic acids</title><p>In our previous study, we observed that control flies exhibited attraction toward food containing 1% carboxylic acids, indicating their ability to detect sour taste through specific taste receptors, but we did not identify the complete receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shrestha and Lee, 2021</xref>). Here, to identify the receptors responsible, we conducted a screening of various <italic>Ir</italic> mutants, targeting receptors with known functional roles as well as those yet to be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We dissolved the tastants in 72-well microtiter plates featuring an alternating pattern of 2 mM sucrose alone or combined with 1% LA, 1% CA, or 1% GA.

Among the defective <italic>Ir</italic> lines, most showed a preference for LA, CA, and GA, but the response of <italic>Ir25a<sup>2</sup></italic>, <italic>Ir51b<sup>1</sup></italic>, and <italic>Ir76b<sup>1</sup></italic> to 1% LA, CA, and GA was significantly reduced compared to control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>Ir94a<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>Ir94h<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants, generated through ends-out homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>), exhibited lower preference or aversion to CA and GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). These receptors (IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h) might assemble into multimeric complexes, with IR25a and IR76b serving as essential, yet general, subunits. The IR25a and IR76b are supplemented by additional subunits such as IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h that confer specificity for carboxylic acid. The functional role of IR94a and IR94h in behavior and physiology was unknown, although their expression was observed in the pharyngeal region of both larvae and adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Dahanukar, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stewart et al., 2015</xref>).

Overall, we suggest that five IRs (<italic>Ir25a</italic>, <italic>Ir51b</italic>, <italic>Ir76b</italic>, <italic>Ir94a</italic>, and <italic>Ir94h</italic>) exhibit strong potential as receptors for sour taste.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ionotropic receptors are essential for sensing carboxylic acids in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</title><p>Screening of candidate 33 <italic>Ir</italic> mutants through binary food choice assay in presence of (<bold>A</bold>) 1% lactic acid (LA), (<bold>B</bold>) 1% citric acid (CA), and (<bold>C</bold>) 1% glycolic acid (GA) (<italic>n</italic> = 6â8 biological replicates).

Previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> show that after mating, females change their food preferences in addition to increasing their feeding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, many animals exhibit a dietary shift in response to changes in environmental or developmental requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Waldbauer and Friedman, 1991</xref>). Motivated by these results, we set out to investigate if changes in mating status are associated with a shift toward a preference for sour taste and, if so, whether this preference is dependent on the sex of the fly. Therefore, we conducted experiments to investigate potential sex differences and the effect of mating state on the attraction to LA, CA, and GA. We found that the attraction to the carboxylic acids was indistinguishable among mated male flies, virgin female flies, and mated female flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). These results suggest that sex and mating status do not significantly impact the fliesâ response to carboxylic acid in terms of attraction, and the physiological and developmental status of the organism are not important factors for nutritional assessment of carboxylic acid value. After establishing that sour taste perception is not sex-specific, we proceed to validate potential receptors for the sensation of sour taste. Thus to determine the function of <italic>Ir51b</italic> in detecting carboxylic acids, we examined an additional mutant, <italic>Ir51b<sup>2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhakal et al., 2021</xref>). This mutant exhibited a similar deficit as <italic>Ir51b<sup>1</sup></italic>, suggesting the essential role of <italic>Ir51b</italic> in GRN-mediated sour taste perception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Previously, the broadly expressed IRs, IR25a and IR76b, were identified as key molecular sensors for LA, CA, and GA in the peripheral region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shrestha and Lee, 2021</xref>). Having identified <italic>Ir51b</italic> as a key sensor for carboxylic acid, we conducted a recovery experiment. We used the broadly expressed <italic>Ir25a-GAL4</italic> to drive <italic>UAS-Ir51b</italic> in the mutant background. The responses to LA, CA, and GA were fully rescued at a concentration of 1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We observed that the defect persisted in the deficiency lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). After observing the defect in <italic>Ir94a<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>Ir94h<sup>1</sup></italic> flies in sensing CA and GA in feeding behavior assays, we performed rescue experiments using the respective <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers. We found that the mutant phenotype of <italic>Ir94a<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>Ir94h<sup>1</sup></italic> flies was fully restored to normal by expressing wild-type <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> transgenes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref>). By rescuing the deficits of <italic>Ir94a<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>Ir94h<sup>1</sup></italic> using the respective <italic>GAL4</italic> lines, we confirmed that <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> are essential for the perception of carboxylic acid-mediated sensation.</p><p>Previous research showed that acetic acid detection by IR7a was contingent on pH and concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rimal et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we conducted a series of experiments to investigate the behavioral responses of fruit flies to different concentrations and pH ranges of carboxylic acids. Firstly, we performed feeding assays with and without the presence of sucrose to determine the influence of sugar on fliesâ behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Control flies (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) exhibited attraction to 0.5% and 1% carboxylic acid. In contrast, at 5% and 10% LA, the attraction was relatively lower, and flies rather avoided 10% CA and 5% and 10% GA. All candidate mutants displayed significant defects in attraction to 0.5% and 1% of the tested carboxylic acid food. The difference in preference between control flies and mutants was particularly pronounced at 1% concentration for all three of the tested acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This implies that the ideal concentration to attract flies is 1% carboxylic acid. We thus proceeded with further studies using a 1% concentration. Interestingly, <italic>Ir94a<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>Ir94h<sup>1</sup></italic> showed normal responses to all concentrations of LA. The absence of sugar removes the competition between the activation of avoidance and attraction sensory neurons, revealing the role of the tastant itself present in the food. However, the reduction in preference or avoidance behavior persisted in the candidate mutants, both in the presence and absence of sucrose, at concentrations ranging from 0.1% to 5%. Intriguingly, the response toward 10% carboxylic acid food was similar in control flies and mutants. These results indicate the involvement of the five identified IRs in sensing low concentrations of carboxylic acid in the context of sour taste.</p><p>Feeding assays were performed using carboxylic acids with varying pH levels, from acidic to neutral, to examine the effect of pH on the behavioral characteristics of control flies and candidate IR mutants. The results revealed that pH influenced the behavioral responses of both control flies and mutants, with a higher preference observed for low-pH acids compared to neutral pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The pH effects were distinguishable among control flies and mutants in the acidic range of approximately pH 2.3â2.7. Even after adjusting the pH to 3.5 using KOH, the contrasting behavior between control flies and mutants persisted. In contrast, as the pH increased to approximately pH 5.0â7.0, the behavior became similar between control flies and mutants. These findings indicate that the pH of the acid is a significant factor in taste discrimination. Collectively, these data demonstrate that the pH, concentration, and chemical structure of the acid influence attraction to sour taste.</p><p>Electrophysiological techniques offer a potent means to investigate the peripheral taste response of insects, complementing behavioral assays. Through electrophysiological assays, we can directly and quantitatively measure peripheral gustatory responses. We previously identified the role of IR25a and IR76b for the sensation of carboxylic acids from labellum using tip recording assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shrestha and Lee, 2021</xref>). To investigate whether newly identified <italic>Ir</italic> mutants elicit abnormal neuronal responses from the labellum, we conducted tip recording assays to assess the electrophysiological response of <italic>Ir51b<sup>1</sup></italic>, <italic>Ir94a<sup>1</sup></italic>, and <italic>Ir94h<sup>1</sup></italic> in L-type sensilla (L4, L6, and L8). We observed normal neuronal firing in all three mutants when stimulated with 1% LA, CA, and GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>). Based on the results of the binary food choice assay and tip recording assay, we hypothesize that <italic>Ir51b</italic>, <italic>Ir94a</italic>, and <italic>Ir94h</italic> may play a role in the sensation of carboxylic acid in pharyngeal organs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Ir51b</italic>, <italic>Ir94a</italic>, and <italic>Ir94h</italic> exhibit distinct patterns of expression in the pharynx</title><p>Because the behavioral defects of <italic>Ir94a<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>Ir94h<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant flies to detect CA and GA were fully rescued by their GAL4 lines, respectively, we expanded our research to investigate the expression pattern of these receptors using their <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers. Within the adult fly pharynx, three distinct pharyngeal taste organs can be distinguished: the labral sense organ (LSO), as well as the ventral and dorsal cibarial sense organs (VCSO and DCSO). The VCSO and DCSO are located on opposite sides of the rostrum, whereas the LSO is situated in the haustellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). <italic>Ir94a</italic> was expressed in the VCSO region of the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), whereas <italic>Ir94h</italic> showed neuronal expression in both the LSO and VCSO regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). This analysis, based on the location of expression, provides evidence that <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> are distinct neurons within the pharynx. Additionally, we previously generated a knock-in-GAL4 line for <italic>Ir51b</italic> (referred to as <italic>Ir51b<sup>2</sup></italic>). However, we were unable to visualize the expression of <italic>Ir51b</italic> using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter. Nevertheless, we successfully recapitulated the expression of <italic>Ir51b</italic> in the bitter-sensing GRNs of the labellum using RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhakal et al., 2021</xref>). Considering the broad expression of <italic>Ir51b</italic>, including the GRNs involved in the attractive sensing of low levels of acids in the pharynx, as demonstrated by the defect in sensing low concentrations of carboxylic acids through feeding assays in <italic>Ir51b</italic> mutants, we sought to validate this speculation.

However, we did not observe neuronal expression in these different chemosensory body parts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Furthermore, the axonal projection of <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> GRNs to the SEZ, which is a brain region responsible for processing taste signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C, D</xref>), suggests that IR94a and IR94h play a role in taste perception from the pharynx. However, because both <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> neurons exhibit defects in sensing the same compounds, we were curious about the potential association between them at the level of neural circuit connections. To this end, we conducted a rescue experiment using <italic>Ir94a-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Ir94h-GAL4</italic> to rescue the defects of <italic>Ir94h<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant and <italic>Ir94a<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This genetic experiment demonstrated a failure in rescuing the defects, indicating no association between the roles of IR94a and IR94h in sensing sour taste. <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> appear to operate independently in the perception of sour taste, with no complementary or redundant functions between them in this specific sensory process. Using the pharyngeal-specific neurons <italic>Ir94a-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Ir94h-GAL4</italic>, we attempted to rescue the defect observed in <italic>Ir51b<sup>1</sup></italic>, and intriguingly, we found that both pharyngeal neurons successfully rescued the defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Because <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> neurons occupy different locations within the pharynx, this finding led us to speculate that the activation of a single neuron is adequate to confer the activity of IR51b.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Functional validation of pharyngeal <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> GRNs in detecting appealing sour taste</title><p>To investigate the role of pharyngeal neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in relation to the pharyngeal sour sensation, we examined flies <italic>trans</italic>-heterozygous for two <italic>poxn</italic> null alleles (<italic>poxn<sup>70</sup></italic> and <italic>poxn</italic><sup>Î<italic>M22</italic></sup><italic><sup>âB5</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boll and Noll, 2002</xref>). We chose to use <italic>poxn</italic> mutants in our study due to their suitability for studying pharyngeal taste coding, as they lack taste function in the legs and labial palps but retain intact pharyngeal sweet taste, which is necessary and sufficient for driving the preferred consumption of sweet compounds through prolonged ingestion. We assessed the behavior of <italic>poxn</italic> mutant flies using pre-ingestion contact analysis (proboscis extension response [PER] assay) and post-ingestion contact analysis (binary food choice assay). Our findings revealed that there was no attractive response in the PER assay, but prolonged consumption showed increased feeding of low concentrations of acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). This observation may be attributed to the presence of functional pharyngeal neurons that drive attraction to sour stimuli in <italic>poxn</italic> mutants, whereas labellar attractive sour taste sensation is apparently absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Dahanukar, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>).

However, the reduced fluorescence activity in the mutant background was restored when driven by cell type-specific expression of the respective genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâD</xref>). We then examined the physiological response to lower concentrations of the carboxylic acids to analyze whether minor concentrations were sufficient to elicit neuronal activity. We applied 0.1% CA and GA and observed changes in neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We observed a comparatively lower neuronal response compared to 1% CA and GA, indicating that the optimal appetitive concentration elicits a stronger physiological response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Calcium imaging analysis showing the activation of pharyngeal <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) with carboxylic acid applied as stimulus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap analysis of pre- and post-stimulus with <italic>Ir94a-GAL4</italic> flies with expression of GCaMP6s in control, mutant (<italic>Ir94a<sup>1</sup></italic> and <italic>Ir51b<sup>1</sup></italic>) background, and rescue flies.

This suggests that IR25a and IR76b act as coreceptors in the <italic>Ir94a-</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic>-expressing GRNs, playing an essential role in pharyngeal GRN-mediated sour taste perception.</p><p>We also investigated the role of <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> GRNs in sensing other acids (LA and HCl), sucrose, and a bitter compound, quinine. However, we did not observe intense changes in fluorescence intensity after the application of these stimulants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Both CA and GA induced a progressive increase in the GCaMP6s signal compared to the pre-stimulus fluorescence activity baseline, whereas other appetitive compounds did not enhance the response. In our previous research, we found that three IR mutants (<italic>Ir51b<sup>1</sup></italic>, <italic>Ir94a<sup>1</sup></italic>, and <italic>Ir94h<sup>1</sup></italic>) do not play a role in attraction to vitamin C, a sour tastant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shrestha et al., 2023a</xref>). Furthermore, when tested for aversive response to caffeine and attractive response to salt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sang et al., 2024</xref>), these mutants showed no significant differences in preference or avoidance compared to the control group when exposed to sucrose, caffeine, or salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This implies that IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h are specifically required for detecting carboxylic acids (CA and GA), although IR51b is also essential for sensing LA.</p><p>To delve deeper into the taste perception of the candidate IR mutants, we explored their role in detecting strong acids, specifically HCl, in addition to weak carboxylic acids. Using feeding assays with 1 and 100 mM HCl, we observed that the control group preferred the slightly lower concentration of HCl but avoided the higher concentration. Interestingly, the response of the candidate IR mutants mirrored that of the control group for both concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In summary, our findings suggest that IR25a, IR51b, IR76b, IR94a, and IR94h are responsible for the gustatory sensation of appealing concentrations of carboxylic acids and specifically contribute to the perception of sour taste rather than other taste modalities.</p><p>Moreover, we ectopically expressed <italic>UAS-Ir51b</italic>, <italic>UAS-Ir94a</italic>, and <italic>UAS-Ir94h</italic> under the guidance of <italic>Gr33a-GAL4</italic> and checked whether it elicits an enhanced taste-induced neuronal response from S- or I-type sensilla similar to L-type sensilla. On checking the neuronal firing from S-type (S3, S6, and S10) and I-type (I8, I9, and I10) sensilla of ectopically expressed flies, the response was similar to control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that these three IRs are not enough to recapitulate sour receptors. Overall, our current results, in combination with our previously published results, illustrate that peripheral sweet-sensing neurons and pharyngeal neurons are crucial requisites for carboxylic acid-sensing.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings from behavioral and physiological experiments demonstrate that <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> GRNs are specifically tuned to CA and GA, with IR51b acting as a coreceptor, along with IR25a and IR76b. Together, our results suggest that sour taste perception is accomplished through two parallel IR-mediated pathways in the gustatory system of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study reveals the pharyngeal cellular mechanism by which the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gustatory system detects and evaluates sour taste stimuli. We identified specific pharyngeal neurons, namely IR94a and IR94h, as molecular sensors for carboxylic acids, with IR25a, IR51b, and IR76b acting as coreceptors. These findings highlight the importance of pharyngeal taste sensors in sour taste perception and provide insights into the complex processes that govern taste perception in insects.</p><p>Our research indicates that a group of IRs plays a crucial role in mediating the pleasant taste experience associated with optimal concentrations of carboxylic acids, with a specific emphasis on their involvement in perceiving sourness, as opposed to other taste qualities. In addition, we have previously reported that IR51b is essential for detecting aversive nitrogenous waste in the labellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhakal et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, IR51b functions as an aversive receptor in the labellum but as an attractive receptor in the pharynx. Thus, IR51b may not be specifically dedicated to sour taste perception but could potentially act as a coreceptor in the pharynx for detecting three carboxylic acids. Our attempts to identify IR51b expression using the GAL4 reporter failed due to the ineffectiveness of our knock-in-GAL4 (<italic>Ir51b<sup>2</sup></italic>). Consequently, we were unable to identify the specific neurons responsible for detecting LA, and further research is needed to determine the responsive GRNs for LA. Another intriguing finding is the role of <italic>Ir51b</italic> function in either IR94a or IR94h neurons is sufficient for attraction raises questions about two separate circuits within the pharynx. Understanding the specific mechanisms behind this observation could provide insights into how different neurons collaborate to mediate behavioral responses to stimuli.</p><p>We revealed that both IR25a and IR76b serve as coreceptors within the GRNs expressed in the pharynx. Physiological examinations of mutants lacking IR25a and IR76b demonstrated noteworthy but partial reductions in the responsiveness of pharyngeal GRNs to CA and GA stimuli. This diminished responsiveness was effectively restored by cell type-specific expression through pharyngeal GRNs. The physiological responses in the rescued flies closely resembled those in control flies, suggesting that the defective property is intrinsic to individual cells. This intrinsic defect operates independently of external influences, emphasizing the autonomy of the cells and underscoring the role of pharyngeal receptors, including the identified coreceptors (IR25a and IR76b). Thus, we believe that pharyngeal cells have a predominant role in perceiving carboxylic acid taste.</p><p>We observed the differences in behavioral characteristics among the identified receptor mutant lines. For instance, while <italic>Ir94a</italic> mutants exhibit neutrality toward CA, <italic>Ir94h</italic> mutants strongly avoid it. We believe that while all the identified genes may be involved in the same sensory process, they likely have distinct functions within that process. Some genes may play a more critical role or exert a higher degree of influence on the overall sensation. This could explain the varying degrees of defect severity among the associated genes. Additionally, if an identified gene has a substantial number of crucial interactions, its mutation may have a cascading effect, resulting in a more severe defect compared to genes with fewer interactions or less critical partners. Therefore, each identified gene and its associated mutation should be evaluated within the specific sensory process and in the context of the overall genetic and biological framework to understand the variations in defect severity. Conceivably, these receptors could activate some other pathway through an independent cellular mechanism, indicating its importance not only in attraction to acid but also in masking the acid avoidance mechanism. Additionally, this discrepancy hints at the complex interplay between sensory neurons and the stimuli they detect. Reference to previous research highlighting the aversive nature of carboxylic acids at high concentrations adds depth to this observation, suggesting potential variations in doseâresponse dynamics mediated by these mutants in different way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ganguly et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rimal et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The reception of different carboxylic acids achieved by different receptors in our study is compelling. We believe that it is a multifaceted process that involves a range of factors and mechanisms. This selectivity likely arises from a combination of structural specificity, with the receptors possessing unique binding sites or domains that interact with the distinct chemical structures of different carboxylic acids. The differences in chemical structure, size, shape, or properties that lead to differentiation in acidity can impact the receptors' ability to recognize and bind to them, resulting in different behavioral and neural responses. Moreover, taste neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> appear to possess broader dynamic ranges than previously anticipated. Additionally, they exhibit responsiveness to various chemicals even without direct contact and demonstrate OFF responses that correlate taste attributes with behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dweck and Carlson, 2023</xref>). Examining these factors is essential for comprehending how taste circuits convert chemical information into behavior and for extending the understanding of the taste-based coding mechanism of specific ligandâreceptor interactions. Furthermore, evolutionary adaptation may have contributed to the selectivity, with organisms developing receptors tailored to compounds relevant to their survival, such as those in their natural diet. More importantly, the presence of the CH<sub>3</sub> (methyl) group in LA, as opposed to GA or CA, may contribute to some of the differences in their properties. Receptors are highly specific in recognizing and binding to certain molecules, often having binding sites with complementary shapes and chemical properties to the molecules with which they interact. The methyl group, for example, contributes to the receptor specificity. In our investigation of various organic acids, we recognized the significance of the anion component. However, our findings also highlight the crucial role of each acidâs acidity in determining its attractive properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Consequently, the unique specificity displayed by IR94a and IR94h receptors may also arise from their ability to discern the potent acidic characteristics and appealing flavors generated by specific ligands associated with CA and GA. These receptors appear finely tuned to recognize the intense acidity and pleasurable taste attributes conferred by these particular compounds, thereby elucidating their role in the sensory perception of flavors.</p><p>Based on our findings, we propose that labellar sour sensors are primarily involved in the initial detection of acidic tastes, influencing the extension response of the proboscis, whereas pharyngeal sour sensors are essential for the ingestion of acidic food. The labellar sensors appear to have minimal or no role in the ingestion process. Moreover, other research groups have demonstrated that <italic>poxn</italic> mutants still exhibit a response to sweet compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">LeDue et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting the existence of additional internal pharyngeal neurons responsible for other taste modalities. It would be worthwhile to investigate if these internal pharyngeal neurons also mediate other taste modalities.</p><p>The activation of sweet-sensing GRNs by LA has been shown to have two distinct phases, as confirmed by calcium imaging in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stanley et al., 2021</xref>). IR25a mediates the onset response, and the removal phases are mediated by sweet GRs, resulting in elevated calcium responses upon the removal of LA. Our previous findings revealed that the fructose receptor GR43a is essential for the behavioral response to carboxylic acids; however, it does not operate in the labellum, indicating that the behavioral assay may capture effects associated with the post-ingestive roles of GRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shrestha and Lee, 2021</xref>). Similarly, it would be valuable to investigate the functional requirement of sour-sensing GRs in the pharynx. Additionally, recent observations have revealed relationships between the OFF response (but not the ON response) and tastant structure and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dweck and Carlson, 2023</xref>). Thus, it would be noteworthy to examine these relationships of various acidic tastants. Such an analysis could unveil further aspects of acidic taste coding.</p><p>Subsequent research endeavors should strive to elucidate the precise convergence of the two parallel pathways within the brain that collaboratively oversee sour taste perception. Delving deeper into this intricate interaction would shed light on the complex orchestration of sensory information. Furthermore, an exploration into the intricate neural circuits that establish connections between peripheral and pharyngeal gustatory neurons holds the promise of unearthing even more profound insights into the mechanisms at play. Additionally, the precise neural circuits involved in the integration of the sensory inputs and the behavioral outputs remain to be elucidated. Exploration of the downstream signaling mechanisms of pharyngeal GRNs and potential connection with other taste modalities is one of the interesting areas of research based on our study.</p><p>This studyâs exploration of the sensory biology of taste in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a significant advancement in our understanding of gustatory mechanisms, providing a robust framework for future investigations into the sour taste perception among insects. By elucidating the complexities of nutrient selection and feeding strategies, this research not only enhances our comprehension of insect behavior but also bridges a gap to broader biological processes, including those in humans. The findings prompt a reevaluation of how organisms, from insects to humans, interact with their environments through molecular sensory pathways, highlighting the universal aspects of taste biology across diverse species. This cross-species insight is invaluable for developing more comprehensive models of sensory-driven behaviors in ecological and evolutionary contexts. Additionally, investigating the ecological significance of the lesser-studied pharyngeal neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which are key to the flyâs perception of carboxylic acid taste, presents a valuable opportunity to deepen our understanding of sensation and mechanism behind it. These neurons are critical for essential survival behaviors, including feeding. Research into the natural stimuli activating these neurons and their role in the flyâs fitness could reveal their integration into the species' ecological and evolutionary strategies. Such studies could aid in our knowledge of taste perception and enlighten us on the adaptive importance of sensory systems in nature.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p>The wild-type control for all experiments was <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>.

The preference index (P.I.) was calculated according to the following equation: (<italic>N</italic><sub>B</sub> â <italic>N</italic><sub>R</sub>)/(<italic>N</italic><sub>R</sub> + <italic>N</italic><sub>B</sub> + <italic>N</italic><sub>P</sub>) or (<italic>N</italic><sub>R</sub> â <italic>N</italic><sub>B</sub>)/(<italic>N</italic><sub>R</sub> + <italic>N</italic><sub>B</sub>+ <italic>N</italic><sub>P</sub>), depending on the dye/tastant combinations. P.I. = 1.0 and â1.0 indicate complete preferences for one of the other foods, and P.I. = 0.0 indicates no bias between the two food choices.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiology was conducted, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). At first, 4- to 6-day-old flies were anesthetized on ice. Then, a reference glass electrode filled with Ringerâs solution was inserted into the thorax of the flies, extending the electrode toward their proboscis. To avoid any possible biases, five to six live insects were prepared per setup, and the same procedure was repeated for several rounds on different days. The sensilla were stimulated for 5 s with different tastants dissolved in a 30-mM TCC solution (i.e., electrolytes) in recording pipettes (10â20 Î¼m tip diameter). The recording electrode was connected to a preamplifier (Taste PROBE, Syntech), and the signals were collected and amplified tenfold using a signal connection interface box (Syntech) in conjunction with a 100- to 3000-Hz band-pass filter. Recordings of action potentials were acquired using a 12-kHz sampling rate and analyzed using the AutoSpike 3.1 software (Syntech). Each consecutive recording was performed within approximately 1 min between each stimulation. The black circles in each figure indicate the number of insects tested.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>This method was conducted as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). The labella of flies were dissected and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Cat# 15710) in PBS-T (1Ã phosphate-buffered saline and 0.2% Triton X-100) for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed tissues were washed carefully three times with PBS-T. After washing, tissues were cut in half with a razor blade. The samples were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in blocking buffer (0.5% goat serum in 1Ã PBS-T). The primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution; mouse anti-GFP [Molecular Probes, Cat# A11120]) were added to freshly prepared blocking buffer and incubated with the samples overnight at 4Â°C. The samples were washed three times with PBS-T at 4Â°C and incubated with secondary antibodies (1:200 dilution in the blocking buffer; goat anti-mouse Alexa488 [Thermo Fisher, Cat# A11029]) for 4 hr at 4Â°C. The tissues were then washed three times with PBS-T and placed in mounting buffer (37.5% glycerol, 187.5 mM NaCl, 62.5 mM Tris, pH 8.8) and viewed using an inverted Leica LASX confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Ex vivo calcium imaging</title><p>Ex vivo calcium imaging was performed using a low-melting agarose method. For the experimental process, we used 4- to 7-day-old flies expressing <italic>UAS-GCaMP6s</italic> driven by <italic>Ir94a-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Ir94h-GAL4</italic> (incubation condition: 50â60% relative humidity, 25Â°C, 12/12 hr light/dark cycle). For the experiment, 0.5% low-melting agarose was prepared and distributed on the confocal dish (SPL Life Sciences, Cat# 102350). The shallow well with a blade was prepared for sample fixation. Next, the head of each fly was decapitated carefully using sharp razor blades, followed by the excision of the slight part of the labellum of the extended region of the proboscis for easy access of tastant to pharyngeal organs (LSO for <italic>Ir94h-GAL4</italic> and VCSO for <italic>Ir94a-GAL4</italic>). The prepared tissue sample was later carefully fixed in an inverted position on the well already prepared earlier. Adult hemolymph solution (108 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 8.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid), pH 7.5) was kept as the pre-stimulus solution, which was followed by the stimulus solution after 30 s. Stimulus solution was inserted slowly on pre-stimulus solution to avoid any kind of liquid phase movement. This allowed direct access of the stimulus to the pharyngeal neurons. GCaMP6s fluorescence was viewed with a fluorescence microscope. The relevant area of the pharynx was visualized using the 10Ãobjective. A video was recorded at a speed of two frames scanned per second. Changes in neuronal fluorescent activity were recorded for 4 min after supplying the stimulus. Throughout the experiment, following the stimulation, the tissue remained exposed to the chemical due to the absence of mechanisms for its removal. Typically, the response onset occurred within 1â2 min following the stimulation period. Fluorescence intensities (<italic>F</italic>) were measured using Fiji/ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fiji.sc">https://fiji.sc</ext-link>). A region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the cell bodies. For the analysis, the average intensity for ROIs during each frame was measured using the Time-Series Analyzer Plugin written by J. Balaji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/time-series.html">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/time-series.html</ext-link>). If there was modest movement of sample, it was measured manually at different fraction of time in same ROI and subsequently merged. The change in fluorescence intensity (Î<italic>F</italic>) relative to the baseline fluorescence (<italic>F</italic>) represented by Î<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> (%) was calculated as (<italic>F</italic><sub>max</sub> â <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>)/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> Ã 100%. <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> is the GCaMP6s baseline value averaged for 10 frames immediately before stimulus application. <italic>F</italic><sub>max</sub> is the maximum fluorescence value following stimulus delivery. Each Î<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> (%) was presented as dot plot in respective figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Optogenetic assay</title><p>Two different optogenetics methods were used in the study. Flies were grown on standard cornmeal agar supplemented with 400 Î¼M ATR (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# R2500) at 25Â°C under dark conditions. After eclosion, 4- to 6-day-old flies were kept in a vial containing 1% agarose with ATR for 18â24 hr under the same conditions. The next day, each fly was trapped within a trimmed 200 Âµl pipette tip so that the proboscis was exposed to the outside while the remainder of the fly was secured inside the pipette tip. In the first method, the optogenetic experiment was performed as described previously with a few modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Joseph et al., 2017</xref>). To the above-described flies under the controlled condition, the fly proboscis was stimulated with red light or white light. Those with full or partial proboscis extension were recorded as positive. The light source was activated for 3â5 s for respective experiments. In the second method, we stimulated the fly proboscis with sucrose in the initial phase, and those showing a positive response were stimulated using sucrose, followed by red light. The PER was recorded as full and partial. In each trial (<italic>n</italic>), flies showing a positive response to sucrose were used for further experiments. The PER percentage was calculated by the percentage of the total number of positive responses to red lights.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RT-PCR analyses</title><p>The whole body, labellum, and pharynx samples were dissected from control (<italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>) adult flies for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. Only the pharynx was dissected from control and <italic>poxn</italic> null alleles (<italic>poxn<sup>70</sup></italic> and <italic>poxn<sup>ÎM22âB5</sup></italic>) for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>. Achieving a pristine dissection of the pharynx necessitated the application of meticulous and precise techniques, coupled with diligent handling and preparation. Initially, the dissection commenced with the removal of the labellum section using a sterile surgical blade, executed with utmost care to minimize any inadvertent damage. Subsequently, employing another sterile surgical blade, the targeted region of the pharynx was delicately isolated from the surrounding proboscis tissue. This isolated pharyngeal segment was then meticulously collected, ensuring its integrity and purity for subsequent experimental analyses. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega). To perform the RT-PCR, we used the following primers:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Ir51b</italic> forward primer: 5â²-<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCGCTAACAAACGCTGCTTAC</named-content>-3â²</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Ir51b</italic> reverse primer: 5â²-<named-content content-type="sequence">CAGAGCTGACAGTATCCAACCAA</named-content>-3â²</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>tubulin</italic> forward primer: 5â²-<named-content content-type="sequence">TCCTTGTCGCGTGTGAAACA</named-content>-3â²</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>tubulin</italic> reverse primer: 5â²-<named-content content-type="sequence">CCGAACGAGTGGAAGATGAG</named-content>-3â².</p></list-item></list><p>The RT-PCR reactions were run for 35 cycles to amplify the target gene fragments. The resulting RT-PCR products were subsequently analyzed to determine gene expression levels. To ensure the integrity and purity of the RNA preparation and the absence of genomic DNA contamination, we included a No Reverse Transcriptase (no-RT) sample as a control, which consisted of RNA without the treatment of AMV reverse transcriptase enzymes before proceeding to PCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>The experiments were performed on several different days, and the data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (ver. 8.0; Dotmatics).

Here, the co-expression of the two drivers has not been examined, and Ir94a-GAL4 does not appear to be expressed in the LSO.

Prior studies have also found roles for other response modes (OFF response), other IRs and GRs, and other organs (labellum, tarsi) in behavioral responses to carboxylic acids. Overall, the authors' model may be overly simplistic, and the discussion does not do justice to how their model reconciles with the body of work that already exists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101439.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Shrestha et al investigated the role of IR receptors in the detection of 3 carboxylic acids in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A low concentration of either of these carboxylic acids added to 2 mM sucrose (1% lactic acid (LA), citric acid (CA), or glycolic acid (GA)) stimulates the consumption of adult flies in choice conditions. The authors use this behavioral test to screen the impact of mutations within 33 receptors belonging to the IR family, a large family of receptors derived from glutamate receptors and expressed both in the olfactory and gustatory sensilla of insects. Within the panel of mutants tested, they observed that 3 receptors (IR25a, IR51b, and IR76b) impaired the detection of LA, CA, and GA, and that 2 others impacted the detection of CA and GA (IR94a and IR94h). Interestingly, impairing IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h did not affect the electrophysiological responses of external gustatory sensilla to LA, CA, and GA. Thanks to the use of GAL4 strains associated with these receptors and thanks to the use of poxn mutants (which do not develop external gustatory sensilla but still have functional internal receptors), they show evidence that IR94a and IR94h are only expressed in two clusters of gustatory neurons of the pharynx, respectively in the VCSO (ventral cibarial sense organ) and in the VCSO + LSO (labral sense organ). As for IR51b, the GAL4 approach was not successful but RT-PCR made on different parts of the insect showed an expression both in the pharyngeal organs and in peripheral receptors. These main findings are then complemented by a host of additional experiments meant to better understand the respective roles of IR94a and IR94h, by using optogenetics and brain calcium imaging using GCamp6. They also report a failed attempt to co-express IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h into external receptors, a co-expression which did not confer the capability of bitter-sensitive cells (expressing GR33a-GAL4) to detect either of the carboxylic acids. These data complete and expand previous observations made on this group and others, and dot to 2 new IR receptors which show an unsuspected specific expression, into organs that still remain difficult to study.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are supported by the data presented, but it remains difficult to make general conclusions as concerns the mechanisms by which carboxylic acids are detected.</p><p>(1) All experiments were done with 1% of carboxylic acids. What is the dose dependency of the behavioral responses to these acids, and is it conceivable that other receptors are involved at other concentrations?</p><p>(2) One result needs to be better discussed and hypotheses proposed - which is why the mutations of most receptors lead to a loss of detection (mutant flies become incapable of detecting the acid) while mutations in IR94a and IR94h make CA and GA potent deterrents. Does it mean that CA and GA are detected by another set of receptors that, when activated, make flies actively avoid CA and GA? In that case, do the authors think that testing receptors one by one is enough to uncover all the receptors participating in the detection of these substances?</p><p>(3) The paper needs to be updated with a recent paper published by Guillemin et al (2024), indicating that LA is detected externally by a combination of IR94e, IR76b and IR25a. IR25a might help to form a fully functional receptor in GR33a neurons (a former study from Chen et al (2017) indicate that IR25a is expressed in all gustatory neurons of the pharynx).</p><p>(4) Although it was not the main focus of the paper, it would have been most interesting if the cells expressing IR94a and IR94h were identified, and placed on the functional map proposed by the group of Dahanukar (Chen et al 2017 Cell Reports, Chen et al 2019 Cell Reports).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101439.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors investigated the molecular and cellular basis of sour taste perception in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, focusing on identifying receptors that mediate attractive responses to certain carboxylic acids. It builds on previous work from the same group that had identified the IR co-receptors IR25a and IR76b for this sensory process, screening a set of mutants in IRs to identify three, IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h, required for feeding preference responses to some or all of the tested acids.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work is of interest because it assigns sensory roles to IRs of previously unknown function, in particular IR94a and IR94h, and points to pharyngeal neurons in which these receptors are expressed as the relevant sensory neurons (potentially with different roles for IR94a- and IR94h-expressing neurons). The work combines elegant genetics, simple but effective feeding and taste assays, chemo-/opto-genetic activation, and some calcium imaging. Overall the presented data look solid and well-controlled.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The in situ expression analysis relies entirely on transgenic driver lines for IR94a and IR94h (which had been previously described, though not fully cited in this work). Importantly, given that many of the behavioral experiments (genetic rescue, physiology, artificial activation) use the IR94a and IR94h GAL4 driver lines, it would be helpful to validate that these faithfully reflect IR94a and IR94h expression (as far as I can tell, such validation wasn't done in the original papers describing these lines as part of a large collection of IR drivers). For IR51b, pharyngeal expression is concluded indirectly from non-quantitative RT-PCR analysis (genetic reporters did not work). The lack of direct detection of gene/protein expression (for example, through RNA FISH, immunofluorescence, or protein tagging) would have made for a more complete characterization of these receptors (for example, there is no direct evidence that they also express IR25a and IR76b, as one might expect). Finally, the relationship of IR94a and IR94h neurons to other types of pharyngeal neurons remains unclear, as are their projection patterns in the SEZ.</p><p>Conceptually, the work is of interest mostly to those in the immediate field; there have been a very large number of studies in the past decade (several from this lab) characterizing the contributions of different IRs to various chemosensory processes. The current work doesn't lend much insight into the nature of the minimal functional unit of gustatory IRs (reconstitution of a functional IR in a heterologous neuron/cell has not been achieved here, but this is a limitation of many other previous studies), nor to how different pharyngeal sensory pathways might collaborate to control behavior. Nevertheless, the findings provide a useful contribution to the literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101439.2.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shrestha</surname><given-names>Bhanu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kookmin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sang</surname><given-names>Jiun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kookmin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rimal</surname><given-names>Suman</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kookmin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Youngseok</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kookmin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Shrestha et al report an investigation of mechanisms underlying gustatory preference for carboxylic acids in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Notably, the projections of <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> into the dorso-anterior subesophageal ganglion suggest divergent expression patterns rather than co-expression in the pharyngeal regions (Koh et al., 2014). Regarding co-expression of <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> in the LSO, we did not find any evidence to support this claim. Our data reinforce this view, showing that <italic>Ir94a</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> expression is limited to the VCSO, while <italic>Ir94h</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> is present in both the LSO and VCSO. Thus, the notion of co-expression of <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> in the LSO is not substantiated by current evidence.</p><p>As a reviewer suggested, it is possible that the GAL4 drivers utilized may not fully reflect the endogenous expression of these receptors. Despite this limitation, our behavioral, expression, and physiological analyses strongly suggest that <italic>Ir94a</italic> and <italic>Ir94h</italic> are located in distinct regions, supporting a model of two parallel IR-mediated pathways operating within the sensory system.</p><p>In addition, RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of <italic>Ir51b</italic>. However, due to methodological constraints, we were unable to conduct cell-type-specific expression studies using <italic>Ir51b</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic>. This limitation, which we have acknowledged in the manuscript, does not detract from our core findings but highlights an area for future research. Further studies utilizing cell-specific expression analysis and co-expression studies with additional drivers could offer more definitive insights into IR51bâs functional role and its interactions within broader IR-mediated pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The description of methods and results for the ex vivo calcium imaging is not satisfactory. Details about which cells are being analyzed, and in which organs are not included. No solvent stimulus is tested. The temporal dynamics of the responses are not presented. Movies of the imaging are not included as supplementary information - it would be important to visualize those with what was considered modest movement.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this valuable feedback. As discussed above, <italic>Ir94h</italic> is specifically expressed in the L7-7 sensilla of the LSO, while <italic>Ir94a</italic> is expressed in the V2 cells of the VCSO. This evidence led us to focus specifically on these cells in our calcium imaging study to ensure accuracy and relevance. In our experiments, Adult hemolymph solution (AHL) (108 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 8.2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 4 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.5) was used as the solvent and employed as a pre-stimulus (as mentioned in the Methods section). During this phase, we observed no changes in fluorescence, indicating that AHL itself did not influence the responses. Fluorescence changes occurred only when the test chemical, dissolved in AHL, was introduced. To further confirm that AHL had no impact on the results, we conducted continuous recordings with AHL alone before beginning our main experiments, and these trials confirmed the absence of fluorescence alterations. We have included the temporal dynamics and supplementary video recordings to provide a more comprehensive understanding of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The observed differences in phenotypes of Ir25a and Ir76b mutants are intriguing, as are those between the co-receptor mutants and Ir51b, Ir94a, and Ir94h, but have not been sufficiently considered. Prior studies have also found roles for other response modes (OFF response), other IRs and GRs, and other organs (labellum, tarsi) in behavioral responses to carboxylic acids. Overall, the authors' model may be overly simplistic, and the discussion does not do justice to how their model reconciles with the body of work that already exists.</p></disp-quote><p>Stanley et al. (2021) reported that the gustatory detection of lactic acid requires both IRs and GRs functioning together. Specifically, they found that IR25a mediates the onset peak response (ON response) to lactic acid, while GRs dampen this response and contribute to a removal peak (OFF response). Interestingly, in <italic>Ir25a</italic> mutants, a small onset peak still occurred, while <italic>Gr64a-f</italic> mutants showed an enhanced onset, suggesting that IRs and GRs interact dynamically to modulate taste responses.</p><p>In our previous work, we also observed the role of sweet GRs, in addition to <italic>Ir25a</italic> and <italic>Ir76b</italic>, in detecting carboxylic acids in the labellum (Shrestha et al., 2021). This raises the possibility of a similar interplay with carboxylic acids in our current study, where different IRs may contribute to distinct aspects of sensory responses in the pharynx, leading to the phenotypic differences we observed. Moreover, Chen et al. (2017) demonstrated that sour-sensing neurons in the tarsi express both IR76b and IR25a and specifically respond to carboxylic and inorganic acids without reacting to sweet or bitter compounds. This finding points to a specialized role for these receptors in sour detection and suggests a coordinated response involving multiple sensory organsâsuch as the labellum, tarsi, and pharynx.</p><p>The phenotypic differences observed in our mutants align with a more integrated model of carboxylic acid detection, in which multiple receptors and sensory organs contribute to the overall behavioral response. This supports the idea that our current model offers a more detailed understanding of how different carboxylic acids are detected and processed by the gustatory system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Shrestha et al investigated the role of IR receptors in the detection of 3 carboxylic acids in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A low concentration of either of these carboxylic acids added to 2 mM sucrose (1% lactic acid (LA), citric acid (CA), or glycolic acid (GA)) stimulates the consumption of adult flies in choice conditions. The authors use this behavioral test to screen the impact of mutations within 33 receptors belonging to the IR family, a large family of receptors derived from glutamate receptors and expressed both in the olfactory and gustatory sensilla of insects. Within the panel of mutants tested, they observed that 3 receptors (IR25a, IR51b, and IR76b) impaired the detection of LA, CA, and GA, and that 2 others impacted the detection of CA and GA (IR94a and IR94h). Interestingly, impairing IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h did not affect the electrophysiological responses of external gustatory sensilla to LA, CA, and GA. Thanks to the use of GAL4 strains associated with these receptors and thanks to the use of poxn mutants (which do not develop external gustatory sensilla but still have functional internal receptors), they show evidence that IR94a and IR94h are only expressed in two clusters of gustatory neurons of the pharynx, respectively in the VCSO (ventral cibarial sense organ) and in the VCSO + LSO (labral sense organ). As for IR51b, the GAL4 approach was not successful but RT-PCR made on different parts of the insect showed an expression both in the pharyngeal organs and in peripheral receptors. These main findings are then complemented by a host of additional experiments meant to better understand the respective roles of IR94a and IR94h, by using optogenetics and brain calcium imaging using GCamp6. They also report a failed attempt to co-express IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h into external receptors, a co-expression which did not confer the capability of bitter-sensitive cells (expressing GR33a-GAL4) to detect either of the carboxylic acids. These data complete and expand previous observations made on this group and others, and dot to 2 new IR receptors which show an unsuspected specific expression, into organs that still remain difficult to study.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are supported by the data presented, but it remains difficult to make general conclusions as concerns the mechanisms by which carboxylic acids are detected.</p><p>(1) All experiments were done with 1% of carboxylic acids. What is the dose dependency of the behavioral responses to these acids, and is it conceivable that other receptors are involved at other concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we conducted experiments to examine the dose dependency of behavioral responses to carboxylic acids, with results presented in Supplementary Figure 1. We found that lower concentrations of carboxylic acids are perceived as attractive, while higher concentrations are aversive. This differential response suggests that the receptors identified in our study are primarily tuned to detect low concentrations of these acids. Since higher concentrations elicited aversive responses, it is plausible that additional receptors, beyond the scope of our study, may be involved in sensing these higher concentrations. These receptors could be part of other gustatory receptor neurons that respond specifically to increased acid levels, as fruit flies tend to avoid higher concentrations. We propose that future research could investigate these alternative pathways to gain a complete understanding of the behavioral responses to carboxylic acids. In summary, our findings suggest that specific receptors are involved in detecting low concentrations, while distinct receptor pathwaysâpossibly mediated by other GRNsâmay regulate responses to higher concentrations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) One result needs to be better discussed and hypotheses proposed - which is why the mutations of most receptors lead to a loss of detection (mutant flies become incapable of detecting the acid) while mutations in IR94a and IR94h make CA and GA potent deterrents. Does it mean that CA and GA are detected by another set of receptors that, when activated, make flies actively avoid CA and GA? In that case, do the authors think that testing receptors one by one is enough to uncover all the receptors participating in the detection of these substances?</p></disp-quote><p>As we mentioned above, it is possible that distinct receptor pathways mediate avoidance of GA and CA. This suggests that CA and GA might activate different sets of receptors that trigger avoidance behavior, pointing to a more complex interplay of receptor activity than we initially considered. Certain acids may indeed be detected by multiple receptors, with each receptor contributing uniquely to the behavioral response. Regarding the sufficiency of testing receptors individually, we recognize the limitations of this approach. Examining receptors one by one may not reveal the full spectrum of receptors involved, especially due to potential interactions or compensatory mechanisms that only emerge when certain receptors are inactive. Therefore, a more holistic approachâsuch as genetic screens for behavioral responses or using complex genetic models to disrupt multiple receptors simultaneouslyâcould provide deeper insights. Moving forward, incorporating receptor interactions that modulate each other, along with more comprehensive assays, could help explain these discrepancies by uncovering previously overlooked receptor functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The paper needs to be updated with a recent paper published by Guillemin et al (2024), indicating that LA is detected externally by a combination of IR94e, IR76b and IR25a. IR25a might help to form a fully functional receptor in GR33a neurons (a former study from Chen et al (2017) indicate that IR25a is expressed in all gustatory neurons of the pharynx).</p></disp-quote><p>According to Guillemin et al. (2024), the combination of IR94e, IR76b, and IR25a is required for amino acid detection but not for detecting lactic acid (LA). In their calcium imaging experiments, 100 mM LA elicited a response similar to the vehicle control, suggesting that these receptors do not play a role in LA detection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Although it was not the main focus of the paper, it would have been most interesting if the cells expressing IR94a and IR94h were identified, and placed on the functional map proposed by the group of Dahanukar (Chen et al 2017 Cell Reports, Chen et al 2019 Cell Reports).</p></disp-quote><p>The expression patterns of IR94a and IR94h were previously detailed by Chen et al. (2017), showing that IR94h is expressed in the labial sense organ (LSO, specifically in L7-7) and the ventral cibarial sense organ (VCSO, V2), while IR94a is expressed in the VCSO (V5). Given this established information, we referenced these known expression patterns without replicating the mapping in our study. Our primary focus was to investigate the functional role of these neurons within the pharynx, and we believe we have successfully highlighted their specific contributions. However, we recognize that integrating the functional mapping of these neurons in alignment with the work of Dahanukarâs group would have strengthened our findings and provided a more comprehensive understanding. We acknowledge this as a limitation of our study and appreciate your suggestion, as it points to a valuable direction for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors investigated the molecular and cellular basis of sour taste perception in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, focusing on identifying receptors that mediate attractive responses to certain carboxylic acids. It builds on previous work from the same group that had identified the IR co-receptors IR25a and IR76b for this sensory process, screening a set of mutants in IRs to identify three, IR51b, IR94a, and IR94h, required for feeding preference responses to some or all of the tested acids.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work is of interest because it assigns sensory roles to IRs of previously unknown function, in particular IR94a and IR94h, and points to pharyngeal neurons in which these receptors are expressed as the relevant sensory neurons (potentially with different roles for IR94a- and IR94h-expressing neurons). The work combines elegant genetics, simple but effective feeding and taste assays, chemo-/opto-genetic activation, and some calcium imaging. Overall the presented data look solid and well-controlled.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The in situ expression analysis relies entirely on transgenic driver lines for IR94a and IR94h (which had been previously described, though not fully cited in this work). Importantly, given that many of the behavioral experiments (genetic rescue, physiology, artificial activation) use the IR94a and IR94h GAL4 driver lines, it would be helpful to validate that these faithfully reflect IR94a and IR94h expression (as far as I can tell, such validation wasn't done in the original papers describing these lines as part of a large collection of IR drivers). For IR51b, pharyngeal expression is concluded indirectly from non-quantitative RT-PCR analysis (genetic reporters did not work). The lack of direct detection of gene/protein expression (for example, through RNA FISH, immunofluorescence, or protein tagging) would have made for a more complete characterization of these receptors (for example, there is no direct evidence that they also express IR25a and IR76b, as one might expect). Finally, the relationship of IR94a and IR94h neurons to other types of pharyngeal neurons remains unclear, as are their projection patterns in the SEZ.</p><p>Conceptually, the work is of interest mostly to those in the immediate field; there have been a very large number of studies in the past decade (several from this lab) characterizing the contributions of different IRs to various chemosensory processes. The current work doesn't lend much insight into the nature of the minimal functional unit of gustatory IRs (reconstitution of a functional IR in a heterologous neuron/cell has not been achieved here, but this is a limitation of many other previous studies), nor to how different pharyngeal sensory pathways might collaborate to control behavior. Nevertheless, the findings provide a useful contribution to the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your thoughtful feedback. As noted in our response, our primary objective was to investigate the sensory functions of IR94a and IR94h. To this end, we conducted behavioral assays, which we validated with additional approaches including genetic rescue, physiological tests, and artificial activation. Throughout these experiments, we extensively utilized <italic>Ir94a</italic>- and <italic>Ir94h</italic>-<italic>GAL4</italic> driver lines. To ensure these lines accurately reflect the expression of IR94a and IR94h, we verified their expression patterns using immunohistochemistry across various body parts. Our results align with previous findings that show both receptors are exclusively expressed in the pharynx. Regarding IR51b, we employed RT-PCR due to its high sensitivity and specificity, which supported our hypothesis. Nonetheless, we agree that more direct detection methods would have provided a stronger validation of IR51b expression. Our previous study (Sang et al., 2024) also demonstrated the pharyngeal expression of co-expressed receptors, specifically IR25a and IR76b. However, we recognize that the lack of direct evidence for their co-expression with IR51b remains a significant gap. This limitation primarily stems from the unavailability of specific reagents needed for direct assays targeting IR51b, which restricted our experimental approach.</p><p>You also raised the potential relationship between IR94a and IR94h neurons and other pharyngeal neuron types, including their projection patterns in the subesophageal zone. This is indeed an important area for future research that could clarify neural connectivity and further our understanding of sensory mechanisms. However, our study was focused on exploring sensory mechanisms in peripheral regions rather than detailed neural mapping in the SEZ. Investigating these connections would undoubtedly provide valuable insights into the neural circuitry involved and represents an intriguing direction for future research.</p></body></sub-article></article>
