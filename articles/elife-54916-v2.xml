regulated by accessory proteins. We recently reported powerful regulation of Kv1.2 potassium channels by the amino acid transporter Slc7a5. In this study, we report that Kv1.1 channels are also regulated by Slc7a5, albeit with different functional outcomes. In heterologous expression systems, Kv1.1 exhibits prominent current enhancement ('disinhibition') with holding potentials more negative than −120 mV. Knockdown of endogenous Slc7a5 leads to larger Kv1.1 currents and strongly attenuates the disinhibition effect, suggesting that Slc7a5 regulation of Kv1.1 involves channel inhibition that can be reversed by supraphysiological hyperpolarizing voltages. We investigated chimeric combinations of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, demonstrating that exchange of the voltage-sensing domain controls the sensitivity and response to Slc7a5, and localize a specific position in S1 with prominent effects on Slc7a5 sensitivity. Overall, our study highlights multiple Slc7a5-sensitive Kv1 subunits, and identifies the voltage-sensing domain as a determinant of Slc7a5 modulation of Kv1 channels.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>Kv1.1</kwd><kwd>Kv1.2</kwd><kwd>Slc7a5</kwd><kwd>voltage-dependent gating</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurata</surname><given-names>Harley T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vanier Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baronas</surname><given-names>Victoria A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000190</institution-id><institution>University of Alberta</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rowland and Muriel Haryett fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamothe</surname><given-names>Shawn M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>USRA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silver</surname><given-names>Grace</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Career Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurata</surname><given-names>Harley T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Alberta Diabetes Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Salary support</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurata</surname><given-names>Harley T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The voltage-sensing mechanism of a subfamily of potassium channels is modulated in unconventional ways by an amino acid transporter.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A wide array of ion channels underlie distinct and regulated patterns of electrical signaling in excitable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yu et al., 2005</xref>). Ion channel subtypes possess different voltage dependence, kinetics, sensitivity to signaling cascades, regulation by physiological ions, and other stimuli that contribute to the moment-to-moment and long-term adaptability of electrical signaling in the body. In contrast to the rich complexity of multi-protein complexes known to regulate many synaptic neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobi and von Engelhardt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tomita, 2019</xref>), the majority of research on voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channels has focused on mechanisms of voltage sensitivity. Studies of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Shaker channel, the first cloned Kv channel, have generated a detailed understanding of core principles of voltage-dependent regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bezanilla, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bezanilla, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tempel et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Timpe et al., 1988</xref>). In comparison, regulation of mammalian Kv channels by extrinsic factors such as accessory proteins or signaling cascades is less understood. It is noteworthy that the Kv channels are the most diverse ion channel gene family, with nearly 50 human genes known to encode pore-forming subunits, but there are a relatively small number of recognized and well-studied accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutman et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Based on prior observations of variable Kv1.2 function in different cell types, we hypothesized that Kv1.2 is influenced by a variety of unidentified regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baronas et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baronas et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baronas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rezazadeh et al., 2007</xref>). We have pursued the identification of novel regulatory proteins that may influence this Kv channel, which has served as a structural model for interpretation of functional data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matthies et al., 2018</xref>). We identified powerful effects of an amino acid transporter, Slc7a5, on the gating and expression of Kv1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baronas et al., 2018</xref>). Slc7a5 has been primarily studied in its role as a transporter of drugs and amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barollo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dickens et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soares-da-Silva and Serrão, 2004</xref>), and also in the context of nutrient regulation of mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicklin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolfson et al., 2016</xref>), but is not recognized as a regulator of ion channel function. Recessively inherited Slc7a5 mutations were recently identified in patients with neurological symptoms including autism and motor delay. These traits were attributed to defective Slc7a5-mediated amino acid transport in endothelial cells in the blood–brain barrier, where it is prominently expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanai et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tărlungeanu et al., 2016</xref>), although Slc7a5 likely has diverse physiological roles in many cell types. For example, low levels of Slc7a5 have been reported in neurons, and other studies have suggested transport-independent functions of Slc7a5 in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katada and Sakurai, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsuo et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, Slc7a5 is essential for T cell differentiation and clonal expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marchingo et al., 2020</xref>), correlated to negative outcomes and growth of many proliferating tumor cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salisbury and Arthur, 2018</xref>), and causes embryonic lethality in Slc7a5 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poncet et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Several structures of Slc7a5 have been recently reported, highlighting its conserved LeuT fold comprising 12 transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yan et al., 2019</xref>), but there are few clues into the mechanisms underlying the powerful modulation of Kv1.2 by Slc7a5. Features of Slc7a5-dependent modulation of Kv1.2 currents include a pronounced shift (~−50 mV) of the voltage-dependence of activation, along with prominent inhibition of currents that is relieved by strong negative holding voltages. This voltage-dependent relief of inhibition can be very pronounced, often exceeding 10-fold enhancement of whole cell current. Strikingly, certain epilepsy-linked mutations of Kv1.2 are hypersensitive to Slc7a5-mediated modulation, leading to extraordinarily large (sometimes &gt;100 mV) gating shifts when co-expressed with Slc7a5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baronas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Masnada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">EuroEPINOMICS RES consortium et al., 2015</xref>). Although these effects are very prominent, the underlying structural determinants of the Slc7a5:channel interaction, its specificity among other Kv channels, and the role of Slc7a5 modulation in vivo, remain unclear.</p><p>In this study, we expanded our investigation of Slc7a5-mediated regulation to include another prominent neuronal potassium channel, Kv1.1. This channel subunit exhibits overlapping patterns of expression with Kv1.2 in the central nervous system, and often assembles with Kv1.2 into heteromeric channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coleman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manganas and Trimmer, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shamotienko et al., 1997</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that Kv1.1 is especially sensitive to modulation by Slc7a5, with endogenous levels of Slc7a5 having prominent regulatory effects. However, Kv1.1 exhibits different outcomes of Slc7a5 modulation relative to Kv1.2, whereas Kv1.5 is Slc7a5-insensitive. We use these differences to probe for sequence elements that influence Slc7a5 sensitivity, and identify the voltage-sensing domain as an important determinant. In summary, this study highlights a non-canonical regulatory influence of Slc7a5 on multiple Kv1 channels and identifies critical channel segments involved in these effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Kv1.1 sensitivity to Slc7a5</title><p>We recently reported several powerful effects of Slc7a5 on the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baronas et al., 2018</xref>).

This behavior arises due to an initial Slc7a5-mediated inhibition of channels, which is apparent immediately upon break-in and is then relieved by hyperpolarization. Exemplar records illustrating this relief of Slc7a5-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) were generated with intermittent 50 ms depolarizations to +10 mV from a holding potential of −120 mV (note that sweeps are concatenated for illustration, the interpulse interval was 2 s). Kv1.2 expressed alone exhibits relatively large currents, and no apparent relief of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). However, Kv1.2 co-expression with Slc7a5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>) leads to baseline currents that are small shortly after whole cell break-in but increase substantially after 20–30 s at a holding potential of −120 mV. We observed an average 5.1 ± 2.2 fold (mean ± S.D.) current enhancement of Kv1.2 with Slc7a5, although this is variable and reached 11.5-fold in some cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). In contrast, this effect was prominent for Kv1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), even in the absence of co-transfected Slc7a5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), with an average current enhancement of 3.2 ± 1.2 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These features (inhibition of baseline current, and relief of inhibition with −120 mV holding potential) became more prominent when Slc7a5 was co-expressed with Kv1.1, with a 6.1 ± 2.6 fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,F</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that Slc7a5 causes prominent inhibition of both Kv1.1 and Kv1.2. Reversal of Slc7a5-mediated inhibition by strong hyperpolarizing voltages leads to enhancement of current.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Kv1.1 exhibits prominent disinhibition in response to hyperpolarizing (−120 mV) voltage.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Disinhibition of Kv1.2 (<bold>A</bold>) or Kv1.1 (<bold>B</bold>) was tested by delivering repetitive 50 ms depolarizations to +10 mV (every 2 s), with an interpulse holding voltage of −120 mV.

The human Slc7a5 transcript is resistant to the mouse-targeted shRNA sequence used for the ShR4-1 cell line, due to two base pair mismatches. Thus, we could rescue Slc7a5 expression in ShR4-1 cells by transfection with human Slc7a5 cDNA (~91% sequence identity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,E–G</xref>).

These findings indicate that Slc7a5 is an important contributor to the Kv1.1 modulation observed in LM cells.

In all conditions, Kv1.1 recovers from inactivation with a holding voltage of −80 mV, as currents measured at point ‘e’ are comparable to point ‘d’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This finding suggests that Slc7a5-induced inhibition is not equivalent to C-type inactivation, because different voltages are required for recovery from these different conditions. To test this more stringently, we carried out similar experiments using Kv1.1[Y379T] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although Kv1.1[Y379T] exhibits far more prominent inactivation than WT Kv1.1, a similar outcome was observed. Strong hyperpolarization to −120 mV was required to rescue currents from Slc7a5 inhibition after break-in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, once this inhibition was relieved, channels could recover from nearly complete inactivation with a holding potential of −80 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). The disparity in the voltage-dependence of recovery from inactivation versus Slc7a5-mediated inhibition is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, highlighting that nearly complete recovery from C-type inactivation (solid symbols, ratio of points e/d) is observed with a holding voltage of −80 mV, whereas this voltage does not recover Slc7a5-mediated inhibition (open symbols, ratio of points b/c). These findings indicate that Slc7a5-mediated inhibition stabilizes channels by a mechanism distinct from C-type inactivation. Nevertheless, there appears to be some interaction between these processes because Slc7a5 can influence the inactivation rate in channel mutants that are prone to C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baronas et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Slc7a5 sensitivity is controlled by the voltage-sensing domain</title><p>Our findings illustrate that Kv1.1 is sensitive to endogenous levels of Slc7a5, but does not exhibit a prominent gating shift.

Our efforts to identify novel regulatory proteins of Kv channels revealed that Slc7a5, a widely studied amino acid transporter, exerts a powerful influence on gating and expression of Kv1.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baronas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamothe and Kurata, 2020</xref>). Prominent effects of Slc7a5 include suppression of channel expression, a −50 mV shift of voltage-dependent activation, and marked suppression of current that can be relieved/disinhibited by negative holding potentials. While powerful, the broader significance and underlying molecular mechanisms of these varied effects remain unclear. In this study, we have continued to investigate Slc7a5 regulation of Kv channels to address some of these lingering questions.</p><p>We previously demonstrated some Kv1 subtype specificity of Slc7a5 regulation, as Kv1.2 was prominently affected by Slc7a5, while Kv1.5 was not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baronas et al., 2018</xref>). Further investigation of other subtypes revealed that Kv1.1 exhibits some of the Slc7a5-mediated hallmark gating features observed in Kv1.2, most notably, the prominent Slc7a5-mediated inhibition relieved by holding the membrane voltage at −120 mV. Surprisingly, this effect persists in the absence of heterologous expression of Slc7a5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The influence of endogenous levels of Slc7a5 on Kv1.1 was confirmed using an shRNA knockdown approach, along with rescue by shRNA-resistant Slc7a5 cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The inhibitory effect of Slc7a5 on Kv1.1 or Kv1.2 is observed immediately upon whole-cell break-in, with current amplitudes significantly reduced compared to expression of either channel alone. It should be noted that after holding at −120 mV, channels typically remain ‘disinhibited’ such that Kv1 current suppression by Slc7a5 does not re-occur during the recording in most cells. However, other features of Slc7a5 regulation (accelerated inactivation of Kv1.1[Y379T] and Kv1.2[V381T], hyperpolarizing shift of Kv1.2 channel activation) persist even after Slc7a5 inhibition has been relieved. We have not identified a method to accelerate development of the Slc7a5-inhibited state. The underlying mechanism is not yet clear, although the requirement of strong negative voltages (−120 mV) for disinhibition is interesting as it lies outside the voltage range where most gating charge of Kv1.2 channels is displaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodchild et al., 2012</xref>). At this stage, we have not ruled out whether the strong negative voltages required to relieve Slc7a5-mediated inhibition are related to voltage-dependent conformational changes of the channel, transporter, or both. Interestingly, Kv1.2’LT’ (I304L and S308T) mutant channels, with altered coupling between the VSD and the pore, prevent the Slc7a5-mediated inhibition effect but retain sensitivity to the Slc7a5-mediated gating shift in Kv1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baronas et al., 2018</xref>). Based on these effects, we hypothesize that Slc7a5-mediated inhibition involves the pore domain (and can also trigger C-type inactivation in channels that are susceptible), which is influenced by coupling to Slc7a5 interactions in the VSD.</p><p>We have taken steps to determine whether the Slc7a5-mediated effects on Kv1.1 are due to a direct interaction with the channel, or some indirect effect related to Slc7a5 function. Slc7a5 can indirectly influence mTOR activity (primarily mTORC1), due to activation of mTORC1 by amino acids like leucine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicklin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saxton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolfson et al., 2016</xref>). Also, mTOR signaling has been shown to modulate Kv1.1 translation in dendrites, although this mechanism is unlikely to be involved here, as it was shown to rely on UTR elements that are not present in our Kv1.1 cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niere and Raab-Graham, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raab-Graham et al., 2006</xref>). We used a variety of approaches, including pharmacological inhibition of Slc7a5 (BCH) and mTORC1 (rapamycin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but found no effect on Kv1.1 regulation by Slc7a5. The transport deficient Slc7a5[F252A] mutant also suppressed Kv1.1, although we occasionally observed more prominent recovery of current at −80 mV in Slc7a5[F252A] versus WT Slc7a5 effects in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Based on recent cryo-EM structures, F252 is located in TM6 of Slc7a5, in very close proximity to the substrate-binding site. Mutations of F252 or other critical sites might influence the conformations achieved by the transporter, and alter its influence on the channel, but this will require further investigation. At present, we have not determined whether there is reciprocal modulation of Slc7a5 function by Kv channels. However, this possibility will continue to be explored, as certain combinations of Kv7 channels and myo-inositol transporters exhibit mutual regulation, along with other channel:transporter combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lebowitz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manville et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neverisky and Abbott, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Slc7a5 is expressed in a wide variety of cell types and undergoes prominent changes in certain physiological or pathological conditions. For example, T cell activation and proliferation requires prominent upregulation of Slc7a5, leading to protein abundance orders of magnitude larger than Kv channel expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marchingo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sinclair et al., 2013</xref>). Slc7a5 upregulation has also been reported in a variety of tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barollo et al., 2016</xref>), and Slc7a5 inhibition attenuates proliferation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salisbury and Arthur, 2018</xref>). In most instances, the role of Slc7a5 is considered in the context of providing nutrients for cell growth and division, and also activation of mTOR signaling. However, changes in ion channel activity and cellular excitability are also linked to cell division and proliferation in normal development and cancer or other pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang and Jan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pardo and Stühmer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Satou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Serrano-Novillo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). The cellular signals that control ion channel activity and expression during cell growth and division remain unestablished. We will continue to investigate how Slc7a5 or other related proteins may link cellular metabolism with electrical activity, growth, and proliferation. Recent work has also suggested that the inhibitory effect of Slc7a5 on Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 may enhance excitability in neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alles et al., 2020</xref>). Gene expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mousebrain.org/">mousebrain.org</ext-link>) of Slc7a5 overlaps with Kv1.1/1.2 in the NF1-3 subclass of DRG neurons and INH2 subclass of spinal cord neurons, each with varying degrees of expression between cell types. Therefore, excitability in certain cell types in the nervous system may be influenced by Slc7a5-mediated regulation of Kv1 channels, and altered during pain and inflammation. Overall, differential sensitivity, expression, and assembly of Kv1 isoforms and Slc7a5 may fine tune the interplay between channel and transporter. However, physiological modulation of Kv1 channels by Slc7a5 is still under investigation.</p><p>Auxiliary subunits can interact with voltage-gated ion channels in a variety of ways. The canonical auxiliary subunits of the Kv1 channel family are the Kvβ subunits, which are soluble proteins that interact with a cytoplasmic scaffolding domain that is structurally distinct from the Kv1 transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gulbis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Long et al., 2005</xref>). However, there is great diversity amongst known modulators of other Kv channels, including several transmembrane proteins. BK channels can be modulated simultaneously by both the BKβ and BKγ subunits, which are thought to associate with the pore-forming subunits via transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzalez-Perez and Lingle, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yan and Aldrich, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan and Aldrich, 2010</xref>). Similarly, the widely studied KCNE subunits are transmembrane proteins that have been proposed to integrate into clefts between neighboring voltage-sensing domains to modulate channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Another Kv channel with prominent regulation of channel gating by multiple classes of regulatory proteins is the Kv4 family, which is sensitive to both KChIP (a soluble cytoplasmic protein) and DPP-like proteins (transmembrane), leading to modulation of channel expression and gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jerng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitazawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zagha et al., 2005</xref>). Although we have not yet collected direct evidence of an interaction between Slc7a5 and Kv1.1 or Kv1.2, our findings indicate that Slc7a5 sensitivity is encoded by the voltage-sensing domains of these channels, and is significantly weakened by mutations in the S1 segment. While we suspect this is a site of interaction, Slc7a5 may also influence these channels via an intermediary, or through other nearby regions of the channel that interact allosterically with mutations in S1. Our previous studies have demonstrated co-regulation of Kv1.2 by Slc7a5 and Kvβ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baronas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lamothe and Kurata, 2020</xref>), indicating the possibility that Kv1 channels might assemble with multiple accessory subunits simultaneously (similar to the putative Kv4 complex with KChIP and DPP-like proteins). It is also noteworthy that we have previously identified powerful regulation of Kv1.2 gating by extracellular redox conditions, by a mechanism that is not intrinsic to the Kv1.2 α-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baronas et al., 2017</xref>). This effect is vastly different from Slc7a5 modulation, indicating an additional regulatory mechanism, and a recent study has suggested a possible role for the sigma opioid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraham et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, there are likely multiple unrecognized regulatory mechanisms that can strongly influence Kv1 channel gating, but it remains unclear how these pathways may interact in cell lines or native tissues.</p><p>In summary, our study highlights that Slc7a5 influences multiple targets in the Kv1 family, including Kv1.1 and Kv1.2. Moreover, we map Slc7a5 sensitivity to the voltage-sensing domain of Kv1 channels, highlighting a specific residue in the S1 segment rather than a cytoplasmic signal. We are hopeful that ongoing investigation of Kv channel regulatory proteins will broaden our understanding of voltage-gated channel function and regulation in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Bath solution had the following composition: 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, and was adjusted to pH 7.3 with NaOH. Pipette solution had the following composition: 135 mM KCl, 5 mM K-EGTA, 10 mM HEPES and was adjusted to pH 7.2 using KOH. Chemicals for electrophysiological solutions were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher. BCH (Slc7a5 inhibitor 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid, Sigma-Aldrich) was stored as a 100 mM stock solution in 1N NaOH, and diluted to working concentrations each experimental day. Rapamycin (Alfa Aesar, Fisher Scientific) was stored as a 10 mM stock solution in DMSO and diluted to working concentrations each experimental day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Lentiviral vector construction and delivery</title><p>We generated shRNAs targeting four segments of mouse Slc7a5 (refseq: NM_011404), with the ShR1, ShR2, ShR3, ShR4, and Negative control primers (see Appendix). Oligos were designed for hairpin formation and cloned into pLV-RNAi vector system (Biosettia, San Diego, USA. Cat#sort-B21) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Satou et al., 2020</xref>). All constructs were confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Applied Genomics Core, University of Alberta). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with packaging vectors (Provided in the pLV-RNAi vector system) and an shRNA expression vector. Lentivirus was harvested by centrifugation of HEK293T cell culture supernatant 48 hr after transfection. LM fibroblasts cells were seeded in six well plate at about 30% confluence the day before viral transduction. After 24 hr, media was replaced with fresh complete medium (DMEM with 10% FBS) containing 8 µg/mL polybrene and 0.5 mL of viral supernatant. After 24 hr of incubation, the virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. After further incubation for 48 hr, puromycin (2.5 µg/mL) was added and maintained in culture for selection of transduced cells. For the generation of clonal shRNA-expressing cell lines, transduced cells were plated by serial dilution in 96 well plates, and wells with single cells were identified by visual inspection under a microscope. After expansion of individual clones, effectiveness of knockdown was assessed using Western blot and qPCR approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blot</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Detection of Slc7a5</title><p>Cell lysates from LM fibroblasts were harvested in NP-40 lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl) with 1% protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, P8340), 3 days after transfection.

Reverse transcription was performed using the SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, USA), using Oligo(dT)20 primers to make cDNA. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out with TaqMan Fast Advance Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) in an ABI 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Taqman probes used were: Slc7a5 (cat: Mm00441516_m1), and GAPDH as an internal control gene (cat: Mm99999915_g1), obtained from Thermo Fisher. The cycling protocol used an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 3 s, annealing at 60°C for 30 s.

Using standard subcloning methods, WT Kv1.1, Slc7a5 and Slc7a6 cDNAs were tagged at the N-terminus with mEGFP. Mouse LM fibroblast cells were plated at 30% confluency in 12-well plates and then transiently transfected using jetPRIME the next day with cDNAs encoding BRET donors and acceptors. 48 hr after transfection, cells were replated onto white polystyrene 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher). After 24 hr, cells were washed with PBS, and incubated with Nano-Glo live cell assay reagent (Promega). Emission spectra were measured between 400 and 700 nm in 2 or 5 nm increments, and measured for 2 s at each interval with a Synergy H4 Hybrid Reader (BioTek). All Spectral data were normalized to the peak nanoluc emission, and subtraction of the normalized Kv1.1-nanoluc spectrum (measured as a blank control) produced the EGFP emission. The area under the curve (AUC) for the integrated EGFP emissions of Slc7a5 and Slc7a6 were normalized to the integrated EGFP emission from Kv1.1 nanoluc + EGFP-Kv1.1 in each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Wherever possible, we have displayed data for all individual data points collected, in addition to reporting mean ±S.D. or a box plot (where shown, box plots depict the median, 25th and 75th percentile (box), and 10th and 90th percentile (whiskers)).

suggesting that they interact in hitherto unanticipated manner. This study by Lamothe et al. shows that the amino acid transporter Slc7a5 broadly modulates the activity of other potassium channel isoforms but the functional outcomes are different. These findings highlight the diversity of regulatory mechanisms and enable identification of crucial regions involved in mediating these novel interactions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Control of Slc7a5 sensitivity by the voltage-sensing domain of Kv1 channels&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Baron Chanda as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Geoff Abbott (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The study identifies a new target for regulation by SLC75a5 which has been previously shown to regulate Kv1.2. This study shows that this regulation extends to other Kv1 channels but in ways that are unexpectedly different. These studies provide new insights into a relatively new area of ion channel biology. From a mechanistic standpoint, the study also shows that the voltage-sensing domain is the key domain involved in mediating these disparate effects on channel function. Nonetheless, the consensus amongst reviewers is that the manuscript does not provide sufficient mechanistic insight to warrant further consideration in <italic>eLife</italic>. As you will see below, there are some differences in opinion as to what will be sufficient. I hope the reviewers' feedback will help you improve the manuscript. If you believe you will be able to address these concerns and would like to reach out to us with a planned resubmission, please do not hesitate to contact us in advance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Control of Slc7a5 sensitivity by the voltage sensing domain of Kv1 channels&quot; by Sharmin et al., is an extension of the previous work from the same lab showing the effects of Slc7a5 co-expression on gating and expression of Kv1.2. In this manuscript the authors show that Slc7a5 can also regulate Kv1.1 with slightly different effects. Kv1.1 appears to be modulated by Slc7a5 even at the endogenous levels of expression. Furthermore, swapping the voltage sensing domains between Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 can also swap Slc7a5 sensitivity. The data presentation is transparent and the manuscript is well-written. However, this work would have been much more impactful if the authors had gone ahead and tried to identify the molecular mechanisms that contribute to differential sensitivity instead of limiting themselves to low-resolution domain level view. Given our understanding of the structure of Kv1 channel and the homology between the two isoforms, it seems this would be rather straightforward.</p><p>Some of the concerns I have regarding the manuscript are as follows:</p><p>1) Considering that kv1.1 is susceptible to endogenous levels of Slc7a5, could it be possible that the G-V curves shown in Figure 1 are already left shifted? Have the authors recorded the G-V curves from the endogenous Slc7a5 knock out cell line (shR41 used in Figure 4D and 4E)? If yes, do they see a shift in V1/2 when they rescue the cell line with human Slc7a5?</p><p>2) The authors should include in the discussion what could be the putative physiological importance of such differential sensitivity of two isoforms of Kv1. Along the same lines, have the authors tested the effects of Slc7a5 co-expression on the concatenated heterodimers of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 that the authors have used in one of the previous manuscripts. This could be important considering the physiological existence of these isoforms potentially as heterodimers.</p><p>3) Do authors believe that 6 hours of rapamycin treatment would completely inhibit downstream mTOR signaling? Although mTORC1 activity is inhibited completely within 30 minutes of rapamycin exposure, mTORC2 inhibition would require longer incubation than 6 hours (multiple lines of evidence, for example Sarbassov et al., 2006). Have the authors done any experiments to show that the concentration used in the manuscript for 6 hours can inhibit mTOR signaling completely? If not, these details need to be mentioned in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors describe regulation of the Kv1.1 potassium channel by the sodium-coupled amino acid transporter, Slc7a5. This is a follow-up to their previous publication showing Slc7a5 regulation of Kv1.2. The main difference between the two is that Slc7a5 reduces Kv1.2 current density and negatively shifts its voltage dependence of activation; Slc7a5 does not alter Kv1.1 in this way but instead alters disinhibition from a presumed non-conducting state and speeds C-type inactivation of the hyper-inactivating Kv1.1-Y379T mutant. The voltage sensor appears to dictate which of these sets of effects occur, based on convincing chimera data. Overall this is interesting work that pushes forward the relatively new field of channel-transporter complexes.</p><p>Specific points.</p><p>1) Have the authors considered that rather than disinhibiting Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 from a non-conducting state, Slc7a5 has the opposite effect, and slows disinhibition from this state? In many of the examples they show, the channels reach an equivalent or greater peak current after the -120 mV pulses in the absence of Slc7a5 (either immediately or after a few pulses) versus in the presence. When Slc7a5 is co-expressed, the channel eventually achieves a similar current level, but it takes many more pulses. It appears more as if the transporter slows disinhibition of the channel and/or favors the equilibrium toward the inhibited state. The authors should demonstrate that they can distinguish between the two completely opposite conclusions.</p><p>2) Related to the point above, if the non-conducting state is actually a form of C-type inactivation, then slowed disinhibition (recovery) from inactivation with Slc7a5 would be consistent with the more rapid inactivation they observe for the mutant Kv1.1 channel when Slc7a5 is also present. The authors should try some inactivation recovery voltage protocols in which they vary the recovery pulse voltage and duration as this might provide answers or at least clues to points 1 and 2.</p><p>3) Still on the inactivation theme – does Slc7a5 alter the slower C-type inactivation that wild-type Kv1.1 undergoes with longer pulses? This is more important than the unnatural process shown with the Y379T mutant.</p><p>4) Some evidence of physical interaction would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This research group had reported the regulation of Kv1.2 by Slc7a5. This manuscript reports the difference in the effects of Slc7a5 on the gating of Kv1.2 and Kv1.1 and found that the voltage sensor domain underlies the difference. However, this new study provides only some limited incremental insight on the mechanisms of Kv1 channel regulation by Slc7a5. The finding that the voltage sensor domain underlies the Kv1.1 and kv1.2 difference is new but without surprise. Importantly, the mechanisms on how Slc7a5 affects Kv channel gating via its impact on voltage sensor domain remains completely unknown.</p><p>1) Results section. The difference in disinhibition between Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 caused by Slc7a5 could be explained by the different effects on their inactivation. It is likely that Kv1.2 shows no inactivation in the absence of exogenous Slc7a5 co-expression while Kv1.1 undergoes partial inactivation even with endogenous Slc7a5 expression. Both Kv1.2 and Kv1.1 could be similarly inactivated with exogenous Slc7a5 expression. A comparison in inactivation rates and levels (i.e., portion of channels became inactivated) between Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 with endogenous Slc7a5 only and in the presence of exogenous Slc7a5 should be helpful to explain the difference in disinhibition which is essentially a recovery from the inactivated state at very negative membrane voltages.</p><p>2) Subsection “Inhibition of Slc7a5 transport function or signaling does not prevent Kv1 modulation”. Although inhibition of the Slc7a5 transporter activity and the downstream mTOR activity had little effect on Kv1.1 channel's sensitivity to Slc7a5, it remains unclear whether there are direct physical interactions involved. Particularly, how voltage sensor domain is involved in the Slc7a5's effects on Kv channel gating is completely unknown. It will be helpful if some biochemical experiments can be done to demonstrate physical interactions between Slc7a5 and kv1.1 or 1.2 voltage sensor domain. In addition, the amino acid sequences of voltage sensor domains between Kv1.1 and 1.2 are highly similar, it won't be difficult to identify amino acid residues involved for the 2 channels' difference in their sensitivities to Slc7a5.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Control of Slc7a5 sensitivity by the voltage-sensing domain of Kv1 channels&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In this manuscript the authors show that Slc7a5 can also regulate Kv1.1 with slightly different effects. Kv1.1 appears to be modulated by Slc7a5 even at the endogenous levels of expression. Furthermore, swapping the voltage sensing domains between Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 can also swap Slc7a5 sensitivity. In the revised version, new data to differentiate between Slc7a5-induced inhibition and classic C-type inactivation was added. Furthermore, they have able to identify the residues that are responsible for the difference in Slc7a5's modulation of Kv1 channels' gating properties. The data clearly demonstrate that the voltage sensor domain (VSD) is relevant in the different effects of Slc7a5 on Kv1.1, 1.2 and 1.5 channels.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>Some concerns remain.</p><p>1) It is helpful to provide some characterization or explanation of the Slc7a5-induced Kv1.1 and 1.2 channel inhibition which can be disinhibited by holding at -120 mV. How does the inhibition occur? It is not shown in the data what condition and how long needed for the inhibition to occur. After disinhibition by holding at a very negative voltage, it is unclear whether the channel can go back to the inhibited state.</p><p>2) It is possible that Slc7a5 may act on VSDs either directly via physical interactions or indirectly via another protein. However, the current data cannot rule out other possibilities, e.g., Slc7a5 may act on other parts of the channels which somehow allosterically magnifies or modifies the Kv1 channels' intrinsic voltage gating properties.</p><p>3) It is interesting that the F252A mutation on Slc7a5 exerted some effect on Kv1 gating. The observed interaction between inactivation and inhibition is also interesting. Some elaboration or thoughts on those could be helpful for readers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54916.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

A few key points are that Slc7a5 is markedly upregulated in conditions of rapid cell growth and division (ie. tumors, T-cell activation and expansion), and may influence Kv1 channel function. A recent publication has also hypothesized a role for Slc7a5 in regulating neuronal excitability in pain and inflammation (Alles et al., 2020). The relative abundance of Kv1 subtypes with different Slc7a5 sensitivity may influence the outcome in these scenarios. These are a few potential scenarios, although a clear cut physiological system illustrating Slc7a5 modulation of Kv1 channels has not been established.</p><p>As requested we have added data from the Kv1.2-Kv1.1 tandem heterodimer described in: Baronas et al., 2015 in Figure 3—figure supplement 3. These heterodimeric channels exhibit shifted voltage-dependence of activation (but not as large as seen for Kv1.2 homomers), and attenuated Slc7a5-mediated inhibition compared to Kv1.1 homomers. We speculate that this difference is likely due to the stoichiometric requirements for these two functional outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do authors believe that 6 hours of rapamycin treatment would completely inhibit downstream mTOR signaling?

Our primary aim was to investigate the possibility of a signal-mediated effect of Slc7a5 on Kv1.1. There is some consensus that mTORC1 is the primary amino acid responsive mTOR complex, so this was our primary concern (Saxton and Sabatini, 2017). We have expanded significantly on these considerations (together with some other reviewer suggestions) in the paper as follows:</p><p>In addition to rapamycin, we have now included data from a transport deficient Slc7a5[F252A] mutant, along with BCH (Slc7a5 transport inhibitor), which demonstrate that the transport function of Slc7a5 is not required for Kv1.1 modulation. These conditions recapitulate the gating effects of WT Slc7a5 on Kv1.1, suggesting that signals related to the transport function of Slc7a5 (amino acid uptake) are not essential for Kv1.1 modulation (see Figures 4, 5, 6 and accompanying supplements).</p><p>We also included western blot data demonstrating basal levels of mTORC1 activation based on phospho-S6, phospho-mTOR and 4-EBP1 detection, along with complete inhibition by rapamycin (Figure 4, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We have also stated explicitly that the experiments do not absolutely rule out the involvement of mTORC2, however mTORC1 is the primary amino acid responsive mTOR complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors describe regulation of the Kv1.1 potassium channel by the sodium-coupled amino acid transporter, Slc7a5.

In many of the examples they show, the channels reach an equivalent or greater peak current after the -120 mV pulses in the absence of Slc7a5 (either immediately or after a few pulses) versus in the presence. When Slc7a5 is co-expressed, the channel eventually achieves a similar current level, but it takes many more pulses. It appears more as if the transporter slows disinhibition of the channel and/or favors the equilibrium toward the inhibited state. The authors should demonstrate that they can distinguish between the two completely opposite conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for requesting this clarification – we regret that we did not describe this aspect of our interpretation more clearly in the initial submission. We intended to convey that Slc7a5 has an inhibitory effect on Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 (causing very small initial currents after whole cell break in). This effect is then relieved by very negative holding voltages – this relief of inhibition is what we had referred to as “disinhibition”. Addition of more Slc7a5 makes this effect more prominent, (ie. Figure 2B, E, F, Figure 3E-G). This may reflect a higher stoichiometry of interaction of the channel with overexpressed Slc7a5 (i.e. occupancy of more subunits than with lower levels of endogenous Slc7a5).</p><p>We have attempted to clarify this throughout the text. For example, we switched to primarily referring to “relief of Slc7a5-mediated inhibition”. We feel this will help and is more descriptive of our observations. We have also more clearly described the effect and its voltage-dependence in our discussion of Figure 2, 3 and 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related to the point above, if the non-conducting state is actually a form of C-type inactivation, then slowed disinhibition (recovery) from inactivation with Slc7a5 would be consistent with the more rapid inactivation they observe for the mutant Kv1.1 channel when Slc7a5 is also present. The authors should try some inactivation recovery voltage protocols in which they vary the recovery pulse voltage and duration as this might provide answers or at least clues to points 1 and 2.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting aspect of this system. We have added significantly more detail, although we must admit that we do not yet understand completely. This information has been primarily added to Figures 5 and 6.</p><p>A clear outcome of our findings is that Slc7a5-mediated inhibition is distinct from C-type inactivation. In Figure 6 (and Figure 6—figure supplement 1), we demonstrate that relief of Slc7a5-mediated inhibition requires a strong hyperpolarization to -120 mV (hyperpolarization to -80 mV is not effective). In contrast, after channels have been rescued from Slc7a5 inhibition, they can undergo C-type inactivation, and recover readily from C-type inactivation with a holding voltage of -80 mV. This is shown in Figure 6, and more dramatically for the C-type enhanced Y379T mutant in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. This illustrates that Slc7a5-mediated inhibition is distinct from C-type inactivation, although the effects of Slc7a5 on in Kv1.1[Y379T] and Kv1.2[V381T] mutants suggest there may be some interplay between these processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Still on the inactivation theme – does Slc7a5 alter the slower C-type inactivation that wild-type Kv1.1 undergoes with longer pulses? This is more important than the unnatural process shown with the Y379T mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reported the effects of Slc7a5 on inactivation of WT Kv1.1 in the revised manuscript. We do not observe a consistent change in the time course of C-type inactivation in WT Kv1.1, even though these channels exhibit strong inhibition by Slc7a5. This finding further supports our overall suggestion that Slc7a5-mediated inhibition is distinct from C-type inactivation. This is shown in Figure 5 of the revision (previous experiments on Kv1.1[Y379T] have been moved to Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and updated to include data from the Slc7a5[F252A] transport-deficient mutant).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some evidence of physical interaction would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we have tried various approaches for co-immunoprecipitation with Slc7a5, but we have not been able to demonstrate this convincingly. In the revised manuscript, we have used a BRET approach to demonstrate proximity of Kv1.1 and Slc7a5 (similar to what we reported for Kv1.2 and Slc7a5 in Baronas et al., 2018). We have included this in the revision in Figure 4, although we have qualified our findings and clarified that this is not necessarily a demonstration of direct association.</p><p>We have also added considerable chimeric/mutational analysis of Slc7a5 sensitivity in this revision. Additional data in Figures 8 and 9 identify a particularly important position in S1 (Kv1.2 I164/ Kv1.1 V168). Again this does not demonstrate physical association but begins to reveal specific structural regions that influence susceptibility to Slc7a5-mediated modulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This research group had reported the regulation of Kv1.2 by Slc7a5. This manuscript reports the difference in the effects of Slc7a5 on the gating of Kv1.2 and Kv1.1 and found that the voltage sensor domain underlies the difference. However, this new study provides only some limited incremental insight on the mechanisms of Kv1 channel regulation by Slc7a5. The finding that the voltage sensor domain underlies the Kv1.1 and kv1.2 difference is new but without surprise. Importantly, the mechanisms on how Slc7a5 affects Kv channel gating via its impact on voltage sensor domain remains completely unknown.</p><p>1) Results section. The difference in disinhibition between Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 caused by Slc7a5 could be explained by the different effects on their inactivation. It is likely that Kv1.2 shows no inactivation in the absence of exogenous Slc7a5 co-expression while Kv1.1 undergoes partial inactivation even with endogenous Slc7a5 expression. Both Kv1.2 and Kv1.1 could be similarly inactivated with exogenous Slc7a5 expression. A comparison in inactivation rates and levels (i.e., portion of channels became inactivated) between Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 with endogenous Slc7a5 only and in the presence of exogenous Slc7a5 should be helpful to explain the difference in disinhibition which is essentially a recovery from the inactivated state at very negative membrane voltages.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important question. As mentioned above, we have added experiments and clarified our writing to describe how Slc7a5-mediated inhibition is distinct from C-type inactivation. We report that WT Kv1.1 is clearly susceptible to Slc7a5-mediated inhibition, although there is not a consistent effect on inactivation (see Figure 5). We also demonstrate that relief of Slc7a5 inhibition vs. C-type inactivation occurs at very different holding voltages (see Figure 6, and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Notably, even after nearly complete inactivation of Kv1.1[Y379T] channels (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), they recover readily with a holding voltage of -80 mV. This suggests that Slc7a5-mediated inhibition is distinct from C-type inactivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Inhibition of Slc7a5 transport function or signaling does not prevent Kv1 modulation”. Although inhibition of the Slc7a5 transporter activity and the downstream mTOR activity had little effect on Kv1.1 channel's sensitivity to Slc7a5, it remains unclear whether there are direct physical interactions involved. Particularly, how voltage sensor domain is involved in the Slc7a5's effects on Kv channel gating is completely unknown. It will be helpful if some biochemical experiments can be done to demonstrate physical interactions between Slc7a5 and kv1.1 or 1.2 voltage sensor domain. In addition, the amino acid sequences of voltage sensor domains between Kv1.1 and 1.2 are highly similar, it won't be difficult to identify amino acid residues involved for the 2 channels' difference in their sensitivities to Slc7a5.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree these are important concerns and we have added additional data to address these questions, particularly in Figures 4, 7, 8 and 9 of the revised manuscript. We had initially pursued more detailed experiments of Kv1.1/1.2 chimeras. These data are now included as supplements to Figure 7, although we found these experiments to be ambiguous in that we could not isolate individual voltage sensor regions that determined a Kv1.1- vs. Kv1.2-like response. This may be because both Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 are sensitive to Slc7a5, leading to mixed effects on the gating shift and Slc7a5-mediated inhibition in these chimers. Although We could not find a clear answer using the approach of mixing segments of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2, we agree that this may be useful information and is worthwhile to include.</p><p>It turned out that a far more useful approach was to use chimeric channels comprising segments of Kv1.5 (which is insensitive to any Slc7a5 modulation, as far as we can tell). This approach was much more fruitful, and revealed a single amino acid in the S1 segment that strongly influences Slc7a5 sensitivity. This has been included in Figures 8 and 9 of the revision, highlighting that residue Kv1.2[164] or Kv1.1[168] strongly influences the response to Slc7a5.</p><p>As mentioned to reviewer #2, we have not successfully co-immunoprecipitated Kv1.1 and Slc7a5 (or Kv1.2 and Slc7a5), which may be a reflection of the interaction being detergent sensitive, or implying the involvement of additional proteins. We have used a BRET assay that illustrates proximity in the revised paper (Figure 4D-F), although we recognize that more work will need to be done to determine the structural basis for modulation. We have tried to convey this uncertainty regarding a physical association clearly in the revision.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>Some concerns remain.</p><p>1) It is helpful to provide some characterization or explanation of the Slc7a5-induced Kv1.1 and 1.2 channel inhibition which can be disinhibited by holding at -120 mV. How does the inhibition occur? It is not shown in the data what condition and how long needed for the inhibition to occur. After disinhibition by holding at a very negative voltage, it is unclear whether the channel can go back to the inhibited state.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed this in the Results section, along with more details in the Discussion (see also point 3). We clarify that Slc7a5-mediated inhibition is observed immediately after break-in. After relief of inhibition, currents typically remain stable for the remainder of the experiment. We presume that Slc7a5-mediated inhibition occurs over longer time scales than we are able to observe in a patch clamp recording.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is possible that Slc7a5 may act on VSDs either directly via physical interactions or indirectly via another protein. However, the current data cannot rule out other possibilities, e.g., Slc7a5 may act on other parts of the channels which somehow allosterically magnifies or modifies the Kv1 channels' intrinsic voltage gating properties.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that although we have identified specific residues that influence the functional effects of Slc7a5 on Kv channels, this does not demonstrate that this is the specific site of interaction. We have made a note of this towards the end of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is interesting that the F252A mutation on Slc7a5 exerted some effect on Kv1 gating. The observed interaction between inactivation and inhibition is also interesting. Some elaboration or thoughts on those could be helpful for readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the channel inhibition by the F252A mutant is an interesting finding because it suggests that modulation is not dependent on signaling pathways typically related to Slc7a5. Based on our findings we favor the explanation of a direct association between the channel and transporter, although this will require deeper investigation to confirm. We have added a few additional thoughts on this topic in the Discussion. In terms of the relationship between inactivation and Slc7a5 mediated inhibition, we have alluded to this in our added discussion. Specifically, since altered pore-VSD coupling seems to abolish Slc7a5-mediated inhibition in the Kv1.2’LT’ mutant, we suspect that this effect requires intact pore-VSD coupling (rather than some immobilization of the VSD by Slc7a5 that prevents channel opening).</p></body></sub-article></article>
