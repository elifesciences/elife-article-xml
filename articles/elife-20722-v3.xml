Their inhibition is predicted to have pleiotropic effects, but it is unclear whether this will impact on the clinical utility of CDK8/19 inhibitors. We discovered two series of potent chemical probes with high selectivity for CDK8/19. Despite pharmacodynamic evidence for robust on-target activity, the compounds exhibited modest, though significant, efficacy against human tumor lines and patient-derived xenografts. Altered gene expression was consistent with CDK8/19 inhibition, including profiles associated with super-enhancers, immune and inflammatory responses and stem cell function. In a mouse model expressing oncogenic beta-catenin, treatment shifted cells within hyperplastic intestinal crypts from a stem cell to a transit amplifying phenotype. In two species, neither probe was tolerated at therapeutically-relevant exposures. The complex nature of the toxicity observed with two structurally-differentiated chemical series is consistent with on-target effects posing significant challenges to the clinical development of CDK8/19 inhibitors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20722.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20722.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20722.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Healthy cells in the human body can become cancerous if they gain genetic mutations that allow them to rapidly grow and divide. Some types of cancer respond better to drug treatments than others and tumors often develop resistance to a particular drug treatment after a while. Because of this, researchers are always searching for new molecules to develop into anticancer drugs.</p><p>Recently, a team of researchers identified some small molecules that could inactivate two closely related proteins called CDK8 and CDK19. CDK8 is essential for the WNT signaling pathway – which enables cells to communicate with one another – and has been extensively studied in various cancers. Previous studies indicate that this protein can either promote or inhibit the growth of tumors, depending on the type and stage of the cancer. Furthermore, CDK8 regulates a type of molecular switch called a “super-enhancer”, which controls the activity of many genes. In contrast, the role of CDK19 in cells was not as well understood. Here Clarke, Ortiz-Ruiz et al. investigated whether two different classes of small molecules that target CDK8 and CDK19 (referred to as “prototype CDK8/19 drugs”) could inhibit the growth of cancers, and whether they have any harmful side effects on healthy cells.</p><p>For the experiments, human cancer cells were implanted into mice. Treating these mice with prototype CDK8/19 drugs inhibited the activity of CDK8 and CDK19 in the cancer cells and slowed the growth of colorectal tumors. A type of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia was particularly sensitive to the drugs. However, Clarke, Ortiz-Ruiz et al. also observed that the prototype drugs altered the activity of many genes with roles in healthy tissues such as immune, bone and stem cells. Further experiments in mice and cells grown in the laboratory confirmed that these prototype drugs have adverse effects on healthy intestinal and bone marrow stem cells and trigger changes to immune cells. These concerning side effects were also evident when the prototype drugs were tested in rats and dogs. Furthermore, the experiments indicate that there is not a suitable range of doses of these drugs in which the therapeutic benefits outweigh the toxic side effects.</p><p>Clarke, Ortiz-Ruiz et al. conclude that the clinical development of CDK8/19 drugs will be extremely challenging and that their prototype drugs would not currently be suitable for use as cancer treatments. However, the small molecules they describe will be important probes in research to study exactly how CDK8/19 regulate gene activity in both healthy cells and cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20722.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20722.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>CDK8</kwd><kwd>inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Mediator complex</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>super-enhancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009794</institution-id><institution>Breast Cancer Now</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2008MayPR16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dale</surname><given-names>Trevor C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C309/A11566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Workman</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C368/A6743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Workman</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A368/A7990</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Workman</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Detailed molecular profiling investigations alongside antitumor testing and tolerability studies in animals suggest caution when considering the clinical development of inhibitors of CDK8 and CDK19, since a clear therapeutic window could not be demonstrated with two structurally distinct, potent and selective prototype drugs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Mediator complex is a multi-subunit regulator of transcription in eukaryotes that transfers signals from DNA-bound transcription factors to the RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yin and Wang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poss et al., 2013</xref>). It also has a role in transcription elongation and pausing, and can influence chromatin structure, where it facilitates the formation of enhancer-promoter gene loops and is enriched at ‘super-enhancer’ regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whyte, 2013</xref>). Mediator activity is regulated by the association with a four-subunit kinase module containing cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), cyclin C (CCNC) and Mediator subunits MED12 and MED13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taatjes et al., 2002</xref>). As a kinase that reversibly associates with the Mediator, CDK8 is thought to regulate gene expression through phosphorylation of transcription factors and Mediator subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rzymski et al., 2015</xref>). Phosphorylation by CDK8 can directly alter transcription factor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bancerek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morris et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>) or mark factors for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fryer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alarcón et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2014</xref>). The role of CDK8, and the Mediator kinase module, in the control of transcription may not be unique as paralogs of CDK8, MED12 and MED13 have been identified that may have distinct roles in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sato et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tsutsui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galbraith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Westerling et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The biological function of CDK8 varies by cell type and response to different stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen and Taatjes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCleland et al., 2015</xref>).

Furthermore, <italic>CDK8</italic> expression is reportedly required for growth of colorectal cancer xenografts and to maintain embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, <italic>CDK8</italic> expression transforms fibroblasts into a malignant phenotype, whereas expression of a kinase-dead mutant does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Firestein et al., 2008</xref>). An shRNA screen has also demonstrated a requirement for CDK8 in the activation of WNT signaling in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Firestein et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that CDK8 and the Mediator kinase module may promote oncogenesis through activation of the canonical WNT pathway.</p><p>Previously, we reported the discovery and optimization of a potent and selective 3,4,5-trisubstituted pyridine series of small-molecule inhibitors of WNT signaling from a cell-based pathway screen, and using a chemo-proteomic strategy we identified CDK8 and CDK19 as the primary molecular targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyer, 2015</xref>). Through further optimization we identified a potent, highly selective and orally bioavailable dual CDK8/19 ligand with excellent cell-based activity and pharmaceutical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mallinger et al., 2016a</xref>).

Throughout our studies on both chemical series, we observed a strong correlation between the compounds’ affinities for both CDK8 and CDK19, suggesting that selective inhibition of CDK8 versus CDK19 is likely to be a significant challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mallinger et al., 2016a</xref>). This reflects the high sequence similarity between CDK8 and CDK19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also tested selected compounds from a further three chemical series that we identified from the literature and again could not detect any substantial selectivity for CDK8 versus CDK19 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vitro activity of chemical probes and preclinical candidates</title><p>We confirmed compound activity in a range of in vitro assays using human colorectal cancer cell lines, including some with an increased <italic>CDK8</italic> gene copy number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). All four compounds potently inhibited a WNT-dependent reporter in all of the cell lines tested, but did not inhibit a WNT-independent housekeeping <italic>EEF1A1</italic> promoter-reporter construct in the negative control RKO colorectal cancer cell line, which expresses low levels of beta-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mallinger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dale et al., 2015</xref>). Weakly-active negative-control compounds from the 3,4,5-trisubstituted pyridine and 3-methyl-1<italic>H</italic>-pyrazolo[3,4-<italic>b</italic>]pyridine series (compounds 5 and 6 respectively) did not inhibit reporter gene expression or STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Given the potent inhibition of reporter activity we were surprised by the lack of effect of our potent inhibitors on tumor cell proliferation after standard 4 d continuous exposure conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). However, this was consistent with a reported lack of antiproliferative effects for a different chemical series in a single colorectal cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koehler et al., 2016</xref>). Silencing of <italic>CDK8</italic> and/or <italic>CDK19</italic> by shRNA in <italic>CDK8</italic>-amplified COLO205 cells also had no effect on viability, despite evidence for inhibition of reporter output or target gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Knockdown was more effective when we used <italic>CDK8</italic> and/or <italic>CDK19</italic> siRNA in <italic>CDK8</italic>-amplified HT29 cells, but again we saw no significant effect on viability after 5 d exposure to siRNA, despite near complete inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation by the <italic>CDK8</italic> siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). In contrast, a 14 d colony growth assay revealed a significantly similar antiproliferative effect for the lead compounds from both chemical series (p&lt;0.001 for all comparisons with 1, 3 and 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which was not observed for the negative-control compounds 5 and 6. However, no compounds showed colony growth inhibition in the negative control RKO colorectal cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mallinger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dale et al., 2015</xref>). In this assay, we found three beta-catenin mutant (LS513, LS180, LS174T) and an APC mutant (SW620) colorectal cell lines to be most sensitive to treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The association between beta-catenin mutation and sensitivity to compound treatment in the colony assay did not reach significance (p&gt;0.05). The lack of response of the RKO cells suggested that colony growth in this line did not require beta-catenin or CDK8 and contrasted with the APC or beta-catenin mutant lines where colony growth appeared to be dependent on beta-catenin-regulated transcription that also required CDK8/19. Overall, there was no significant correlation between compound activity in TCF-reporter, phospho-biomarker, colony growth assays and either CDK8/19 protein levels or gene copy number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CDK8/19 ligands have modest activity against human colorectal cancer tumor xenogafts</title><p>Next, we determined if our two series of compounds had antitumor activity in vivo in human colorectal cancer xenograft mouse models.

In SW620 tumor xenografts biomarker inhibition was rapidly achieved following treatment with 3 or 4 and could be maintained for approximately 10 hr after a single treatment with 30 mg/kg of 3, while 30 or 100 mg/kg of 4 prolonged the period of inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation so that, unlike 3, multiple dosing with 4 prevented recovery of biomarker to control levels between treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

Given this sporadic body weight loss in mice and our evidence that the compounds had effects on bone development, altered immune/inflammatory profiles and stem cell differentiation in vitro or in vivo experimental models, we carried out detailed toleration studies. Our aim was to determine if there was a therapeutic window for the compounds, using PK/PD and efficacy data determined in our mouse models as a guide. Following daily doses of compound 3 or 4 for 14 days in rats we detected significant, adverse alterations in multiple organ systems and tissues (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Since these pathological effects were seen with two highly selective, but structurally distinct CDK8/19 inhibitors in both rats and dogs, we conclude that the adverse effects of treatment are the direct result of inhibition of CDK8 and/or CDK19. These observations indicate that the clinical development of either series of CDK8/19 inhibitors, or other chemotypes with similar profiles, would be extremely challenging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>CDK8 may reportedly act both as an oncogene and as a tumor suppressor, but until recently, the absence of a potent and selective inhibitor of CDK8 has restricted many functional studies to genetic inhibition using shRNA or siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mitra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chattopadhyay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Firestein et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Starr et al., 2009</xref>). The potential difference between loss of protein and inhibition of enzymatic activity is highlighted by a recent study with the natural product CDK8/19 inhibitor cortistatin A that found a treatment-induced gene expression profile distinct from the profile resulting from CDK8/19 shRNA knockouts in the same cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poss et al., 2016</xref>). Also conscious of the potentially opposing context-dependent roles of CDK8 in tumor development, we set out to clarify the therapeutic potential of targeting CDK8/19. Using two structurally-distinct series of potent and highly selective ligands that we discovered, we explored the consequences of CDK8/19 targeting in vitro and in vivo and investigated tolerability to determine if there was a therapeutic window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mallinger et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Czodrowski et al., 2016</xref>). Despite reproducible inhibition of TCF/LEF reporter activity and STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation by both series of compounds, we were only able to detect modest, though generally significant, antiproliferative or antitumor effects in vitro or in vivo. In follow-up studies on cell cultures derived from PDX tumors, and selected PDXs in vivo, we found that compounds from the 3,4,5-trisubstituted pyridine series had only modest effects in vitro and little effect in vivo despite maximal inhibition of STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation. The pleiotropic nature of CDK8/19 function, influencing the activity of multiple specific transcription factors and also super-enhancers, may make identification of biomarkers for particular cancer cell types that are especially sensitive to CDK8/19 inhibitors challenging; despite this both series of compounds did show greater potency in a systemic or subcutaneous model of human AML, similar to that reported for the natural product inhibitor of CDK8/19, cortistatin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We found that the in vivo activity of our CDK8/19 inhibitory compounds was associated with modulation of gene expression regulated by transcription factors that are CDK8 substrates. Moreover, Pelish and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>) recently demonstrated that in AML cells CDK8 is associated with gene super-enhancers and that pharmacological inhibition of CDK8 activated super-enhancer output. Here, we also found that pharmacological inhibition of CDK8 with our potent and selective chemical probes in colorectal cancer models resulted in gene expression profiles consistent with increased super-enhancer activity. Genes whose expression were altered by the compounds included those encoding products associated with bone development, stem cell biology, immunology and inflammation. Extensive follow up experiments in in vitro and in vivo models demonstrated effects on bone, stem cell differentiation and response of immune cells to different stimuli. Some of the effects were unique, for example concentration-dependent stimulation or inhibition of bone matrix production by osteoprogenitor cells in vitro that was not observed with a WNT-pathway inhibitor.</p><p>CDK8 activity maintains embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated, pluripotent state and colorectal tumors in a de-differentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2012</xref>). We found that complete inhibition of CDK8/19 in the presence of activated oncogenic beta-catenin mimicked the effect of reducing, rather than completely abrogating, WNT-signaling. CDK8/19 inhibition resulted in a shift from a stem cell to a predominantly TA cell phenotype. This response may also be linked to super-enhancer activation, as expression of <italic>Myc</italic>, a super-enhancer-regulated gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lovén et al., 2013</xref>), was repressed in the stem cell population, but elevated in the TA cell population following compound treatment. The example of <italic>Myc</italic> illustrates the potential complexity of the response to CDK8 inhibition, as <italic>Myc</italic> expression will potentially be repressed through loss of CDK8 activity required by beta-catenin, but <italic>Myc</italic> expression may also be promoted through super-enhancer activation. This suggests that cellular context will have a major impact on the transcriptional response to CDK8 inhibition.</p><p>The final key aim of our studies was to investigate tolerability to CDK8/19 inhibition and identify a possible potential therapeutic window for compounds 3 and 4. In rat and dog tolerability studies, we found that 3 and 4 produced unusually extensive, but similar, adverse effects in a wide range of tissues. Given our observations, that are consistent with the reported role of CDK8 in repressing super-enhancer activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>), and the potentially key roles of super-enhancers as master controllers of cell identity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>), the breadth, degree and depth of adverse effects is perhaps not surprising. We detected elevation of the mainly proinflammatory and proimmunestimulatory associated cytokine, IL-12, in rats treated with 3. Elevated IL-12 may result from decreased STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> following CDK8 inhibition, as bone marrow macrophages from STAT1<sup>S727A</sup> mutant mice exhibit elevated IL-12 and Cox-2 expression following activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schroder et al., 2007</xref>). Cox-2 induction is associated with an increased production of PGE2, which we detected in vitro, that may also explain the unusual split response of increased IL-17A and decreased IL-17F observed in our in vitro experiments, since PGE2, or agonists of the EP receptor for PGE2 are among the few stimuli that induce this split effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Melton et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We concluded that the multiplicity of preclinical pathomorphological lesions would make monitoring and controlling toxicity in a clinical study very challenging, especially as no clear safety window could be established from our studies. Our data strongly suggest that the adverse effects are target related as they are detected with two chemically distinct series of potent and selective CDK8/19 ligands and indicate that dual pharmacological CDK8/19 inhibition is not tolerated in rats or dogs at exposure levels that correspond to therapeutically relevant exposures. Even in the more sensitive xenograft models of AML, there was no clear therapeutic window, as these tumors responded only when STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> phosphorylation was continuously inhibited and equivalent exposures were not tolerated in our <italic>in vivo</italic> rat and dog toleration studies. Protein kinase inhibitors in clinical development or approved often have off-target activity or in some cases can be intentionally multi-targeted to have inhibitory activity against multiple protein kinases. Our observations are important for both scenarios as we identify CDK8/19 as potential ‘anti-targets’ to be avoided and we recommend screening against these protein kinases when establishing the safety profile of lead compounds and development candidates as well as assessing the quality of chemical probes.</p><p>As described earlier, the natural product cortistatin A was recently reported by Pelish and colleagues as a CDK8/19 inhibitor with specificity, potency, favourable pharmacokinetics that would make it a useful in vitro and in vivo probe for the Mediator kinases and as a promising lead for development of therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we employed two different series of potent and selective CDK8/19 inhibitors, with paired negative controls, that are much less challenging to synthesise compared to cortistatin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>). Our synthetic compounds have optimal pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties with single digit nM affinities for CDK8/19 and low nanomolar activity against promoter and STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> reporter assays and are as potent as cortistatin A, as well as exhibiting very high selectivity in broad kinome profiling. As described by Pelish and colleagues for cortistatin A, we found similar induction of super-enhancer-regulated genes with our compounds, although note that in our case we profiled gene expression in tumours treated in vivo rather than in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to cortistatin A our compounds were also tolerated in mice and likewise we also found AMLs to be highly sensitive in vivo models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>). However, in our study we also evaluated our two series in dedicated tolerability studies in rat and dog that revealed toxicity not apparent in mouse studies. The detailed toxicity profile of cortistatin A was not reported by Pelish and colleagues, but given the similarities in the results from in vitro and in vivo studies between cortistatin A and our two series we predict that cortistatin A and other CDK8/19 inhibitors would exhibit similar toxicity.</p><p>It remains to be seen if toxicity could be avoided if CDK8/19 inhibitors were administered intermittently as part of a combination therapy. For example, CDK8/19 inhibitors might modulate antitumor immunotherapy by inactivating STAT1 and stimulating tumor surveillance by NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Putz et al., 2013</xref>). It is also unclear if toxicity could be avoided by selectively targeting CDK8 or CDK19 alone. During the optimisation of both the 3,4,5-trisubstituted pyridine and 3-methyl-1<italic>H</italic>-pyrazolo[3,4-<italic>b</italic>]pyridine series, we were unable to separate CDK8 from CDK19 affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mallinger et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Czodrowski et al., 2016</xref>). This is also true for two additional distinct chemical series that we identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schiemann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mallinger et al., 2016b</xref>), and also for a further three chemotypes we profiled from the literature, all of which demonstrated balanced CDK8 and CDK19 affinity in our hands. Similarly, the natural product cortistatin A cannot selectively distinguish between CDK8 and 19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>). The inability to selectively target CDK8 or CDK19 is likely due to the very high degree of sequence similarity around the active site of these two kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), suggesting that strategies to selectively target either of these paralogs will require a different approach, such as allosteric modulation or selective degradation.</p><p>The recent identification of selective inhibitors of the transcriptional kinases CDK7 or CDK12/13 has fuelled interest in the clinical development of inhibitors of these targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwiatkowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chipumuro et al., 2014</xref>). This is of relevance here as inhibition of these kinases has also been reported to affect super-enhancer-associated gene expression in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, MYCN-driven tumours, small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer models where anti-tumour activity is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwiatkowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chipumuro et al., 2014</xref>). In adult CDK7 conditional knockout mice, effects were seen in tissues with a high cell turnover that were at least in part due to a depleted stem cell population resulting from a loss of CDK1 and CDK2 activation or reduced super-enhancer-associated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganuza et al., 2012</xref>). Super-enhancers are frequently found associated with genes whose products control the pluripotent state or define cell identity and this may make stem cell populations particularly vulnerable to therapeutic interventions that interfere with super-enhancer associated gene expression, including inhibitors of the transcription-regulating CDKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>). In an in vivo mouse model of an oncogenically-activated stem cell compartment we found our CDK8/19 inhibitors altered the proportion of stem cells to proliferative TA cells that may in part be due to super-enhancer activation. This raises the hypothetical possibility that, similar to AML cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pelish et al., 2015</xref>), the stem cell compartment requires a precise ‘dosage’ of super-enhancer activity and that activation or inhibition of super-enhancer activity will negatively impact the stem cell compartment. The selective CDK7 tool inhibitors are reported to be tolerated in mice and so predicted to be non-toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kwiatkowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chipumuro et al., 2014</xref>); however, our CDK8/19 inhibitors were also tolerated in mice and the toxicity was not revealed until detailed tolerability studies were performed in other species. Thus the true toxicity profile of other transcriptional CDK inhibitors may not be revealed until dedicated tolerability studies are performed using selective compounds with optimised pharmaceutical properties.</p><p>In summary, we have discovered and made available two chemically distinct series of potent selective chemical probes and appropriate inactive control compounds that can be used to further explore the function of Mediator-associated kinases CDK8/19 and their role in human disease both in vitro and in vivo. These compounds will also be of particular value for exploring the regulation of super-enhancer activity in development and disease. However, on the basis of the complex toxicological profile and an inability to define a clear therapeutic window, we have decided against the further clinical development of our compounds and suggest caution when considering the clinical applicability of other CDK8/19 inhibitors. We also advise incorporating the profiling CDK8/19 as anti-targets in drug discovery and chemical probe projects aimed at other kinases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Compounds</title><p>Compounds were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mallinger et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Czodrowski et al., 2016</xref>) or resynthesised by published routes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Biochemical assays</title><p>In vitro binding of compounds to CDK8 was determined using FRET-based Lanthascreen binding competition with a dye-labeled ATP competitive tracer assay.

An extraordinary amount of work has gone into these studies which appear to have been performed in a rigorous fashion. The conclusions are well supported by the data provided. Normally a study of this magnitude could only afford to be performed in a pharmaceutical company who would then not publish the work, especially the toxicology findings. I see the impact of this work being 1) clear therapeutic- implications for efforts to target Cdk8/19, 2) release of valuable chemical probes, 3) demonstration of the context-dependent effects of Cdk8/19 inhibition (most studies would just look at one context and then conclude target does x).</p><p>On the negative side, this manuscript is a dense read and does come across as a data-dump of sorts but I don't see an easy way to prune given the enormous volume of data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Clarke et al. describe the &quot;de-validation&quot; of CDK8/19 as suitable targets in both solid and liquid tumor indications. A great deal of interest in targeting super-enhancers in oncology has emerged from the work of Young, Gray, Shair, and others including Clarke et al. The natural product corticostatin A which targets CDK8/19 highly selectively was shown by Shair (Nature, 2015) to activate super enhancer gene sets which include tumor suppressive genes. The Clarke et al. team previously (Nature Chem. Bio., 2015) came across CDK8/19 as the relevant target in a hit from a Wnt-cell based screen. Thus, having identified a new chemical series for inhibition of CDK8/19, they asked whether using a panel of different structurally distinct CDK8/19 inhibitors could be employed to further test CDK8/19 as a target in oncology. In short, through careful pathway readouts (Stat phosphorylation) and cell killing assays in tumor cell lines as well as patient derived xenografts, they show that inhibition of CDK8/19 and by extension, activation of mediator, has complex effects in multiple organ systems, bone and immune cells in both ex vivo and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings. The most sensitive cancer cell type appears to be AML, which is consistent with the previously described CDK8/19 inhibitor corticostatin, suggesting that the compounds which are claimed to be CDK8/19 inhibitors provide the same biological effects. Even in AML, there appears to be little or no therapeutic window, which is relevant since this would likely be the most attractive clinical indication.</p><p>I think this is an unusual paper for <italic>eLife</italic>, as there is little new biologically here, per se. However, in the broader context of contributing to our understanding of complex biology of mediator kinases and the potential for therapeutic benefit, I think it does warrant publication in a high profile/general interest journal. As I cited above, many of the papers in this area in the last two years have appeared in similar general interest journals, highlighting the impact this manuscript could have. One always wonders if the authors of such a paper have an &quot;axe&quot; to grind in some way. However, since these authors previously were pursuing this same target class independently, I think they were not initially hoping to invalidate the targets. As the community recently saw with MTH1 &quot;inhibitors&quot; reported by two groups in Nature and then followed up by high quality on target molecules invalidating MTH1, with better tool compounds, it is critical to publish results from testing of second/third generation tool compounds as these clarify the real outcome if such agents would be put in the clinic.</p><p>I support publication, but suggest the authors comment more specifically on how readers should judge the likelihood of other transcriptional regulatory kinases such as CDK7, CDK12, and CDK13 having a suitable therapeutic index in cancer. Also, the authors should comment on the corticostatin work as this is very directly comparable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20722.047</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Both reviewers and the editors found your manuscript to be important.

We do not anticipate that the revised manuscript will require re-review before acceptance.</italic> </p><p>We have revised and shortened the impact statement as requested, from:</p><p>“Two structurally distinct potent and selective chemical probes for CDK8/19 did not show a clear therapeutic window between exposures required for biomarker inhibition and antitumor activity in experimental tumor models and those causing major pleiotropic toxicity; this complex toxicological profile, associated with on-target inhibition, suggests caution when considering the clinical development of ATP-competitive inhibitors of CDK8/19.’</p><p>Now revised to:</p><p>“Detailed molecular profiling investigations and tolerability studies in animals suggest caution when considering the clinical development of inhibitors of CDK8 and CDK19, since a clear therapeutic window could not be demonstrated with two structurally distinct, potent and selective compounds”.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]I support publication, but suggest the authors comment more specifically on how readers should judge the likelihood of other transcriptional regulatory kinases such as CDK7, CDK12, and CDK13 having a suitable therapeutic index in cancer.</italic> </p><p>We are responding to this comment first of all by summarising what we feel are the pertinent published findings and then by summarising the implications and the short paragraph we have inserted into the text. In their Nature paper, Pelish and colleagues (Pelish et al. 2015. Nature 526:273-276) noted that AML cell growth was sensitive to cortistatin A and also a BRD4 inhibitor, I-BET151, that had opposing effects on super-enhancer associated gene expression. They suggested that AML cells are dependent on a ‘precise dosage’ of super-enhancer associated gene expression for survival. Importantly, even though the two compounds have opposing effects, combined treatment showed that I-BET151 had a dominant effect over cortistatin A. This was consistent with super-enhancer genes being highly expressed, but restrained by the mediator complex from even higher expression.</p><p>Consistent with the dependence of tumor cells on super-enhancer activity are observations with the recently discovered CDK7-selective inhibitors THZ1 and THZ2. These compounds preferentially decrease expression of super-enhancer associated genes in neuroblastoma and small cell lung cancer (Chipumuro et al. 2014. Cell 159:1126-1139; Christensen et al. 2014. Cancer Cell 26:909-922). A further study in triple-negative breast cancer found a unique dependence on CDK7 for survival that was mediated through an ‘Achilles cluster’ of super-enhancer associated genes (Wang et al. 2015. Cell 163:174-186).</p><p>Mouse knockout studies of CDK7 and <italic>MAT1</italic>, a co-factor required for CDK7 activity, have shown that loss of CDK7 activity is embryonically lethal (Rossi et al. 2001. EMBO J. 20:2844-2856; Ganuza et al. 2012 EMBO J. 31:2498-2510). CDK7 was indispensable for embryonic cell proliferation. In adult mice, elimination of CDK7 had phenotypic consequences in those tissues with elevated cell turnover. This resulted in an age-related phenotype with depletion of stem cell pools, telomere shortening and early death.</p><p>The recently described THZ531, a covalent inhibitor of CDK12/13, is reported to repress transcription factor and super-enhancer associated gene expression more than expression associated with regular enhancers (Zhang et al. 2016. Nature Chem. Biol. 12:876-884). CDK12 knockout is also embryonically lethal in mice and linked to reduced gene expression of regulators of pluripotency and DNA damage response (Juan et al. 2016. Cell Death Diff. 23:1038–1048).</p><p>Overall, inhibitors of the transcriptional kinases CDK7, CDK12 and CDK13 are predicted to have antitumor activity either in the case of CDK7 from exploiting the dependences of certain oncogenic drivers on elevated super-enhancer activity or for CDK12/13 through effects on super-enhancers or regulation of genome instability. Super-enhancers are frequently found associated with genes whose products control the pluripotent state or define cell identity. Therefore targeting transcriptional CDKs such as 7, 12 and 13 may deplete the stem cell compartment, as detected in conditional CDK7 knockouts in adult mice described above. In an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of an oncogenically activated stem cell compartment signalling we report that our CDK8/19 inhibitors altered the proportion of stem cells to proliferative TA cells in the hyperplastic crypt that may in part be due to super-enhancer activation. This raises the hypothetical possibility that similar to AML cells, the stem cell compartment requires a precise ‘dosage’ of super-enhancer activity and that activation or inhibition of super-enhancer activity will have a negative impact on the stem cell compartment. The selective CDK7 tool inhibitors are reported to be tolerated in mice and so are predicted to be non-toxic; however, as we reported, our CDK8/19 inhibitors were also tolerated in mice and the toxicity was not revealed until detailed tolerability studies were performed in higher species. This suggests that the true toxicity profile of inhibitors of the other transcriptional CDKs may not be revealed until dedicated tolerability studies are performed in higher species using selective compounds with optimised pharmaceutical properties. We have added a short paragraph to the Discussion to cover these points (eighth paragraph).</p><p><italic>Also, the authors should comment on the corticostatin work as this is very directly comparable.</italic> </p><p>Pelish and colleagues (Pelish et al. 2015. Nature 526:273-276) found AML cells were particularly sensitive to cortistatin A treatment and demonstrated corresponding CDK8/19 inhibition with STAT1<sup>SER727</sup>, a target engagement biomarker for CDK8/19 inhibition. They also demonstrated that Cortistatin A inhibited the CDK8 kinase module, but did not inhibit other transcriptional CDKs and did not bind to ROCK1 or 2, the other described targets for cortistatin A, in MOLM-4 AML cell lysates. In addition they showed that Cortistatin A was orally bioavailable, well tolerated in mice and efficacious against AML solid tumor xenograft or systemic disease models. The authors concluded that ‘The specificity, potency, favorable pharmacokinetics and long residence time of CA make it a useful <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> probe of Mediator kinases and a promising lead for development of therapeutics.’ In our paper we employed two different and chemically distinct series of potent and selective CDK8/19 modulators s that are much less challenging to synthesise compared to cortistatin A. These compounds had optimal pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties with single digit nM affinities for CDK8/19 and low nanomolar activity in promoter and STAT1<sup>SER727</sup> reporter assays and are as potent as cortistatin A. As described by Pelish and colleagues for cortistatin A, we found similar induction of super-enhancer-regulated genes, although we carried out gene expression profiling of xenograft tumors treated <italic>in vivo</italic> rather than <italic>in vitro</italic> culture. Our compounds were similarly tolerated in mice and we also independently found AML to be a highly sensitive tumor type for our compounds. However, in our study we also tested our two series in dedicated tolerability studies in higher species that revealed toxicity not apparent in mouse studies. Given the similarities in the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies between cortistatin A and our own two series, we predict that cortistatin A will exhibit similar toxicity.</p><p>We already refer to cortistatin A at various points in the Discussion; however, in response to reviewer 2 we have modified the text to further address the comparison between our compounds and that described for cortistatin A and to indicate that Cortistatin A is likely to share similar tolerability problems (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
