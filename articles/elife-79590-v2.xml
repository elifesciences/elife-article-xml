Existence of functional Notch signaling in enucleate platelets remains elusive.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Transcripts/peptides of Notch1 and Delta-like ligand (DLL)–4 were detected in platelets isolated from human blood by RT-qPCR, Western analysis and flow cytometry. Platelet aggregation, granule secretion and platelet-leukocyte interaction were analyzed by lumi-aggregometry and flow cytometry. Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles were documented with Nanoparticle Tracking Analyzer. Platelet thrombus on immobilized collagen was quantified using microfluidics platform. Intracellular calcium was monitored by fluorescence spectrophotometry. Whole blood coagulation was studied by thromboelastography. Ferric chloride-induced mouse mesenteric arteriolar thrombosis was imaged by intravital microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>We demonstrate expression of Notch1, its ligand DLL-4 and their respective transcripts in human platelets. Synthesis and surface translocation of Notch1 and DLL-4 were upregulated by thrombin. DLL-4, in turn, instigated neighbouring platelets to switch to ‘activated’ phenotype through cleavage of Notch receptor and release of its intracellular domain (NICD), which was averted by inhibition of γ-secretase and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). Inhibition of Notch signaling, too, restrained agonist-induced platelet activation, and significantly impaired arterial thrombosis in mice. Strikingly, prevention of DLL-4-Notch1 interaction by a blocking antibody abolished platelet aggregation and extracellular vesicle shedding induced by thrombin.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study presents compelling evidence in support of non-canonical juxtacrine Notch signaling within platelet aggregates that synergizes with physiological agonists to generate occlusive intramural thrombi.

Signaling is induced through binding of five independent ligands, Delta-like ligands (DLL)–1, 3, 4 and Jagged (Jag)–1 and –2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>), to four isoforms of cognate Notch receptors, Notch1 to Notch4, on surface of adjacent cells. Binding incites sequential α- and ϒ-secretase-mediated proteolytic events releasing the intracellular domain of Notch receptor (NICD) that initiates downstream effects of Notch activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maillard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanpain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qiao and Wong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Platelets are circulating blood cells having central role in hemostasis and pathological thrombus formation that can lead to serious vaso-occlusive pathologies like myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Despite lack of genomic DNA platelets intriguingly express several transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spinelli et al., 2010</xref>) and developmental morphogens like Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kumari and Dash, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Steele et al., 2009</xref>) and Sonic Hedgehog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kumari et al., 2014</xref>), whose non-canonical non-genomic roles in platelet biology and thrombogenesis remain poorly characterized. Notch signaling has been linked to differentiation of megakaryocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sugimoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mercher et al., 2008</xref>), the platelet precursor cells in bone marrow, though there also have been reports to the contrary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dorsch et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poirault-Chassac et al., 2010</xref>). Here, for the first time, we demonstrate abundant expression of Notch1 and DLL-4, as well as their respective transcripts in human platelets. When platelets were challenged with thrombin, a potent physiological agonist, synthesis and surface translocation of Notch1 and DLL-4 were significantly augmented. Interestingly, DLL-4, in turn, instigated activation of human platelets, as evidenced from binding of PAC-1 and fibrinogen to surface integrins α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>, P-selectin externalization, release of adenine nucleotides, shedding of extracellular vesicles (EVs), amplified tyrosine phosphoproteome and rise in intracellular calcium, associated with generation of NICD. In parallel DLL-4 significantly enhanced phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. Attenuation of γ-secretase significantly abrogated platelet activation responses triggered either by DLL-4 or thrombin. Inhibition of γ-secretase, too, significantly impaired arterial thrombosis in mice and platelet thrombus generation ex vivo. Furthermore, preclusion of DLL-4-Notch1 interaction by pre-incubation with a blocking antibody prohibited thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation and shedding of EVs, which underscores a critical role of Notch signaling in inducing human platelet activation in synergism with physiological agonists in a juxtacrine manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used, and their suffering. Mice (species: <italic>Mus musculus</italic>; strain: Swiss albino; sex: male and female; age: 4-5 weeks old; weight: 8-10 g each) were anaesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine cocktail (100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine).

Interestingly, pre-treatment of platelets with either DAPT (10 μM) or DBZ (10 µM), specific γ-secretase inhibitors, for 10 min led to significant drop in DLL-4-induced PEVs release (by 45.55% and 41.98%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), thus underscoring critical role of γ-secretase activity.</p><p>Platelet activation is associated with phosphorylation of multiple cytosolic proteins on tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Golden et al., 1990</xref>).

Above observations are indicative of DLL-4-γ-secretase axis-induced flux in tyrosine phosphoproteome in human platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Thrombin-stimulated platelets were employed in the study as positive control.</p><p>Roles of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and protein kinase C (PKC) in platelet activation have been widely reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirsch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Polanowska-Grabowska and Gear, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkinson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Watson and Hambleton, 1989</xref>). In order to implicate these kinases in DLL-4-mediated integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> activation, platelets were pre-treated with either LY-294002 (80 µM) or Ro-31–8425 (20 µM), inhibitors of PI3K and PKC, respectively, or vehicle for 10 min at RT, followed by incubation with DLL-4 (15 µg/ml) for 10 min. Strikingly, both the inhibitors triggered significant drop in DLL-4-induced PAC1 binding to platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), which underscored the roles of PI3K and PKC in DLL-4-induced conformational changes in integrins α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>. Consistent with activation of PI3K, phosphorylation of its p85 regulatory subunit was significantly augmented (by 3.85-fold) in presence of DLL-4 (15 µg/ml, 10 min), which, too, provoked significant upregulation (by 2.35-fold) in phosphorylation of AKT, the enzyme downstream of PI3K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, J-M). The phosphorylations of PI3K as well as AKT were significantly attenuated by 30.05% and 36.67%, respectively, upon pre-treatment with DAPT (10 µM for 10 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, J-M).

Interestingly, there was significant upregulation in platelet aggregation, PAC-1 binding and P-selectin externalization when cells were challenged with thrombin (0.1 U/ml) in presence of DLL-4 compared to samples exposed to thrombin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, A-F). These parameters were considerably attenuated (by 50%, 30.34%, and 23.05%, respectively) upon prior exposure to DAPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, A-F). As Notch signaling is propagated through direct cell-cell contact in juxtracrine manner, it is tempting to speculate that cellular proximity achieved within densely packed thrombus milieu would permit interactions between DLL-4 and Notch1 on surfaces of adjacent platelets that would synergize with physiological agonists in realizing thrombus consolidation.</p><p>In order to implicate juxtracrine Notch signaling in amplification of platelet activity, we forestalled possible interaction between DLL-4 and Notch1 on adjacent cell surfaces by employing a rabbit polyclonal anti-DLL-4 antibody (20 µg/ml for 5 min) that would block DLL-4. In control samples a non-specific rabbit IgG (20 µg/ml) substituted the antibody against DLL-4. Remarkably, presence of anti-DLL-4 antibody significantly impaired (by 81.95 %) platelet aggregation induced by thrombin (0.1 U/ml) compared with rabbit IgG-treated counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, G and H).

However, expression of Notch receptors and its functionality in human platelets has remained unexplored. Notch signaling is mediated through four isoforms of mammalian Notch receptors, namely Notch1 to Notch4, which interact with five independent Notch ligands, DLL-1,–3, –4 and Jag-1 and –2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kopan and Ilagan, 2009</xref>). In this report we have demonstrated that, enucleate platelets have notable expression of Notch1 and its ligand DLL-4, which function in a non-canonical manner to synergize with physiological platelet agonists, leading to generation of prothrombotic phenotype. Although platelets have limited protein-synthesizing ability, exposure to thrombin instigated significant translation of DLL-4 and Notch1 in puromycin-sensitive manner, thus adding them to the growing repertoire of platelet translatome. Strikingly, thrombin, too, provoked translocation of these peptides to platelet surface membrane, raising possibility of juxtacrine DLL-4-Notch1 interaction within the confinement of platelet aggregates. DLL-4 stimulated significant rise in expression of NICD, the cleavage product of Notch, in a γ-secretase-dependent manner, that signifies the existence of functional DLL-4-Notch1-NICD signaling axis in platelets. This is not out of place here to mention that γ-secretase, too, is responsible for cleavage of amyloid-precursor proteins (APP) releasing amyloid-β (Aβ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tarassishin et al., 2004</xref>). Platelets, which contribute to 95% of circulating APP in body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bush et al., 1990</xref>), are known to generate Aβ<sub>40</sub> upon stimulation with physiological agonists like thrombin or collagen in a PKC-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Smith and Broze, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Skovronsky et al., 2001</xref>), leading to rise in local concentration of Aβ within the thrombus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Skovronsky et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Smith, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Platelets are central players in hemostasis and pathological thrombosis that can lead to occlusive cardiovascular pathologies like myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Upon activation platelet surface integrins α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> switch to an open conformation, which allows high-affinity binding of fibrinogen and cell-cell aggregate formation, surface mobilization of P-selectin and rise in intracellular free calcium. In our quest to explore the non-genomic role of Notch pathway in platelet biology, we discovered that DLL-4 and not DLL-1 was able to instigate significant binding of PAC-1 (that recognizes the open conformation of α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>) and fibrinogen to platelets, associated with exocytosis of contents of alpha and dense granules, which was consistent with switch to a ‘pro-active / pro-thrombotic’ phenotype. DLL-4, too, provoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx leading to substantial rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, extracellular vesicle shedding, platelet-leukocyteaggregate formation and increase in platelet tyrosine phosphoproteome, all hallmarks of stimulated platelets. Notably, inhibition of γ-secretase employing two pharmacologically different compounds significantly impaired DLL-4-mediated ‘pro-activating’ effects on platelets. Inhibitors of either PI3K or protein kinase C evoked remarkable decrease in PAC1 binding, which underlines contributions of these enzymes in DLL-4-induced integrin activation. The phosphorylations of PI3K and AKT (downstream of PI3K) in platelets were significantly boosted in presence of DLL-4, which were attenuated upon pre-treatment with DAPT. In sum, above findings are strongly suggestive of non-canonical signaling triggered by DLL-4 in human platelets that operates in γ-secretase-PI3K-AKT-dependent manner leading to platelet activation.</p><p>Thrombin is a potent physiological agonist that induces platelet aggregation and secretion through cognate PAR receptors. As thrombin amplifies expression of DLL-4 on platelet surface and DLL-4, in turn, induces platelet activation signaling, we asked whether DLL-4 synergizes with thrombin in stimulation of platelets. Pre-treatment of cells with DLL-4 followed by low dose (0.1 U/ml) thrombin significantly upregulated platelet aggregation, PAC-1 binding and P-selectin exposure elicited by thrombin alone, which underlines a potentiating effect by DLL-4. These responses were considerably abrogated by inhibitor of γ-secretase that further authenticates contribution of Notch signaling in platelet activation. Platelet aggregation induced by diverse agonists including thrombin, collagen and TRAP was also restrained by inhibiting γ-secretase activity. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase significantly impaired thrombus formation in a murine model of mesenteric arteriolar thrombosis and platelet thrombus generation ex vivo. As our laboratory and others have demonstrated Aβ to be a potent stimulus for platelets with thrombogenic attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sonkar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canobbio et al., 2014</xref>), pharmacologic inhibition of γ-secretase in platelets would prohibit release of both NICD and Aβ that may be envisaged as an effective multimodal anti-thrombotic strategy leading to thrombus destabilization. Kaolin-activated thromboelastography, too, validated delayed formation of thrombus that was significantly less stable compared with control counterpart having optimal γ-secretase activity. Taken together, above observations underscored seminal contribution from DLL-4-Notch1-γ-secretase axis in amplification of agonist-mediated platelet responses and determination of thrombus stability.</p><p>As direct cell-cell contact is the mainstay of Notch signaling, it is reasonable to speculate interactions between DLL-4 and Notch1 on surfaces of adjacent platelets, which are closely approximated within the densely packed thrombus milieu. In order to validate it, we blocked proximity between DLL-4 and Notch1 by pre-incubating platelets with a rabbit polyclonal anti-DLL-4 antibody, followed by stimulation with thrombin. In control samples, a non-specific rabbit IgG substituted the antibody against DLL-4. Remarkably, presence of blocking antibody significantly impaired platelet aggregation evoked by thrombin compared with the rabbit IgG-treated counterparts. The extent of drop in aggregation directly correlated with concentration of the blocking antibody. In keeping with it, shedding of extracellular vesicles from aggregated platelets was also potentially inhibited when cells were pre-incubated with anti-DLL-4 antibody, and not with rabbit IgG. Above observations were overwhelmingly supportive of juxtracrine Notch signaling operating within the tightly packed platelet aggregate/thrombus milieu that potentiates platelet stimulation by physiological agonists.</p><p>In conclusion, we provide compelling evidence in favour of a PI3K /AKT-dependent non-canonical Notch signaling pathway operative in enucleate platelets that contributes significantly to the stability of occlusive arterial thrombus as well as to platelet activation instigated by thrombin through juxtacrine interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We demonstrate that inhibitors of γ-secretase, which downregulate Notch signaling in platelets, could be effective anti-platelet agents. Besides, antibody against DLL-4 may be employed therapeutically to forestall DLL-4-Notch1 interaction on surfaces of adjacent platelets as a potential anti-thrombotic approach.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Scheme depicting the role of Notch signaling in potentiating agonist-induced platelet stimulation.</title><p>Juxtacrine interaction between DLL-4 and Notch1 expressed on surfaces of agonist-stimulated platelets that remain in close proximity within platelet aggregates, leading to potentiation of thrombin signaling and consolidation of thrombus.

This manuscript by Chaurasia et al., describes a novel signaling pathway involving Notch1 and its ligand, Δ-like ligand-4 (DLL4) in driving platelet activation and thrombus formation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Each of the three reviewers commented on the experimental approach being rigorous, data clearly presented, and claims/conclusions well supported by the data. The reviewers have provided some suggestions to help improve upon some aspects of the paper. Detailed comments are included below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a new signaling pathway of platelet activation. The manuscript may be considered for publication following the authors reply to the comments below.</p><p>Authors may consider the following comments:</p><p>1. English editing for whole manuscript.</p><p>2. May fix the conclusion part. Such as relocating the part describing &quot;involvement of γ-secretase in the cleavage of cleavage of amyloid-precursor proteins (APP) releasing amyloid-β (Aβ), etc.&quot; to other part of the discussion. May focus on describing the involvement of DLL-4-Notch1 axis.</p><p>3. In Figure 3I, What are the tyrosine phosphorylated proteins? The name of specific proteins may be mentioned against specific kDa. A clear representative blot may be used.</p><p>4. In Figure 3J, along with pAkt, the pPI3K blot may also be used.</p><p>5. In Figure 4A and G, the percentage aggregation may mentioned in the Y axis. In 4A, only thrombin treatment shows 40% aggregation, where as in Figure 4G, it is 60% aggregation.</p><p>6.

In our report, we have observed 15 µg/ml to be the optimal concentration of DLL-4 to elicit signaling in platelets. The dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for DLL-4 and Notch1 binding ranges from 7.5 µM to 12.7 µM (Luca et al., 2015). Thus, the concentration of DLL-4 employed in our study (~200 nM) is most likely to be physiologically relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The logic flow on how NICD was identified as a substrate for calpeptin is unclear. Did the authors do a series of experiments to narrow down to calpeptin? Can the authors provide justification for this line of reasoning?</p></disp-quote><p>Calpain is a ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent thiol protease that is known to be activated in platelets stored at 37 °C and following stimulation with ionophore A23187 (Wadhawan et al., 2004). Several signaling and structural proteins including FAK (focal adhesion kinase), <italic>Src</italic>, Btk (Bruton’s tyrosine kinase), protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), ABP (actin-binding protein), filamin, talin, myosin (heavy chain) and spectrin are well known substrates of calpain in human platelets (Fox et al., 1985, Fox et al., 1987, Fox et al., 1990, Fox et al., 1991, Mukhopadhyay et al., 2001, Wadhawan et al., 2004). Calpain has been projected as a regulator of platelet outside-in signaling, aggregation and clot retraction (Croce et al., 1999, Schoenwaelder et al., 1997, Kuchay and Chishti, 2007). This prompted us to ask whether NICD is also a substrate of calpain in platelets under storage or upon ionophore A23187-stimulation. Interestingly, we observed remarkable drop in the level of NICD when platelets were either stored at 37 °C ͦbut not at 22 °C ͦor stimulated with ionophore A23187. This decrease was reverted when cells were pre-incubated with calpain inhibitors like calpeptin or ALLN, and calcium chelators like EGTA. These observations add NICD to the repertoire of calpain substrates in human platelets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The TRAP is the PAR1 activation peptide. Since platelets express both PAR1 and PAR4 as thrombin receptors and both are activated by thrombin, the authors should refer to TRAP as PAR1-AP and give some justification for not using PAR4-activation peptide in the experiment design as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for constructive suggestion. Accordingly, we have now referred TRAP as PAR1-activating peptide (PAR1-AP) in our revised manuscript. Platelets are known to express both PAR1 and PAR4 as dual receptor system for thrombin-mediated signaling (Kahn et al., 1999, Coughlin, 2000). However, keeping with varying affinity of receptors towards ligand, PAR1 needs low-dose thrombin for activation of platelets whereas PAR4 requires high thrombin concentration for signal transmission (Duvernay et al., 2017). Hence, TRAP has been employed as an activation peptide for PAR1 as most of the experiments in our study were carried-out with low-dose of thrombin.</p><p>References:</p><p>Coughlin, S. R. 2000.
