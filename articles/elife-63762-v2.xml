cellular functions across all domains of life. In bacteria, lipoproteins have important roles in virulence and are targets for the development of antimicrobials and vaccines. Bacterial lipoproteins are secreted from the cytosol via the Sec pathway and acylated on an N-terminal cysteine residue through the action of three enzymes. In Gram-negative bacteria, the Lol pathway transports lipoproteins to the outer membrane. Here, we demonstrate that the Aat secretion system is a composite system sharing similarity with elements of a type I secretion systems and the Lol pathway. During secretion, the AatD subunit acylates the substrate CexE on a highly conserved N-terminal glycine residue. Mutations disrupting glycine acylation interfere with membrane incorporation and trafficking. Our data reveal CexE as the first member of a new class of glycine-acylated lipoprotein, while Aat represents a new secretion system that displays the substrate lipoprotein on the cell surface.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lipoprotein</kwd><kwd>acylation</kwd><kwd>n-palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>protein secretion</kwd><kwd>acyltransferase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DTP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cunningham</surname><given-names>Adam F</given-names></name><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Ian R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>AatD is a novel acyltransferase that mediates N-palmitoylation of glycine, a process not previously described, that results in the secretion of lipoproteins to the bacterial cell surface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein acylation by the covalent attachment of fatty acids occurs for hundreds of proteins in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. This event confers distinct biochemical properties, enabling acylation to regulate intracellular trafficking, subcellular localisation, protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions, and are of obvious importance to cell biology. As a consequence, lipoproteins are key components of bacterial pathogens and have been targeted for antibiotic and vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dev et al., 1985</xref>). In Gram-negative bacteria, lipoproteins are transported across the inner membrane from the cytosol to the periplasm by the Sec pathway. However, in Gram-positive cells, lipoproteins can also be secreted by the TAT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thompson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Widdick et al., 2011</xref>). The signal peptide inserts into the inner membrane and a diacylglycerol is attached by Lgt to the sulphur moiety of the invariant cysteine at the +1 position of the lipoprotein. The signal sequence is then cleaved by Lsp (signal peptidase II) exposing the N-terminal amine group of the cysteine for monoacylation by Lnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gupta et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mizushima, 1984</xref>). The mature triacylated lipoprotein remains embedded in the inner membrane or is localised to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane by the essential Lol pathway. LolCE, in combination with the ATPase LolD, extracts the triacylated lipoprotein from the inner membrane for transport across the periplasm by LolA, where it is then incorporated into the inner leaflet of the outer membrane by LolB. While the majority remain periplasmically located, in recent years, there have been a number of descriptions of surface localised outer membrane lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Konovalova et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanism of translocation across the outer membrane to the cell surface remains poorly understood.</p><p>Previously, we described two outer membrane proteinsÂ (OMPs), CexE and Aap, associated with enterotoxigenic (ETEC) and enteroaggregative <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (EAEC), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crossman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheikh et al., 2002</xref>). CexE has been implicated in prolonged bacterial shedding and increased severity of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivas et al., 2020</xref>), whereas Aap influences biofilm formation and gut colonisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belmont-Monroy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheikh et al., 2002</xref>). Despite Aap and CexE sharing only 18% amino acid identity, both proteins are secreted by the Aat system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belmont-Monroy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivas et al., 2020</xref>). The Aat system requires five proteins (AatPABCD) to facilitate protein secretion, two of which bear resemblance to components of the type I secretion system (T1SS): an OMP and a periplasmic adaptor protein (PAP). In contrast to the T1SS, the CexE and Aap substrate molecules are translocated using a two-step mechanism. First, Aap/CexE is translocated across the inner membrane into the periplasm by the Sec pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pilonieta et al., 2007</xref>). It then enters the Aat system to be secreted across the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belmont-Monroy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivas et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While further characterising the two-step secretion mechanism of the Aat system, we noticed that during secretion, CexE is post-translationally modified by the Aat system and this modification is required for the secretion. Here, we reveal that following cleavage of the Sec-dependent signal sequence, the N-terminus of CexE is modified by the addition of an acyl chain. We demonstrate that AatD is a homolog of the apolipoprotein <italic>N</italic>-acyltransferase (Lnt). We reveal thatÂ AatD is both necessary and sufficient for monoacylation of CexE and Aap. However, in contrast to Lol lipoprotein substrates, CexE lacks an N-terminal cysteine and instead an invariant glycine is the site of acylation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the addition of an N-terminal glycine to the coding sequence of a heterologous protein was sufficient for this novel AatD-catalysed acylation event. We propose that Aap and CexE are members of a novel class of lipoprotein that are secreted through the Aat system, which is a conglomeration of the Lol pathway and a T1SS. We reveal thatÂ AatD is a new acyltransferase with glycine as the target of N-palmitoylation. Consequently, we reveal a new function for acylation-protein secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distribution of the Aat system</title><p>The Aat system was first identified in EAEC, where it corresponds to the molecular probe (CVD432) used to define this <italic>E. coli</italic> pathovar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baudry et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishi et al., 2003</xref>). In order to determine whether the Aat system was more widespread, each of the Aat proteins from ETEC H0407 was used to search the non-redundant protein sequence database using repetitive iterations of the PSI-BLAST algorithm. The full Aat system and an Aap or CexE homolog was identified in 826 separate nucleotide accessions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This revealed that the Aat system is distributed more widely than initially anticipated and is encoded in pathogens with diverse mechanisms of virulence such as ETEC, EAEC, enteropathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic>, Shiga-toxin producing <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic> sp., <italic>Salmonella enterica, Citrobacter rodentium</italic>, <italic>Providencia alcalifaciens</italic>, and <italic>Yersinia entercolitica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crossman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petty et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivas et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To understand the conservation of the Aat system, the organisation of the <italic>aat</italic> operon was examined for each of the 826 genomes identified above. The relative genomic distance between each of the <italic>aat</italic> genes and <italic>aap</italic>/<italic>cexE</italic> was calculated from their boundaries on the nucleotide accession. From this analysis six separate organisations of the <italic>aat</italic> operon were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the most common organisation, <italic>aap</italic>/<italic>cexE</italic> are separated from the <italic>aatPABCD</italic> operon by at least 1 kb. This accounted for just over half of the <italic>aat</italic> systems identified. In just under a quarter of <italic>aat</italic> operons identified, <italic>aap</italic>/<italic>cexE</italic> are within 1 kb of the <italic>aatPABCD</italic> operon either within 400 bp upstream (18.4%) or 1 kb downstream (4.8%). In 25% of the <italic>aat</italic> systems identified, <italic>aatD</italic> was separated from <italic>aatPABC</italic> byÂ &gt;1 kb. The most common of these organisations was <italic>aatD</italic> separated from the other members of the <italic>aat</italic> system and substrate protein (11.9%), closely followed by <italic>aatD</italic> and <italic>aap</italic>/<italic>cexE</italic> together but greater than 1 kb distance from other <italic>aat</italic> genes (9.0%). Finally, in the least common example, <italic>aatD</italic>, <italic>aap</italic>/<italic>cexE,</italic> and <italic>aatPABC</italic> were all separated by greater than 1 kb (4.1%). We did not identify any examples of <italic>aatD</italic> encoded between 39 bp and 1 kb from the stop codon of <italic>aatC</italic>. However, despite these differences, in every example, the <italic>aatPABC</italic> genes formed a single operonic unit located with <italic>aatD</italic> and <italic>aap</italic>/<italic>cexE</italic> on a chromosomal pathogenicity island or a large virulence plasmid. These data suggest that AatPABCD have a role in Aap/CexE secretion.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Organisation of the Aat operon.</title><p>Unique Aat amino acid sequences were detected using PSI-BLAST. These sequences were used to identify the strains that encoded them in the NCBI identical protein groups. As the <italic>aat</italic> genes were present on contigs of whole genome sequencing projects, it was not possible to assess if a strain encoded a gene on the chromosome or plasmid. Instead, contigs were used to identify the complete Aat system. This analysis does not include strains that might encode the <italic>aat</italic> genes or <italic>aap</italic>/<italic>cexE</italic> on a separate genomic element. However, a total of 827 complete Aat systems were identified in the same nucleotide accession. The positions of these genes were used to assess the organisation of the <italic>aat</italic> operon. From this assessment five different classes of <italic>aat</italic> operon organisation were defined.</p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><label>Figure 1âsource data 1.</label><caption><title><italic>aatA</italic> gene positions.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-63762-fig1-data1-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material> </p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig1sdata2"><label>Figure 1âsource data 2.</label><caption><title><italic>aatB</italic> gene positions.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-63762-fig1-data2-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material> </p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig1sdata3"><label>Figure 1âsource data 3.</label><caption><title><italic>aatC</italic> gene positions.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-63762-fig1-data3-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material> </p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig1sdata4"><label>Figure 1âsource data 4.</label><caption><title><italic>aatD</italic> gene positions.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-63762-fig1-data4-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material> </p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig1sdata5"><label>Figure 1âsource data 5.</label><caption><title><italic>aatP</italic> gene positions.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-63762-fig1-data5-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material> </p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig1sdata6"><label>Figure 1âsource data 6.</label><caption><title><italic>aap</italic> or <italic>cexE</italic> gene positions.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-63762-fig1-data6-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material> </p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig1sdata7"><label>Figure 1âsource data 7.</label><caption><title>Calculated distance between genes.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-63762-fig1-data7-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material> </p><p> <supplementary-material id="fig1sdata8"><label>Figure 1âsource data 8.</label><caption><title>Distances and designations.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="plain" mimetype="text" xlink:href="elife-63762-fig1-data8-v2.txt"/></supplementary-material> </p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63762-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Aat-dependent secretion of CexE</title><p>To test whether all of the <italic>aat</italic> genes are required for CexE secretion, we constructed single gene deletion mutants of <italic>cexE</italic> and each <italic>aat</italic> gene in ETEC H10407 pCfaD.

The apparent molecular mass of the two CexE subtypes was determined from the migration of the different protein species on an SDS-PAGE gel relative to the molecular weight ladder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The upper band had an apparent molecular mass of 12.7 kDa (uCexE), while the lower band (mCexE) had an apparent molecular mass of 11.8 kDa, which is consistent with the secreted form of CexE recovered from the supernatant fractions. As CexE is predicted to be exported into the periplasm by the Sec pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pilonieta et al., 2007</xref>), the inefficient cleavage of a signal peptide could be responsible for the difference in the molecular mass of uCexE compared to mCexE. To investigate this, ETEC H10407 pCfaD was grown in the presence of sodium azide. Sodium azide inhibits SecA to prevent translocation of proteins across the inner membrane and subsequent cleavage of the signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huie and Silhavy, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oliver et al., 1990</xref>).

However, in the presence of sodium azide, a protein (preCexE) with an apparent molecular mass of 13.2 kDa was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These observations suggest that the difference in molecular mass between uCexE and mCexE was not due to inefficient cleavage of the signal peptide but was due to a post-translational event mediated by AatD.</p><p>A size change in the CexE homolog Aap has not been reported before despite numerous investigations of the Aat system. To determine whether the migration of Aap was altered by AatD, the effect of an <italic>aatD</italic> deletion on the apparent size of Aap was investigated in EAEC 042. EAEC 042, an <italic>aap</italic> mutant, an <italic>aatD</italic> mutant, and an <italic>aatD</italic> mutant complemented with pJNW were grown in DMEM-highÂ glucoseÂ (HG); the pJNW plasmid encodes the complete <italic>aat</italic> operon from EAEC 042. Whole-cell lysates of each strain were analysed by SDS-PAGE. As noted above for CexE, the deletion of <italic>aatD</italic> in EAEC 042 resulted in an apparent increase in size of Aap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The size change of Aap in the <italic>aatD</italic> mutant could be restored to the wild-type size by complementation with the pJNW plasmid. From these data we conclude that AatD can modify Aap and CexE post-translationally and that this modification is required for secretion of the mature substrate molecule to the extracellular milieu.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Predicted functions of Aat components</title><p>To assist our understanding of the contribution of each Aat component to the secretion of CexE, we constructed hidden MarkovÂ models (HMM) for individual Aat proteins.

In agreement with previous publications, AatA is a homolog of the trimeric OMP TolC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>) and AatB is a PAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>), components associated with T1SS and drug efflux pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishi et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, AatD was not homologous to any T1SS or efflux-associated proteins. Instead, AatD was homologous to apolipoprotein <italic>N</italic>-acyltransferase (Lnt), which is a member of the carbon-nitrogen hydrolase (C-N hydrolase) family (PF00795) required for bacterial lipoprotein acylation and transport via the Lol system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Comparison of the C-N hydrolase domain of AatD with other members of PF00795 revealed that AatD forms a clade with Lnt suggesting that they are functionally related. The ATPase domain of AatC is part of a clade containing the ATPase domains of LolD, the ATPase subunit of the LolCDE lipoprotein transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, AatP is more closely related to LolC and LolE than typical ABC transporters of the T1SS, such as HlyB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The homology of AatP, AatC, and AatD to proteins of the Lol pathway suggests that the Aat system is a composite system of a T1SS and the Lol lipoprotein trafficking system.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic analysis of AatD, AatP, and AatC.</title><p>Sequences were aligned using Clustal omega and the tree was calculated using RAxML.

To test this hypothesis, we used 17-ODYA, an 18-carbon alkyne fatty acid that can be conjugated to an azide linked fluorescent molecule by a copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction to investigate CexE lipidation.

This allowed theÂ production of a C-terminally His-tagged variant of CexE. Both strains harbouring pACYC-<italic>cexE</italic>-6His were grown in the presence or absence of 17-ODYA. The bacterial lipoprotein YraP was included as a positive control. CexE and YraP were isolated from each culture by virtue of their C-terminal 6xHis-tag by using nickel affinity chromatography. The purified proteins were then linked to an azide derivative of Alexa Fluor 488 using a CuAAC reaction. After the CuAAC reaction, the CexE and YraP samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and fluorescence was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In the presence of AatD and 17-ODYA, CexE was fluorescently labelled; in the absence of either 17-ODYA or AatD, no fluorescence was observed. Moreover, only mCexE was labelled indicating that uCexE is an unacylated form of CexE; counterintuitively, the acylated form (mCexE) migrates faster on SDS-PAGE than the unacylated uCexE. Furthermore, only the acylated versions of Aap and CexE were present in the culture supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

These sequences were aligned and a WebLogo was produced for the regions flanking each of the catalytic residues; the four residues were 100% conserved in all AatD sequences identified.

Such acylation events confer distinct biochemical properties on the proteins, enabling acylation to regulate intracellular trafficking, subcellular localisation, and molecular interactions. The current dogma for Gram-negative bacterial lipoproteins purports that proteins are triacylated on an N-terminal cysteine through the action of three enzymes Lgt, Lsp, and Lnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grabowicz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakayama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">ZÃ¼ckert, 2014</xref>). While N-palmitoylation of the amino acid glycine does occur in Bacteroidetes, there is no evidence that this acylated glycine is incorporated into a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lynch et al., 2017</xref>). Although N-terminal glycine acylation by <italic>N</italic>-myristoyltransferase is present in life, it is restricted to eukaryotes. N-myristoylation is one of the three major classes of fatty acylation reactions for eukaryotic proteins, which include N-myristoylation of glycine/lysine in proteins such as c-Src or HIV Gag1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Resh, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Veronese et al., 1988</xref>); S-palmitoylation of cysteine in proteins such as Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hancock et al., 1989</xref>); and N-palmitoylation of cysteine in proteins such as Hedgehog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pepinsky et al., 1998</xref>). Examples of bacterial N-myristoylation rely on eukaryotic proteins produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> or the injection of myristoylatable proteins into eukaryotic cells by type III secretion systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duronio et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). While the Î±-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein (GÎ±<sub>s</sub>) has been reported to be N-palmitoylated at a glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kleuss and Krause, 2003</xref>), glycine N-palmitoylation is dependent on an adjacent cysteine residue that is known to be S-palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kleuss and Krause, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Linder et al., 1993</xref>). However, subsequent studies suggested that the detected N-palmitoylation of glycine in GÎ±<sub>s</sub> was due to intermolecular transfer of palmitoyl from the S-palmitoylated cysteine to the N-terminal glycine during proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ji et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, no enzyme was identified as responsible for GÎ±<sub>s</sub> N-palmitoylation. Thus, N-palmitoylation of glycine appears to be a rare or under-described event and to our knowledge this is the first report of enzyme-mediated N-palmitoylation of a protein at a glycine residue. The recent publication by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belmont-Monroy et al., 2020</xref> identified AatD as an acyltransferase of Aap and CexE responsible for N-palmitoylation of a glycine residue. However, this study failed to recognise this modification as the first confirmed example of enzyme-mediated N-palmitoylation of a glycine or to demonstrate that the position and conservation of the N-terminal amino acids were crucial to acylation. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate the dependence of CexE secretion on the Sec apparatus that the secreted protein was acylated and that the catalytic triad of the C-N hydrolases is required for AatD-mediated acylation of CexE. Combined with our independently derived results, these data confirm CexE and Aap as the first members of a new class of N-terminally glycine-acylated bacterial lipoproteins.</p><p>Since AatD requires the same catalytic residues as Lnt, the two enzymes likely share a similar mechanism of action, albeit with a different substrate protein. Lnt is most efficient at using phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in vitro but is capable of using the other major phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hillmann et al., 2011</xref>). Although not directly tested in this work, based on similarities with Lnt, PE is likely the major source of palmitoyl for N-palmitoylation of CexE. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belmont-Monroy et al., 2020</xref> suggested that PE is the major source of lipid due to an increase of PE in the <italic>aar</italic> mutant compared to the wildÂ type. However, this seems counterintuitive as the deletion of <italic>aar</italic> results in an increase in <italic>aggR</italic> expression, which subsequently results in increased AatD production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santiago et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yasir et al., 2019</xref>); Aar is a negative regulator of <italic>aggR</italic> expression in EAEC 042 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santiago et al., 2014</xref>). If AatD uses PE as a substrate, an increase in the amount of AatD would be expected to lead to a decrease in PE and an increase in lyso-PE, whereas these researchers found aÂ &gt;10-fold increase in PE production and no change in lyso-PE levels in an aar mutant. How lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saha et al., 1996</xref>) is drastically disrupted in such a mutant is intriguing and suggests potential further roles for Aar in phospholipid regulation.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belmont-Monroy et al., 2020</xref> suggested that Lnt is able to acylate Aap. However, in our hands there was no evidence of CexE acylation in the absence of AatD. Given that Aap and CexE lack the traditional lipobox of bacterial lipoproteins that would be recognised by the Lol system, that the signal sequence of all Aap and CexE peptides was predicted to be cleaved by signal peptidase I, which has been confirmed experimentally for CexE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pilonieta et al., 2007</xref>), that we were able to reconstruct specific AatD-mediated acylation in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3), which does not naturally encode AatD or CexE but does encode Lnt, and that modification of CexE could not be detected even when CexE was overexpressed in an AatD-negative Lnt-positive background, we do not believe that Lnt plays a role in CexE acylation. Indeed, our demonstration of acylation of a heterologous protein with a single glycine residue suggests that AatD is a specific <italic>N</italic>-acyltransferase and that it has the potential for exploitation for production of novel acylated peptides in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>The Aat system is, to our knowledge, the only secretion system that acylates and secretes a lipoprotein substrate to the cell surface. While surface exposed lipoproteins have been reported for <italic>E.Â coli,</italic> forÂ example, Lpp, RcsF, and SslE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Konovalova et al., 2014</xref>), these lipoproteins are acylated by Lgt and Lnt on an N-terminal cysteine in the typical manner and translocated to the outer membrane by the Lol pathway. Similarly, <italic>Neisseria</italic> spp. decorate their cell surfaces with secreted lipoproteins that are acylated by Lgt and Lnt on an N-terminal cysteine and trafficked to the outer membrane by the Lol system. In the latter case, an OMP termedÂ Slam is required for translocation of the protein to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hooda et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, the Aat system encodes a novel and specialised <italic>N</italic>-acyltransferase, AatD. To allow secretion of the novel lipoprotein CexE, the Aat system has combined proteins of the T1SS and the Lol trafficking pathway. Not only does the Aat system secrete a novel class of lipoproteins from the periplasm to the surface of the cell but also it acylates that protein itself. For this reason, we believe that reclassification of the Aat system as the first example of the lipoprotein secretion system (LSS) is warranted. We propose that the LSS would remain as a sub-class of the T1SS to emphasise its similarities to the T1SS.</p><p>The Aat system is not unique in secreting a periplasmic substrate. Other T1SS employ a two-step secretion mechanism. One such example is the MacAB-TolC complex which secretes heat-stable enterotoxin from the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamanaka et al., 2008</xref>). We identified MacA and MacB as homologs of AatB and AatPC, respectively, suggesting that AatPC may use a similar mechanism of mechanotransmission as MacB to secrete Aap/CexE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crow et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, AatB may form a similar gating ring to MacA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fitzpatrick et al., 2017</xref>). However, how the Aat system is able to combine the mechanism of the MacAB-TolC T1SS and the LolCDE lipoprotein trafficking pathway to specifically mediate translocation of a lipoprotein to the cell surface has yet to be elucidated.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, based on our observations, we propose our model for Aat-mediated protein secretion. First, the Sec machinery secretes preCexE into the periplasm, resulting in cleavage of the signal peptide by signal peptidase I to form uCexE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pilonieta et al., 2007</xref>). Once in the periplasm, the N-terminal glycine of uCexE is acylated by AatD to create mCexE. Through this acylation event mCexE then associates with the inner membrane. We believe this to be first step for secretion by the Aat system since CexE acylation by AatD is independent of the other members of the Aat system. In addition, the deletion of any of the <italic>aatPABC</italic> genes does not result in a loss of CexE acylation. We propose that the acylation of CexE is required to enter the AatPABC tunnel. Due to the homology to LolCDE, we believe that mCexE is extracted from the inner membrane by AatPC. Finally, AatA, AatB, and AatPC form a channel for mCexE secretion in a manner analogous to a typical T1SS. Subsequently, mCexE inserts into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. mCexE remains surface exposed or is further secreted into the extracellular milieu in a soluble form or as a component of outer membrane vesicles, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roy et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematic of proposed Aat system mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PreCexE produced in the cytoplasm is secreted into the periplasm by the Sec pathway (Sec).

The conservation of this system within pathogenic bacterial strains represents a possible new drug target. Previous studies have shown that deletion of <italic>aatD</italic>, <italic>aatC</italic>, or <italic>aap</italic>/<italic>cexE</italic> reduces bacterial colonisation and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belmont-Monroy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rivas et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, chemicals targeting the Aat system have the potential to prevent or perhaps reduce the severity of bacterial disease. As the Aat system does not appear to be present in non-pathogenic strains, this would be an ideal target to prevent off-target effects. As only pathogenic bacteria would be affected by the inhibition of the Aat system, there would be no risk of evolving resistant alleles in non-pathogenic populations. Furthermore, as the addition of an acyl chain can improve the half-life of peptide drugs like insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurtzhals, 2007</xref>), the ability to acylate heterologous proteins with a simple glycine addition is a valuable new tool for the biotechnology enabling new acylated peptides to be produced in <italic>E. coli</italic>. In conclusion, we have identified a novel <italic>N</italic>-acyltransferase. In addition, we have characterised a novel class of bacterial lipoproteins that are acylated and secreted by a composite secretion system. There are still significant questions left to be answered on the mechanism of Aat secretion as well as the function of the secreted proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>H10407</td><td>Evans and Evans (1973)</td><td/><td>Prototypical ETEC strain</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>042</td><td>Evans and Evans (1973)</td><td/><td>Prototypical EAEC strain</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>DH5Î±</td><td>New England Bioscience</td><td>C2987I</td><td>Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21(DE3)</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>EC0114</td><td>Protein production strain</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pKD46</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Datsenko and Wanner, 2000</xref></td><td/><td>Plasmid encoding Î» Red recombinase genes</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCP20</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Datsenko and Wanner, 2000</xref></td><td/><td>Plasmid encoding Flp recombinase gene</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pET26b</td><td>Novagen</td><td/><td>T7 expression vector with C-terminal 6 His tag</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pACYC184</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang and Cohen, 1978</xref></td><td/><td>Plasmid with p15A origin of replication</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pACYCDuet-1</td><td>Novagen</td><td/><td>Plasmid with p15A origin of replication and two T7 promoters</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-CexE (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-His Tag (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>GenScript</td><td>Cat# A00186, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_914704">AB_914704</ext-link></td><td>WB (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti <italic>E. coli</italic> RNA polymerase beta antibody (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>BioLegend</td><td>Cat# 663903, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2564524">AB_2564524</ext-link></td><td>WB (1:10000)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial cultivation</title><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> contains the bacterial strains used in this study.

Anti-rabbit (IRDye 800CW goat anti-rabbit IgG, Li-Cor) or anti-mouse (IRDye 680LT goat anti-mouse IgG, Li-Cor) secondary antibodies were used to detect primary antibody binding. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1 in 15,000 in 2% BSA and incubated for a minimum of 1 hr at room temperature with agitation. Membranes were washed four times with TBST for 5 min at room temperature with agitation. Secondary antibody fluorescence was detected using the Odessy CLx imaging system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Inhibition of SecA by sodium azide</title><p>Two cultures of ETEC H10407 pCfaD were inoculated from the same overnight culture. The cells were both grown at 37â for 90 min with aeration. WCL samples of each culture were taken. L-arabinose was added to both cultures to a final concentration of 0.2%. Sodium azide was added to a final concentration of 3 mM to one of the cultures. Both cultures were grown for 2 hr at 37â with aeration. WCL samples of each culture were taken and separated by Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. CexE was detected by western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Proteomic analysis</title><p>ETEC H10407 and EAEC 042 were grown in IMDM and DMEMÂ HG, respectively. In initial experiments, CexE and Aap supernatant fractions were harvested with buffer containing Triton X-100 as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheikh et al., 2002</xref>. Subsequently, supernatant proteins from ETEC H10407 pCfaD cultures were isolated using a modification of the protocol described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sheikh et al., 2002</xref> where Triton X-100 was excluded, as it proved to be unnecessary. In brief, cells were separated from the culture supernatant by centrifugation at 8000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4Â°C. The culture supernatant was filtered using Millex-GP Syringe Filter Unit, 0.22 Âµm, polyethersulfone (Merck), then cooled on ice. Ice-cold 100% TCA was added to a final concentration of 20%. Samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatant was removed and discarded from the sample. The pellet was washed twice with 1 ml ice-cold 100% methanol, proteins were collected with centrifugation at 21,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4Â°C between each wash. The supernatant was removed, and residual methanol was evaporated by incubating the sample at 60Â°C for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 50 Âµl Tris-tricine sample buffer. If a colour change to yellow occurred, saturated Tris-base was added until the original colour returned. Samples were analysed by Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE.</p><p>Membranes were extracted from 50 ml of cells grown under the conditions required for CexE production. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideÂ (PMSF). Cells were lysed using EmulsiFlex-C3 (Avestin). Unlysed cells were collected by centrifugation at 5000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4â. The supernatant was separated. The membranes were collected by centrifugation at 50,000 Ã <italic>g</italic> for 60 min at 4â. The resulting membrane pellet was washed twice with ice-cold 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0). The final pellet was resuspended in 100 Âµl 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0). The samples were normalised by protein concentration. The membrane samples were separated by Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>CuAAC</title><p>Overnight cultures harbouring plasmids encoding His-tagged proteins of interest to be labelled were used to inoculate 25 ml LB supplemented with the relevant antibiotics to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05. Cultures were grown for 1.5 hr at 37Â°C. 17-ODYA dissolved in DMSO was added to a final concentration of 20 ÂµM and protein production induced. An equal volume of DMSO was added as a negative control. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 600 Âµl of 50 mM NaP (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mM PMSF. Cells were lysed by sonication for 15 min using the bioruptor on a 30 s on, 30 s off cycles. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was retained. His-tagged proteins were isolated from the supernatant using Dynabeads His-Tag Isolation and Pulldown (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturerâs instructions. Imidazole was removed by dialysis. Protein sample concentrations were measured with Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). A master mix was prepared of 0.2 mM Cy5-azide (Sigma-Aldrich) or Alexa Fluor 488 azide (Invitrogen), 0.2 mM Tris[(1-benzyl-1<italic>H</italic>-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (TBTA), and 2 mM freshly prepared CuSO<sub>4</sub>. This was made to 50 Âµl in H<sub>2</sub>O and 5 Âµl of the master mix was added to 40 Âµl each normalised protein sample. Sodium ascorbate was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. Samples were incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hr with agitation. Protein was precipitated using chloroform-methanol extraction. To each sample, 400 Âµl MeOH, 150 Âµl chloroform, and 300 Âµl H<sub>2</sub>O were added and vortexed for 30 s. Samples were centrifuged at max speed for 2 min. The top layer was removed and 400 Âµl MeOH was added and samples were centrifuged again at max speed for 2 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed twice with 400 Âµl MeOH, then dried. Pellets were resuspended in 20 Âµl 1Ã Tris-tricine sample buffer and separated by Tris-tricine SDS-PAGE. Gels were incubated in fixative (10% acetic acid, 50% methanol) prior to fluorescence detection, then stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Heterologous protein acylation</title><p>ETEC H10407 pCfaD was transformed with pRSF-GGG-mCherry, pRSF-GG-mCherry, pRSF-G-mCherry, or pRSF-SS-mCherry. Cultures were grown as previously described for <italic>cfaD</italic> induction. At the same time as <italic>cfaD</italic> was induced, 17-ODYA was added to a final concentration of 20 ÂµM.

The isolated CexE proteins were separated on a Tris-tricine gel and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. The bands corresponding to uCexE and mCexE were excised and subjected to trypsin-LysC digestion. The tryptic peptide extracts were analysed by nanoHPLC/MS MS/MS on an Eksigent, Ekspert nano LC400 uHPLC (SCIEX, Canada) coupled to a triple TOF 6600 mass spectrometer (SCIEX, Canada) equipped with a PicoView nanoflow (New Objective) ion source; 5 Âµl of each extract was injected onto a 5 mm Ã 300 Î¼m, C18 3 Î¼m trap column (SGE, Australia) for 5 min at 10 Î¼l/min. The trapped tryptic peptide extracts were then washed onto the analytical 75 Î¼m Ã 150 mm ChromXP C18 CL 3 Î¼m column (SCIEX, Canada) at 400 nl/min and a column temperature of 45â. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water and solvent B contained 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Linear gradients of 2â40% solvent B over 60 min at 400 nl/min flow rate, followed by a steeper gradient from 40% to 90% solvent B in 5 min, then 90% solvent B for 5 min, were used for peptide elution. The gradient was then returned to 2% solvent B for equilibration prior to the next sample injection. The ionspray voltage was set to 2600 V, declustering potential 80 V, curtain gas flow 30, nebuliser gas 1 (GS1) 30, interface heater at 150â. The mass spectrometer acquired 50 ms full-scan TOF-MS data followed by up to thirtyÂ 100 ms full-scan product ion data, with a rolling collision energy, in an information-dependant acquisition mode for protein identification and peptide library production. Full-scan TOF-MS data was acquired over the mass range ofÂ 350â1800 and for product ion MS/MS 100â1500. Ions observed in the TOF-MS scan exceeding a threshold of 200 counts and a charge state of +2 to +5 were set to trigger the acquisition of product ion, MS/MS spectra of the resultant 30 most intense ions. The data was acquired and processed using Analyst TF 1.7 software (ABSCIEX, Canada). Protein identification was carried out using Protein Pilot 5.0 for database searching.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the BBSRC DTP scholarship to IRH.

At the same time, there was consensus that a few revisions to the text for clarity and completeness need to be made prior to publication. Reviewer 3, in particular, had some straightforward suggestions that should be easy to incorporate. See comments included below for details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I have nothing to add to my initial review, and my concerns have been more than sufficiently addressed</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Discussion.</p><p>&quot;To our knowledge, this is the first report of enzyme mediated N-palmitoylation of glycine in nature&quot;. Again, even with the glycine qualifier, this statement is not true. First, glycine N-acylation (including palmitoylation) has been described in eukaryotes. In bacteria, N-palmitoylation of glycine has also been defined in Bacteroidetes (and is referenced in the Belmont-Monroy study). This statement doesn't add to the quality, novelty, or relevance of the current work, it should be removed as it is misleading. Changes should be made to &quot;Thus, we describe a new mechanism of N-palmitoylation. We reveal glycine as a new target of N-palmitoylationâ¦&quot;</p><p>To help move the field forward, the authors should make clear how they prepare supernatant fractions of &quot;secreted&quot; mCexE. The method used to generate Figure 2 seems to TCA precipitation of filtered supernatants. The method used to generate Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 adds a long Triton X-100 treatment prior to TCA precipitation. The method used for Figure 7âfigure supplement 2 is not described in any details. Why these methods differ should be explained. L471 describing conditions needs a reference.</p><p>Results.</p><p>&quot;acylation was required for secretion&quot;. The referenced data (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1) does not support this statement since the only variable is the presence/absence of lipid-staining dye. The need for acylation is more directly tested in Figure 7âfigure supplement 2. This statement should be moved.</p><p>Discussion.</p><p>&quot;However, this study [Belmont-Monroy et al., 2020] failed to recognise this modification as a previously uncharacterised N-terminal glycine acylation event&quot;. This statement is false. An example from that publication refuting the statement: &quot;This peptide is only observed in the 042aap(pAap) sample and corresponds to a protein N-terminal palmitoylation. The post-translational modification of Aap is illustrated in Figure 10E [depicting N-palmitoyl glycine Aap]&quot;.

Again, even with the glycine qualifier, this statement is not true. First, glycine N-acylation (including palmitoylation) has been described in eukaryotes. In bacteria, N-palmitoylation of glycine has also been defined in Bacteroidetes (and is referenced in the Belmont-Monroy study). This statement doesn't add to the quality, novelty, or relevance of the current work, it should be removed as it is misleading.

We do acknowledge in the discussion that many proteins are acylated, and many are acylated on glycine. However, we are unable to identify from the literature, or databases dedicated to cataloguing such events, any proteins that are clearly N-palmitoylated on glycine by a specific enzyme. In order to clarify the known literature, and how our work relates to previous observations, we have adjusted the introductory paragraph of the Discussion so it reads:</p><p>âPost-translational modification of proteins by the covalent attachment of fatty acids occurs for a myriad of proteins in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. Such acylation events confer distinct biochemical properties on the proteins, enabling acylation to regulate intracellular trafficking, subcellular localization, and molecular interactions.

The method used to generate Figure 2 seems to TCA precipitation of filtered supernatants. The method used to generate Figure 4âfigure supplement 1 adds a long Triton X-100 treatment prior to TCA precipitation. The method used for Figure 7âfigure supplement 2 is not described in any details. Why these methods differ should be explained.

Our initial experiments used the method previously described by Sheikh et al., where Triton X-100 was used. Subsequent experiments did not use Triton X-100 as we found it was not required. For clarity we have adjusted the description in the methodology. To address this, we have included the following lines:</p><p>âETEC H10407 and EAEC 042 were grown in IMDM and DMEM-HG, respectively. In initial experiments CexE and Aap supernatant fractions were harvested with buffer containing Triton X-100 as previously described by Sheikh et al., 2002. Subsequently, supernatant proteins from ETEC H10407 pCfaD cultures were isolated using a modification of the protocol described by Sheikh et al., 2002 where Triton X-100 was excluded, as it proved to be unnecessary.â</p><p>We also added the following wording.</p><p>Figure 7âfigure supplement 2 legend âSupernatant proteins were isolated by TCA precipitation after removal of cells by centrifugation and filtration.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results.</p><p>&quot;acylation was required for secretion&quot;. The referenced data (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1) does not support this statement since the only variable is the presence/absence of lipid-staining dye. The need for acylation is more directly tested in Figure 7âfigure supplement 2. This statement should be moved.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for highlighting this oversight and have added the following wording.</p><p>âFurthermore, only the acylated versions of Aap and CexE were present in the culture supernatant (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion.</p><p>&quot;However, this study [Belmont-Monroy et al., 2020] failed to recognise this modification as a previously uncharacterised N-terminal glycine acylation event&quot;.

The post-translational modification of Aap is illustrated in Figure 10E [depicting N-palmitoyl glycine Aap]&quot;.

We have now included the following text:</p><p>âSince AatD requires the same catalytic residues as Lnt the two enzymes likely share a similar mechanism of action, albeit with a different substrate protein. Lnt is most efficient at using PE in vitro but is capable of using the other major phospholipids such as phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid (Hillmann et al., 2011). Although not directly tested in this work, based on similarities with Lnt, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is likely the major source of palmitoyl for N-palmitoylation of CexE. In fact, Belmont-Monroy et al., 2020 suggested that PE is the major source of lipid due to an increase of PE in the aar mutant compared to the wild-type. However, this seems counter intuitive as the deletion of aar results in an increase in aggR expression, which subsequently results in increased AatD production (Santiago et al., 2016); Aar is a negative regulator of aggR expression in EAEC 042 (Morin et al., 2013; Santiago et al., 2016; Yasir et al., 2019). If AatD uses PE as a substrate an increase in the amount of AatD would be expected to lead to a decrease in PE and an increase in lyso-PE, whereas these researchers found a &gt;10 fold increase in PE production and no change in lyso-PE levels in an aar mutant. How lipid homeostasis is drastically disrupted in such a mutant is intriguing and suggests potential further roles for Aar in phospholipid regulation.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concordant findings from separate groups are valuable.

We have addressed this by altering Figure 10 and the legend to include OMVs and rewording the paragraph discussing Figure 10 as follows. We are unsure of the point the referee is trying to make regarding periplasmic proteins and so have not addressed this further.</p><p>âIn Figure10, based on our observations, we propose our model for Aat-mediated protein secretion. First, the Sec machinery secretes preCexE into the periplasm, resulting in cleavage of the signal peptide by Signal Peptidase I to form uCexE(Pilonieta et al., 2007). Once in the periplasm the N-terminal glycine of uCexE is acylated by AatD to create mCexE. Through this acylation event mCexE then associates with the inner membrane. We believe this to be first step for secretion by the Aat system since CexE acylation by AatD is independent of the other members of the Aat system. In addition, the deletion of any of the aatPABC genes does not result in a loss of CexE acylation. We propose that the acylation of CexE is required to enter the AatPABC tunnel. Due to the homology to LolCDE, we believe that mCexE is extracted from the inner membrane by AatPC. Finally, AatA, AatB and AatPC form a channel for mCexE secretion in a manner analogous to a typical T1SS. Subsequently, mCexE inserts into the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. mCexE remains surface exposed or is further secreted into the extracellular milieu in a soluble form or as a component of outer membrane vesicles, as previously described (Roy et al., 2011).â</p></body></sub-article></article>
