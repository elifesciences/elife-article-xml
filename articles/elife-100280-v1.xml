Although less well studied, selection history, which reflects multiple facets of experience with recent events, is increasingly recognized as a distinct source of attentional bias. To examine how selection history impacts saccadic choices, we trained two macaque monkeys to perform an urgent version of an oddball search task in which a red target appeared among three green distracters or vice versa. By imposing urgency, performance could be tracked continuously as it transitioned from uninformed guesses to informed choices as a function of processing time. This, in turn, permitted assessment of attentional control as manifest in motor biases, processing speed, and asymptotic accuracy. Here, we found that the probability of making a correct choice was strongly modulated by the histories of preceding target locations and target colors. Crucially, although both effects were gated by success (or reward), their dynamics were clearly distinct: whereas location history promoted a motor bias, color history modulated perceptual sensitivity, and these influences acted independently. Thus, combined selection histories can give rise to enormous swings in visuomotor performance even in simple tasks with highly discriminable stimuli.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>visual attention</kwd><kwd>saccade</kwd><kwd>perceptual decision</kwd><kwd>choice</kwd><kwd>oculomotor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY025172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salinas</surname><given-names>Emilio</given-names></name><name><surname>Stanford</surname><given-names>Terrence R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During visual search, the choice of where to look next is biased to a remarkable degree by the location and color histories of recently viewed target stimuli.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The choice of where to look, which is integral to most daily human activities, reflects dynamic interplay between information sensed from the external environment and internal goals specific to the task at hand. This interaction is likely a key contributor to the variability in choice and associated outcome that typifies real-world behavior. But even in a laboratory setting, performance on visuomotor choice tasks varies not only between subjects but also for the same subject across nominally identical sessions and trials. Understanding the drivers of behavioral variance is essential to determining the factors that limit performance and, ultimately, to deducing their neural basis.</p><p>It is a given that attentional state contributes substantially to the conditions that determine success or failure on any given goal-oriented task. Endogenous mechanisms allocate attention volitionally, prioritizing choices according to internal goals, whereas exogenous mechanisms attract attention automatically in proportion to the physical saliencies of external features or events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Itti and Koch, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Theeuwes, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carrasco, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolfe and Horowitz, 2017</xref>). How strongly these mechanisms engage their respective neural substrates and the degree to which these attentional pointers align or conflict contribute to determining if, when, and how any particular choice is made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Busse et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Markowitz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scerra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seideman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oor et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Although exogenous and endogenous attentional mechanisms are potent influences, physical stimulus properties and explicit knowledge of task requirements do not solely determine choice performance in any given instance. It is now generally accepted that current choices are constrained by the recent history of past choices in ways that are neither consistent with task goals nor a straightforward reflection of the physical saliencies of available options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fecteau and Munoz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Awh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Theeuwes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Theeuwes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>). âSelection historyâ is the umbrella term for attention mechanisms that are distinct from stimulus-driven and goal-directed forms in that they comprise a collection of implicit biases shaped by past experience. Potential sources of selection history bias include feature-based priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maljkovic and Nakayama, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McPeek et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">KristjÃ¡nsson and Campana, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brascamp et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">KristjÃ¡nsson and Ãsgeirsson, 2019</xref>), location bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maljkovic and Nakayama, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chelazzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hickey et al., 2014</xref>), and stimulus- or action-reward associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barraclough et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hikosaka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hauser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hermoso-Mendizabal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lak et al., 2020</xref>), among others. Given their heterogeneity, selection history biases are likely to impact the coding of both intrinsic and extrinsic decision variables â and do so on multiple timescales â to drive choice trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Awh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Theeuwes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Theeuwes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although selection history influences are measurable as effects on performance accuracy, reaction time (RT), or both, discerning how multiple sources of variance contribute to determining choice outcome is not straightforward. Just as these implicit biases need not align with goal-directed or stimulus-based drivers of attention, different sources of selection history bias may reinforce or conflict with each other to varying degrees according to their respective history-dependent profiles. Thus, via internal trade-offs, many different combinations of selection history bias could yield very similar behavioral outcomes as measured by accuracy and RT. Moreover, because history-induced biases are not explicitly strategic â they develop even when history offers no predictive value to the current trial â their expression in measures of overt behavior will be attenuated in laboratory tasks that prioritize accuracy and allow sufficient time for choices to be guided predominantly by goal-driven mechanisms.</p><p>The current study uses urgency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stanford and Salinas, 2021</xref>) to isolate and quantify how selection history biases deriving from target feature (color) and target location impact saccadic choices; specifically, the ability to identify and look toward a color singleton (i.e., an âoddballâ stimulus of unique color) presented within an array of uniform distracters on each trial. With the so-called compelled oddball (CO) task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scerra et al., 2019</xref>), the goal was to differentiate sources of history bias based on both inter- and intra-trial temporal dynamics and, having done so, determine the degree to which they act independently or interact in biasing each choice. Urgency is the key, first, for maximizing the measurable impact of bias, and second, for distinguishing the influences of biases that act on stimulus features (e.g., color priming) from those that do not (e.g., location priming). This is possible because, under time pressure, individual choices can be precisely identified via their unique temporal signatures as either uninformed guesses or perceptually informed decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salinas and Stanford, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stanford and Salinas, 2021</xref>), and spatial and perceptual biases are predicted to manifest in very different ways for each. Motor biases based on target location history are expected to be most evident either before or soon after presentation of the stimulus array (which is when guesses are elicited), and to wane thereafter, once perceptual information becomes available. In contrast, biases based on target color history should be completely absent early on and become evident only after some processing of the stimulus feature content has occurred (which is when informed decisions are elicited).</p><p>Here, we identify these distinct sources of bias in the performance of rhesus monkey subjects, thus laying the groundwork for future neurophysiological studies aiming to reveal their neural basis. Our findings demonstrate that spatial and feature-based selection histories exert independent influences on behavior, and that their combined impact can be extraordinarily large even for visuomotor tasks that involve simple rules and highly discriminable stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Accuracy of urgent singleton search depends on perceptual processing time</title><p>Two monkeys performed the CO task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), a singleton search paradigm that, via the imposition of a response time limit, compels subjects to begin preparing a response in advance of making the perceptual judgment that determines the correct choice (Methods). In this task, urgency is incorporated by delivering the signal to make a saccade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, Go) before presenting the target-distracter stimulus array, or color cue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, Cue); this cue is withheld for a variable amount of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, Gap). By design, the task mandates that saccades be initiated within a normal RT range (RT â¤ 450 ms). This, together with the variable Gap interval, yields choices based on a wide range of nominal cue viewing times or processing times (PTs, where PT is calculated by subtracting RT <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mo>â</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>â Gap in each trial).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral task and psychophysical performance from two monkeys.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The compelled oddball (CO) task. Trials begin when the subject fixates on the central gray spot (Fixation). Four gray placeholders then appear (Targets On) separated by 90Â° surrounding the fixation spot (at variable eccentricities and orientations across days). Urgency is incorporated by next extinguishing the fixation spot (Go), which instructs the subject to respond. After a variable time delay (Gap, 0â225 ms), the target and distracter identities are revealed (Cue). A correct choice requires a saccade to the stimulus with a unique color, the oddball stimulus, within 450 ms of the go signal. The reaction time (RT) is measured from the go signal to saccade onset.

Plotted for each Gap, average RTs ranged between 200 and 250 ms for monkey C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, top) and 250 and 300ms for monkey N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, bottom), while mean choice accuracy values changed gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Importantly, the tachometric curve, which plots performance as a function of PT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), shows that choice accuracy rises sharply as the amount of cue viewing time increases. Thus, PT readily distinguishes between choices that are likely to be guided by the color cue (informed) and those that are not (guesses). For PT &lt; 100 ms, the performance of both monkey subjects was at chance (probability correct = 0.25), indicating that such choices were not informed by the color cue. Conversely, for PT <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mo>â³</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> 150 ms for monkey C, and PT <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mo>â³</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> 200 ms for monkey N, most choices were informed, as indicated by performance asymptotes that approached 70% correct. We refer to the performance levels at each of these PT extremes as the floor and ceiling accuracies, respectively (Methods).</p><p>The measured ceiling levels seem unusually low for a visuomotor task in which the response rule is so simple and the stimuli so highly discriminable. Why? Two observations already point to selection histories as responsible for such low numbers. First, the results were unlikely due to insufficient training. This is because, although our subjects practiced the CO task extensively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, caption) throughout several months of data collection, their ceiling accuracies did not improve (the Pearson correlation between experimental session and ceiling performance was 0.2, p=0.1 for monkey C and 0.05, p<italic>=</italic>0.6 for monkey N). And second, urgency itself is also unlikely to be a significant factor limiting the accuracy of the monkeysâ informed choices. This is because other animals from our laboratory reached high ceilings (â¼95% correct) in the urgent CO task when the target color remained fixed or when it switched only between blocks of trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scerra et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these two observations suggest that what makes the CO task particularly difficult is the randomization of the target colors and locations. Indeed, the same conclusion would be reached based on prior studies that used standard nonurgent versions of the oddball task; in that case, monkey performance was also much lower when both color and location were randomized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Song and McPeek, 2015</xref>) than when the target colors alternated between blocks of trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bichot and Schall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bichot and Schall, 2002</xref>) or between days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McPeek and Keller, 2004</xref>).</p><p>As will be shown next, when both the target color and location change unpredictably across trials, performance during oddball search is swayed by selection histories to a remarkable degree.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Perceptual and non-perceptual selection history biases are dissociable on the basis of PT</title><p>The ability to differentiate informed from uninformed choices is the basis for distinguishing the influences of selection history biases that derive from perceptual versus non-perceptual sources. If present, perceptual priming due to target color repetition could, in principle, affect the timing, slope, and/or ceiling of the tachometric curve, each an attribute that reflects the likelihood that a choice is perceptually informed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shankar et al., 2011</xref>). Perceptual priming cannot, however, influence uninformed choices â saccades made at short PTs â before the processing of color information has had any impact. Importantly, these perceptually uninformed choices are precisely those predicted to be most sensitive to non-perceptual biases. In the context of an urgent feature discrimination task, motor plans developing in advance of cue information (i.e., during the Gap interval) might be expected to incorporate spatial biases that reflect the recent history of target locations. If so, the expression of a history-induced location bias would be maximal for guesses and diminish as choices become increasingly guided by perceptual evidence.</p><p>Because the effects of selection history on performance were highly consistent for the two monkeys, in this and the following subsections, these effects are presented and discussed based on the data pooled across subjects. We return to the differences and similarities between the two individuals in more detail in the last section of the Results, once the main phenomena have been characterized.</p><p>The impacts of target color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâd</xref>) and target location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2eâh</xref>) repetition on performance were assessed by post hoc sorting of trials based on their respective histories (Methods). Separate tachometric curves were computed from trials conditioned on the number of preceding trials (1â4) for which either target color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) or target location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) was the same (S) or different (D). For example, the 1S condition includes the color sequences red-<bold>red</bold> and green-<bold>green</bold> (bold type indicates the target color on the trial that contributes to the given tachometric curve), while the 3S condition includes the color sequences red-red-red-<bold>red</bold> and green-green-green-<bold>green</bold>. Likewise, D trials are preceded by <italic>N</italic> trials with a target of the opposing color. The 1D condition, then, includes the color sequences green-<bold>red</bold> and red-<bold>green</bold>, while the 3D condition includes the color sequences green-green-green-<bold>red</bold> and red-red-red-<bold>green</bold>.

Strong selection history effects became evident, as performance depended systematically on the number of preceding trials in which the target color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2aâd</xref>) or the target location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2eâi</xref>) was either the same or different from that in the current trial. But critically, the respective influences of these two history variables on choice behavior were readily distinguishable by their PT dependencies, as anticipated.</p><p>The influence of target color repetition only became apparent at PT &gt; 100 ms, an inflection point that marks the transition from uninformed choices to those increasingly steered by color information. From there, each additional preceding trial of the same target color (1Sâ4S) was associated with a performance increment, as evident in both the slopes and ceiling values of the corresponding tachometric curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, blue curves; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, blue bars). Correspondingly, decreasing slopes and ceiling values depending on the number of preceding trials of a different target color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, red curves; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, red bars) were indicative of history-induced performance decrements. Thus, the trial-by-trial history of target color decreased (same color) or increased (different color) the amount of cue viewing time needed to achieve a given level of accuracy. Importantly, this perceptual bias altered the efficacy with which color information guided the choice, but, as expected, had no measurable effect on uninformed choices, as indicated by uniformity of the floor accuracies across the range of history conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the principal effect of target location repetition was on uninformed choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e and f</xref>), those made at PT &lt; 100 ms, before cue information began to guide behavior. For these perceptually uninformed choices, or guesses, the likelihood of looking toward a given location increased as a function of the number of preceding trials in which the target appeared at that location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, blue curves; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, blue bars) and decreased slightly when preceding targets appeared elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, red curves; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, red bars).</p><p>The PT-based dichotomy between color and location history biases and their respective selection history dependencies (i.e., effect of number of S or D trials) is well summarized by a contrast computed as the difference between two tachometric curves, one conditioned on a given number of S repetitions minus another conditioned on the same number of D repetitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, for color (gold traces), the resulting difference curve reveals a PT-dependent bias that tracks closely with the increasing likelihood of making a correct color discrimination; the bias is near zero for uninformed choices, but its magnitude rises sharply after the inflection point (at PT <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mo>â³</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> 100 ms) that demarcates the transition to increasingly informed choices.

In contrast, when evaluating the effect of a single event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the difference between 1S4x and 1D4x conditions should be generally smaller than that between 1S and 1D, as the reference event becomes more distant from the current choice.</p><p>As anticipated, a single-color event, whether corresponding to a repeat or a switch, had no impact on a future uninformed choice, as indicated by the floors of the tachometric curves obtained for different trial separations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). However, single-color events did impact future informed choices, as indicated by the ceilings of the same curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). The impact of a color repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, S conditions, blue circles) versus a switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, D conditions, brown circles) was fairly symmetric about a mean performance baseline and accounted for a difference of approximately 13 percentage points in the likelihood of making a correct informed choice on the trial immediately following the reference event (1S versus 1D). This color bias decayed within 5 trials or so; it had a demonstrable influence over informed choices for the next 4 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, 1S4x versus 1D4x; note separation between 95% CIs) but largely faded thereafter.

More importantly, the location bias was evident for both uninformed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, floor) and informed choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>, ceiling) and showed greater persistence than the color bias.

When an action aims to achieve a particular objective (e.g., looking toward the color singleton to obtain reward), the result influences subsequent behavioral strategy. But in addition, as we show here, it also has powerful effects on the development of nonstrategic perceptual and motor-based selection history biases.</p><p>The impact of outcome (reward versus no reward) on perception was quite apparent in the way that it modulated the expression of history-induced color bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Tachometric curves conditioned on previous trial repetitions of either the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) or different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>) target color were jointly conditioned on outcome; i.e., different curves were generated depending on whether the color repetitions were associated with correct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, green color spectrum) or incorrect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, magenta color spectrum) choices. The biasing impact of the outcome was large. For example, for tachometric curves in which each choice was preceded by four trials of the same target color, we observed a difference of nearly 50 percentage points in ceiling performance depending on whether the previous same-color trials were correct or incorrect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, light green versus light magenta traces; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, 4SC versus 4SE). Thus, for repeats of the same target color, a history of successful outcomes increased the likelihood of correctly choosing the target, whereas a history of unsuccessful outcomes decreased this likelihood. In other words, the same stimulus sequences led to vastly different performance depending on their association with reward. For repeats of the alternative target color, the effect of outcome on ceiling performance was more subtle but qualitatively consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and g</xref>). In this case, when the different target color was associated with success on previous trials, choosing the current target color was less likely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and g</xref>, green); and vice versa, when the different target color was previously associated with errors, choosing the current target color was comparatively more likely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and g</xref>, magenta).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Perceptual accuracy is strongly modulated by the joint history of target color and trial outcome.</title><p>(<bold>aâd</bold>) Task performance in color repeats.

This is true for repetitions of both the same target color and the same target location. For example, if the color singleton was red on 4 consecutive trials and the subject made an error (i.e., looked to a green distracter) on each of those trials, the results suggest a progressive perceptual devaluation of red stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and c</xref>, magenta). This, in turn, suggests that the attribution of outcome on each trial was to the color of the singleton (e.g., red), not the color of the distracter (e.g., green) that was erroneously targeted by the saccade â an attribution that ignores the role of the motor act in causing the outcome. A similar logic applies to repeated target location. If the target repeatedly appeared in the same location and was missed (i.e., the subject looked elsewhere), the subject was less likely to select the target at that location on the current trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6aâc</xref>, magenta). Again, to the extent that error history biased behavior, the attribution of the unrewarding outcome appears to be tied to the singleton location, not the erroneous motor act.</p><p>A common trend for the influence of outcome on RT was observed for both color and location bias, and for same and different target repetitions within each of these feature dimensions. Specifically, RTs tended to be shorter when preceded by one or more error trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5d, h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6d and h</xref>, magenta) and longer when preceded by correct trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5d, h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6d and h</xref>, green). This effect on RT is consistent with a general association between time and accuracy that, by design, is particularly acute in urgent choice tasks; namely, long RTs typically lead to long PTs and thereby to high accuracy, whereas short RTs typically lead to short PTs and thereby to near-chance performance. In general, however, relatively modest differences in mean RT, like those between SC and DC conditions (green bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5d, h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6d and h</xref>), are difficult to attribute because variations in motor urgency (and thus RT) can be very large even under relatively simple conditions, such as during saccades to lone visual targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hikosaka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hauser et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, in an urgent choice paradigm like the CO task, numerous mechanisms are likely to determine the RT distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shankar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldstein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oor et al., 2023</xref>). As discussed below, while differences in choice accuracy were slight across the two monkey subjects, their differences in mean RT were larger, consistent with the notion that, in general, RTs have more complex variability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Little evidence of interaction between color and location histories</title><p>Up to now, the results indicate that both the history of target colors and the history of target locations produce strong biases on task performance that are heavily gated by the outcomes (success/failure) of the trials within those histories.

If the prediction agrees with the measurement, the natural interpretation is that the two history variables exert independent influences on performance. Conversely, a significant discrepancy is interpreted as evidence of a functional interaction between the two history variables with respect to task performance.</p><p>This is best understood with an example. First, from the data, we calculate the probability of a correct outcome given a combined sequence; say, that the target in the prior trial had a different color <italic>and</italic> the same location.

The values from the experimental data are 0.59 and 0.71, respectively. Then, by assuming a form of functional independence (conditional independence; Methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Salinas and Stanford, 2024</xref>) between the two history variables, color and location, it is possible to use these two values measured separately to predict the probability correct when the two history conditions occur jointly. The predicted probability correct is 0.64 in this case (using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 7</xref> and the fact that the overall probability correct was 0.66). The discrepancy between the two resulting numbers (0.68 versus 0.64) is small, so in a plot of predicted versus measured accuracy, they correspond to a point near the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, top row, point marked 1DS).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Tests of interaction between individual histories.</title><p>Each panel plots the predicted task performance at long processing times (PTs) (ceiling accuracy) based upon independent contributions from two history effects (<italic>y</italic> axis), contrasted with the actual, measured task performance (<italic>x</italic> axis).

To obtain a more complete characterization of the interdependence between color and location histories, the analysis is extended to sequences that go back further in time, up to 4 trials before the trial being evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, <italic>H</italic> = 1 to <italic>H</italic> = 4, from top to bottom row). As the history length increases, more sequence combinations arise, and the contrast between predicted and measured accuracies includes more data points (with the number of trials represented by each point decreasing accordingly). For instance, going back 2 trials into the past, the 4 possible color sequences (SS, SD, DS, DD) can be combined with 4 possible location sequences to yield 16 unique combinations of color and location, so 16 data points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, <italic>H</italic> = 2). But critically, the pattern that emerges is similar for all the history lengths: the data generally lie along the diagonal, with regression slopes close to 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, blue lines and <italic>Î²</italic><sub>2</sub> coefficients). This indicates that, to a first approximation, color and location histories influence ceiling performance independently of each other.</p><p>To validate this analysis method, we applied it to a different pair of history variables, target color, and trial outcome. A strong interaction was expected for this combination of variables based on the earlier results, which showed that the same color history can either increase or decrease the ceiling accuracy depending on the outcome of the past trials considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, green versus magenta). In this case, the effect of a given color history was paired with the effect of a given success history.

For this example, the discrepancy between predicted (0.54) and empirical (0.62) probabilities is larger, and the four data points for the 1-trial histories deviate further from the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, <italic>H</italic> = 1, top row). Now, as longer histories are considered, the pattern that emerges demonstrates a consistent deviation from the diagonal and a shallower slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, blue lines and <italic>Î²</italic><sub>2</sub> coefficients), indicating that the predicted ceiling accuracy typically underestimates the magnitude of the joint history effect: when the empirical accuracy is above the mean (&gt;66% correct along the <italic>x</italic> axis), the prediction is typically too low, and when the empirical accuracy is below the mean (&lt;66% correct along the <italic>x</italic> axis), the prediction is typically too high. Thus, as expected, for color and outcome histories, the results of this independence analysis are consistent with an underlying functional interaction.</p><p>Very similar results were obtained when we considered the combined effect of target location and outcome histories, except that the discrepancies between predicted and measured probabilities were slightly larger than for color and outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>, blue lines and <italic>Î²</italic><sub>2</sub> coefficients). Again, this is consistent with earlier results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and denotes a strong functional interaction, in this case between outcome and target location histories.</p><p>Finally, we considered again the interaction between target color and target location histories, but this time pairing each of them with success history. In this case, the goal was to predict the probability of a correct outcome given the recent history of the three variables. For example, we measured <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="negativethinmathspace"/><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="negativethinmathspace"/><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow class="MJX-TeXAtom-ORD"><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, which is the probability that a choice is correct when, in the preceding trial, the target color was the same, the target location was the same, and the outcome was correct.

For this example, the measured and predicted probabilities were nearly identical (0.892 versus 0.897; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, top row, point marked 1SSC). There were 8 unique sequences going back 1 trial, and most of the corresponding data points fell close to the equality diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, <italic>H</italic> = 1, top row). For longer sequences, the resulting data points spanned a wide range of accuracies (for <italic>H</italic> = 3, going from &lt;20% correct to almost 100% correct), but the alignment was consistent with a slope of 1 in all cases. The data show that color- and location-driven biases exert largely independent effects on ceiling performance, especially once outcome history is taken into consideration.</p><p>In summary, the results from our analyses based on predictability are consistent with the notion that although both color and location histories interact strongly with outcome history, the resulting color- and location-driven biases make approximately independent contributions to performance during informed choices.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Selection history effects are consistent across monkeys</title><p>Considering the diverse sources of history-driven biases that impact performance in the CO task, it would not be surprising if selection history effects were to manifest to widely varying degrees across individual subjects. Interestingly, though, we found that while RTs indeed tended to be somewhat idiosyncratic, variations in choice accuracy across history conditions were highly consistent in both sign and magnitude across the two monkey subjects.</p><p>Data from monkeys C and N were compared side-by-side for the history conditions already discussed in the preceding sections. For choice accuracy, the results recapitulated the trends identified earlier. During uninformed choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>), color history had essentially no impact, whereas saccades were strongly biased toward prior target locations, especially when they were associated with success (or reward). Across subjects, the corresponding modulations of the floor of the tachometric curve were nearly identical. During informed choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>), the effect of location history alone was more subtle than that of color alone, but both dimensions had a remarkably strong impact on performance when prior outcomes were taken into account. Across subjects, the corresponding modulations of the ceiling of the tachometric curve were again similar in this case, except that monkey C was somewhat more sensitive to switches in target color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>; note slightly larger deviations from average in orange points for D color conditions).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Consistency of history effects across individual subjects.</title><p>The data in this figure are analogous to the bar plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, but for each of the two monkeys.

First, as noted earlier, monkey N generally responded more slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). This was visible in the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, note difference between dotted lines) even after having downshifted all the RTs of this subject (by 29 ms; Methods). And second, the magnitudes of the history-driven modulations in RT were considerably larger for monkey N than for monkey C when trial outcome was taken into account (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, histories conditioned on outcome). Interestingly, however, for each type of history condition, the trends in these modulations were not dissimilar: for the D sequences, for instance, the changes across repetitions and between correct and error conditions were qualitatively the same for the two animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, histories conditioned on different color and outcome, and different location and outcome).</p><p>These findings are in line with the notion that RTs are the product of numerous interacting factors, including sensory, cognitive, and motor mechanisms. They also illustrate a key property of the tachometric curve, which is that it is minimally sensitive to variations in urgency or motor preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stanford et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shankar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seideman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stanford and Salinas, 2021</xref>). This is because, when trials are parsed according to PT, the variability in performance due to urgency is drastically curtailed. As a consequence, derived measures of choice accuracy, including the floor and ceiling values, are largely indicative of sensory and cognitive processing but not motor processing. Therefore, it is not surprising to find that the two monkey subjects showed relatively large differences in their sensitivities to history when measured by mean RT, but showed only slight differences when measured by choice accuracy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>When searching for a color oddball, the performance of trained monkeys is excellent as long as the color of the target remains fixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bichot and Schall, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bichot and Schall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McPeek and Keller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scerra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c and d</xref>). Otherwise, when target and distracter colors are randomly swapped across trials, accuracy drops precipitously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Song and McPeek, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Here, we investigated why. As in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Busse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gupta et al., 2024</xref>), a large lapse rate (â¼35% in our case) that could be naively interpreted as stochastic behavior due to internal noise sources turned out to correspond, instead, to the manifestation of short-term biases driven by the recent history of events preceding each choice. In contrast to prior studies, we examined this problem under high urgency, which means that (uninformed) motor plans must be initiated early on. We exploited the temporal resolution afforded by the urgent-choice design to dissociate bias mechanisms that may start acting before the relevant sensory information becomes available from those that must start acting afterward. That is, mechanisms that bias the initial motor selection process versus mechanisms that bias the later perceptual evaluation of sensory features (color) and the subsequent choice. With this approach, we found that the histories associated with target location and target color made large contributions to choice accuracy that (1) were associated with motor and perceptual mechanisms, respectively, (2) had distinct time constants, (3) in both cases depended strongly on the success of past trials, and (4) to a large degree acted independently of each other during perceptually informed trials. Having teased apart these selection history biases, we found that the magnitude of their effect on visuomotor performance could be remarkably large.</p><p>History-driven biases are ubiquitous, but in the context of visuomotor choice tasks, or sensory-guided tasks more generally, they are typically observed when the relevant perceptual information is weak and the choice difficult. When associated with threshold performance in perceptual tasks, such effects are often referred to as âserial dependenciesâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kiyonaga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manassi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cicchini et al., 2024</xref>). Many of these effects are specifically related to sensory representations kept in working memory, such as when a saccade is made to the location of a remembered visual cue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Papadimitriou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Papadimitriou et al., 2017</xref>), or during discrimination tasks in which two stimuli are presented sequentially, one after the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boboeva et al., 2023</xref>). In other cases, the categorization of stimuli requires comparison with respect to an implicit boundary that must be represented internally, and the dependence on past trials is consistent with a boundary representation that is automatically updated as new stimuli are experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ashourian and Loewenstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raviv et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hachen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MendonÃ§a et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sheehan and Serences, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boboeva et al., 2023</xref>). In these types of studies, the data can be generally understood as perception resulting from current sensory evidence being combined with or compared to prior information stored internally, and the observed biases are most obvious when the available sensory evidence is weak and unreliable, so prior information takes precedence. In this framework, history-dependent perceptual biases are the manifestations of involuntary mechanisms for updating the relevant prior information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MendonÃ§a et al., 2020</xref>). Such mechanisms are most useful under natural conditions, when statistical regularities are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kiyonaga et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fritsche et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hermoso-Mendizabal et al., 2020</xref>), but they may be counterproductive during typical laboratory tasks in which trials are uncorrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As in the studies just discussed, the task used here is a simple visuomotor paradigm â and yet, the differences are stark. In those studies, variations in performance were primarily driven by variations in stimulus strength or discriminability, and prior history typically led to relatively small deviations in accuracy of a few percentage points (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MendonÃ§a et al., 2020</xref>). Here, in contrast, the variability in performance was mainly driven by the amount of time available for processing the visual cue, and the magnitude of the history effects was extremely large (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), spanning nearly the full range from 0% to 100% correct for certain conditions. This is even more remarkable given that the task had no short-term memory requirements other than the task rule itself, and that the discriminability of the stimuli was always high â a condition under which the effects discussed in the previous paragraph typically vanish. Clearly, the framework developed for the abovementioned studies, based on the update of task-relevant information held in short-term memory, does not apply in this case.</p><p>Rather, our results are better understood as the confluence of two phenomena that have been described before, and for which the neural underpinnings have been at least partially characterized in monkeys. On one hand, the motor bias we observed is highly consistent with experiments showing that monkeys make much faster and much more accurate saccades to spatial locations that have been recently associated with a large reward than to locations that have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lauwereyns et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ikeda and Hikosaka, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hikosaka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isoda and Hikosaka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hauser et al., 2018</xref>). Such effects are caused by the recent history of reward-driven reinforcement going back a few (1â15) trials and are entirely compatible with the endogenous deployment of attention to a specific location tagged by reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maunsell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hauser et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, although such spatial effects have been obtained under more minimalistic conditions (i.e., during saccades to lone visual targets), all indications are that they correspond closely to the motor biases in the CO task. Interestingly, however, expression of the strong bias that we observed in favor of previously rewarded target locations is likely to depend on the urgent nature of the CO task, because under nonurgent but otherwise comparable conditions, target location repetitions had no discernible effect on accuracy and only a small influence on RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bichot and Schall, 2002</xref>). This contrast suggests that the suspicion mentioned in the Introduction was correct, namely, that the impact of motor biases on <italic>informed</italic> choices is greatly amplified and much more evident when motor activity is already ongoing before the target selection occurs.</p><p>On the other hand, the perceptual bias we observed is highly consistent with color priming, a well-known effect whereby the perceptual processing of a given color in one trial facilitates the processing of the same color in the next trial. Although priming effects are typically reported as differences in RT, the color bias in the CO task is most likely the same as the âpriming of pop-outâ reported in human participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maljkovic and Nakayama, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McPeek et al., 1999</xref>), which is characterized as an attention-focusing mechanism that builds up cumulatively (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2aâd</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), decays within 5â8 trials (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), and is largely involuntary (consistent with permanence in spite of months of practice). As with the motor bias, neurophysiological studies again indicate that the phenomenology is entirely compatible with known attention mechanisms; i.e., the priming results can be explained by short-lived adaptation in the responses of identified neural circuits in visual and oculomotor areas, which convey information about object salience and thereby guide the selection of saccade targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Westerberg and Schall, 2021</xref>). In contrast to the motor bias, the color priming effect seems to be minimally affected by urgency, because its impact on choice accuracy under nonurgent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bichot and Schall, 2002</xref>) was comparable to that found here.</p><p>Two observations suggest that spatial and feature-based selection history effects are highly robust and hence relevant to real-world situations. First, the qualitative similarity just discussed between such effects as found in the CO task and in simpler, nonurgent tasks. And second, the fact that they are not strategic, on average neither helping nor hindering overall performance. Importantly, though, these are just two types of history-driven bias.</p><p>History-based influences on performance take many forms and probably involve a wide diversity of neural mechanisms and circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yashar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Failing and Theeuwes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang and Sisk, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Theeuwes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with this notion, we found little evidence of a functional interaction between the location- and feature-based biases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and d</xref>), in agreement with a prior psychophysical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Di Pace et al., 1997</xref>). Also, although both serial dependencies and color priming are history-driven and perceptual in nature, they likely represent mechanistically distinct phenomena. Indeed, a study that directly compared them found that their effects were uncorrelated and concluded that they are mediated by separate mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galluzzi et al., 2022</xref>). History effects are relevant not only to attention and visuomotor behaviors, as in the present study, but also to other cognitive functions such as working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Papadimitriou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Papadimitriou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boboeva et al., 2023</xref>), value assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Failing and Theeuwes, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Constantinople et al., 2019</xref>), or task switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wylie and Allport, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Monsell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stoet and Snyder, 2007</xref>). Given this, and the remarkable degree to which the performance of our monkey subjects was swayed by history-driven biases, we conclude that the contribution of recent history to behavioral variability is likely much larger than is generally appreciated, particularly under more naturalistic, less constrained conditions during which multiple such effects may be expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kattner et al., 2025</xref>).

After 200 ms, a stimulus array consisting of four gray placeholders spaced 90Â° apart is presented to indicate the locations at which the singleton target and three distracters will appear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, Targets On).

Crucially, the relevant color information is withheld for a period of time ranging from 0 to 225 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, Gap), after which the gray placeholders change color to reveal the location of either a green target among three red distracters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, Cue) or a red target among three green distracters (not shown). Target identities and locations are randomly and independently assigned from trial to trial such that the prior probability of a color repetition is 0.5, and the prior probability of a location repetition is 0.25.

RT was measured from the time of the Go signal to the onset of the saccade (when eye velocity had surpassed 50Â°/s).

Tachometric curves were generated by sorting the trials by PT and computing the fraction correct for all trials within each PT bin, with bins (50 ms width) shifting every 1 ms. The tachometric curves of both subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) show that performance varies from chance (probability correct = 0.25) to asymptotic with increasing PT. For PT &lt; 100 ms, behavior is at chance, and such trials are deemed âuninformedâ. For PT &gt; 150 ms, performance rises rapidly to reflect the increasing likelihood that the choice is guided by color information, and these choices are considered âinformedâ.</p><p>Separate tachometric curves were generated for each history sequence, and for each resulting curve, two key parameters were calculated: the percent correct for uniformed choices (or floor accuracy) and the percent correct for informed choices (or ceiling accuracy). The calculation of these quantities was independent of the bin size used to depict the tachometric curves: the floor simply corresponded to the percent correct for all history-conditioned trials with PT &lt; 100 ms, whereas the ceiling corresponded to the percent correct for all history-conditioned trials with PT &gt; 150 ms. For both quantities, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using binomial statistics, specifically, the Agresti-Coull method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agresti and Coull, 1998</xref>).

Entirely analogous procedures were used to determine the time courses corresponding to same or different target locations, which also involved sequences labeled 1S, 1S1x, 1S2x, 1S3x, and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>, blue data), and 1D, 1D1x, 1D2x, 1D3x, and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>, brown data).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The primary contribution of the paper is to add a twist in which the target information is revealed after, rather than before, the cue to make a foveating eye movement. This twist results in a kind of countermanding of an earlier &quot;uninformed&quot; saccade plan by a new one occurring right after the visual information is provided. As with countermanding tasks in general, time now plays a key factor in success in this task, and it is time that allows the authors to quantitatively assess the parametric influences of things like previous target location, previous target identity, and previous correctness rate on choice performance. The results are logical and consistent with the prior literature, but the authors also highlight novelties in the interpretation of prior-trial effects that they argue are enabled by the use of their paradigm.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Careful analysis of a multitude of variables influencing behavior</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Results appear largely confirmatory</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed the previous comments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100280.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Oor</surname><given-names>Emily E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Wake Forest University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Winston- Salem</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Salinas</surname><given-names>Emilio</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Wake Forest University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Winston-Salem</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stanford</surname><given-names>Terrence R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Wake Forest University School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Winston-Salem</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Oor et al. report the potentially independent effects of the spatial and feature-based selection history on visuomotor choices. They outline compelling evidence, tracking the dynamic history effects based on their clever experimental design (urgent version of the search task). Their finding broadens the framework to identify variables contributing to choice behavior and their neural correlates in future studies.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In their urgent search task, the variable processing time of the visual cue leads to a dichotomy in choice performance - uninformed guesses vs. informed choices. Oor et al. did rigorous analyses to find a stronger influence of the location-based selection history on the uninformed guesses and a stronger influence of the feature-based selection history on the informed choices. It is a fundamental finding that contributes to understanding the drivers of behavioral variance. The results are clear.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) In this urgent search task, as the authors stated in line 724, the variability in performance was mainly driven by the amount of time available for processing the visual cue. The authors used processing time (PT) as the proxy for this &quot;time available for processing the visual cue.&quot; But PT itself is already a measure of behavioral variance since it is also determined by the subject's reaction time (i.e., PT = Reaction time (RT) - Gap). In that sense, it seems circular to explain the variability in performance using the variability in PT. I understand the Gap time and PT are correlated (hinted by the RT vs. Gap in Figure 1C), but Gap time seems to be more adequate to use as a proxy for the (imposed) time available for processing the visual cue, which drives the behavioral variance. Can the Gap time better explain some of the results? It would be important to describe how the results are different (or the same) if Gap time was used instead of PT and also discuss why the authors would prefer PT over Gap time (if that's the case).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to Rev 1 for requesting clarification of this important point. As Rev 1 notes, PT is a derived variable, computed for each trial by subtracting the Gap interval from RT (PT=RTâGap). While it is true that Gap and PT are correlated (inversely), it is precisely because of the variance in RT that Gap alone is not an adequate (or certainly not the best) predictor of choice outcome. First, note that, if the Gap were fixed, there would still be variance in RT and in outcome, and any dependence of outcome on time would be explained necessarily by the PT. This is true at any Gap. So, clearly, the PT predicts outcome in a way that the Gap cannot. It is easy to see why: the Gap is the part of the RT interval during which no cue information is present, whereas the PT is the part of the same interval during which it is. Therefore, if one accepts the logical premise that the likelihood of a correct choice depends on the amount of time available to view the Cue before making that choice (i.e., the definition of PT), it follows that the relationship between PT and performance should be tighter than that between performance and Gap. And, indeed, this is the case. Mean accuracy declines systematically as a function of Gap, as expected, but its correlation with performance is much weaker than for PT.</p><p>Rev 1âs request for a comparison of how accuracy varies as function of PT versus how it varies with Gap has appeared in earlier publications (Stanford et al., 2010; Shankar et al., 2011; Salinas et al., 2014) and we now include it here for the current dataset by adding plots of accuracy versus Gap as a new panel in Fig. 1 (Fig. 1c). That PT (not Gap) better predicts the likelihood of success on a given trial is evident in comparing the tachometric (Fig. 1b) and psychometric curves (Fig. 1c). The tachometric curves vary from chance to asymptotic performance and do so over a short range of PT (~75 ms) with well-defined inflection points identifying key transitions in performance (e.g., from guesses to increasingly informed choices). In contrast, the psychometric function plotting average accuracy versus Gap (Fig. 1c) varies much more gradually, a reduction in temporal definition attributable to the failure to account for the RTâs contribution to determining PT for each trial at a given Gap.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors provide a compelling account of how the urgent search task affords</p><p>(i) more pronounced selection history effects on choice and</p><p>(ii) dissociating the spatial and feature-based history effects by comparing their different effects on the tachometric curves. However, the authors didn't discuss the limits of their task design enough. It is a contrived task (one of the &quot;laboratory tasks&quot;), but the behavioral variability in this simple task is certainly remarkable. Yet, is there any conclusion we should avoid from this study? For instance, can we generalize the finding in more natural settings and say, the spatial selection history influences the choice under time pressure? I wonder whether the task is simple yet general enough to make such a conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>As Rev. 1 notes, the CO task is a laboratory task that produces large history effects. But importantly, we don't think urgency is causal or essential to the existence of such effects (this is now more explicitly stated in the first section of the Results); it is simply a powerful tool for revealing and characterizing them. As noted in the Discussion, our results are consistent with studies that, based on simpler, non-urgent tasks, demonstrated either reward-driven spatial biases or color priming effects. The CO task uses urgency to generate a psychometric function that time resolves perceptually informed from perceptually uninformed choices, and thereby provides the logical key to disambiguating the simultaneous contributions of perceptual and non-perceptual biases to performance. Such was essential to our demonstration that distinct biases act independently on the same saccade choices.</p><p>In a natural setting, we would certainly expect the respective magnitudes of such non-volitional history-based biases to be highly context dependent, but it would be difficult, if not impossible, to discern their relative impact on natural behavior. That said, we think that the biases revealed by the CO task are exemplary of those that would manifest in natural behaviors depending on the real-world context to which such behaviors correspond. Here, it is important to emphasize that the spatial- and feature-based biases we observed were not strategic, on average neither helping nor hindering overall performance. Thus, in the real-world we might expect the expression of similar biases to be an important source of behavioral variance. These observations are now summarized in the penultimate paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Although the authors aimed to look at both inter- and intra-trial temporal dynamics, I'm not sure if the results reflect the true within-trial dynamics. I expected to learn more about how the spatial selection history bias develops as the Gap period progresses (as the authors mentioned in line 386, the spatial history bias must develop during the Gap interval). Does Figure 3 provide some hints in this within-trial temporal dynamics?</p></disp-quote><p>Because it is based on the location of the saccadic choice(s) on previous trial(s), we might expect a signal of spatial bias to be present before and during the Gap period and perhaps even before a trial begins (i.e., intertrial interval). However, because behavioral bias is a probabilistic measure of saccade tendency, we have no way of knowing if such a signal is present during periods devoid of saccadic choices. Note that, for both monkey subjects, average RT exceeded the duration of the longest Gap employed (Fig. 1), and this means that relatively few saccades occurred prior to Cue onset. That said, it's clear in both Figs. 2, 3, and 6 that location bias is evident for saccades initiated at the transition between Gap and Cue intervals (PT=0). Anecdotally, we can report that that spatial bias is evident when we extend our analysis back further into the range of negative PTs (i.e., Gap interval), but the statistics are weak given the paucity of trials at that point. Nevertheless, this is consistent with a bias that exists from the beginning of the trial, as would be expected based on neurophysiological studies from Hikosaka's lab in a simpler but comparable spatial bias task.</p><p>Although our data do not unequivocally identify the temporal origin of the spatial bias, they clearly show that the bias is present early (at short PTs) and diminishes rapidly as the perceptual information accrues (at long PTs). Thus, the PT-dependent temporal dynamics that are revealed clearly suggest that spatial and perceptual biases operate over different intra-trial time frames, one decreasing and the other increasing. As mentioned by Rev. 1, Fig. 3 emphasizes this dichotomy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The monkeys show significant lapse rates (enough error trials for further analyses). Do the choices in the error trials reflect the history bias? For example, if errors are divided in terms of PTs, do the errors with short PT reflect more pronounced spatial history bias (choosing the previously selected location) compared to the errors with long PT?</p></disp-quote><p>The short answer is âyesâ. Errors generally show a PT-dependent influence of history bias. However, correct and error trials are the result of the same biased dynamics, and analyzing them separately post-hoc does not provide much additional insight about the history effects beyond that provided by the tachometric curves themselves.</p><p>To see this, first consider the figure below (Author response image 1). Two tachometric curves conditioned on color history are shown (left). These are the two extreme curves plotted in Fig. 2a, which correspond to the 4S (i.e., 4 repeats of the current target color) and 4D (4 color repeats and then a switch) conditions. Each of these curves already shows the probability of making an error at each PT but, indeed, we can compare the proportions of correct and error trials at short PTs (guesses) and long PTs (informed choices). These are indicated by the bar graphs on the right. Now, the effect of a bias would be to create a difference in success rate between repetitions (4S, blue) and switches (4D, red) relative to the overall, unbiased expectation (indicated by dotted lines). For color-based history, there is no bias at short PT: the proportions of correct choices are almost exactly at the expected chance level (filled bars coincide with dotted line). In contrast, at long PTs, there is a differential effect, but it is due both to a proportion of correct trials that is higher than expected in the 4S case (filled blue bar above dotted line) and to a proportion of correct trials that is lower than expected in the 4D case (filled orange bar below dotted line). This is exactly as one would expect if the current choice was biased by target color history.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100280-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A similar analysis can be done for location history (Author response image 2, which shows the two extreme curves from Fig. 2e). In this case the bias is much stronger at short PTs, and the difference between repeats (4S, blue) and switches (4D, red) is largely explained by a proportion of correct choices that is much higher than expected by chance in the 4S condition (filled blue bar well above dotted line). This makes sense, because a rewarded location is likely to become the next guess, so if the target happens to appear again at that same location, the subsequent guess is more likely than chance to be correct. At longer PTs, the differential effect is smaller, as would be expected for more informed choices, but it is again driven by the 4S condition. Importantly, in the case of location the total number of S trials is much smaller than the total number of D trials (because a target-location repetition has a probability of 0.25 only), so it only makes sense to compare the proportions of correct (or error) trials, not the absolute numbers, between those conditions.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100280-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In summary, although it is possible to examine the separate dependencies of correct and error trials on history and PT, the distinction is not very useful. Only the frequency of errors relative to that of correct choices makes complete sense, not so much, say, the frequency of short PT errors relative to that of long PT errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a clear and systematic study of trial history influences on the performance of monkeys in a target selection paradigm. The primary contribution of the paper is to add a twist in which the target information is revealed after, rather than before, the cue to make a foveating eye movement. This twist results in a kind of countermanding of an earlier &quot;uninformed&quot; saccade plan by a new one occurring right after the visual information is provided. As with countermanding tasks in general, time now plays a key factor in the success of this task, and it is time that allows the authors to quantitatively assess the parametric influences of things like previous target location, previous target identity, and previous correctness rate on choice performance. The results are logical and consistent with the prior literature, but the authors also highlight novelties in the interpretation of prior-trial effects that they argue are enabled by the use of their paradigm.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Careful analysis of a multitude of variables influencing behavior</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Results appear largely confirmatory.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors provide comprehensive accounts of the urgent search task in multiple places in the manuscript. But the description can be simpler and more consistent throughout. I found it confusing when the authors compared their task with previous search tasks used by Bichot and Schall, McPeek et al. I believe the authors wanted to explain that it is not just the urgency but the fact that the target color being randomly interleaved also contributes to the pronounced history bias in their task. I appreciate their thorough comparison with previous studies but it can be distracting or lose focus. It might read better if this statement can be expanded in the Discussion, not in the Results (lines 366-376).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree that the paragraph in question was ambiguous and appeared to elaborate a Discussion point, which was not our intent. Indeed, as the reviewer noted, the main point was that the randomization of the target colors (and not urgency) is the critical aspect of the task that makes it surprisingly difficult for the monkeys. We have revised the paragraph to emphasize this conclusion and the two empirical results from our own data that support it. The agreement with prior studies, which is somewhat tangential, is now briefly mentioned at the end of the paragraph. It should now be clear that the text mainly describes current data that are relevant to the interpretation of the main results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It's important to state that feature-based selection history bias is not merely due to the monkey's intrinsic bias to one color over the other (red vs green). The authors did a nice job controlling that, as mentioned in Methods (lines 194-196) and supplementary figure (Figure 1 - Figure Supplement 2). It would be helpful for readers to read in Results as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We now mention this in the second section of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) D trial examples for the location history in Results can be confusing to readers (lines 407-409; left-left-right, up-up-left). The examples in Methods (lines 224-229; left-up-right, up-down-left) are better to convey the preceding (different) trials can be of any kind.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed. Both types of example are now mentioned in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I have only minor comments:</p><p>(1) In the abstract, I'm not sure what &quot;when combined&quot; means in the last sentence. What is combined? Selection history and stimulus salience? If so, this is not very clear. Also, it might be nice to end the abstract on how the study addresses the three components of attention that the abstract started with in the first place (salience, task, and history). Otherwise, I spent multiple abstract reads (before even reading the rest of the paper) trying to see whether indeed the paper addresses the three components of attention that were so prominently described at the beginning of the abstract or not. And, I still could not convince myself of whether all three were addressed by the study or not (I then resorted to proceeding with a reading of the rest of the paper).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have reworded the abstract to clarify that we are focusing on selection history, not salience or top-down attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 72: isn't stimulus location still a feature????</p></disp-quote><p>Our nomenclature here is intended to be consistent with the commonly applied distinction between âspatialâ and âfeatureâ -based attention that underscores the distinct mechanistic underpinnings of âwhereâ and âwhatâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Lines 76-79: I'm very confused here. The part about &quot;guesses can be strongly biased toward an arbitrary location early on&quot;. However, I expected the later part of the sentence to still stick to location and mention what the temporal dynamic is. Instead, it discusses perceptual bias, which I presume is the color thing. So, the net result is that I'm a bit confused about how *both* location and color behave in *both* early and late times.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten the end of this paragraph to clarify when and how location and feature biases manifest in behavior. It may be useful to note the following. The tachometric curve describes different types of choices distinguished by their timing, guesses at short PTs vs informed decisions at long PTs. However, this also corresponds to the degree to which perceptual information becomes available over time <italic>within a single trial</italic>. Namely, perceptual information is initially absent but arrives later on. The revised text now reflects this distinction, making the logic for the expected results clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Last paragraph of the introduction (lines 80-82): it would be helpful to justify here why the psychophysics were done in monkeys in this study, instead of humans.</p></disp-quote><p>We now allude to the reason these studies were done in monkeys but feel that more elaboration of this point is better left to Discussion. The Discussion now more explicitly states that the current data are closely related to neurophysiological studies of spatial attention and color priming in monkeys (beginning of 4th paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Line 389: this kind of formulation is much clearer to me than lines 76-79 mentioned above.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted, the above-mentioned section has been revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I'm a bit confused by Figure 4 in the sense that some of the effect sizes are not too different from Figure 2, even when there are some intermediate inconsistent trials. I guess the problem is aggravated by the different axis ranges in Figures 2, and 4.</p></disp-quote><p>All the 1S and 1D data points are the same in both figures, as they should, but the problem is that, otherwise, the two figures are just not comparable. Apples and oranges. To see this, note that the trends for the difference between S and D conditions should go in opposite directions as trials go further into the past, and indeed they do. In Figures 2c, f, the differences between 1S and 1D results are small, and those between 4S and 4D results are the largest because both S and D effects grow away from the average with more repetitions. In contrast, in Figure 4b-d, the differences between S and D shrink as the effect of a single trial becomes more distant (differences are largest between 1S and 1D results, smallest between 1S9x and 1D9x results). The only slightly ambiguous trend is that of Figure 2g, because the S data are more noisy. We have expanded the text surrounding Figure 4 to highlight the different expected trends for this analysis in contrast to that presented in Figure 2. This should clarify the qualitative difference between the two.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- On a related note, it is odd that the summary figures (e.g., Figures. 2, 4, etc) are vertically aligned such that the dependent measure is on the x-axis rather than the y-axis. For example, looking at Figure 2, it would make much more sense if panels b-d and f-h were rotated by 90 deg, such that the vertical axis is indeed the low asymptote or high asymptote or RT. This would directly correlate with the same data in panels a and e in the same figure and would be much easier to follow. Then, later in the paper, Fig. 8 suddenly does the dependent measure on the y-axis, as I said. I think it can help to use similarly consistent plotting approaches across all (or most) analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We tried other formats but settled on the current one because we felt it made it (slightly) easier to compare the patterns across history conditions between any two of the 6 bar graphs in each figure (in Figs 2, 5, 6), in part because it prevents any confusion with the PT axes. As this does not make a substantial difference either way, we prefer to maintain the present arrangement. Additional labels are now included, which should make the figures a bit more friendly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- At the beginning of the paper, I was under the impression that this will really be a free viewing search task (e.g., Wolfe search arrays or old Nakayama search arrays), but then it became clear later that it was still an instructed task, with the only difference being that the target onset is now 4 targets. I think this distinction should be clarified very early on, in order to avoid confusion by the readers. The reason I say this is that with enforced fixation, there are other factors in this task that come into play, like the monkey's individual microsaccade rates etc, which can modulate performance since they also have a form of countermanding that is like the one imposed by the compelled saccade task. So, better alert the readers to the context of the task early on.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We have provided additional detail when introducing the task for the first time in the Introduction, along with a citation to an earlier publication in which the specific task is described. There should be no ambiguity now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor Comments:</bold></p><p>Short Assessment:</p><p>This important study makes compelling use of the monkey animal model to capture the long-time course over which trial history affects decision-making under time pressure, showing decisions are affected by the stimulus sequence extending back as many as four trials previously.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Decision-making is variable, but how much of this variability can be accounted for by the immediate previous history is not well known. Using an &quot;urgent&quot; saccade, Oor et al manipulated how much time monkeys had to process evidence, and evaluated what they did when there was too little time to make an evidence-based decision. They report that the history affected performance as far back as 4 previous trials and that different aspects of the stimulus history (color and location) affected performance differently.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The key strengths of this paper are that the monkey paradigm permitted a study under highly controlled conditions with stable performance across sessions and enough trials to conduct the history analysis farther back in time than is possible with smaller data sets. While the fact that prior history affects decisions was previously known, this study provides a careful quantification of the effect -- which proves to be quite large - as well as an assessment of both location and feature histories in combination with each other. The manuscript is well-written and easy to follow.</p><p>Weaknesses and recommendations for the authors:</p><p>(1) The figures are lovely but could use some more text/design elements to clarify, and there is space to do so. e.g., in Figure 2, there could be titles to indicate that the top row involves the color history and the bottom row involves location history. The information is there, in the y labels of panels B and F, but it takes a while to see that.</p></disp-quote><p>Done. Titles have been added to Figure 2 and several others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Furthermore, the abbreviations 1D, 4S, etc are explained in the legend but it seems there is room to spell them out or include a graphic to indicate what they mean.</p></disp-quote><p>The labels 1D, 4S, etc are difficult to spell out because each one represents multiple conditions; for instance, 2S may correspond to green-green or red-red target colors, and so on. Figure legends have been edited to more clearly indicate that S and D labels correspond to repeat and switch trials, respectively, and that the associated number indicates how far back the history goes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The terms &quot;low asymptote&quot; and &quot;high asymptote&quot; could be indicated in a graphic of a tachymetric function, smoothing the transition to the rightmost panels. (Consider also alternative terms - perhaps &quot;floor&quot; and &quot;ceiling&quot; might be more readily understandable than asymptote to the student reader??).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggested terms, âfloorâ and âceilingâ, which weâve adopted. They are indeed more natural. Figure 2a now indicates that floor and ceiling accuracies correspond to opposite ends of the PT axis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The units for the asymptotes are not indicated - I assume these are &quot;% correct&quot; but that would be helpful to clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. Units for floor and ceiling (and RT) are now indicated in all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 3 - &quot;PT&quot;, and &quot;1S-1D&quot; could be spelled out, and the meaning of the two colored traces could be in the figure itself rather than only in the legend. Similar suggestions apply about labeling, abbreviations apply in subsequent figures.</p></disp-quote><p>PT is now spelled out in all figures other than Figure 1, and labels for the two traces were added to Figure 3.
