propagating many appetite-related cues. Understanding the dynamics controlling appetite requires deeply exploring the cell types and transitory states harbored in this brain site. We generated a multi-species DVC cell atlas using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing, by curating and harmonizing mouse and rat data, which includes &gt;180,000 cells and 123 cell identities at 5 granularities of cellular resolution. We report unique DVC features such as <italic>Kcnj3</italic> expression in Ca<sup>+</sup>-permeable astrocytes as well as new cell populations like neurons co-expressing <italic>Th</italic> and <italic>Cck</italic>, and a leptin receptor-expressing neuron population in the rat area postrema which is marked by expression of the progenitor marker, <italic>Pdgfra</italic>. In summary, our findings demonstrate a high degree of complexity within the DVC and provide a valuable tool for the study of this metabolic center.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dorsal vagal complex</kwd><kwd>Pdgfra</kwd><kwd>Gfral</kwd><kwd>area postrema</kwd><kwd>nucleus of the solitary tract</kwd><kwd>GLP1</kwd><kwd>single nucleus RNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2022-03390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabatini</surname><given-names>Paul V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202010PJT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kokoeva</surname><given-names>Maia V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT180590</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sabatini</surname><given-names>Paul V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01ktx4s83</institution-id><institution>Canada First Research Excellence Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Healthy brains, healthy lives</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murdoch</surname><given-names>Hunter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00w3qhf76</institution-id><institution>Fonds de recherche du QuÃ©bec</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Healthy brains, healthy lives</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murdoch</surname><given-names>Hunter J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dorsal vagal complex is a highly intricate structure composed of distinct transcriptional classes of glial and neuronal cells, exhibiting many similarities but also notable differences between mice and rats.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulating appetite in response to changing environmental conditions to maintain energy balance requires the intricate interplay of multiple organs. Across the central nervous system, multiple discrete brain regions and cell types control appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gautron et al., 2015</xref>). Within the brainstem, the dorsal vagal complex (DVC), comprising the area postrema (AP), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, acts as a key nexus point for metabolic signals, evidenced by the dense expression of many relevant hormone receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ludwig et al., 2021</xref>). Separately, the DVC also serves as the primary site of gut-based signals via vagal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Williams et al., 2016</xref>). Functionally, the DVC was long considered a site promoting meal termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwartz, 2006</xref>), but growing evidence suggests it also controls long-term energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Much of the interest in DVC neuronsâ role in appetite and energy balance stems from their role as therapeutic targets for obesity and anorexia in cancer cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yanovski and Yanovski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borner et al., 2018</xref>). For many years, most pharmacotherapies failed to produce efficacious and long-lasting weight loss in obesity and increase appetite in cancer cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Advani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>). More recently, however, the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R) agonists are eclipsing the weight loss achieved by previous generations of therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">VÃ©niant et al., 2024</xref>). While expressed across the central nervous system, GLP1R expression is particularly enriched in DVC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2018</xref>), and it is the DVC that mediates many of the effects of GLP1R agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2024</xref>). Separately, an emerging strategy for treating cancer cachexia is inhibiting growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) signaling in the DVC by blocking the action of GDNF Family Receptor Alpha Like (GFRAL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Medic et al., 2022</xref>), the receptor for GDF15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Given the clinical significance of the DVC for this spectrum of conditions, understanding the molecular heterogeneity and function of this region is essential.</p><p>Traditionally, identification and ensuing study of DVC cell types was limited to known neurotransmitter and receptor-expressing cell types. For instance, the cholecystokinin and monoamine-expressing cells, demarcated by tyrosine hydroxylase (<italic>Th</italic>) expression, were previously shown to be non-overlapping cell populations with unique roles in appetite suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roman et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, the advent of single-cell mRNA sequencing approaches made unbiased molecular censuses of heterogeneous populations possible. Such studies focusing on the mouse have revealed the complexity of the mouse DVC, comprised of dozens of transcriptionally distinct cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ludwig et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dowsett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Moving forward, unifying information from multiple single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets of the DVC into a reference atlas is needed to more fully understand the cells within the DVC and generate a common and scalable classification for cell identities. Such a reference atlas is also needed to contrast the cell types found within the mouse to other research models, including the rat, which are prominent models for DVC biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ludwig et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fortin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To address this, we generated a comprehensive snRNA-seq-based atlas of the mouse and rat DVC. This atlas features mouse and rat labeled cells with increasing granularity and an accompanying computational toolbox including the mouse and rodent atlas label transfer environment using treeArches. The mouse DVC atlas reveals a higher degree of cellular complexity than previously appreciated. The cellular census of the rat DVC exhibits many similarities to the mouse but also rat-specific cells including a novel population of leptin receptor and <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-expressing neurons localized to the AP. Using this unified atlas, we also uncover the cell types that transcriptionally respond to meal consumption which may hold the potential of suppressing appetite without gastrointestinal side effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The murine DVC cell classes</title><p>To generate a de novo snRNA-seq atlas of the mouse DVC, we isolated the DVC from 30 adult C57BL/6J mice and subjected them to 10X Genomics-based snRNA barcoding and sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Magnaclass 1 neurons predominately express genes required for inhibitory neurotransmission (e.g. <italic>Gad1</italic> and <italic>Gad2</italic>) and share transcriptomic markers with the Sall3-class of neurons, whereas magnaclass 2 neurons express mostly excitatory transcripts (e.g. the glutamate transporter VGLUT2) also found in the Lhx2-class and monoamine class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, as described in other brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vaaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tritsch et al., 2016</xref>), evidence of co-transmission/co-release of multiple primary neurotransmitters was found in at least 55% of neurons regardless of their cell class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). We also identified eight transcriptionally distinct neural classes in addition to the magnaclasses. Among these eight classes, we found two neural classes expressing traditionally non-neuronal genes: the Golli and pH-related classes. The Golli-class neurons are a relatively small cluster, comprising ~1% of all neurons. Interestingly, Golli-class neurons express multiple myelin-associated genes such as <italic>Mag</italic> and <italic>Mog</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Landry et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lutz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheli et al., 2016</xref>) normally expressed by oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Additionally, we identified a class of neurons with genes normally upregulated in astrocytes (e.g. <italic>Slc6a11</italic>) and related to clearance and uptake of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), Ca<sup>+</sup>, and bicarbonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Melone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Theparambil et al., 2020</xref>), which we named âpH-related classâ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Similar to Golli-class neurons, pH-related neurons were a relatively rare cluster (&lt;1% of all neurons). While the corelautus-class neurons express very few genes at higher levels, among them are <italic>Cdk8</italic>, <italic>Lars2</italic>, <italic>Gabra6</italic>, and <italic>Fat2</italic>. Expression of <italic>Cdk8</italic> is largely absent from the DVC but is enriched within the DVC-adjacent hypoglossal nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting these cells are hypoglossal neurons. We also identified the Lhx2-class, which was enriched for the Parvalbumin (<italic>Pvalb</italic>) gene whose expression is largely excluded from the DVC. As <italic>Pvalb</italic> is highly expressed in the neighboring cuneate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), we posit this class may belong to this anatomically adjacent area which was captured in our dissection. When interrogating snRNA-seq data from the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steuernagel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>), another brain site important for energy balance, we could not find clusters sharing all markers with our neuronal classes, indicating DVC-specific neuronal programs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The murine DVC cells at their highest resolution</title><p>To better define the heterogeneity of the mouse DVC, we further assigned a clustering-based third layer of cellular resolution resulting in fifty cell identities, of which 15 are non-neuronal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At this resolution, we differentiated between two major groups of astrocytes. Differential expression in synapse-related factors revealed a group of astrocytes with high expression of the inwardly rectifying GIRK1 (<italic>Kcnj3</italic>) channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kubo et al., 1993</xref>) and lack of expression of the AMPAr subunit GluA2 (<italic>Gria2</italic>), additionally rendering them K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>+</sup>-permeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burnashev et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Geiger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We speculate these astrocytes are specific to the DVC as we could not find <italic>Kcnj3</italic>+; <italic>Gria2</italic>- astrocytes in the hypothalamus, forebrain, cortex, or hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steuernagel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batiuk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jessa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, although some regions close to the DVC such as pons and the spinal cord show some co-expression of <italic>Kcnj3</italic> and <italic>Gfap</italic>, the patterns are not to the same extent as observed in the DVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jessa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we distinguished a spectrum of DVC mature oligodendrocytes, including a group resembling the intermediate oligodendrocytes described in the other brain sites that decrease in number with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marques et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sathyamurthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This gradient of expression of markers including <italic>Fyn</italic>, <italic>Opalin</italic>, and <italic>Anln</italic> in oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), does not respond to a developmental trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Although âmyelinating-intermediateâ and âmyelinatingâ oligodendrocytes include cells with overlapping gene expression programs, there is no evidence that each oligodendrocyte will follow a single trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, to properly separate some cell identities, we performed subclustering in three DVC clusters (i.e. clusters 23, 26, and 27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). This permitted us to label pre-myelinating oligodendrocytes, endothelial and mural cells, and distinguish two fibroblast subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>). One of these subtypes expresses high <italic>Stk39</italic> previously described in fibroblast stress-response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kasai et al., 2022</xref>) and so was termed âs-fibroblastsâ for stress-associated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>), which we failed to detect in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, we excluded the possibility of monocytes in our microglial data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>), which had no evidence of microglial activation as we mapped minimal levels of the activation genes <italic>Cxcl10</italic>, <italic>Cd5</italic>, <italic>Cxcl9</italic>, and <italic>Zbp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DePaula-Silva et al., 2019</xref>) therefore , we posit that our DVC microglial cells are in a basal state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). To further evaluate possible activation states in microglia, we performed subclustering and evaluated their marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

Previous studies detailing DVC cell types describe a high degree of heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ludwig et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dowsett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>); however, these studies lacked an in-depth analysis of neurotransmitter profiles of neurons, any cross-species evaluation of DVC cell types, or an analysis of how meal consumption transcriptionally regulates these cells. We therefore developed de novo mouse and rat DVC cell atlases to address these points.</p><p>To more fully describe the cellular complexity within the DVC, we combined a pipeline of cell label transfer using brain existing published datasets and thorough curation of cell identities, which resulted in a four-layer mouse cell hierarchy and a five-layer rodent cell hierarchy of the DVC. Within this hierarchy, we found several unique features of DVC glial cells. First, we found Ca<sup>+</sup>-permeable astrocytes in the DVC in which <italic>Gfap</italic> is almost exclusively expressed and they co-express <italic>Kcnj3</italic> (GIRK1 potassium channel). These cells largely lack <italic>Gria2</italic>, consistent with findings in Bergmann glial cells in which colocalization of <italic>Gria2</italic> and GFAP was found to alter neuron-glial interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsuzuki and Ishiuchi, 2008</xref>). The heterogeneity of astrocytes across, and even within, spatially distinct CNS sites is becoming increasingly apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Endo et al., 2022</xref>), and our finding of DVC-specific astrocyte transcriptional profiles further supports this. When we compared Ca<sup>+</sup>-permeable DVC astrocytes to hypothalamic astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steuernagel et al., 2022</xref>), we found the same expression pattern with minimal overlap between <italic>Gria2</italic> and <italic>Gfap</italic>. However, DVC astrocytes seem to have some unique properties when compared with hypothalamic, cortical, and hippocampal astrocytes. Principally, DVC astrocytes express the GIRK1 channel, likely rendering them less excitable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">LujÃ¡n, 2010</xref>). As astrocytes have well-established roles in maintaining the bloodâbrain barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabezas et al., 2014</xref>), and the pattern of GFAP in the DVC is largely restricted to the boundary separating the AP and NTS, it is possible these DVC-specific astrocytes have specialized functions in regulating bloodâbrain barrier permeability.</p><p>Additionally, while we identified hypothalamic fibroblasts that express high <italic>Aldh1a1</italic> similar to the DVC p-fibroblasts, we failed to find a group equivalent to s-fibroblasts. Other cell populations seem to be consistent with what has been found in other brain sites, like the intermediate oligodendrocytes that are found enriched in the hypothalamus and the corpus callosum in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marques et al., 2016</xref>). In summary, these findings show that while certain DVC glial cells share identities with glial cells from other CNS sites, there are also DVC-specific glial cells.</p><p>Within the mouse neural classes, we found overlap between <italic>Cck</italic>- and <italic>Th</italic>-expressing cells. As these cells have previously been described as non-overlapping, this was unexpected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roman et al., 2016</xref>). Our in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of <italic>Cck</italic>/<italic>Th</italic> positive cells within the NTS and AP. We believe the discrepancy may be due to detection methods as these cells were initially defined as non-overlapping using immunofluorescent detection of TH protein and a <italic>Cck</italic> genetic reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roman et al., 2016</xref>). Functional studies of <italic>Cck-</italic> and <italic>Th</italic>-expressing neurons within the NTS demonstrate these cells have somewhat distinct roles; while both reduce appetite, <italic>Cck</italic> neurons are strongly aversive whereas <italic>Th</italic>-labeled neurons are non-aversive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 2020a</xref>). While no functional characterization of <italic>Cck</italic> and <italic>Th</italic> neurons of the AP has been performed, we posit that as some <italic>Th</italic>-expressing AP neurons also express <italic>Gfral</italic> and <italic>Casr</italic>; both having potently aversive ligands (e.g. GDF15, deoxynivalenol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patel et al., 2023</xref>); they are likely to mediate aversive anorexia. The role of dual <italic>Cck/Th</italic> positive neurons remains to be determined.</p><p>While AGRP expression has long been considered to be hypothalamic-exclusive, a recent report describes <italic>Agrp</italic>-expressing cells within the mouse DVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bachor et al., 2024</xref>), in part from the detection of Agrp mRNA in scRNA-seq data. Similarly, we also detected transcripts for both <italic>Agrp</italic> and <italic>Hcrt</italic> in our snRNA-seq data but failed to detect any transcripts within the DVC by in situ hybridizations. One possible explanation for the discrepancy between the snRNA-seq data and our in situ hybridizations data is that the snRNA-seq mRNA reads for <italic>Agrp</italic> and <italic>Hcrt</italic> gene overwhelmingly mapped to non-coding regions of the respective genes. Combined, these data suggest to us that neither AGRP nor HCRT neuropeptides are produced by DVC cells in rodents.</p><p>We show the presence of neurons with seemingly mixed programs in the DVC, which we called âmixed neuronsâ. Similar groups have been described in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that some neurons may have hybrid functionalities. These mixed neurons share many transcriptomic markersâ expression with many other cell identities and may require the use of other technologies to fully identify them anatomically in the brain.</p><p>To perform a cross-species analysis, we generated a rat-based DVC atlas and compared it with the mouse DVC. Our rat dataset was smaller than the mouse data; it is possible some of the new neuronal cell identities (e.g. M_sema, M4) may contain cells belonging to multiple cell types, as treeArches did not append these identities to the tree. Despite this, we corroborated two new cell types in the rat DVC that are not present in mice: the <italic>Pdgfa</italic>-expressing (ortus-akin class) and the immunity-related neurons. <italic>Pdgfra</italic> is a well-described marker gene for OPCs and fibroblasts within the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kang et al., 2010</xref>) but, to our knowledge, has not been associated with neurons. Notably, although the PDGFRA immuno-signal in HuC/D+ neurons is clearly discernible, it is less intense than in OPCs and fibroblasts, in agreement with expression levels from our snRNA-seq data. Since it was previously demonstrated that OPCs can give rise to neurons in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Robins et al., 2013</xref>) and there is evidence of neurogenesis in the AP following amylin administration in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liberini et al., 2016a</xref>), it is possible that these PDGFRA+/HuCD+ cells in the AP represent a transient stage of PDGFRA+ OPCs differentiating into neurons.</p><p>Regardless of their maturity, we speculate that the Pdgfra neurons (ortus-akin class) have roles in appetite regulation as they express leptin receptor and <italic>Gfral</italic>. Interestingly, while multiple studies have failed to detect <italic>Lepr</italic> via Cre-based reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wada et al., 2014</xref>) or leptin-induced phosphorylated STAT3 in the AP of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">MÃ¼nzberg et al., 2004</xref>), <italic>Lepr</italic> and leptin-induced phosphorylated STAT3 are detectable within the rat AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liberini et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huo et al., 2007</xref>). We believe one explanation for this species discrepancy in <italic>Lepr</italic> expression is the absence of the ortus class neurons in mice. Future studies are needed to characterize these cells and determine whether their presence is found in other mammals including humans.</p><p>DVC-targeting obesity therapeutics, including amylin and GLP-1 mimetics, produce clinically relevant weight loss but are associated with multiple gastrointestinal adverse events and there is a need to develop new obesity therapies that can reduce appetite without unwanted gastrointestinal side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilding et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, the DVC cells that control appetite suppression and nausea are separable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 2020a</xref>), making targeting such cells an attractive target for pharmacotherapy. As meal consumption is generally not associated with gastrointestinal distress, we sought to identify refeeding responsive cells within the mouse DVC. From this analysis, we found nearly all neural cell identities are transcriptionally altered by meal consumption. We also found the magnitude of transcriptional changes was relatively small, regardless of the cell class examined. While relatively small, the scale of the transcriptional changes in response to refeeding is similar to many of the gene expression changes observed in <italic>Agrp</italic>-neurons following 16 hr food deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steuernagel et al., 2022</xref>). Regardless of whether this is a technical limitation of snRNA-seq methods or accurately reflects the scale of transcriptional changes in the DVC, utilizing transcriptional responses to refeeding to identify neural classes as targets for pharmacotherapy is unlikely to yield specific and targetable pathways.</p><p>In general, one limitation in our study is that it is based on nuclear RNA which may reflect a fraction of biological changes. Using nuclear isolation facilitates generating to have single-neuron data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lake et al., 2016</xref>) since obtaining viable whole neurons (including all their processes) is very challenging. Previous studies on the relationship between nuclear and cellular RNA content in brain show that nuclear sequencing reads may map to intronic regions of genes in higher proportion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lake et al., 2017</xref>). Although this does not appear to impact gene expression analysis for neurons in the current pipelines like the ones we used for our mouse data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lake et al., 2017</xref>), it is possible that some biological features such as microglial activation state are not fully recovered using nuclear RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thrupp et al., 2020</xref>). Although we performed subclustering in the mouse microglia and assessment of the resulting marker genes for each group, we did not find evidence of activation possibly due to this matter. Separately, for meal consumption, we were unable to analyze responses in individual mice as pooling DVCs from individual mice was the most amenable option to maximize nuclei for in our pipeline. As we pooled DVCs from both sexes, this limited our ability to detect sexual dimorphic cell class proportions and gene expression levels.</p><p>As the amount of snRNA-seq data performed on the DVC continues to grow, there is a need for a common, scalable label set that can be applied to new studies and integrate new sequencing data. To develop such a label set, we started with a de novo DVC atlas, we generated three layers of cellular granularity for both neural and non-neuronal cell types. Then, using the treeArches pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Michielsen et al., 2023</xref>), we harmonized our snRNA-seq labels with the Ludwig dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ludwig et al., 2021</xref>) and increased our cellular granularity from three to four layers of resolution. Manually curating and harmonizing our dataset enhanced the ability of our cell atlas to capture the complexity of the DVC neurons since not all groups seem to contain easily delineable subgroups of cells. For example, 11 of the labels incorporated into our cell hierarchy in this pipeline belong to the monoaminergic neuronal class, which seems to encompass multiple subgroups of specialized cells. We further constructed the rodent DVC cell atlas, which resulted in a fifth layer of cell identity to the monoaminergic M3 neurons. Although the number of identities increases as layers are more specific, this gives this unified atlas greater adaptability to different research needs. Additionally, our labels can be accurately harmonized with new databases regardless of size, and new DVC snRNA-seq data can be added to the tree to generate new branches. Thus, our unified rodent DVC atlas is highly amenable to future research elucidating new biologic and therapeutic insights into DVC cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>To generate a snRNA-seq based atlas of the mouse dorsal vagal complex (DVC), we isolated the DVC from 30 adult C57BL/6J mice and subjected them to 10x Genomics-based single-nuclei RNA barcoding and sequencing.

Since this dataset is smaller than the mouse data, we decided to use clusters at a resolution of 2.0 to capture more heterogeneity and delineate better the non-neuronal cell populations.

Microglia and mixed neurons were subclustered as well. The lowest resolution level that allowed for separating populations was used to label the cells. Neurons were also subset, and we mapped the murine neuronal classes markers to resolution 2.0 markers, which were manually curated to delineate better the different populations within them. For all cell identities, and because we only applied one treatment to the rats (i.e. fed ad libitum), we used the FindMarkers function from Seurat v5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hao et al., 2024</xref>) package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">R Development Core Team, 2023</xref>) to obtain gene expression markers of each rat cell population.

Intriguingly, the analysis uncovered previously uncharacterized cell populations, including Kcnj3-expressing astrocytes, neurons co-expressing Th and Cck, and a population of leptin receptor-expressing neurons in the rat area postrema, which also express the progenitor marker Pdgfra. These findings suggest species-specific differences in appetite regulation. This study provides a valuable resource for investigating the intricate cellular landscape of the DVC and its role in metabolic control, with potential implications for refining obesity treatments targeting this hindbrain region.</p><p>In line with previous work published by the PI, the topic is of clear scientific relevance, and the data presented in this manuscript are both novel and compelling. Additionally, the manuscript is well-structured, and the conclusions are robust and supported by the data. Overall, this study significantly enhances our understanding of the DVC and sheds light on key differences between rats and mice.</p><p>I have reviewed the revised manuscript and am pleased to confirm that the authors have addressed my previous comments and concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106217.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hes</surname><given-names>Cecilia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>McGill University Health Centre</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montreal</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tomlinson</surname><given-names>Abigail J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ann Arbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Michielsen</surname><given-names>Lieke</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Leiden</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Murdoch</surname><given-names>Hunter J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal QC, Canada</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montreal</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Soltani</surname><given-names>Fatemeh</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal QC, Canada</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montreal</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kokoeva</surname><given-names>Maia V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>McGill University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montreal</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sabatini</surname><given-names>Paul V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>McGill University Health Centre</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Montreal</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews</p><p>We thank the expert reviewers for their careful consideration of our manuscript and the feedback to help us strengthen our work. Please find a response to each reviewerâs comments below. We have included the original text from the reviewer in unbolded text and our response, immediately below, in bold text for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>(1) Appetite is controlled, not regulated; please reword throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a valid point that we have misused the word âregulateâ in certain instances and âcontrolâ would be more accurate term. We have made adjustments throughout the manuscript.</p><p>(2) One minor point that would further strengthen the data is a more distinct analysis of receptors that are characteristic of the different populations of neuronal and non-neuronal cells; this part could be improved.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion as we had not directly compared metabolicallyrelevant peptides/receptors between the mouse and rat DVC. We have included a list of selected receptors and neuropeptides expression (see Figure S13) for neuronal cells in mouse and rat. We have included this figure as a new supplement. There are some interesting insights from this data, including the relatively broad expression of Lepr in the rat compared with the mouse and the absence of proglucagon expressing neurons within the rat DVC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>(1) In some of the graphs, the label AP/NTS is used, but DVC would be more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reviewed the figures and legends to ensure appropriate use of DVC. We thank the reviewer for bringing this oversight to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 124, p7 - Sprague Dawley RATS</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text to âSprague Dawley ratsâ</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 132, p7 - The phrase &quot;were provided with given access to food&quot; needs grammatical correction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the text was poorly written. The sentence has been corrected to: âWild-type Sprague</p><p>Dawley rats (Charles River) were provided with ad libitum access to food Purina Lab Diet</p><p>1. and water in temperature-controlled (22Â°C) rooms on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with daily health checks.â We have also reviewed the entire manuscript and made additional amendments where necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Page 15 - Mention that GFAP is a marker for astrocytes. Additionally, correct the typo &quot;gfrap&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the misspelling of âGfapâ within the text. We appreciate the reviewerâs comment that there is value in communicating to the nonexpert reader that GFAP is a marker for astrocytes, however, as our data and that from other snRNA-Seq studies show that Gfap mRNA only labels a subset of astrocytes, our preference is to refrain from stating this. Our data suggests the sole use of Gfap as an astrocyte marker will not reflect the true astrocyte population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 432, p15 - What was the rationale for selecting clusters 23, 26, and 27?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to perform subclustering on these clusters because they displayed multiple cell identities when surveyed for the 473 marker genes as described in Methods 2.6.

Fig10S is the integration of samples in treeArches, a necessary step to build the hierarchy in python so the learning algorithm uses only genes that are related to identity and not treatment, we obtained the same overlap of samples when we used R to assign identities. This figure demonstrates our integration was successful because it is only considering genes that are not-treatment related to establish identities, those which are expressed by cells regardless of their response to any treatment. For the meal-related analysis, we were interested in the genes that are changed by treatment, and this is why the analysis differed.

Our discovery of a DVC-specific astrocyte transcriptional profile was underrepresented within the discussion.

As astrocytes have well established roles in maintaining BBB integrity, it is our speculation that this is a major role of these cells.

However, we found several issues with the quality of this data including low UMIs/cell and gene #/cell. For these reasons, we decided against merging these two datasets. So while relatively small, our rat DVC atlas uses high quality data and serves as a valuable starting point.

This is a missed opportunity either to verify the data set or to highlight important limitations if that had been attempted without success.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a highly salient point made by the reviewer. Including Fos expression serves as an internal validation of our refeeding condition and the absence of Fos mRNA levels from the original manuscript was an oversight on our part. As shown in our volcano plot, between ad libitum fed and refed mice, there are two significantly <italic>Fos</italic>-associated genes upregulated in the refed group. Therefore, we are confident that the snRNA-Seq analysis accurately captured rapid changes in response to refeeding in the DVC.

While this may be proper for the DMV, given numerous findings that Gad1/2 are not proper markers for GABAergic neurons and often co-expressed in glutamatergic populations, this confound should have been addressed to make a case if and why they would be proper markers in the DMV.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point. Indeed, there are discrepancies in expression between the Gad1/2 genes and Slc32a1 gene in other data sets. To analyze this within our data set, we examined the mainly GABAergic magnaclass 1 (see <italic>Slc32a1</italic> UMAP plot below). In magnaclass 1, only 5% and 3% of all neurons exclusively express solely <italic>Slc32a1</italic> without either <italic>Gad1</italic> or <italic>Gad2</italic>, respectively. In line with the reviewerâs comment, we found that 54% of neurons express either <italic>Gad1</italic> or <italic>Gad2</italic> but had no detectable <italic>Slc32a1</italic>. While our failure to detect more cells that co-express <italic>Slc32a1</italic> and Gad genes may be partially due to the low expression of <italic>Slc32a1</italic>, it is also very likely that the DVC, like other brain regions, contains neurons that express the Gad enzymes without co-expression of <italic>Slc32a1</italic>.</p><p>This was very much the case with the GLP1 cell cluster, which we identified as the population which had the highest co-expression of excitatory and inhibitory markers. When we refined this analysis to look at expression of excitatory markers with <italic>Slc32a1</italic> (and not other inhibitory genes), there was a marked reduction in the proportion of GLP1 neurons meeting this criterion. We find this is mainly due to the GLP1 cells expressing Gad2 (see plots below). We still find that there are some GLP1-expressing neurons that express excitatory markers and <italic>Slc32a1</italic> and that the GLP1 neurons have a higher proportion of these co-expressing cells than other cell types.</p><p>We have extended our results section to reflect this and thank the reviewer for recommending this analysis.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Slc32a1 expression across all neurons.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106217-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Proportion of neurons in all cell identities expressing glutamatergic markers alone (dark green), Slc32a1 alone (light green), both glutamatergic markers and Slc32a1 (purple) or expressing neither Slc32a1 or glutamatergic markers (grey).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106217-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Balloon plot of Slc32a1, Gad1 and Gad2 across cell types.</title><p>The GLP1-expressing neurons express Gad2 but minimal Slc32a1.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-106217-sa3-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The Pdgfra IHC as verification is great, but images are not very convincing in distinguishing the 2 (mouse) or 3 (rat) classes of cells. Why not compare Pdgfra and HuC/D co-localization by IHC and snRNAseq data (using the genes for HuC/D) in the mouse and in the rat? That would also clarify how specific HuC/D is for DMV neurons, or if it may also be expressed in non-neuronal populations.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the suggestion by the reviewer, we reanalyzed the snRNA-Seq data to identify the extent of the co-expression of HuC/HuD (i.e. <italic>Elavl3</italic> and <italic>Elavl4</italic> genes, respectively) in <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-expressing neurons. The gene expression of the 34 rat neurons belonging to this group are shown in the following heatmap in which each column represents one neuron. As shown, most neurons co-express <italic>Pdgfra</italic> and either HuC or HuD gene. In addition, we shown the UMAP plots of the rat neurons showing expression of the same genes regardless of the neuronal identity assigned. The Pdgfra neurons are visible in darker blue in the last UMAP plot. It's important to note that HuD is a more specific neuronal marker as shown in the table with the average expression of <italic>Elavl3/4</italic> genes, since HuC is expressed by glial cells, specially OPCs and oligodendrocytes. As the HUC/D antibody detects both proteins, this complicates the interpretation of the immunofluorescent staining.
