signalling network increases health during ageing in multiple species. Diverse and tissue-specific mechanisms drive the health improvement. Here, we performed tissue-specific transcriptional and proteomic profiling of long-lived <italic>Drosophila dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants, and identified tissue-specific regulation of &gt;3600 transcripts and &gt;3700 proteins. Most expression changes were regulated post-transcriptionally in the fat body, and only in mutants infected with the endosymbiotic bacteria, <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic>, which increases their lifespan. Bioinformatic analysis identified reduced co-translational ER targeting of secreted and membrane-associated proteins and increased DNA damage/repair response proteins. Accordingly, age-related DNA damage and genome instability were lower in fat body of the mutant, and overexpression of a minichromosome maintenance protein subunit extended lifespan. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism showed altered expression in the mutant intestine, and gut-specific overexpression of a lysosomal mannosidase increased autophagy, gut homeostasis, and lifespan. These processes are candidates for combatting ageing-related decline in other organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>mannosidase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tain</surname><given-names>Luke Stephen</given-names></name><name><surname>Sehlke</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Meilenbrock</surname><given-names>Ralf Leslie</given-names></name><name><surname>Leech</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Paulitz</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name><name><surname>Grönke</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name><name><surname>Fröhlich</surname><given-names>Jenny</given-names></name><name><surname>Mann</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagaraj</surname><given-names>Nagarjuna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0315893A-B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tain</surname><given-names>Luke Stephen</given-names></name><name><surname>Sehlke</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Chokkalingam</surname><given-names>Manopriya</given-names></name><name><surname>Beyer</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011199</institution-id><institution>FP7 Ideas: European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Partridge</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>268739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Partridge</surname><given-names>Linda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multi-omic profiling of gene expression in response to reduced insulin/IGF-like-signalling reveals tissue-specific regulation of DNA damage and lysosomal mannosidase regulation of tissue homeostasis as pro-longevity responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human life expectancy is increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oeppen and Demography, 2002</xref>) and is predicted to continue to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kontis et al., 2017</xref>). However, healthspan, the period of life spent in good health and free from the chronic diseases and disorders of ageing, is not keeping up with lifespan and there is therefore a growing period of functional decline and ill health at the end of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crimmins, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Niccoli and Partridge, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Partridge et al., 2018</xref>).

Identifying the molecular mechanisms and understanding exactly how reducing IIS activity prolongs longevity may hence lead to interventions that ameliorate the effects of ageing and prevent age-related pathology.</p><p>Gene expression profiling in whole organisms has identified genes and molecular mechanisms that ameliorate ageing in IIS mutants in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ewald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Halaschek-Wiener et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kaletsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McElwee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Murphy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Oh et al., 2006</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Teleman et al., 2008</xref>). Recent transcriptomic analysis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Page et al., 2018</xref>), and proteomic analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tain et al., 2017</xref>) showed that the responses to lowered IIS are highly tissues-specific. How these tissue-specific responses are regulated is less clear, and tissue-specific profiling of both the transcriptome and the proteome can give a more informative picture, not only of the molecular changes mediating tissue-specific functional responses to mutations that increase healthspan, but also of how gene expression itself is regulated to achieve those responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barrett et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>IIS affects not only lifespan, but also other processes including development, growth, and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartke, 2011</xref>). Isolating the potentially causal changes in gene expression that specifically modulate longevity in IIS mutants is therefore challenging. In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic>, IIS is activated through insulin-like peptides (DILPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grönke et al., 2010</xref>). Genetic ablation of the median secretory neurons (mNSC), which produce DILPs, or null mutation of 3 <italic>dilp</italic> genes (<italic>dilp2-3,5</italic>) that are expressed in the mNSC neurons, systemically lowers IIS, resulting in extended lifespan, reduced body size, reduced female fertility, and delayed development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grönke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Broughton et al., 2005</xref>). However, the extent to which these traits change is greater in <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants than mNSC-ablated flies, perhaps because IIS activity is reduced throughout development in <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants, while lowered IIS commences only later in larval life in mNSC-ablated flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grönke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Broughton et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>A naturally occurring endosymbiotic bacterium, <italic>Wolbachia pipientis,</italic> present in many insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Werren and Windsor, 2000</xref>), interacts with IIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ikeya et al., 2009</xref>), and increases the longevity of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grönke et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Wolbachia</italic> also increases the resistance of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants to xenobiotics, but does not affect other phenotypes associated with reduced IIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grönke et al., 2010</xref>). Changes in gene expression that require <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in IIS mutants are therefore potentially causal for longevity, and identifying them could thus aid in isolating the specific mechanisms and processes that mediate IIS mutant longevity.</p><p>Here, we have simultaneously profiled tissue-specific changes in gene expression at both the transcriptomic and proteomic level in the gut, brain, thorax, and fat body of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutant flies. Combining our proteomic analysis with transcriptome profiling, we have examined the role of transcriptional and proteomic responses in remodelling of the tissue-specific proteomes in response to lowered IIS. To pinpoint whether these changes were causal for longevity, we quantified whether these changes in expression were altered in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Surprisingly, we found that, unlike in the gut, brain, and thorax, the majority of fat-body-specific gene expression changes in response to reduced IIS were regulated post-transcriptionally, and that this regulation was entirely dependent upon the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. To increase the specificity and robustness of our analysis, we performed a novel meta-analysis of the proteomic responses to those in a previously studied mutant, mNSC-ablated flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tain et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, our tissue-specific gene expression analysis and cross model meta-analysis allowed the identification of both conserved, and model-specific, responses to reduced IIS, which may contribute to IIS-mediated longevity.</p><p>We identified novel functional signatures of reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-protein targeting and an increased DNA damage/repair response that require <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and that were specific to the fat body of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants. We then showed that DNA damage is reduced, and genome stability increased, in the fat body of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutant flies and, importantly, that these effects require <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Furthermore, we showed that increased expression of one subunit of the minichromosome maintenance complex was sufficient to reduce DNA damage in the fat body, and extend lifespan.</p><p>Finally, we identified a gut-specific upregulation of lysosomal alpha-mannosidases in response to lowered IIS that occurred only in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Furthermore, we showed that gut-specific overexpression of one lysosomal alpha-mannosidase was sufficient to maintain gut homeostasis and extend lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tissue-specific remodelling of gene expression in response to reduced IIS</title><p>Reducing IIS activity can remodel gene expression via downstream transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Partridge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kenyon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fontana et al., 2010</xref>).

In total, 1569 proteins were differentially expressed in the fat body of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Of those, 729 proteins changed expression in the same direction as their transcripts and were enriched for functions associated with proteostasis, amino acid metabolism, and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shown in blue and orange, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). The remaining 840 proteins were regulated in the opposite direction to that of their transcripts. This included 601 significantly downregulated proteins, which were enriched for functions relating to translation/peptide generation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and lipids. The remaining 239 proteins were significantly upregulated and enriched for functions relating to DNA replication/repair, and chromatin remodelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Thus, gene expression changes in response to lowered IIS in the brain, gut, and thorax, were driven by transcription; however, in the fat body those changes were primarily post-transcriptional. Together, these findings highlight the importance of quantifying post-transcriptional gene expression when analysing IIS mutants, as many gene expression changes would have been missed if examined solely at the mRNA level.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Identifying tissue-specific, differential gene expression potentially causal in longevity</title><p>To further narrow down changes in gene expression that may have a causal role in IIS mutant longevity, we examined both transcriptomic and proteomic changes in the presence and absence of the intracellular, bacterial symbiont <italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic>.

We thus tested if increased gut-specific expression of lysosomal mannosidase can maintain homeostasis in the ageing gut. Of the six significantly upregulated lysosomal alpha-mannosidases in the <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutant gut, lysosomal alpha-mannosidase V (LManV) was one of the most significantly regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Sorting proteins to the correct cellular location is a vitally important part of proteostasis and dysfunction in the sorting of proteins can lead to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balch et al., 2008</xref>). We identified a fat-body-specific downregulation of proteins associated to the ER, and proteins involved in co-translational import into the ER in response to reduced IIS.

We quantified several SRP, SRP-receptor, and translocon subunits as significantly down-regulated in the fat body of long-lived IIS mutants. Thus, co-translational import into the ER may be tissue-specifically decreased in response to reduced IIS, possibly as a means of post-transcriptionally regulating the proteome.</p><p>Interestingly, the role of ER itself in post-transcriptional regulation is vital, with the ER acting as a major cellular compartment for translation, primarily of secreted and membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reid and Nicchitta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Reid and Nicchitta, 2015</xref>). The reduction in co-translational import to the ER detected in IIS mutants may therefore result in a specific reduction in translation of secreted proteins. However, our analysis suggests the response is more likely to represent a general reduction in translation, because the expression of both secreted, and membrane, proteins was reduced to the same extent.</p><p>Reduced translation is a common feature of long-lived models, especially models of reduced IIS activity, where both translational capacity and translational rate are decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Essers et al., 2016</xref>). Translational capacity is decreased in both the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gut and fat body of IIS mutants, with fewer cytoplasmic ribosomes associating with mRNAs undergoing active translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Essers et al., 2016</xref>). Translational rate, however, is only decreased in the fat body of IIS mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Essers et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike tissue-specific reductions in translational capacity, fat-body-specific reductions in translational rate are dependent on dFoxo in IIS mutants and are thus potentially important for longevity. Functional signatures associated to a general reduction in translation were detected in both the gut and the fat body. However, changes in the expression of co-translational import machinery proteins were unique to the fat body in response to reduced IIS. Changes in the ER co-translational import machinery proteins could lead to more global changes in translation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Fat-body-specific regulation of the DNA damage/repair machinery and maintenance of genome stability in response to lowered IIS</title><p>Our study examined the role of DNA damage responses and genome stability in response to reduced IIS. Key elements of the DNA damage response were strongly, and specifically, induced in the fat body of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> flies. Furthermore, we found that this response required <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and therefore the proteins of the DNA damage response and genome stability machinery are good candidates for regulators of IIS mutant longevity.</p><p>Progressive age-related incidents of DNA damage are common amongst most species examined, and may be the cause cellular dysfunction and thus ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maynard et al., 2015</xref>). Preventing DNA damage may therefore be beneficial for longevity. Using phosphorylated His2Av as a marker for early DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mah et al., 2010</xref>), we were able to confirm a reduction of DNA damage in the fat body of IIS mutant flies that required the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. This correlated with the changes in expression of the DNA damage response and repair pathways detected in the fat body of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants. We identified the replicative helicase MCM complex as regulated in response to reduced IIS. Furthermore, all subunits of the MCM complex were upregulated, but only in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Thus, the MCM complex may play a role in modulating the longevity of IIS mutant flies.</p><p>The MCM complex is an evolutionarily conserved replicative helicase required for initiation and elongation during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bell and Dutta, 2002</xref>). In addition, the MCM complex has been shown to play a role in transcription, chromatin remodelling, and genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailis and Forsburg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Forsburg, 2004</xref>). More recently, MCM complex proteins have been shown to be recruited to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Drissi et al., 2015</xref>) and play a role in repair responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Drissi et al., 2018</xref>). Increased MCM protein levels in the fat body of IIS mutants may aid in preventing age-related DNA damage and/or increase the efficiency of repair pathways and thus promote longevity. Indeed, increased expression of a single subunit (MCM6) of the MCM complex in the fat body was sufficient to significantly reduce age-associated DNA damage in that tissue. Furthermore, increased expression of MCM6 in the fat body was sufficient to extend longevity. Together, these data suggest a role for increased DNA damage/repair responses as possible modulators of IIS-mediated longevity.</p><p>These changes also extended to proteins that regulate genome stability. DNA damage and genomic instability are closely linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Celeste et al., 2002</xref>). Loss of genome stability leads to deregulation of transcription and has been associated with ageing across a wide range of model organisms including <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maxwell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wood et al., 2010</xref>). Combined with the dysregulation of DNA surveillance mechanisms with age, loss of stability can lead to the deleterious activation and mobilisation of TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dennis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maxwell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). However, interventions exist that can prevent TE activation. Dietary restriction can ameliorate transposon de-repression and loss of gene silencing with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). We find that transposon expression was diminished, specifically in the fat body, in response to reduced IIS. Our study suggests that a direct intervention to reduce IIS in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can tissue-specifically activate DNA maintenance mechanisms to maintain transposon repression and potentially delay genomic instability. One important distinction to be studied in the future will be to determine whether increased genome stability prevents DNA damage, or if reduced DNA damage increases genome stability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Gut-specific regulation of lysosomal alpha-manosidase ameliorates age-related gut pathology and is sufficient to extend lifespan</title><p>Managing nutrient uptake and regulating metabolism, including carbohydrate metabolism, is vitally important for an organism.

The question therefore remains, how can increased lysosomal alpha-manosidase expression in the gut extend lifespan? Increased lysosomal alpha-manosidase expression in response to reduced IIS may regulate proteostasis through lysosomal protein recycling. Importantly, our analysis showed increased lysosomal alpha-manosidase expression increased the number of lysosomes in the gut, which may increase gut health on a cellular level. Furthermore, we showed that increased lysosomal alpha-manosidase expression maintained gut health, reduced age-related gut pathologies, and increased longevity. In the future, targeting lysosomal alpha-mannosidases in the gut may therefore prove to be therapeutic against the effects of ageing.</p><p>In summary, here we present a highly reproducible, tissue-specific, transcriptomic and proteomic dataset containing over 11,000 transcripts and 7000 proteins quantified from adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> and show how their expression changes in response to reduced IIS activity. To identify robust modulators of longevity, we have examined proteomic changes that are conserved between two models of reduced IIS and utilised the requirement of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> for IIS-mediated longevity to triage those proteomic changes most likely causal for longevity. We show that post-transcriptional regulation plays a major role in remodelling the fat body-specific proteome in response to reduced IIS, and that many possible candidates for mediating longevity are post-transcriptionally regulated in that tissue. We then identified two processes, ER co-translational ER import and DNA-damage responses/genome stability, regulated in the fat body of long-lived IIS mutant flies, potentially causal to their longevity. We also show that fat-body-specific overexpression of MCM6 is sufficient to reduced age-associated DNA damage and extend lifespan. Furthermore, we show that gut-specific overexpression of LManV was sufficient to increase gut homeostasis and extend lifespan. Together, our analysis offers a valuable resource to the scientific community, and highlights the importance of tissue-specific proteomic profiling and cross model comparison to discover potentially unidentified modulators of longevity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks, fly husbandry, and dissection</title><p>All flies were backcrossed into a white Dahomey (wDah) strain genetic background for at least eight generations.

For transcriptomics gene lists, the background was restricted to genes whose transcripts were detected at a median count above five in the respective tissue. To reduce redundancy of functional categories, we clustered together GO terms that differed in five or fewer gene list member genes; the smallest GO term by total annotations was selected as the primary (most specific) term to represent the cluster.

This expands from previous work where profiles were generated from whole adults or when using different manipulations to alter insulin/IGF signaling. Transcriptional change correlated with protein profile change in most tissue, except fat body. These expression effects interacted with antibiotic treatment, which the authors attribute to Wolbachia; previous work showed that dilp2,3,5 only extends lifespan in antibiotic treated adults. From analysis of the expression changes, Tain tested candidate pathways for ability to modulate aging. Longevity could be increased by minichromosome gene expression in fat body, and lysosomal mannosidase gene expression in the gut. These results refine the catalog of potential cellular mechanisms by which altered IIS controls lifespan. The paper and conclusions should be improved at several points.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>The interaction with Wolbachia is interesting and important. The data imply there is some sort of age-associated damage caused by microbes that is forestalled by dilp235 mutation. When flies are treated with antibiotics, this damage absent and reduced IIS cannot improve survival. (This interpretation implies antibiotic treatment increases lifespan of wildtype flies but data among labs varies and no data on this point are given in the current paper.) The key problem for now is to show the effects are caused by Wolbachia rather than a general impact upon the fly microbiome. Tetracycline knocks down many bacteria and no evidence is given to distinguish that alternative from just removing Wolbachia. This issue must be experimentally resolved, or the work should be rewritten without claiming Wolbachia is the cause. I would also like to see data confirming Wolbachia is present and absent in the stocks currently used in the study (not from years past). And, when were the T+/- stocks produced, in this study or many years back (this matters because it affects time for other microbiome to recover)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for identifying a clear misunderstanding with our methods. There was no treatment of flies with antibiotics during the experiments described in the manuscript. The description of the methods is now more transparent. For the generation of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> minus <italic>wDah</italic> stocks (wDahT), which naturally carry <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, were treated with tetracycline (25 mg/ml) for 3 generations. This was then followed by several generations to allow for full recovery from tetracycline treatment and to restore intestinal flora. Importantly, treatment with tetracycline and the resultant removal of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> did not alter lifespan in the <italic>wDah</italic> stocks [24, 27]. <italic>dilp2,3-5</italic> mutants, both with and without <italic>Wolbachia,</italic> were previously generated by Grönke et al. 2010. To achieve this, <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants were backcrossed for at least 10 generations into the previously described <italic>wDah</italic> or wDahT stock. The presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> was then checked by PCR as described above (Technical details are described in the updated methods).</p><p>We hope that this has clarified our methods to the reviewer. We have now expanded and clarified the methodology section text to better describe the generation of our <italic>Wolbachia</italic> positive and negative stocks. These changes are outlined below.</p><p>Original methods text in the “Fly stocks, fly husbandry, and dissection” section of the method section on pg.31</p><p>“All flies were backcrossed into a white Dahomey (<italic>wDah</italic>) strain genetic background for at least 8 generations.

Tain establishes experimentally that transgene expression of this gene reduces His-foci and TEs. It extends lifespan, which transcends the paper from a correlational project to causal inference. I think this needs to go a bit further. What was the Wolbachia state of the flies in the survival study? I think they should be Wolbachia positive; please clarify. I also recommend treating these flies to remove Wolbachia and remeasuring survival; if the logic of this paper is robust we expect the benefit of MCM6 upon survival to not show up. It is difficult to conclude genome stability/TEs regulation by dilp235 as a mechanism to increase survival dependent on Wolbachia when the transgene survival experiment with MCM6 does not include a Wolbachia treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> status of the MCM6 survival assay, along with all genotypes, is important information for the reader and we have now included information on the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> status of all genotypes in the methods section (see below).

Specifically, the authors determined transcriptomic and proteomic changes in four fly tissues (gut, brain, thorax and fat body) caused by two insulin-reduced mutations, dilp2-3,5 and wDah, with or without gut bacteria Wolbachia pipientis. They showed that the majority of expression changes in fat body of the insulin signaling mutant flies were post-transcriptional and Wolbachia dependent. They then found that the induction of DNA damage and repair proteins in fat body was sufficient for longevity in insulin mutants, supported by bioinformatic analysis and lifespan data with fat body-specific overexpression of MCM6. Lastly, they showed that gut-specific overexpression of lysosomal mannosidase, which they identified from their bioinformatic analysis, was sufficient to increase autophagy, gut homeostasis, and consequently lifespan.

However, the key data of the papers are insufficient for this claim.” Our response to both major comments point 1 and 2 follows below.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and agree that we have examined physiological changes only in tissues in which the expression changes were identified in response to reduced IIS. Our manuscript details the identification of tissue-specific changes in gene expression in responses to reduced IIS. We use our analysis of those tissue-specific changes in response to reduced IIS to direct the tissue-specific expression of, potentially lifespan modulating, individual genes in the specific tissue in which those expression changes occurred. Our approach is an unbiased approach directed by out expression profiling. In our tissue-specific expression profiling we identified gut-specific up-regulation of LManV and a fat body-specific up-regulation of MCM6 in long-lived IIS mutant flies. Both responses are novel responses. We then showed gut- and fat body-specific expression of LManV or MCM6, respectively, was sufficient to extend lifespan in otherwise wild type flies. As such, we believe our manuscript shows tissue-specific modulation of gene expression is sufficient to induce physiological changes (reduced DNA damage/increased genome stability and increased gut health) and extend lifespan.</p><p>Furthermore, if increased expression of LManV or MCM6 in other tissues were to extend lifespan, possibly through increasing autophagy or DNA damage responses in that tissue, it would be interesting, but would be the result of ectopic expression and not related to expression changes in response to reduced IIS nor IIS-mediated longevity. Importantly, significant expression of LManV and MCM6 was mostly limited to the gut and the fat body respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>1.

Our manuscript characterizes tissue-specific transcriptomic and proteomic expression changes in response to reduced IIS. The changes in gene expression are outlined in Figure 1 and Figure S1 A-E. Using two complimentary analyses (see below) we focused on investigated proteomic changes/responses to reduced IIS that may be causal for longevity.</p><p>To focus on expression changes that may contribute to the long life of dilp2-3,5 mutants we examined expression changes that required <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (Figure S2). The presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is required for lifespan extension of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants, but not for other IIS-related phenotypes (Grönke et al. 2010). Therefore, <italic>Wolbacha-</italic>dependent changes to the transcriptome or proteome may be causal for the longevity of IIS mutants.</p><p>To identify robust tissue-specific gene expression changes in response to reduced IIS we also performed hierarchical clustering and GO enrichment analysis of significantly regulated proteins in two independent models of reduced IIS activity, namely <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants and <italic>mNSC-ablated</italic> flies (Tain et al. 2017). Importantly, <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutant flies are longer lived than mNSC-ablated flies and any <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic>-specific proteomic changes may provide insight into additional mechanisms regulating longevity. We identified several conserved proteomic changes (and processes linked to those proteins) between the two models, several of which have been directly associated with longevity of IIS mutants. In addition we identified fat body-specific ER protein targeting, and gut-specific carbohydrate metabolism/α glucosidase activity, specifically mannose metabolism, robust expression changes in response to reduced IIS. Furthermore, we identified DNA damage and repair responses as a functional signature present only in the fat body of dilp2-3,5 mutants. Therefore, our bioinformatic analyses led us to focus on three tissue-specific functional signatures/processes that may contribute the longevity in IIS mutants; translation/ER transport and DNA damage/repair responses in the fat body, and Mannose metabolism in the gut.</p><p>We have now edited the text following from the description of Figure 2 to better explain the logical flow from Figure 2 to Figure 3-5.

Furthermore, translational and ER-targeting functional signatures were conserved between dilp2-3,5 mutants and mNSC-ablated flies (Figure 2, cluster 7 and 8).

By addressing all three reviewers' comments, this nice paper will be improved substantially.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In this manuscript, Tain and colleagues reported a comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomics analysis on <italic>Drosophila</italic> IIS mutants. They found that flies with reduced IIS signaling exhibited tissue-specific transcriptional and proteomic profiles. Interestingly, the transcriptional changes in fat body of IIS mutants were not always consistent with the proteomic changes. Through bioinformatics and functional characterization, the authors identified three enriched pathways that are potentially associated with IISregulated longevity, 1) Protein targeting and translation in ER of the fat body; 2) Fat body-specific DNA damage and repair responses; 3) Gut-specific mannose metabolism. Lastly, overexpression of either minichromosome maintenance protein subunit MCM6 in the fat body or lysosomal α-mannosidase (LManV) in the gut extends lifespan. The study is well designed and the manuscript is well prepared. The work will contribute significantly to our understating of the evolutionarily conserved longevity pathway like IIS. I only have a few minor concerns listed below that need to be addressed before the manuscript is acceptable for publication.</p><p>1) To narrow down the candidate genes that may have a causal role in IIS-regulated longevity, the authors examined the Wolbachia-independent and Wolbachia-dependent changes. As an alternative, it would be great if the authors could compare their -omics data to previous aging transcriptomes to identify IIS-regulated candidate genes with age-related expression profiles.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that comparing our –omics data to previously published aging/IIS responsive transcriptomic datasets would be very interesting, if those transcriptomic datasets were tissue-specific. Unfortunately, very few datasets that examine tissue-specific gene expression changes in response to reduced IIS exist. Furthermore, those datasets that do exist use different platforms, for example Microarrays (Alic et al. 2014) that result in noncomparable levels of sensitivity. Alic et al. 2014 used Dros.2 microarrays to determine differential gene expression in the fat body of flies overexpressing dFoxo under the control of the geneswitch driver S106. They detected 174 differentially expressed genes with an FDR of 10%. In our current study, using RNA-Seq, we detect differential expression of over a 1000 transcripts in the fat body of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants, almost 600 of which were regulated in that tissue alone.</p><p>In addition to compatibility issues arising from analysis platforms, the tissue specific nature of the current and previous –omic profiling studies is very important in performing meta-analyses of the kind suggested by the reviewer. Our current analysis highlights the tissue-specific nature of both transcriptomic and proteomic responses to reduced IIS (Figure S1D). Only 17 transcripts and 22 proteins were regulated in all 4 tissues of the dilp2-3,5 mutants examined here (Figure S1D). The majority of differentially expressed transcripts and proteins show differential expression in one tissue alone. For example, of the 1004 significantly regulated transcripts in the fat body of <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants, 590 were regulated in the fat body alone.</p><p>Therefore, whilst we do believe the meta-analysis approach suggested by the reviewer would be beneficial to the field and would lead to the discovery of further prolongevity targets, the tissue-specific RNA-Seq datasets to do such meta analyses in flies do not yet exist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The identification of ER co-translational targeting and protein translocation was very intriguing. However, no functional characterization was shown. Have the authors tried to examine the role of TRAM and SRP subunits in lifespan control?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that altered ER co-translational targeting and protein translocation in response to reduced IIS is very interesting, and is a possible direction for future work. However, we have, as of yet, not examined the role of SRP subunits in the tissue-specific regulation of lifespan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The rationale behind the analysis on transposable elements (TEs) was a little unclear. Is TE enriched in any of the GO analysis? And the authors did not provide evidence supporting a role of IIS mutant in regulating age-related changes in TE expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment and address their points below</p><p>GO terms associated with TE expression was not specifically enriched in our analysis. We used TE expression analysis as a proxy for genomic stability, which along with DNA damage was enriched in our GO enrichment analysis, specifically in the fat body of long-lived <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants. As described in our main text (Pg. 12-13) genome stability declines with age, and is itself a hallmark of ageing ([46,47]). Loss of genome stability is associated with increased mis-expression of transposable elements. Thus, any reduction in TE expression, by increased genome stability, in response to reduced IIS may be a mechanism of IIS-mediated longevity.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that all evidence associated to changes in TE expression in response to reduced IIS is limited to our single 10d age. As the changes we see in TE expression are likely due to global changes in genome stability and not of specific TEs, performing expression analyses on individual TEs is unlikely to yield a robust and conclusive answer to age-related changes in TE expression. Therefore we propose to examine global TE expression in IIS mutants utilising available <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcriptomic datasets. One such dataset was published recently in <italic>Wolbachia</italic> positive <italic>dilp2-3,5</italic> mutants (Weigelt et al. 2020 doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.06.011). We will perform this analysis upon full revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>This study revealed interesting tissue-specific responses to reduced IIS signaling, including many previously uncharacterized transcriptional and proteomic changes.
