A number of non-centrosomal microtubules anchor at the surface of the Golgi apparatus and play a vital role in the Golgi reorientation, but how the Golgi are regulated by polarity signals remains unclear. Calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2 (CAMSAP2) is a protein that anchors microtubules to the Golgi, a cellular organelle. Our research indicates that CAMSAP2 is dynamically localized at the Golgi during its reorientation processing. Further research shows that CAMSAP2 is potentially regulated by a polarity signaling molecule called MARK2, which interacts with CAMSAP2. We used mass spectrometry to find that MARK2 phosphorylates CAMSAP2 at serine-835, which affects its interaction with the Golgi-associated protein USO1 but not with CG-NAP or CLASPs. This interaction is critical for anchoring microtubules to the Golgi during cell migration, altering microtubule polarity distribution, and aiding Golgi reorientation. Our study reveals an important signaling pathway in Golgi reorientation during cell migration, which can provide insights for research in cancer cell migration, immune response, and targeted drug development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CAMSAP2</kwd><kwd>Golgi reorientation</kwd><kwd>microtubule polarity</kwd><kwd>intracellular transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFA0804802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Wenxiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31930025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Wenxiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32100760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Zhengrong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MARK2-mediated phosphorylation of CAMSAP2 dynamically controls Golgi orientation by altering microtubule anchoring and polarity during directional cell migration.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell migration plays a pivotal role in numerous physiological processes, including embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and immune response mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jaffe and Hall, 2005</xref>). This intricate process is significantly influenced by the dynamic reorientation of the Golgi apparatus, which orchestrates the targeted delivery of newly synthesized membranes and proteins to the leading edge of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mellor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yadav and Linstedt, 2011</xref>). As early as 1970, scientists discovered that the chick corneal epithelium underwent apical and basal transitions of the Golgi during development and proposed that there must be signaling pathways that directly regulate Golgi reorientation. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate Golgi reorientation in cells are still unclear.</p><p>In interphase cells, the Golgi apparatus typically occupies a central position. However, during migration, it undergoes a strategic repositioning toward the migration front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Millarte and Farhan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meiring et al., 2020</xref>). Golgi apparatus becomes a dispersed, unpolarized transitional structure, then transforming into a complete Golgi apparatus with polarity, intricately tied to the microtubule networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yadav and Linstedt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). Interruptions in this network, e.g., by nocodazole, disrupt the Golgi structure, impeding its necessary reorientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thyberg and Moskalewski, 1999</xref>). Non-centrosomal microtubules, rooted in the Golgi, stabilize their ribbon structure and facilitate this reorientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2019</xref>). CAMSAP2, a microtubule minus-end binding protein, emerges as a crucial player in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2019</xref>). Diminished CAMSAP2 levels lead to a loss of Golgi-associated non-centrosomal microtubules, disrupting Golgi function and hampering cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ravichandran et al., 2020</xref>). This emphasizes CAMSAP2’s role in sustaining Golgi integrity during critical cellular events like migration.</p><p>Cell migration is a complex process that relies on intricate signaling pathways and the coordination of various cellular components, such as the microtubule networks and Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Preisinger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Etienne-Manneville, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mardakheh et al., 2016</xref>). Rho GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, are instrumental in the cytoskeletal reorganization needed for migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iden and Collard, 2008</xref>). They govern the formation of stress fibers and the protrusion of lamellipodia and filopodia, all underpinned by the microtubule network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcin and Straube, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">SenGupta et al., 2021</xref>). Microtubule stability, essential for cell polarity and movement, can be modulated by protein kinases such as GSK-3β and the PAR6-PAR3-aPKC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki and Ohno, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldstein and Macara, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Etienne-Manneville, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iden and Collard, 2008</xref>). Motor proteins associated with microtubules, namely dynein and kinesin, are involved in the positioning and transport of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miserey-Lenkei et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, Rab GTPases regulate Golgi trafficking to ensure the delivery of essential components for cell polarization and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu and Storrie, 2012</xref>). ERK and integrin signaling are also implicated in aligning the Golgi along the cell’s axis of migration to facilitate polarized secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Millarte and Farhan, 2012</xref>). Despite the understanding of these pathways in regulating microtubule and Golgi dynamics, the precise mechanisms of their coordination during cell migration remain an area of active investigation.</p><p>Directional cell migration refers to the directional movement of cells through cytosolic deformation, which is constituted by the following five steps in close spatial and temporal coordination: the cell is stimulated by intracellular and extracellular signals, the cytosol extends the lamellar pseudopods forward, the Golgi transforms into a dispersed, unpolarized excess, followed by the formation of a complete polar Golgi body to complete the Golgi reorientation as well as the retraction of the tails. In this study, we focus on the Golgi reorientation: the process by which dispersed unpolarized Golgi stacks form a completely polarized Golgi. We found that the co-localization of CAMSAP2 with the Golgi dynamically changed during directional cell migration, suggesting that CAMSAP2 is dynamically regulated by polarity signaling. Additionally, immunoprecipitation confirmed the interaction between MARK2 and CAMSAP2. Mass spectrometry found that MARK2 phosphorylates CAMSAP2 at serine-835, which affected its interaction with the Golgi-associated protein USO1 but not with CG-NAP or CLASPs. Here, we reveal a novel polarity signaling pathway: MARK2 acts as a polarity-establishing key kinase that regulates Golgi reorientation by phosphorylating serine at position 835 of CASMAP2, thereby affecting CAMSAP2’s binding ability to Golgi-associated protein USO1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamic regulation of the CAMSAP2-Golgi relationship during Golgi reorientation</title><p>To investigate the role of non-centrosomal microtubules in the Golgi apparatus reorientation process, we utilized the microtubule minus-end protein CAMSAP2 as a starting point. CAMSAP2 functions by anchoring the minus ends of non-centrosomal microtubules to the Golgi apparatus, facilitating the formation of ribbon structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ravichandran et al., 2020</xref>). We established a CAMSAP2 knockout cell line in HT1080 cells, a human fibrosarcoma cell line widely employed in cell migration studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rasheed et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Compared to normal cells, CAMSAP2 knockout cells exhibited disordered Golgi apparatus structure, characterized by dispersion into numerous small stack structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). However, immunoblotting analysis revealed no change in the protein level of GM130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These findings suggest that CAMSAP2 plays a crucial role in regulating Golgi structure and morphology, consistent with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin et al., 2018</xref>), thus affirming the success of generating CAMSAP2 knockout HT1080 cells.</p><p>Subsequently, to confirm CAMSAP2’s role in cell migration and Golgi apparatus reorientation, we conducted a wound healing assay to induce directional cell migration. Previous studies on cell wound healing have demonstrated that as early as 2 hr post-scratch, Golgi reorientation is observed in cells at the leading edge of the wound (where a polarized Golgi apparatus, situated at the front edge of the nucleus, aligns toward the scratch side). We fixed the cells after 2 hr of migration with methanol for staining and assessed Golgi reorientation by measuring the angle between the Golgi centroid-nucleus centroid axis and the direction of cell migration. If the absolute value of this angle is within 90 degrees, it indicates that the Golgi is positioned at the front edge of the nucleus and oriented in the migration direction, signifying proper Golgi reorientation. Conversely, if the absolute angle falls between 90 and 180 degrees, it suggests that the Golgi is positioned behind the nucleus, indicating incomplete Golgi reorientation. Compared to control HT1080 cells, the proportion of cells with completed Golgi reorientation was significantly reduced in CAMSAP2 knockout HT1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–H</xref>). To verify the role of CAMSAP2 in directed migration of HT1080 cells, we conducted a scratch assay. Bright-field images were taken of the cells before and 8 hr after scratch formation to measure the change in scratch area over this period. The results showed a significant reduction in migration speed in CAMSAP2 knockout HT1080 cells compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>). These findings strongly suggest CAMSAP2’s involvement in the Golgi apparatus reorientation process, aligning with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Next, we observed whether Golgi non-centrosomal microtubules undergo dynamic regulation during Golgi reorientation. First, we used live-cell imaging to monitor the Golgi reorientation process and observed that the Golgi apparatus transitions into a dispersed intermediate structure before restoring its complete structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). CAMSAP2 is responsible for anchoring the minus ends of non-centrosomal microtubules to the Golgi apparatus. We performed fixation and staining at different time points in the cell wound healing assay. By analyzing CAMSAP2 localization in different states, we found that CAMSAP2 co-localization on the dispersed intermediate Golgi structure was significantly lower than on the fully intact Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The pattern of CAMSAP2 localization on the Golgi apparatus in the leading-edge cells at different time points in the wound healing assay is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>. Since in wound healing assays, the signaling for directed migration is gradually transmitted from the cells at the leading edge of the scratch to the inner cells, we examined immunostaining images taken 2 hr after scratching. Specifically, we observed the localization of CAMSAP2 on the Golgi apparatus in the leading-edge cells compared to the inner cells. We found that the localization of CAMSAP2 on the dispersed Golgi apparatus in the inner cells was significantly lower than its localization on the intact Golgi apparatus in the leading-edge cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). We carefully examined the nuclear morphology of dispersed Golgi cells and found no evidence of mitotic features, indicating that these cells are not undergoing division. Furthermore, during the scratch wound assay, we use 2% serum to culture the cells, which helps minimize the impact of cell division. Our experiments unveil a previously unrecognized phenomenon: dynamic changes in CAMSAP2 localization at the Golgi during cell-directed migration, suggesting the dynamic regulation of non-centrosomal microtubules during Golgi reorientation.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-105977-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Live-cell imaging to monitor the Golgi reorientation process.</title></caption></media><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CAMSAP2 is dynamically localized at the Golgi during the reorientation process in directional cell migration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of HT1080 located at the foremost edge of the cell wound after 0, 0.5, and 2 hr migration.

The cells in the white dashed box on the 2nd have not yet completed the process of cell-directed migration: the Golgi is relatively dispersed and has lost its polarity.

During cell migration, USO1 may influence Golgi apparatus structure and function by regulating interactions between the Golgi apparatus and vesicles, thereby participating in Golgi apparatus redirection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Radulescu et al., 2011</xref>). While the direct mechanisms of USO1’s action require further investigation, it likely plays a crucial role in modulating the Golgi apparatus microenvironment, providing support for the proper positioning of the Golgi apparatus. We have observed that surface-associated proteins on the Golgi apparatus are selectively involved in its functional regulation.</p><p>The specific impact of CG-NAP and USO1 on Golgi apparatus repositioning during cell movement demonstrates how these two proteins jointly regulate the microtubule network associated with the Golgi apparatus. Through this regulation, they can influence cell migration capabilities, highlighting the direct impact of complex interactions between cellular structural elements on cell behavior and migration direction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Signaling transduction in Golgi apparatus orientation</title><p>Within the realm of cell migration, the precise spatial alignment of the Golgi apparatus is intricately linked to the dynamic reconfiguration of the microtubule network - a process meticulously governed by multiple signaling pathways that collaborate to orchestrate this intricate interplay.</p><p>A central protagonist in the Golgi apparatus’s reorientation is MARK2, a protein kinase tasked with regulating the stability and polarity of non-centrosomal microtubules by phosphorylating target proteins, exemplified by CAMSAP2. Our research brings to the fore the specific role of MARK2 in the regulation of CAMSAP2, which concurrently oversees the microtubule network during cellular locomotion. Consequently, this regulatory oversight affects the interaction between CAMSAP2 and the Golgi-associated protein USO1. Notably, MARK2 facilitates the anchoring of the minus ends of non-centrosomal microtubules to the Golgi apparatus, thereby substantially bolstering the stability of the microtubule network. This phosphorylation-dependent regulation of CAMSAP2 by MARK2, along with its ensuing repercussions on the interplay between non-centrosomal microtubules and the Golgi apparatus, stands out as a pivotal mechanism underlying Golgi reorientation during the cellular migration journey. This regulatory mechanism ensures that the Golgi apparatus can adeptly respond to both intracellular and extracellular cues, thus enabling precise positioning along the trajectory of cell migration.</p><p>The localization of MARK2 at the Golgi was initially observed in experiments following serum starvation, where cells were fixed and stained (the data is not displayed). This observation was supported by the loss of Golgi localization in MARK2 knockdown cells, indicating the specificity of the antibody (the data is not displayed). However, this phenomenon was not consistently observed across all cells, likely due to its transient nature. We speculate that the localization of MARK2 to the Golgi depends on its activity and posttranslational modifications. For example, phosphorylation at T595 has been reported to regulate the translocation of MARK2 from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hurov et al., 2004</xref>). Serum starvation might induce modifications or conformational changes in MARK2, leading to its temporary Golgi localization. Additionally, we hypothesize that this localization may coincide with specific Golgi dynamics, such as the transition from dispersed to ribbon-like structures during cell migration. Exploring the reasons behind the localization of MARK2 at the Golgi apparatus in future research will be particularly intriguing.</p><p>Furthermore, several other players, including various signaling molecules and the cytoskeleton, partake in the intricate ballet of Golgi reorientation. RhoA, for instance, amplifies microtubule stability by catalyzing the action of microtubule-stabilizing proteins, deftly steering the Golgi apparatus toward the forefront of cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glaven et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nalbant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meiri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcin and Straube, 2019</xref>). Conversely, Rac1 and Cdc42 predominantly choreograph the assembly of actin filaments at the leading edge of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hladyshau et al., 2023</xref>). They achieve this by exerting influence over the growth and positioning of microtubules, thereby facilitating the Golgi’s realignment toward the direction of cell migration. Moreover, the MAPK/ERK pathway champions the cause of microtubule growth and stability, thereby wielding influence over Golgi positioning and cellular polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). The PI3K/Akt pathway, in turn, assumes the mantle of regulating the stability and dynamics of microtubules, thereby contributing to the establishment of cell polarity and the precise positioning of the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bucurica et al., 2023</xref>). The mTOR signaling pathway, though indirectly, leaves its imprint on the microtubule network by modulating protein synthesis and cellular metabolism, thereby affecting microtubule stability and Golgi localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makhoul et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, Wnt signaling lends its hand to the regulation of Golgi positioning by orchestrating the intricate dance of cell polarity and microtubule organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">VanderVorst et al., 2019</xref>). The combined synergy of these signaling pathways leaves an indelible mark on the precise Golgi positioning and the efficiency of cell migration by modulating the stability and dynamics of microtubules.</p><p>This collective body of evidence exemplifies how cells adeptly respond to both internal and external signals, leading to specific molecular events that recalibrate the spatial coordinates of the Golgi apparatus, consequently influencing the course of cell migration and cellular polarity. These discoveries underscore the pivotal role of signaling pathways in the governance of intracellular structural organization and dynamic adaptations, rendering invaluable insights into our comprehension of cell behavior. As we journey forward, further investigations will delve deeper into the specific mechanics governing these interactions, ultimately providing more profound insights into our understanding of cell migration.</p><p>Future research will delve deeper into the specific molecular interaction mechanisms among MARK2, CAMSAP2, and USO1, as well as how these interactions influence the dynamic repositioning of the Golgi apparatus during cell migration. Moreover, studies will focus on the biological significance of these new findings, especially in processes such as cell migration, cell polarity establishment, and tissue development. Additionally, the role of these molecular mechanisms in diseases, particularly in cancer metastasis and other pathological conditions related to cell migration, will be a key focus of future research. Through this research, we hope to provide new targets for the treatment of related diseases and gain a deeper understanding of the regulation of Golgi apparatus reorientation during cell migration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HT1080 and RPE1 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 (Wisent) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (TransSerum) and 100 mg/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

For MARK2 immunofluorescence staining, before fixing the cells, the serum in the culture medium should be reduced to 1% and cultured for 2 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blot</title><p>Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA], 1% NP-40, 0.5% DOC, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.0) containing 1× protease inhibitor cocktail. For phospho-experiments, cells were lysed in a phospho-buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM NaF, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, 50 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1% NP-40), containing protease inhibitor cocktail and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. After centrifuging to remove insoluble fractions, sample loading was added and boiled for 5 min. Protein was separated on SDS-PAGE gels (to determine the band shift of MARK2-dependent phosphorylation, 30 µM Phos-tag reagent was mixed in gels following the manufacturer’s instructions) and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 hr in 5% BSA, then incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight. After washing three times with TBST, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence.

The pellet was washed with cold homogenization buffer, and the cells were spun down at 500×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 5 volumes of cold homogenization buffer followed by homogenization using a homogenizer. Post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was obtained after centrifugation of the cell homogenate at 600×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. To 12 ml of PNS, 11 ml of 62% (wt/wt) sucrose solution and 250 ml of 100 mM EDTA (pH 7.1) were added to obtain a homogenate with 37% (wt/wt) sucrose concentration. Four milliliters of this homogenate were placed into an SW40 tube Beckman and overlaid with a 5 ml 35% (wt/wt) and a 4 ml 29% (wt/wt) layer of sucrose solution (in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4). These gradients were centrifuged for 2 hr and 40 min at 100,000×<italic>g</italic>. Approximately 1 ml of a Golgi-enriched fraction was collected at the interphase of 35–29% sucrose layers. For further analysis, the collected membranes were pelleted by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000×<italic>g</italic> at 4°C after the addition of 4 volumes of PBS to 1 volume of the Golgi-enriched fraction. Samples were boiled with a loading buffer. Alternatively, the collected membranes are stored at –80°C for future experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Wound healing and migration</title><p>A confluent HT1080 monolayer was scratched using a yellow pipette tip to create a cell-free zone. Fields were photographed just after injury and 2 hr or 8 hr later. Quantification of cell migration was made by measuring the percentage of area recovery using ImageJ software.

Samples were boiled with a loading buffer to stop the reaction. After being verified by western blotting (Phos-tag was added into the SDS-PAGE gels), the sample was loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels and stained with CBB. The bands of GFP-CAMSAP2 were cut out and delivered to mass spectrometry analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantification of western blotting</title><p>Quantification of protein levels was performed with ImageJ. The bands representing respective proteins were manually outlined, and the signal intensity was measured. For normalized protein levels, α-tubulin or GAPDH intensity in each band was also measured with ImageJ. The graphs of the intensity display the values relative to the maximum value (100%) in each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Microscopy image acquisition, processing, and quantitative analysis</title><p>Images were obtained through Zeiss Observer Z1. For superresolution confocal imaging of immunostained samples, Zeiss LSM980 with Airyscan 2 superresolution system was performed with a ×63 1.4 NA objective. All images were modified by adjustments of levels and contrast. To improve image resolution and contrast, sparse deconvolution was used by following the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Images from western blotting of Phos-tag (Wako) have modified the length in the Y-axis to adjust the bands, as the protein bands in Phos-tag SDS-PAGE become broad and tailing. Cells were carefully stained and recorded under the same conditions for quantification of co-localization. Pearson’s R value above the threshold was calculated with the Coloc 2 plug-in in Fiji software from 8-bit 512×512 pixel images of the region of interest with low background.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Data statistics</title><p>The results of the experiments in this study were obtained from three or more independent replications.

They identified that both proteins interact together and that MARK2 phosphorylates CAMSAP2 on the residue S835. They show that the phosphorylation affects the localisation of CAMSAP2 at the Golgi apparatus and in turn influences the Golgi structure itself. Using the TurboID experimental approach, the author identified the USO1 protein as a protein that binds differentially to CAMSAP2 when it is itself phosphorylated at residue 835. Dissecting the molecular mechanisms controlling Golgi polarisation during cell migration is a highly complex but fundamental issue in cell biology and the author may have identified one important key step in this process.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>I thank the authors for the numerous revisions they have made to this manuscript, which have strengthened its clarity and overall quality. However, I must reiterate my initial concerns from the first review regarding the rigor of the data analysis, as certain methodological choices may lead to potential overinterpretation of the results.</p><p>For instance, the low number of cells analyzed in the new Figure 1B (N = 3; 0 h: n = 28; 0.5 h: n = 23; 2 h: n = 20) indicates that fewer than 10 fixed cells have been quantified per replicate. Given the variability of the CAMSAP2 signal observed in Supplementary Figure 2, this sample size does not appear optimal for accurately capturing the complexity of CAMSAP2 localization within the cell population. Additionally, the Pearson's coefficients calculated between CAMSAP2 and GM130 in Figure 1B (approximately 0.4) do not align with those in Figure 3C, where the control condition shows values above 0.6. This discrepancy highlights the high variability of CAMSAP2 Golgi localization in the HT1080 cell population, which may not be adequately represented by the quantification of such a limited number of cells. If the population distribution were narrow, averaging only a few cells might be sufficient to achieve high statistical power; however, this does not appear to be the case, and a larger sample size is necessary.</p><p>Furthermore, to ensure a more robust analysis, SuperPlots displaying each biological replicate should be provided for all quantifications, and statistical analysis should be conducted using a t-test or ANOVA on the means of the three independent experiments rather than on the total number of cells, as the latter approach may influence statistical significance (for reference: jcb.202001064). This recommendation is relevant for Figures 1E, 3B, 3C, 4E, 4F, 6F, Sup1D, Sup3D, Sup3E, Sup3I, and Sup3G and should be implemented whenever possible.</p><p>For instance, in the new Figure 6F, the statistical difference (1 star) between Pearson's coefficients for HT1080 and siUSO1-2 conditions, both approaching 90, raises questions about whether this difference is truly substantial enough to support the claim that USO1 knockdown negatively impacts CAMSAP2 localization.</p><p>Publishing in journals such as eLife requires high standards in data analysis to ensure rigorous and reproducible scientific conclusions. In its present form, this manuscript does not yet meet those standards.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>Supplementary figure 2</p><p>A) The video microscopy conditions are not described in the Materials and Methods section. It is unclear what type of microscope was used-was it a bright-field or confocal microscope? The images contain a significant amount of out-of-focus signal, making it difficult to accurately assess the extent of Golgi apparatus dispersion as described by the authors. If a confocal microscope was used, a Z-stack projection would be beneficial for quantifying this process.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105977.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript Xu et al. explores the regulation of the microtubule minus end protein CAMSAP2 localization to the Golgi by the Serine/threonine-protein kinase MARK2 (PAR1, PAR1B). The authors show that depletion of MARK2 alters Golgi morphology and diminishes CAMSAP2 localization to the Golgi apparatus. The authors combine mass spectroscopy and immunoprecipitation to show that CAMSAP2 is phosphorylated at S835 by MARK2, and that this phosphorylation regulates localization of CAMSAP2 at Golgi membranes. Further, the authors identify USO1 (p115) as the Golgi resident protein mediating CAMSAP2 recruitment to the Golgi apparatus following S835 phosphorylation.</p><p>Impact:</p><p>The Golgi apparatus is a key organelle in cell migration- post translationally modifying and sorting cargo for directed trafficking, acting as a signalling hub, whilst functioning as a nucleation site for microtubules. These functions are essential to establish cell polarity during migration, highlighting the importance of understanding how cells reorient their Golgi in response to different environmental cues.</p><p>The study will be of interest to fundamental biologists investigating Golgi function, and positioning, particularly in the context of different cell migration settings. It may also interest scientists investigating the loss of polarity in cancer or the maintenance of epithelial tissue architecture. I am a cell biologist with expertise in cell trafficking, cytoskeleton, and cell migration- during processes spanning development, homeostasis and cancer.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>Labelling of graphs - many of the graphs are comparing HT1080 cells with two conditions: parental and KO i.e. Figure 2F, H, I. The labels the authors use are &quot;HT1080 and CAMSAP2 KO&quot;. This is confusing and should be changed to &quot;parental and CAMSAP2 KO&quot;, the cell type HT1080 could be listed in the figure legend or on the graph below the conditions. (Similar to the labelling in Figure 3 H, I where they use &quot;control and siRNA&quot;).</p><p>The method section needs improvement - particularly around analysis methods, and statistical details for experiments. I recommend a supplementary table outlining exactly where the data is from (pooled, biological/technical repeats, n definitions, tests of normality etc).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105977.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Peipei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Zhengrong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shantou University Medical College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Shantou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Honglin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yuejia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Mengge</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Ruifan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Wangjing Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciencesof China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yingchun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Xiahe</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Qi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Wangjing Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciencesof China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Wenxiang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>The manuscript Xu et al. explores the regulation of the microtubule minus end protein CAMSAP2 localization to the Golgi by the Serine/threonine-protein kinase MARK2 (PAR1, PAR1B).

We deeply appreciate the constructive feedback and insightful suggestions, which have been instrumental in improving the quality and clarity of our study. We have carefully considered all the comments and have made the necessary revisions to address the concerns raised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Comments</p><p>(1) Dynamic localization of CAMSAP2 during Golgi reorientation</p><p>- The authors use fixed wound edges assays and co-localization analysis to describe changes in CAMSAP2 positioning during Golgi reorientation in response to polarizing cues (a free wound edge in this case). In Figure 1C, they present a graphical representation of quantified immunofluorescence images, using color coding to to describe the three states of Golgi reorientation in response to a wound (green, blue, red indicating non-polarised, partial and complete Golgi reorientation, respectively). They then use these 'colour coded' classifications to quantitate CAMSAP2/GM130 co-localization.It is unclear why the authors have not just used representative immunofluorescence images in the main figures. Transparent, color overlays could be placed over the cells in the representative images to indicate which of the three described states each cell is currently exhibiting. However, for clarity, I would recommend changing the color coded 'states' to a descriptor rather than a color. i.e. Figure 1D x axis labels should be 'complete' and 'partial', instead of 'red' and 'blue'.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful suggestion. We have added representative immunofluorescence images with transparent color overlay to indicate the three Golgi orientation states. These images are included in Supplementary Figure 2B-C, providing a clear visual reference for the quantitative data. Additionally, we have revised the x-axis labels in Figure 1E from &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; to &quot;Complete&quot; and &quot;Partial&quot; to ensure clarity and consistency with the descriptive terminology in the text. These changes are described in the Results section (page 7, lines 15-19) and the figure legend (page 29, lines 27-29).</p><p>We believe these updates improve the clarity and accessibility of our figures and hope they address the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- note- figure 2 F-G, is semi quantitative, why did the authors not just measure Golgi angle using the nucleus and Golgi distribution?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment on this point. Following the recommendation, we have performed an additional analysis measuring Golgi orientation angles based on the nucleus-Golgi distribution. This quantitative approach complements our initial semi-quantitative analysis and provides a more precise assessment of Golgi orientation during cell migration.</p><p>The new data have been incorporated into Supplementary Figure 1F-H. These results clearly demonstrate the consistency between the quantitative and semi-quantitative methods, further validating our findings and highlighting the dynamic changes in Golgi orientation during cell migration. These changes are described in the Results section (page 6, lines 24-31).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While it is established that the Golgi is dispersed during reorientation in wound edge migration, the Golgi apparatus also becomes dispersed/less condensed prior to cell division. As the authors have used fixed images - how are they sure that the Golgi morphology or CAMSAP2 localization in 'blue cells' are indicative of Golgi reorientation and not division? Live imaging of cells expressing CAMSAP2, and an additional Golgi marker could be used to demonstrate that the described changes in Golgi morphology and CAMSAP2 localization are occurring during the rear-to-front transition of the Golgi.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important question. To address this concern, we carefully examined the nuclear morphology of dispersed Golgi cells and found no evidence of mitotic features, indicating that these cells are not undergoing division (Figure 1A, Supplemental Figure 2A). Furthermore, during the scratch wound assay, we use 2% serum to culture the cells, which helps minimize the impact of cell division. This analysis has been added to the Results section (page7, lines 19-22 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Additionally, we conducted live-cell imaging, as suggested, using cells expressing a Golgi marker. This approach confirmed that Golgi dispersion occurs transiently during reorientation in cell migration. The new live-cell imaging data have been incorporated into Supplementary Figure 2A, and the corresponding description has been updated in the Results section (page 7, lines 2-5).</p><p>Finally, considering that overexpression of CAMSAP2 can lead to artifactually condensed Golgi structures, we used endogenous staining to observe CAMSAP2 localization at different stages of migration. These observations provide a clearer understanding of CAMSAP2 dynamics during Golgi reorientation and are now presented in revised Figure 1A-B. This information has been described in the Results section (page 7, lines 5-10).</p><p>We hope these additions and clarifications address the reviewer’s concerns. Once again, we are deeply grateful for this constructive feedback, which has greatly improved the robustness of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) MARK2 localization to the Golgi apparatus</p><p>- The authors investigated the positioning of endogenous MARK2 via immunofluorescence staining, and exogenous flag-tagged MARK2 in a KO background. The description of the protocol required to visualize Golgi localization of MARK2 is inconsistent between the results and methods text. The results text reads as through the 2% serum incubation occurs as a blocking step following fixation. Conversely, the methods section describes the 2% serum incubation as occurring just prior to fixation as a form of serum starvation. The authors need to clarify which of these protocols is correct. Further, whilst I can appreciate that the mechanistic understanding of why serum starvation is required for MARK2 Golgi localization is beyond the scope of the current work, the authors should at a minimum speculate in the discussion as to why they think it might occur.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback on the localization of MARK2 at the Golgi. Due to the complexity and variability of this phenomenon, we decided to remove the related data from the current manuscript to maintain the rigor of our study. However, we have included a discussion of this phenomenon in the Discussion section (page 13, lines 31-39 and page 14, 1-6in the revised manuscript) and plan to further investigate it in future studies.</p><p>The localization of MARK2 at the Golgi was initially observed in experiments following serum starvation, where cells were fixed and stained (The data is not displayed). This observation was supported by the loss of Golgi localization in MARK2 knockdown cells, indicating the specificity of the antibody (The data is not displayed). However, this phenomenon was not consistently observed across all cells, likely due to its transient nature.We speculate that the localization of MARK2 to the Golgi depends on its activity and post-translational modifications. For example, phosphorylation at T595 has been reported to regulate the translocation of MARK2 from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm (Hurov et al., 2004). Serum starvation might induce modifications or conformational changes in MARK2, leading to its temporary Golgi localization. Additionally, we hypothesize that this localization may coincide with specific Golgi dynamics, such as the transition from dispersed to ribbon-like structures during cell migration.</p><p>We also acknowledge the inconsistency in the Results and Methods sections regarding serum starvation. We confirm that serum starvation was performed prior to fixation as an experimental condition, rather than as a blocking step in immunostaining. This clarification has been incorporated into the revised Methods section (page 24, lines 11-12).</p><p>We hope this clarification, along with our planned future studies, adequately addresses the reviewer’s concerns.

The authors should (1) image the cells live using eGFP-tagged MARK2 during serum starvation to show the dynamics of this localization, (2) image U2Os cells using the abcam ab136872 antibody +/- 2% serum starve. Two MARK2 antibodies are listed in Table 2. Does abcam (ab133724) show a similar localisation?</p><p>- The Golgi localization of MARK2 occurs in the absence of the T structural domain, but not when full length MARK2 is expressed. The authors conclude the T- domain is likely inhibitory. When combined with the requirement for serum starvation for this interaction to occur, the authors should clarify the physiological relevance of these observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for their valuable suggestions regarding the use of tools and methods and the physiological relevance of MARK2 localization to the Golgi. Regarding the question of how MARK2 itself localizes to the Golgi, we are currently unable to fully elucidate the underlying mechanism. Therefore, we have removed the discussion of MARK2’s Golgi localization from the manuscript to ensure scientific accuracy. However, Below, we provide our detailed response as soon as possible:</p><p>First, regarding the suggestion to use tools and methods developed by the Waterman lab to strengthen our findings, we have carefully evaluated their applicability. In our live-cell imaging experiments, we found that full-length MARK2 does not stably localize to the Golgi, even under serum starvation conditions. However, truncated MARK2 mutants lacking the Tail (T) domain exhibit robust Golgi localization. Furthermore, our immunofluorescence staining results indicate that the Spacer domain is the minimal region required for MARK2 localization at the Golgi. Based on these findings, we believe that live-cell imaging of EGFP-tagged full-length MARK2 may not effectively reveal the dynamics of its Golgi localization. However, we plan to focus on the truncated constructs in future studies to better explore the mechanisms underlying MARK2's dynamic behavior.</p><p>Regarding the use of the ab136872 antibody to stain U2OS cells with and without serum starvation, we note that the protocol described by the Waterman lab involves pre-fixation and permeabilization steps, which are not compatible with live-cell imaging. Additionally, we observed that MARK2 Golgi localization appears to be condition-dependent and may coincide with specific Golgi dynamics, such as transitions from dispersed stacks to intact ribbon structures. These events are likely brief and challenging to capture consistently. Nevertheless, we recognize the value of this experimental design and plan to adapt the staining conditions in future work to validate our results further. As for the ab133724 antibody listed in Table 2, we clarify that it has only been validated for Western blotting in our study and does not yield reliable results in immunofluorescence experiments. For this reason, all immunofluorescence staining in this study relied exclusively on ab136872. This distinction has been clarified in the revised Table 2 .</p><p>Regarding the hypothesis that the Tail domain of MARK2 is inhibitory, our observations showed that truncated MARK2 mutants lacking the T domain stably localized to the Golgi, whereas fulllength MARK2 did not. Literature evidence supports this hypothesis, as studies on the yeast homolog Kin2 indicate that the C-terminal region (including the Tail domain) binds to the Nterminal catalytic domain to inhibit kinase activity (Elbert et al., 2005). We speculate that serum starvation disrupts this intramolecular interaction, relieving the inhibition by the T domain, activating MARK2, and promoting its localization to the Golgi. Moreover, we hypothesize that the transient nature of MARK2 localization to the Golgi may be related to specific Golgi remodeling processes, such as the transition from dispersed stacks to intact ribbon structures during cell migration or polarity establishment.</p><p>References：</p><p>Elbert, M., Rossi, G., and Brennwald, P.

They find that CAMSAP2 S835A (non-phosphorylatable) was less capable of rescuing Golgi morphology than CAMSAP2 S835D (phosphomimetic). Golgi area has been measured to demonstrate this phenomenon. Representative immunofluorescence images in Fig. 4D appear to indicate that this is the case. However, quantification in Fig. 4E does not show significance between HA-CAMSAP2 and HA-CAMSAP2A that would support the initial claim. The authors could analyze other aspects of Golgi morphology (e.g. number of Golgi fragments, degree of dispersal around the nucleus) to capture the clear structural defects demonstrated in HACAMSAP2A cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback and for pointing out potential areas of improvement in our analysis of Golgi morphology. We apologize for any misunderstanding caused by our description of the results in Figure 4E.</p><p>The quantification indeed shows a significant difference between HA-CAMSAP2 and HACAMSAP2A in terms of Golgi area, as indicated in the figure by the statistical annotations (pvalue provided in the legend). To ensure clarity, we have revised the figure legend (page 32, lines 19-23 in the revised manuscript) to explicitly describe the statistical significance, and the method used for quantification.</p><p>Because the quantification indeed shows a significant difference between HA-CAMSAP2 and HA-CAMSAP2A in terms of Golgi area, and to maintain consistency throughout the manuscript, we did not further analyze other aspects of Golgi morphology.</p><p>We hope this clarification, along with the additional analyses, will address the reviewer’s concerns.

However, these studies lack comparison to WT-CAMSAP2 that would support the role of phosphorylated CAMSAP2 in reorienting the Golgi in this context.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for their insightful suggestion. In response, we have added a comparison between CAMSAP2 S835A/D and WT-CAMSAP2, in addition to HT1080 and MARK2 KO cells, to better evaluate the role of phosphorylated CAMSAP2 in Golgi reorientation.</p><p>The results, now shown in Figure 5A-C, indicate that in the absence of MARK2, there is no significant difference in Golgi reorientation between WT-CAMSAP2 and CAMSAP2 S835A. This observation supports the conclusion that MARK2-mediated phosphorylation of CAMSAP2 at S835 is essential for effective Golgi reorientation.</p><p>To enhance clarity, we have updated the corresponding Results section (page 9, lines 37-40 and page 10, line 1 in the revised manuscript) to describe this additional comparison.

They identified that both proteins interact together and that MARK2 phosphorylates CAMSAP2 on the residue S835. They show that the phosphorylation affects the localisation of CAMSAP2 at the Golgi apparatus and in turn influences the Golgi structure itself. Using the TurboID experimental approach, the author identified the USO1 protein as a protein that binds differentially to CAMSAP2 when it is itself phosphorylated at residue 835. Dissecting the molecular mechanisms controlling Golgi polarisation during cell migration is a highly complex but fundamental issue in cell biology and the author may have identified one important key step in this process. However, although the authors have made a genuine iconographic effort to help the reader understand their point of view, the data presented in this study appear sometimes fragile, lacking rigour in the analysis or over-interpreted. Additional analyses need to be conducted to strengthen this study and elevate it to the level it deserves.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for their thoughtful evaluation and recognition of our study's significance in understanding Golgi reorientation during cell migration. We appreciate the constructive feedback regarding data robustness, clarity, and interpretation. In response, we have conducted additional analyses, revised data presentation, and ensured cautious interpretation throughout the manuscript. These changes aim to address the reviewer’s concerns comprehensively and strengthen the scientific rigor of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments</p><p>In order to conclude as they do about the putative role of USO1, the authors need to perform a siRNA/CRISPR of USO1 to validate its role in anchoring CAMSAP2 to the Golgi apparatus in a MARK2 phosphorylation-dependent manner. In other words, does depletion of USO1 affect the recruitment of CAMSAP2 to the Golgi apparatus?</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for their insightful suggestion regarding the role of USO1 in anchoring CAMSAP2 to the Golgi apparatus. In response, we performed USO1 knockdown using siRNA and quantified the Pearson correlation coefficient of CAMSAP2 and GM130 colocalization in control and USO1-knockdown cells.</p><p>The results show that CAMSAP2 localization to the Golgi is significantly reduced in USO1knockdown cells, confirming that USO1 plays a critical role in recruiting CAMSAP2 to the Golgi apparatus. These results are now presented in Figures 6 E–G, and corresponding updates have been incorporated into the Results section (page 10, lines 36-37 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>We hope this additional experiment addresses the reviewer’s concern and strengthens our conclusions regarding the role of USO1.

To address the role of MARK2 in regulating CAMSAP2 localization to the Golgi apparatus, we overexpressed GFPMARK2 in cells and compared its effects on CAMSAP2 localization to the Golgi with control cells overexpressing GFP alone. Our results show that CAMSAP2 localization to the Golgi is significantly increased in GFP-MARK2-overexpressing cells, as shown in Supplementary Figures 3C and 3E. Corresponding updates have been incorporated into the Results section (page 8, lines 25-27 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Regarding the question of how MARK2 itself localizes to the Golgi, we are currently unable to fully elucidate the underlying mechanism. Therefore, we have removed the discussion of MARK2’s Golgi localization from the manuscript to ensure scientific accuracy. Consequently, we have not conducted experiments to assess the effects of CAMSAP2 overexpression on MARK2’s localization to the Golgi.</p><p>We hope this explanation clarifies the reviewer’s concerns.

They focused on the role of the microtubule minus-end binding protein CAMSAP2, which mediates the linkage between microtubules and the Golgi membrane. At first, they noticed that CAMSAP2 transiently lost Golgi colocalization during the initial phase of the wound healing process. They further found that the cell polarity-regulating kinase MARK2 binds and phosphorylates S835 of CAMSAP2, thereby enhancing the interaction between CAMSAP2 and the Golgi protein Uso1. Together with the phenotypes of CAMSAP2, MARK2, and Uso1 KO cells, these authors argue that the MARK2dependent phosphorylation of CAMSAP2 plays an important role in the reassembly and reorientation of the Golgi apparatus after a transient dispersion observed during the wound healing process.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for their thoughtful summary of our study and constructive feedback. Your comments have been invaluable in refining our research and enhancing the clarity and impact of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments</p><p>(1) The premise of this study was that during the wound healing process, the Golgi apparatus exhibits transient dispersion before reorientation to the front of the nucleus.</p><p>In the first place, this claim has not been well established in previous studies or this paper. Therefore, the authors should present a proof of this claim in a clearer manner.</p><p>To introduce this cellular event, the authors cite several papers in the introduction (page 4) and the results (page 6) sections. However, many papers cited are review articles, and some of them do not describe this change in the Golgi assembly structure before reorientation. Only two original articles discussed this phenomenon (Bisel et al. 2008 and Wu et al. 2016), and direct evidence was provided by only one paper (Wu et al. 2016) in which changes in the Golgi apparatus in wound-healing RPE1 cells were recorded by live imaging (Fig.7A in Wu et al. 2016).</p><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that this previous paper demonstrated that depletion of CAMSAP2 inhibits Golgi dispersion. Obviously, this conclusion is inconsistent with their statement to introduce this study (page4) that ‟This emphasizes CAMSAP2's role in sustaining Golgi integrity during critical cellular events like migration.&quot; In addition, it also contradicts the authors' model of the present paper (Fig. 6E), which argued that disruption of the Golgi association of CAMSAP2 facilitates the Golgi dispersion.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for their detailed comments and for providing us with the opportunity to clarify the premise and conclusions of our study. Below, we address the main concerns raised:</p><p>First, to provide direct evidence of Golgi apparatus changes during the wound-healing process, we conducted live-cell imaging experiments. Our observations, presented in revised Supplementary Figure 2A, clearly demonstrate that the Golgi apparatus exhibits a transient dispersion state before reorienting toward the leading edge of the nucleus during migration.</p><p>Regarding the interpretation of previous studies, we acknowledge the reviewer’s concerns about the citation of review articles. To address this, we have revisited the literature and clarified that the phenomenon of Golgi dispersion during reorientation has been directly demonstrated in Wu et al (Wu et al., 2016), where live imaging of wound-healing RPE1 cells showed this dynamic behavior. Furthermore, we note that in Wu et al paper explicitly demonstrates that CAMSAP2 depletion promotes Golgi dispersion, contrary to the reviewer’s interpretation that &quot;depletion of CAMSAP2 inhibits Golgi dispersion.&quot;</p><p>Our model focuses on the role of CAMSAP2 in restoring the Golgi from a transiently dispersed structure back to an intact ribbon-like structure during reorientation. Specifically, we propose that during this process, the disruption of CAMSAP2’s association with the Golgi affects this restoration, rather than directly promoting Golgi dispersion as suggested by the reviewer. We believe this distinction aligns with our data and the existing literature.</p><p>To strengthen the background of our study, we have revised the introduction and results sections (page 6, lines 6-13 and page 7, lines 1-17) to minimize reliance on review articles and have provided more explicit citations to original research papers. We hope this addresses the reviewer’s concern about the sufficiency of the cited literature.</p><p>We trust these clarifications and revisions resolve the reviewer’s concerns and enhance the robustness of our study. Once again, we are grateful for the reviewer’s constructive feedback, which has greatly helped refine our manuscript.

Specifically, we compared the band shifts observed in GST-MARK2 + GFP-CAMSAP2 versus GST + GFP-CAMSAP2 under identical conditions. As shown in Supplementary Figure 4B, the GST-MARK2 + GFP-CAMSAP2 group exhibited a clear upward band shift compared to the GST + GFP-CAMSAP2 group, indicating additional phosphorylation events induced by MARK2.</p><p>Regarding the inclusion of a kinase-dead MARK2 mutant as a negative control, we acknowledge this as a valuable suggestion for further confirming the specificity of MARK2 in phosphorylating CAMSAP2.

Specifically, in Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 5D (now Supplementary Figure 4C), we have replaced the abbreviation &quot;CS2&quot; with &quot;CAMSAP2&quot; and updated the mutant names from &quot;835A&quot; and &quot;589A&quot; to &quot;S835A&quot; and &quot;S589A,&quot; respectively.
