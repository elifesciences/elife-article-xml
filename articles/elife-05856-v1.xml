Moreover, gene expression noise would seem to impede the evolution of accurate gene regulation, and previous investigations have provided circumstantial evidence that natural selection has acted to lower noise levels. By evolving synthetic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> promoters de novo, we here show that, contrary to expectations, promoters exhibit low noise by default. Instead, selection must have acted to increase the noise levels of highly regulated <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters. We present a general theory of the interplay between gene expression noise and gene regulation that explains these observations. The theory shows that propagation of expression noise from regulators to their targets is not an unwanted side-effect of regulation, but rather acts as a rudimentary form of regulation that facilitates the evolution of more accurate regulation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05856.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05856.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05856.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are stretches of DNA that contain the instructions needed to make proteins and other molecules. By changing how much protein is produced from each gene (i.e., its expression), many organisms—including humans—can produce a wide variety of cell types with very different behaviors. Similarly, single-celled organisms, such as bacteria, can adapt to survive and grow in different environments by changing gene expression levels. It is thus thought that gene expression must be precisely controlled.</p><p>However, the molecular processes involved in gene expression are subject to random fluctuations, and so gene expression is inherently ‘noisy’. This means that even groups of identical cells in identical environments will show variation in their gene expression patterns. Furthermore, different genes show different levels of noise. The DNA sequence of a part of each gene, called the promoter, has a big effect on these noise levels. Consequently, gene expression noise is a genetically encoded trait, and can therefore be shaped by natural selection. But it remains largely unclear how natural selection has affected gene expression noise.</p><p>Now, Wolf et al. have carefully measured the gene expression noise of hundreds of synthetic promoters that were evolved in the laboratory from random DNA sequences, and a similar number of natural promoters in a bacterium called <italic>E. coli</italic>. These experiments revealed that, contrary to expectation, most lab-evolved promoters had low levels of noise. On the other hand, many natural promoters had high levels of noise. Wolf et al. also found that noisy promoters tend to be highly regulated by transcription factors: the proteins that control gene expression by binding to promoter regions. Together, these results imply that unregulated promoters start by having low noise as a default state. Selection pressures must then have caused some <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters to become regulated by transcription factors and raise their noise levels. But, what might these selection pressures have been?</p><p>Many genes need to be expressed at different levels in different conditions, and it is generally accepted that regulation by transcription factors evolves to ‘satisfy’ these requirements. However, transcription factors are themselves noisy, and this noise necessarily propagates to their target genes. Wolf et al. have now developed a general theory showing that this noise-propagation can often benefit an organism. This explains why natural selection can favor an increase in noise levels for regulated genes. Importantly, by showing that the main role of a transcription factor can be to increase the noise of its targets, it suddenly becomes very easy to see how new gene regulatory interactions can evolve from scratch. The next steps in understanding of how gene expression noise evolves will involve manipulating the expression noise of a gene, and measuring how selection acts on such changes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05856.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05856.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>gene expression noise</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>synthetic biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerische Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PZ00P3_126617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silander</surname><given-names>Olin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerische Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51RT-0_145680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Nimwegen</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In-lab evolution of synthetic promoters has revealed a novel general mechanism for de novo evolution of gene regulation, and highlights the crucial role of expression noise in this process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many studies over the last decade have established that, even within homogeneous environments, gene expression varies across genetically identical cells due to thermodynamic fluctuations in the molecular events underlying gene expression and the small numbers of molecules involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elowitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rao et al., 2002</xref>). This phenomenon is commonly referred to as ‘expression noise’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blake et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raser and O'Shea, 2005</xref>). Much progress has been gained in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying noise in gene expression, and noise in transcription in particular (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sanchez and Golding, 2013</xref>). In the simplest scenario, basic thermodynamic fluctuations and Brownian motion of the molecular players would cause transcription initiation at a given promoter to occur with a constant probability per unit time, and the corresponding mRNAs to decay with a constant probability per unit time, leading to a Poissonian steady-state distribution in the number of transcripts. Although such Poissonian fluctuations are observed for some genes, most genes exhibit much larger fluctuations in their mRNA copy number. It is generally believed that such increased variability originates in promoters stochastically switching between different states that are associated with different transcription initiation rates. In the simplest scenario, promoters stochastically switch between an ‘on’ and ‘off’ state, producing ‘bursts’ of transcript while in the on state, and this would lead to increased noise as has been well understood theoretically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kepler and Elston, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paulsson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shahrezaei and Swain, 2008</xref>). However, events such as the stochastic binding and unbinding of transcription factors (TFs), or modifications of the local chromatin state, would generally cause most promoters to switch between a much larger number of different states. Moreover, the extent of promoter state switching would be expected to depend on the specific promoter architecture. Indeed, several studies have shown that different promoters show different amounts of gene expression noise, and that these differences are, at least to some extent, encoded in the promoter sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Newman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hornung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silander et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones, et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, transcriptional noise is thus likely an evolvable trait that is subject to natural selection, but it is currently largely unclear how noise levels have been shaped by natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</xref>). On the one hand, it can be argued that in each condition there is an optimal expression level for each protein, such that variations away from this optimal level are detrimental to an organism's fitness, implying that selection will act to minimize noise. Indeed, by investigating the association between expression noise and various statistics that can be considered proxies of organismal fitness, several studies have provided evidence that selection generally acts to minimize noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Newman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barkai and Shilo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lehner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lehner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silander et al., 2012</xref>). In this interpretation, genes with lowest noise have been most strongly selected against noise, whereas high noise genes have experienced much weaker selection against noise. On the other hand, gene expression noise generates phenotypic diversity between organisms with identical genotypes, and there are well-established theoretical models showing that such phenotypic diversity can be selected for in fluctuating environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bull, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</xref>). In support of such theoretical models, a number of studies provided examples in which there is a positive association between expression noise and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). It is thus possible that some of the genes with elevated noise may have been selected for phenotypic diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to assess how natural selection has acted on the transcriptional noise of promoters, it is critical to determine what default noise levels would be exhibited by promoters that have <italic>not</italic> been selected for their noise properties. To address this, we evolved a large set of synthetic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> promoters de novo in the laboratory using an experimental protocol in which promoter sequences were selected on the basis of the mean expression level they conferred, while experiencing virtually no selection on their noise properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We synthesized a pool of random DNA sequences, 100–150 base pairs in length, and cloned these upstream of a sequence containing a strong ribosomal binding site and the open reading frame of green fluorescent protein (GFP). Beginning with a library of more than 1 million random promoter clones, we used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to select cells expressing specific levels of GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). After sorting, we used PCR mutagenesis to input more genetic variation into the library of promoters and repeated the sorting. After the initial FACS sort, this strategy of mutagenesis followed by FACS was repeated four times. The result was a genetically diverse collection of functional promoters that conferred expression close to a pre-specified target level. We selected a subset of 479 synthetic promoters from the third and fifth rounds of FACS selection, choosing equal numbers of promoters from each of six replicate lineages we evolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’). We then used flow cytometry, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silander et al., 2012</xref>), to measure the distribution of fluorescence levels per cell for each synthetic promoter, as well as for all native <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zaslaver et al., 2006</xref>). We used quantitative Western blotting to confirm that the mean fluorescence levels were directly proportional to GFP molecule numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>), which allowed us to express fluorescence levels in units of numbers of GFP molecules.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05856.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental evolution of functional promoters de novo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We created an initial library of approximately 10<sup>6</sup> unique synthetic promoters by cloning random nucleotide sequences, of approximately 100–150 base pairs (bp) in length, upstream of a strong ribosomal binding site followed by an open reading frame for GFP, as used to quantify the expression of native <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zaslaver et al., 2006</xref>), and transformed this library into a population of cells (‘Materials and methods’). We evolved populations of synthetic promoters by performing five rounds of selection and mutation on this library. In each round we used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to select 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells that lie within a gate comprising the 5% of the population closest in fluorescence to a given target level. Next, plasmids were isolated from the selected cells and PCR mutagenesis was used to introduce new genetic variation into the promoters. We then re-cloned the mutated promoters into fresh plasmids and transformed them into a fresh population of cells. We performed this evolutionary scheme on three replicate populations in which we selected for a target expression level equal to the median expression level (50th percentile) of all native <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters and three replicate populations in which we selected for a target expression level at the 97.5th percentile of all native promoters (referred to here as medium and high expression levels, respectively).

First, the only differences between the different constructs are the promoter sequence inserts. Consequently, the mRNAs of the different reporters are almost identical, varying only by the short sequence segment between the transcription start site and the constant part of the construct. Second, the reporters were constructed specifically to measure transcription, and feature a constant 5′ UTR part upstream of the start codon of the GFP gene, including a strong ribosomal binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zaslaver et al., 2006</xref>). Using qPCR we confirmed that protein levels were determined primarily by mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>). Because protein decay and dilution rates are identical for all reporters, this implies translation rates vary little across the reporters. Although we have not explicitly measured mRNA decay rates of the reporters, we presume that, because the mRNAs are nearly identical, and because translation rates vary little across the reporters, mRNA decay rates likely vary also only moderately across the reporters. Finally, we note that noise levels were reproducible across biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), and noise levels estimated using microscopy were consistent with those measured by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, although the differences in noise levels are likely due to differences in transcriptional noise, fluctuations in translation and dilution rates will also contribute to total noise levels that we observe. Indeed, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bar-Even et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Newman et al., 2006</xref>), we observed a systematic relationship between the mean and variance of expression levels of each promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In particular, we observed a strict lower bound on variance as a function of mean expression. This lower bound is well described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, green curve) by a simple model that incorporates background fluorescence, an intrinsic noise component which is proportional to the number of proteins produced per mRNA, and an extrinsic noise component which likely reflects overall fluctuations in transcription, translation, and dilution rates, that all reporters are subject to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taniguchi et al., 2010)</xref> (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>). We defined the <italic>excess noise</italic> of a promoter as its variance above and beyond this lower bound, allowing us to compare the noise levels of promoters with different means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>We found, surprisingly, that most of the synthetic promoters exhibited noise levels close to the minimal level exhibited by the native promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Additionally, a substantial fraction of native promoters exhibited excess noise levels significantly greater than the synthetic promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6 fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplements 6, 7</xref>). For example, only 26.1% of the synthetic promoters exhibited excess noise above 0.05, compared to 41.6% of the native <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters (p &lt; 7.7 × 10<sup>−10</sup>, hypergeometric test). Given that the synthetic promoters were evolved from random sequence fragments and had not been selected on their noise properties (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2">Appendix 2</xref>), we concluded that functional <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters should exhibit low excess noise levels by default. Importantly, this implies that the native promoters with elevated excess noise must have experienced selective pressures that caused them to increase their noise.</p><p>To understand how selection might have acted to increase noise, we first investigated whether excess noise was associated with other characteristics of the promoters. Previous studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> have shown that promoters with high noise tend to also show high expression plasticity, that is, large changes in mean expression level across environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Newman et al., 2006</xref>). Although we did not clearly observe this association in data from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silander et al., 2012</xref>), a recent re-analysis of this data did uncover a significant association between expression plasticity and noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Singh, 2013</xref>), which we confirmed using our present data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, we found that there is an equally strong relationship between excess noise and the number of regulators known to target the promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Salgado et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In particular, whereas the excess noise levels of promoters without known regulatory inputs are very similar to those of our synthetic promoters, promoters with one or more regulatory inputs have clearly elevated noise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The general association between elevated noise and gene regulation has recently been observed in eukaryotes as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sharon et al., 2014</xref>), and mutations that lower gene expression noise typically target TF binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hornung et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05856.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Promoters with elevated noise exhibit high expression plasticity and large numbers of regulatory inputs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Native promoters were sorted by their excess noise <italic>x</italic> and, as a function of a cut-off on <italic>x</italic> (horizontal axis), we calculated the mean and standard error (vertical axis) of the variation in mRNA levels across different experimental conditions (data from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genexpdb.ou.edu/">http://genexpdb.ou.edu/</ext-link>) of all promoters with excess noise larger than <italic>x</italic>.

We next aimed to develop a theoretical understanding of these two observations. Perhaps the simplest interpretation of the observation that natural selection must have increased the noise levels of some promoters is that these promoters were directly selected for increased noise. Several theoretical treatments have shown that phenotypic variability may be selectively beneficial when environments change in ways that cannot be accurately sensed or are too rapid for organisms to respond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bull, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haccou and Iwasa, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</xref>), with the phenotypic variability acting as a ‘bet hedging’ strategy. Thus, it is conceivable that selection has directly selected for increased noise as a bet hedging strategy for a subset of promoters, and more recent theoretical work shows that increasing gene expression noise may indeed increase population growth rates in some scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tanase-Nicola and ten Wolde, 2008</xref>). However, this interpretation does not explain the association between noise and regulation. On the contrary, one would naively expect that bet hedging strategies function as an alternative to gene regulation, that is, when implementing sensing and regulation would be either too difficult or too costly to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kussell and Leibler, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the general association between gene regulation and expression noise, using an analogy with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem from physics, it has been suggested that expression noise may be an unwanted but unavoidable side-effect of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lehner and Kaneko, 2011</xref>). Indeed, any regulator will have some noise in its expression or activity, and this noise will be propagated to its target genes. Consequently, this ‘noise-propagation’ effect will cause an increase in expression noise of the targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thattai and van Oudenaarden, 2001</xref>). Although noise-propagation is a plausible explanation for the general association between noise and regulation, its effects are detrimental to the accuracy of expression regulation, and one might thus expect natural selection to have acted to minimize its effects, for example, by minimizing the expression fluctuations in regulators. It would thus appear difficult to reconcile our observation that high noise promoters must have experienced selection to increase their noise levels with the assumption that selection has acted to minimize noise-propagation. Instead, our observations would be better explained by a scenario in which noise-propagation is positively selected for.</p><p>To clarify these observations, we developed a general theoretical model for quantifying how selection acts on gene regulatory interactions. In particular, the model calculates the effect on fitness of evolving a new regulatory interaction between a given gene and a given regulator, as a function of properties of the regulator, and the way selection acts on the gene's expression levels. As explained in ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref>, we derive that, under relatively mild assumptions, the fitness effects of a new regulatory interaction can be calculated analytically, and depend on only a few effective parameters. To explain this general model, we illustrate it using a simple scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05856.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A model of the evolution of gene expression regulation in a variable environment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression distribution of an unregulated promoter (blue curve) and selected expression ranges in three different environments, that is, the red, gold, and green dashed curves show fitness as a function of expression level in these environments.

In its natural habitat, the population experiences a number of different environments <italic>e</italic> that may require the gene to express at different levels and we assume that the fitnes of an individual cell, that is, its growth or survival rate, is a function of its gene expression state. Indeed, recent work has confirmed that expression fluctuations in single cells can affect their instantaneous growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kiviet et al., 2014</xref>). In the simple scenario of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we assume there is an optimal level <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> in each environment, and that cells with expression levels within a certain range <italic>τ</italic> around this optimum are selected. As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> assumes there are three environments (red, gold, and green), with the green environment requiring up-regulation of the expression and the red environment requiring down-regulation of the expression. The fitness in each environment corresponds to the fraction of cells with expression levels within the selected range, that is, the unregulated promoter has reasonably high fitness in the gold environment but very low fitness in the green and red environments. Since the overall fitness is the product of the fitness in each environment, a poor overlap between the expression distribution and selected range in any one environment leads to low overall fitness. In our model, the mismatch between the actual and desired expression levels is quantified by the ‘expression mismatch’ <italic>Y</italic>, where <italic>Y</italic><sup>2</sup> = var(<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>)/(<italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup> + <italic>τ</italic><sup>2</sup>) is the variance in the desired expression levels <italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> across environments relative to the sum of the variances of the fitness function <italic>τ</italic><sup>2</sup> and the expression distribution <italic>σ</italic><sup>2</sup> (<italic>Y</italic> ≈ 4 for the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>We now consider evolving a regulatory interaction between the promoter and a given regulator. We assume that, in each environment <italic>e</italic>, the regulator's expression, or more generally its activity, will have some average level <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>. Coupling the promoter to the regulator will have two effects. First, the mean expression of the gene in each environment will become correlated with the mean activity of the regulator.

This is the typical way in which we think about gene regulation and we will call this effect on the gene's mean expression the ‘condition-response’ effect.

Interestingly, coupling to a noisy regulator whose activity is entirely uncorrelated with the desired expression levels (blue dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,H</xref>) also substantially increases fitness. In this regime, the increased fitness results exclusively from the noise-propagation mechanism, and by coupling to the regulator the promoter effectively implements a bet hedging strategy.</p><p>Surprisingly, coupling to the uncorrelated noisy regulator (blue dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,H</xref>) outperforms coupling to a moderately correlated regulator (magenta dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,G</xref>). To understand how coupling to a regulator with moderate correlation <italic>R</italic> = 0.64 can be outperformed by coupling to a regulator with no correlation <italic>R</italic> = 0, we calculated the optimal signal-to-noise <italic>S</italic> as a function of its correlation <italic>R</italic> (red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This shows that the magenta regulator has too large an <italic>S</italic> for its correlation, that is, increasing the noise of this TF would result in an increase of the promoter's noise, and this would in turn lead to an increase in fitness in the green and gold conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This illustrates that regulators may generally be under selection to become noisy themselves. To the left of the red curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, noise-propagation is too large and the increased noise of the targets can be considered a detrimental side-effect of regulation. In contrast, to the right of the red curve, noise-propagation is too small, that is, increasing the noise of the regulator would improve fitness.</p><p>Most interestingly, the red curve corresponds to a continuum of regulatory strategies in which the condition-response and noise-propagation effects are optimally acting in concert, going from being dominated by noise-propagation in the lower left, to being dominated by the condition-response in the top right. Importantly, this clarifies how accurate regulation can evolve smoothly from a state without regulation. Highly accurate regulation with high <italic>R</italic> and <italic>S</italic> can be reached by starting from coupling to a noisy regulator with low <italic>R</italic> and <italic>S</italic>, whose benefits come entirely from the noise-propagation, and then increasing both <italic>R</italic> and <italic>S</italic> in incremental steps along this continuum of regulatory strategies.</p><p>We now discuss how this theoretical model helps us interpret our experimental observations. First, our model predicts that the selective pressure for a promoter to evolve regulatory interactions is determined by the expression mismatch <italic>Y</italic>. When <italic>Y</italic> &lt; 1, even a constitutively expressed promoter has a good overlap with the fitness function across all conditions, and there will be no selective pressure to evolve regulation. Our synthetic promoters, which were selected for expressing at a constant level, correspond to this situation, and our results show that such promoters have low noise by default. Thus, we interpret the observation that native promoters without known regulatory inputs have noise levels similar to those of our synthetic promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) as indicating that constitutive promoters have low noise by default.</p><p>In the interpretation of our model, the promoters with elevated noise were those in which selection required their expression levels to vary significantly across environments, that is, for which <italic>Y</italic> ≫ 1. How much expression noise a given promoter is likely to evolve depends on its value of its expression mismatch <italic>Y</italic>, and the values of the correlations <italic>R</italic> and signal-to-noise <italic>S</italic> of the regulators that are available in the genome. Since the precise environmental conditions that <italic>E. coli</italic> experiences in the wild, and how these determine optimal expression levels of its genes, are largely unknown, it is not possible to make quantitative predictions of the expected noise levels of specific promoters using our model. However, our model can be used to understand the general qualitative trends observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>First, our model explains why there is a general correlation between expression noise and expression plasticity. Since regulators affect the expression of their targets in a linear manner, coupling a promoter to a combination of different regulators is equivalent to coupling the promoter to a single ‘effective regulator’ whose expression distribution is a linear combination of the expression distributions of the individual regulators. Assuming that coupling to such a linear combination of regulators can attain a correlation <italic>R</italic> with the desired expression levels of the gene, our model predicts that noise-propagation will be selected whenever <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>; that is, whenever the expression mismatch <italic>Y</italic> is large enough, noise-propagation will be beneficial. If we additionally assume that selection has tuned the signal-to-noise of the regulators to optimize the amount of noise-propagation, then the final noise level of the promoter is predicted to equal <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>tot</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>var</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app3">Appendix 3</xref>). This expression can be interpreted as saying that, of the original mismatch <italic>Y</italic><sup>2</sup>, a fraction <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>Y</italic><sup>2</sup> is accounted for by the condition-response, whereas the remaining fraction (1 − <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic>Y</italic><sup>2</sup> is accounted for by the noise-propagation. This implies that both the expression plasticity, which is given by the variance in the promoter's mean across conditions (i.e., <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>Y</italic><sup>2</sup>), and the noise level (i.e., (1 − <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic>Y</italic><sup>2</sup>) are proportional to the original expression mismatch <italic>Y</italic><sup>2</sup>. Our model thus predicts that the expression plasticity and noise level should be correlated.</p><p>Our model also predicts a general positive correlation between expression noise and the number of regulatory inputs. Starting from a high expression mismatch <italic>Y</italic>, each new regulatory interaction will reduce the mismatch from <italic>Y</italic> to <italic>Y</italic>′ &lt; <italic>Y</italic> by a combination of the condition-response effect reducing the average deviations from the desired levels, and the noise-propagation increasing the overlap by virtue of increasing the expression noise. Whenever <italic>Y</italic>′ is still larger than 1, the promoter will be under selective pressure to evolve further regulatory interactions. In this way, the higher the initial mismatch <italic>Y</italic>, the larger the expected number of regulatory interactions that will be necessary to reduce the mismatch below 1; that is, our model generally predicts that the number of regulatory interactions, the expression plasticity, and the final noise all correlate with the original mismatch <italic>Y</italic>.</p><p>Finally, since in our model elevated noise levels are due to noise-propagation per definition, it trivially predicts that, the larger the number of regulatory inputs, the larger the final noise levels tends to be. More specifically, our model predicts that, in a given condition, the noise level of a promoter is determined by the noise levels of the TFs that regulate it. To test this prediction, we used a very simple linear model that assumes that the excess noise level of a gene is equal to the sum of the noise levels of the TFs that regulate it (‘Materials and methods’). Although this simple model is very crude, that is, assuming noise-propagation to be of equal size for all targets of a given TF, and assuming that fluctuations in TF activities are all independent, it was nevertheless able to explain a substantial fraction of the variance in excess noise levels across promoters (17%). The top five TFs most significantly associated with elevated noise levels of their targets were CRP, H-NS, ArcA, ilvY, and GadX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Of these, GadX and H-NS were also identified, using a simpler method, in the data of our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silander et al., 2012</xref>). The appearance of H-NS is interesting since it is a histone-like nucleoid-associated protein that acts as a silencer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorman, 2004</xref>), that is, somewhat analogous to the role of nucleosomes in eukaryotes, and in eukaryotes nucleosome positioning at promoters has been shown to be a major determinant of transcriptional noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tirosh and Barkai, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cairns, 2009</xref>). The TFs ArcA and GadX are involved with responses to low oxygen and acid stress, respectively, and it is plausible that these TFs may be partially activated in the conditions in which our experiments are performed. Our cells are grown in M9 minimal media with glucose in micro-titer plates, and measurements are taken late in the exponential phase. It is well-known that in micro-titer plates oxygen limitation can become a major stress late in the exponential phase, and this may result in the activation of fermentation reactions which in turn cause acid stress. The appearance of CRP is consistent with our observation in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silander et al. (2012)</xref> that promoters of genes involved in carbon metabolism are over-represented among high noise promoters. In summary, modeling of excess noise levels in terms of known regulatory interactions shows that, in accordance with our model, a substantial amount of the variation in noise levels can be explained by noise-propagation from noisy regulators, and the regulators we identify as most significantly propagating noise are consistent with existing biological knowledge regarding our growth conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Because genotype-phenotype relationships for complex phenotypic traits are poorly understood, it is often difficult to assess how observable variation in a particular trait has been affected by natural selection. Here we have shown that, by comparing naturally observed variation in a particular trait with variation observed in synthetic systems that were evolved under well-controlled selective conditions, definite inferences can be made about the selection pressures that have acted on the natural systems. In particular, by evolving synthetic <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters de novo using a procedure in which promoters are strongly selected on their mean expression and not on their expression noise, we have shown that native promoters must have experienced selective pressures that increased their noise levels, and that promoters with elevated noise are highly regulated by TFs.</p><p>To account for this, we have developed a theoretical model that provides a simple mechanistic framework for understanding how selection acts on regulatory interactions. The key ingredient of the model is that it recognizes that a regulatory interaction affects the target's expression in two separate ways: the condition-response effect through which the mean expression of the target becomes a function of the mean activity of the regulator, and the noise-propagation effect through which the noise of the target is increased in proportion to the noise of the regulator. Our model elucidates that not only the condition-response effect but also the noise-propagation effect is often a <italic>functional</italic> consequence of the regulatory interaction; that is, instead of being just an unavoidable side-effect of regulation, noise-propagation is often beneficial and can be considered to act as a rudimentary form of regulation. Our framework vastly expands the evolutionary conditions under which novel regulatory interactions can evolve. Instead of assuming that regulators and their targets must evolve in a tightly coordinated fashion, noise-propagation alone may provide a sufficient benefit for a new regulatory interaction to evolve. This regulation can then be smoothly mutated along a continuum in which noise-propagation and condition-response are acting in concert, slowly lowering noise, and increasing the accuracy of the condition-response, eventually leading to highly accurate regulation. In this way our model provides a plausible scenario for how accurate regulatory interactions can evolve de novo from a state without regulation. Finally, our model shows that unless regulation is very precise, regulatory interactions that act to increase noise are beneficial. Thus, elevated levels of expression noise can be expected whenever the accuracy of regulation is limited.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Ab initio</italic> promoter library construction from random sequences</title><p>We obtained chemically synthesized nucleotide sequences of random nucleotides 200 bp in length (Purimex, Germany). Each sequence had defined 5′ and 3′ ends to allow PCR amplification. Within these constant regions, restriction sites for BamHI and XhoI were present. The intervening sequence was made up of 157 bp of random nucleotides (5′-CCTTTCGTCTTCACCTCGAG-(N157)-GGGATCCTCTGGATGTAAGAAGG-3′). However, as coupling of base pairs during oligonucleotide synthesis is not always successful and strand breaks can frequently occur in long oligonucleotides, many oligonucleotides were shorter than 200 bp in length. We used PCR to generate double-stranded DNA from the single-stranded oligonucleotides using forward and reverse primers matching the defined 5′ and 3′ ends. We gel-purified the double-stranded PCR product and double-digested it using BamHI and XhoI. After column purification, sequences were ligated into a version of the low-copy plasmid pUA66, which contains a gfpmut2 open reading frame downstream of a strong ribosomal binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zaslaver et al., 2006</xref>).

For each of these reference genes, the mean fluorescence level was measured and a selection gate was constructed, centered on this mean expression level, such that 5% of all clones in the population fell within the gate. For each round of selection, we sorted 200,000 cells contained within this gate. Sorted cells were then transferred to 4 ml Luria Broth (LB) media (containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin) and grown overnight.

We amplified the promoter sequences from these plasmids using the GeneMorph II Random Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) with the primers referred to previously that matched the defined regions of the promoters. We used 0.01 ng of DNA as starting material and 35 cycles for amplification. This resulted in a mutation rate of around 0.01 per bp (such that we expect that, in 200 bp, 95% of the promoters will contain between zero and four mutations). These PCR products were then digested with XhoI and BamHI, ligated back into the vector, and again transformed into DH10B cells.

(2012)</xref>, identifying approximately 5000 cells most similar in forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC). We then calculated the mean and variance in log-fluorescence using these cells, using a Bayesian procedure that accounts for outliers (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>). We randomly selected 479 promoters from the evolved set (72 medium expressers and 72 high expressers after three rounds of selection; 168 medium expressers and 167 high expressers after five rounds of selection) and quantified mean and variance in fluorescence. We used the same measurement procedures to calculate mean and variance for all promoters contained in a library of <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters also placed upstream of the gfpmut2 open reading frame on the pUA66 plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zaslaver et al., 2006</xref>). We refer to the promoters from this library as native <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters. For 288 promoters, we quantified fluorescence in three independent cultures and found that both mean and variance in expression were reproducible across replicate biological experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, we sequenced 378 sequences from our set of 479 promoter sequences, which showed that even after five rounds of selection, the promoters were quite diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To confirm the sensitivity and accuracy of the FACS measurements, we selected 10 promoters and used fluorescence microscopy to measure their mean and variance in fluorescence. The cells were grown in the same conditions described above, placed on 1% agarose pad, and images were obtained using a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (Photometrics) connected to a DeltaVision Core microscope (Applied Precision) with a UPlanSApo 100×/1.40 oil objective (Olympus). Image-processing was done in soft-WoRx v3.3.6 (Applied Precision) and fluorescence values were extracted based on DIC image-mediated cell detection in MicrobeTracker Suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sliusarenko et al., 2011</xref>). For each cell, we calculated fluorescence per cell volume by summing all pixel values and dividing by the volume of the cell as estimated by MicrobeTracker. Cells undergo substantial phenotypic changes when they are put on agar, including changes in the distribution of cell sizes. Consequently, it is problematic to compare absolute variance measurements directly between FACS and microscope. We therefore compared the relative noise levels of different promoters. The 10 selected native promoters consist of five pairs with almost identical mean expression values (as measured by FACS) but with noise levels that vary by different amounts. For each of the five pairs we calculated the ratio of the noise levels of the higher and the lower noise promoter as measured by both FACS and the microscope. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, with the exception of one pair of promoters that showed almost equal noise levels in FACS but a 50% difference in noise in the microscope, all other pairs showed good correlation of the relative noise levels in FACS and in the microscope, confirming that relative noise levels are similar in FACS and microscope measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantitative Western analysis</title><p>To determine the correspondence between fluorescence intensities and absolute GFP numbers per cell, eight individual promoter clones were grown in three biological replicates using the same media conditions as in the experimental evolution.

Of the 1816 promoter fragments, 1718 could be unambiguously associated with a gene that was immediately downstream, and the 1718 promoter fragments were associated with 1137 different downstream genes (for some genes there were multiple or repeated upstream promoter fragments). We used the operon annotations of RegulonDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Salgado et al., 2013</xref>) to extract, for each promoter, the set of additional downstream genes that are part of the same operon as the first downstream gene. We obtained known regulatory interactions between TFs and genes from RegulonDB and counted, for each <italic>E. coli</italic> gene, the number of TFs known to regulate the gene. We defined the number of regulatory inputs of a promoter to equal the average of the number of inputs for all genes in the operon downstream of the promoter. We sorted promoters by their excess noise and, as a function of a cut-off on excess noise level, calculated the mean and standard error of the number of regulatory inputs for all promoters with excess noise level above the cut-off. We obtained genome-wide gene expression measurements from the Gene Expression Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genexpdb.ou.edu/">http://genexpdb.ou.edu/</ext-link>). For each <italic>E. coli</italic> gene, we obtained 240 log fold-change values <italic>x</italic> corresponding to the logarithm of the expression ratio of the gene in a perturbed and a reference condition. We defined the variance in expression of a gene as the average of <italic>x</italic><sup>2</sup> across the 240 experiments. We again sorted promoters by their excess noise and, as a function of a cut-off on excess noise level, calculated the mean and standard error of gene expression variances for all promoters with excess noise above the cut-off.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Fitting excess noise levels in terms of regulatory interactions</title><p>Using the RegulonDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Salgado et al., 2013</xref>), we constructed a binary matrix <bold>R</bold> of regulatory interactions, where the components <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>pr</italic></sub> = 1 when regulator <italic>r</italic> is known to target promoter <italic>p</italic>, and <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>pr</italic></sub> = 0 otherwise.

The qPCR procedure uses a standard reference curve which allows it to infer the absolute number of molecules of the mRNA of interest in the input sample. Each input sample is created by extracting RNA from a certain number of cells (which we can estimate approximately), and reverse transcribing this RNA into cDNA. Unfortunately, both the total amount of cells used, as well as the efficiency of the reverse transcription, can fluctuate significantly outside of our control, and this will make the total number of molecules detected fluctuate as well. To control for this, we always quantify the absolute number of molecules of two types of mRNAs in parallel for each sample: the mRNAs of the gene of interest and the mRNAs of a reference gene which we are confident is constantly expressed. The reference gene we used was <italic>ihfB</italic>.</p><p>For each promoter of interest <italic>p</italic>, we obtained measured mRNA molecule numbers together with mRNA molecule numbers for the reference gene in three separate biological replicates and in three technical replicates for each biological replicate, that is, nine pairs of measurements in total. We denote the log-quantity of the mRNA of promoter <italic>p</italic> in biological replicate <italic>r</italic> and technical replicate <italic>i</italic> as <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>pri</italic></sub>, and the log-quantity of the reference gene in the same replicate as <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>pri</italic></sub> (note that this depends on the promoter <italic>p</italic> because these quantities come from a common sample). To estimate a single log-ratio <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> − <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> between the expression of the gene of interest and the reference gene, we will proceed as follows. First, we will integrate the data from the technical replicates to obtain biological replicate expression <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>pr</italic></sub> and <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>pr</italic></sub>. We then combine the differences <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>pr</italic></sub> = <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>pr</italic></sub> − <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>pr</italic></sub> across the biological replicates to obtain the final <italic>d</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> = <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub> − <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>.</p><p>The statistical model that we use assumes that the difference between the value <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>pri</italic></sub> measured in technical replicate <italic>i</italic> and the true expression <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>pr</italic></sub> is Gaussian distributed with mean zero and an unknown variance <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf41"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Note that we assume that this ‘noise’ is the same for all promoters <italic>p</italic>, but may fluctuate between biological replicates.

We assume that there is a small fraction of measurements that failed in some way, giving erroneous measurement values. To take this into account we will use a mixture model that assumes a small fraction of the measurements come from a uniform distribution that spans the observed range of the data.</p><p>Let <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> = max<sub><italic>p</italic>, <italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>pri</italic></sub>) − min<sub><italic>p</italic>, <italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>pri</italic></sub>) denote the range of observed values in biological replicate <italic>r</italic>, and let <italic>ρ</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> denote the fraction of measurements in replicate <italic>r</italic> that are meaningful, that is, not erroneous.

In the minimal media with glucose in which our cells are grown, the doubling time is more than 30 min, so that the protein decay is indeed smaller than the mRNA decay rate by a factor of approximately 6. Since this is not a very large factor, one may worry that, for stable mRNAs, the approximation breaks down. Fortunately, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shahrezaei and Swain (2008)</xref> it was also shown (by simulation) that, as long as the mRNA decay rate is at least as large as the protein decay rate, then the approximation is still quite accurate.

Second, we do not observe promoters with high excess noise, even though their fitness would easily allow it. For example, a promoter with mean expression near the optimum 8.11 but excess noise as high as 0.25 (i.e., significantly higher than observed for any of the clones) would have higher fitness than any promoter with mean less than <italic>μ</italic> = 7.76 or larger than <italic>μ</italic> = 8.47 (independent of their noise), and we do observe many promoters with means that deviate this far from the optimum. The fact that we do not observe high excess noise promoters, even though they would not be selected against, strongly suggests that such high noise promoters are uncommon a priori, that is, among all random sequences that drive expression at a medium level, the large majority have low excess noise levels and high noise promoters are rare. Moreover, note also that, for promoters that are not near the optimum, the optimal excess noise level is typically <italic>larger</italic> than those of the observed clones, for example, the optimal excess noise for a promoter with mean <italic>μ</italic> = 7.5 is <italic>η</italic> = 0.22.

However, given the limited number of clones involved, the change in excess noise levels is only marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004 in a t-test). Similarly, the effect of selection on excess noise levels seems to be opposite on the populations of round 3 and round 5 (center and right panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">Appendix 2—figure 5</xref>). We suspect that there are some systematic experimental fluctuations that make measured excess noise levels vary across days, and that the observed distributions of excess noise levels are more a reflection of experimental variability than of true shifts in the distribution. Importantly, excess noise levels larger than 0.1, which are observed for a substantial fraction of native promoters, are very rare for all these populations.</p><p>In summary, our in-depth analysis of the FACS fitness function and the effects of selection show that the noise properties of the synthetic promoters have not been significantly shaped by selection. Already the synthetic promoters at the third round of selection are tightly concentrated in a low noise band, even though selection does not select against noise, and promoters with mean away from the optimum would benefit from having higher noise. Two additional rounds of mutation and selection on the promoters from the third round do not substantially change the distribution of noise levels, confirming that there are no substantial fitness differences among promoters with different noise. Similarly, performing additional rounds of selection (be it very stringent, normal, or lenient) also does not substantially change the observed noise levels of the selected promoters. Thus, our results show that promoters selected from a large collection of random sequences naturally display low noise levels. Importantly, this implies that the native promoters with substantially higher noise levels must have experienced some selective pressures that caused them to increase their noise.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="app3"><title>Appendix 3</title><boxed-text><sec id="s8" sec-type="appendix"><title>A simple model for the evolution of gene regulation and expression noise</title><p>Given a particular environment, the fitness, for example, growth rate or survival probability of a cell, depends on the expression level of its genes. Note that the fact that gene regulatory mechanisms have evolved already demonstrates that different environments require different gene expression patterns, that is, expressing a gene at the ‘wrong’ level for a given environment has negative effects on fitness/growth rate.

This result is equivalent to results on selection for phenotypic variance obtained previously (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bull, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haccou and Iwasa, 1995</xref>). However, in these previous models that more abstractly considered ‘phenotypic traits’, it was assumed that both the mean and variance of the phenotypic trait were not only directly encoded by the genotype but could also be independently altered through mutations, without explicitly considering how mean and variance would be encoded in the genotype. In our case, where the ‘trait’ under study is the transcription rate of a promoter, it is a priori quite clear how mutations may alter mean levels, for example, through changes in the affinity of the sigma-factor binding site, but much less clear how the variance is encoded in the genotype. Moreover, rather than simply increasing its noise, we would naturally expect that promoters would evolve gene regulation in order to deal with different required expression levels across different environments.</p><sec id="s8-1"><title>Including gene regulation</title><p>We now further extend the model by considering that there are various transcriptional regulators in the cell whose activities may vary across the different environments <italic>e</italic>.

However, the absolute value of the fitness increase is small, that is, for small <italic>Y</italic>, promoters already have reasonably high fitness without regulation. As the value of <italic>Y</italic> increases, the log-fitness values start varying more dramatically as a function of <italic>R</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. Independent of the value of <italic>Y</italic>, the optimal fitness is always obtained for very high <italic>R</italic> and high <italic>S</italic>. In this regime the regulators are very accurate (high <italic>S</italic>) and correlate very well with the desired expression levels of the promoters (high <italic>R</italic>). In this regime the noise-propagation is very small and the condition-response effect of the regulator is high, that is, as expected, the most optimal solution is a very accurate regulation in which all benefits of the regulation stem from the condition-response effect. However, when <italic>Y</italic> is large, an almost equally high fitness can be obtained by coupling to a ‘noisy’ regulator with low <italic>S</italic> and <italic>R</italic> = 0 in the bottom left of the plots. In this regime the condition-response effect is small and noise-propagation is large, and the benefits of the regulatory interaction stem solely from the noise-propagation, that is, by coupling to the noisy regulator a bet hedging strategy is implemented. Notably, when <italic>Y</italic> is large, only regulators with very high correlation <italic>R</italic> and large signal-to-noise <italic>S</italic> can outcompete coupling to an entirely noisy regulator with <italic>R</italic> = 0 and small <italic>S</italic>; that is, to outcompete noise-propagation, the condition-response effect has to be highly accurate. In other words, unless a regulator is available that very precisely regulates the promoter to attain its desired expression levels, best fitness can often be obtained through noise-propagation.</p><p>Note also that, whenever <italic>Y</italic> is larger than 1 and the correlation <italic>R</italic> is not very high, fitness generally decreases rapidly with the signal-to-noise of the regulator; that is, when a regulator has only moderate correlation with the desired expression levels of its target, low signal-to-noise is preferred. This suggests that regulators that are regulating targets whose desired expression levels correlate only moderately with the regulator's activity may be under selection for <italic>lowering</italic> their signal-to-noise ratios.</p><p>To illustrate the selection on the signal-to-noise level of the regulator, the red curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Appendix 3—figure 3</xref> show the optimal signal-to-noise <italic>S</italic><sub>*</sub> as a function of the correlation <italic>R</italic>. To the left of these lines the signal-to-noise is too low, that is, the regulator is too noisy, and fitness can be increased making the regulator more accurate. In this regime the noise-propagation is a detrimental side-effect of the regulatory interaction. For each value of <italic>Y</italic> there is a critical value of <italic>R</italic> where the optimal signal-to-noise <italic>S</italic><sub>*</sub> diverges. Above this critical value of <italic>R</italic> the noise-propagation is always detrimental. However, unless <italic>Y</italic> is close to 1, this critical value of <italic>R</italic> is generally very high.</p><p>To the right of the red curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Appendix 3—figure 3</xref> the accuracy of the regulator is too high for its correlation <italic>R</italic>, and fitness could be improved by increasing the noise of the regulator. In this regime the noise-propagation is not large enough. Interestingly, the red curve thus corresponds to a continuum of regulatory strategies where the condition-response and noise-propagation are optimally acting in concert. This suggests a plausible scenario for evolving accurate regulation de novo from a state without regulation. Initially, a promoter can couple to a noisy regulator whose activities do not correlate at all with the desired expression levels of the promoters. Due to the noise-propagation, this coupling may already be beneficial. Once the regulatory interaction exists, the coupling strength, the activity profile of the regulator, and its noise level can be slowly mutated so as to increase both the correlation <italic>R</italic> and signal-to-noise <italic>S</italic> along the red curve, leading finally to accurate regulation where the condition-response effect dominates.</p><p>These considerations also suggest different possible scenarios for the joint evolution of multiple promoters and their regulators. On the one hand, when a regulator is coupled to a single promoter or a set of promoters whose desired expression levels are perfectly correlated across environments, it can increase overall fitness by increasing the correlation <italic>R</italic> between the regulator's activities and the desired expression levels of its targets. In this way, regulation may evolve to become more precise over time. On the other hand, promoters may often have an incentive to couple to regulators that only moderately correlate with their desired levels. Once a regulator is coupled to multiple promoters that have different desired expression levels, there is no way that the regulator can adapt its activities to correlate highly with the desired levels of all its targets, and such regulators will experience selection to become more noisy.</p></sec><sec id="s8-4"><title>Final noise levels under optimal coupling and signal-to-noise</title><p>We next consider what final noise levels <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf117"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>tot</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> result when a promoter, with a certain expression mismatch <italic>Y</italic>, couples optimally to a regulator which has a certain correlation <italic>R</italic>, and whose signal-to-noise level has been optimized as well.</p><p>To this end we need to determine the jointly optimal coupling <italic>X</italic><sub>*</sub> and signal-to-noise <italic>S</italic><sub>*</sub> given a certain expression mismatch <italic>Y</italic> and correlation <italic>R</italic>.

In other words, the evolved transcriptional noise level of a promoter precisely reflects to what extent the promoter's regulation is not able to track the expression levels desired by the environment.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the total noise level <italic>σ</italic><sub>tot</sub> as a function of <italic>Y</italic> and <italic>R</italic> when the promoter is optimally coupled to a regulator with optimal signal-to-noise. The figure illustrates that there are two regimes of solutions (‘phases’) separated by a phase boundary (thick black curve) that occurs at (1 − <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic>Y</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1. On one side of this boundary, in the top left of the figure, the final noise level <italic>σ</italic><sub>tot</sub> is essentially not different from the original noise level <italic>σ</italic>. This occurs either when <italic>Y</italic> &lt; 1, that is, when no regulation is necessary, or when very accurate regulation is available. Note that, similarly to what we saw in the last section, very high correlations <italic>R</italic> are necessary to realize this regime at larger values of <italic>Y</italic>. We call this the ‘basal noise regime’.</p><p>The largest part of the parameter space occurs on the other side of the phase boundary, which we call the ‘environment-driven noise regime’. Here the final noise level <italic>σ</italic><sub>tot</sub> becomes independent of the original noise <italic>σ</italic>, but is instead determined by the fraction of variation in desired expression levels var(<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) that is not tracked by the condition-response, that is, by (1 − <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) var(<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>). The figure also indicates the optimal values of <italic>S</italic><sub>*</sub> as a function of <italic>Y</italic> and <italic>R</italic>. The optimal signal-to-noise <italic>S</italic><sub>*</sub> diverges at the phase boundary, that is, in the basal noise regime, regulators are preferred with signal-to-noise that is as high as possible. In contrast, for the majority of the parameter space in the environment-driven noise regime, signal-to-noise levels of 1 or less are preferred, that is, unless regulation is very precise, noisy regulators are typically preferred over precise regulators.</p><p>The figure also demonstrates that, unless <italic>R</italic> is close to 1, the final noise increases with the variance in desired expression levels var(<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>). Thus, unless there is a systematic correlation between the expression mismatch <italic>Y</italic> of a promoter and the correlation of the regulator with highest available correlation, noise levels are expected to increase with the ‘plasticity’ var(<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) that the environment requires of the promoters.</p><p>Similarly, the larger <italic>Y</italic>, the larger the remaining variance Y′<sup>2</sup> = (1 − <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic>Y</italic><sup>2</sup> tends to be after coupling to the regulator with the highest available correlation <italic>R</italic>. Whenever this remaining expression mismatch is <italic>Y</italic>′ large, the promoter will have an incentive to couple to further regulators, that is, the theory also generally predicts that promoters with high var(<italic>μ</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) tend to couple to more regulators.</p><p>Finally, we note that this theoretical model can easily be extended to the case of multiple promoters and regulators. In particular, because in our model the promoter's expression is a linear function of the regulatory inputs, the theory extends easily to promoters coupling to multiple regulators with different coupling constants. However, the regulatory network structure that will evolve in this general case will depend crucially on the correlation structure of the desired expression levels across all the promoters. Moreover, there might be many environmental changes that affect the optimal expression levels but that cannot be sensed by any of the regulators, and this will constrain the extent to which regulators can optimize their activities to match the desired levels of their targets. We intend to pursue such analyses in future work.</p></sec></sec></boxed-text></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="article-commentary" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05856.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Golding</surname><given-names>Ido</given-names></name><role>Reviewing editor</role><aff><institution>Baylor College of Medicine</institution>, <country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>eLife posts the editorial decision letter and author response on a selection of the published articles (subject to the approval of the authors).

How does it motivate the theoretical model and its interpretation</italic>?</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that, for the sake of succinctness, we left out a discussion of the current understanding of mechanisms causing expression noise. To better put our work into context, we have now included such a discussion in the Introduction and cited some of the works the reviewers mention.</p><p>As the reviewers point out, there is by now a large literature on the molecular mechanisms involved in gene expression noise, and since we obviously cannot give a comprehensive overview of this literature, we focused on the points that are most relevant for our work. Briefly, from a mechanistic perspective, it is well accepted that, because a given promoter is only present in one or a few copies within a single cell, and because all molecules in the cell are subject to Brownian motion and thermal fluctuations, the sequence of transcription initiation events from a given promoter is inherently stochastic. In the simplest scenario both transcription initiation and mRNA decay occur at a constant probability per unit time, leading to a Poissonian distribution of transcript numbers, with variance equal to mean. However, many promoters have been shown to exhibit variance in expression that is larger than their mean, which is generally quantified using the Fano factor (ratio of variance to mean). Moreover, this Fano factor has been shown to vary significantly across different promoters. Mechanistically, this additional noise is generally understood to arise from promoters stochastically switching between different ‘states'. In the simplest models, there is only an ‘on’ and an ‘off’ state, with promoters producing bursts of transcripts in the ‘on’ state only (indeed some authors simply identify the Fano factor with ‘burst size’). However, Fano factors larger than one result whenever promoters switch stochastically between different states that have different transcription rates associated with them. Such general state changes are likely associated with events such as the binding and unbinding of different transcription factors, local changes to the state of the chromatin, and so on. Moreover, since the concentrations of TFs may vary from cell to cell, the rates of switching between different states may vary from cell to cell as well. Thus, these mechanistic considerations suggest that the level of transcriptional noise may, at least to some extent, be encoded in the sequence of the promoter. Indeed, several recent works have established this to be the case. Consequently, transcriptional noise is thus subject to evolution through natural selection, and the main question that we set out to investigate in this work is how selection has shaped noise properties of promoters.</p><p>In summary, the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying transcriptional noise are very much in line with our interpretation of the results presented in the paper: different promoter sequences may lead to different levels of transcriptional noise because they contain different sets of binding sites for regulatory proteins. Indeed as we were performing this work, several works appeared that provide further support that regulatory sites in promoters are important contributors to transcription noise (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hornung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sharon et al., 2014</xref>), which we now also cite in the text.</p><p><italic>2) A possibly related flaw is the rather weak connection between the experiments and theoretical model. First, the model itself should be described in some more detail in the main text. But more crucially: How does the model help interpret the experiments? Can any kind of quantitative comparison be made between the two sets of results</italic>?</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the presentation of the theoretical model was rather terse and we have in the revision substantially expanded on the details of the theoretical model in the main text, including also the main analytical result illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. We also expanded the description of the model in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Most importantly, we have altered the presentation to better explain how precisely our model helps interpret the results of our experiments. The general structure of our presentation is to first summarize the main experimental observations that we want to explain: Natural selection must have acted to increase the noise levels of a substantial fraction of <italic>E. coli</italic> promoters, and the promoters with elevated noise are generally characterized by being highly regulated, i.e. having known regulatory sites and showing higher expression plasticity across conditions. We note that this general association between high transcriptional noise and gene regulation has now been observed in several studies.</p><p>After this, we review the explanations that have been proposed to account for selection for noise, on the one hand, and for the general association between noise and regulation, on the other hand. We review theoretical work arguing that increased phenotypic variability can act as a beneficial ‘bet hedging’ strategy, but point out that this interpretation fails to explain the association between noise and regulation. On the other hand, a plausible argument has been made that increased noise may be an unavoidable side-effect of regulation, i.e. due to unavoidable noise-propagation, but this is generally thought to be a detrimental effect, and does not explain our observation that selection acted to increase noise levels rather than to minimize them.</p><p>We then go on to present our general model, and explain how it clarifies these apparently contradicting observations. In particular, the model clarifies that the effects of coupling a promoter to a regulator can be usefully decomposed into a condition-response effect, whereby the mean levels of the promoter become dependent on the mean levels of the regulator, and a noise-propagation effect, whereby the noise of the promoter is increased due to noise in the regulator. The key insights that our model provides is that both of these effects can be beneficial, and that there is a continuum of possible regulatory strategies in which these two effects act in concert, varying from strategies in which all benefits come from the noise-propagation effect, to strategies where all benefits derive from the condition-response effect. In this way, our model clarifies that apparently complementary explanations such as ‘noise as a side-effect of regulation’ versus ‘noise selected as a bet hedging strategy’, are really just different parameter regimes within one unified theoretical frame work.</p><p>Finally, we return to our experimental observations, and discuss how the model helps explain them. First, we note that it would be very difficult to make quantitative predictions about what precise levels of noise would be expected for which promoters in which conditions, because this would depend on the details of how gene expression fluctuations affect fitness in different environments in the wild, which are almost impossible to know at this point. However, the model does explain the general trends observed in our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. In particular, we now discuss in some detail why our model predicts that positive correlations should be expected both between noise and the number of regulatory inputs, as well as between noise and expression plasticity.</p><p>Finally, a key assumption of our model is that elevated noise levels are, at least to some extent, the result of noise-propagation, i.e. the noise level of a promoter is determined by the noise levels of the regulators that regulate it. In the revision we now present a simple computational model that models the noise of a promoter as a linear function of the noise levels of the regulators that are known to target the promoter. We show that this model, although very crude, can explain a substantial fraction of the variation in observed noise levels. This simple model also identifies which TFs are most strongly contributing to noise levels, and we briefly discuss that the ‘noisy TFs’ that we identify are consistent with the biology of the growth conditions in which our experiments were done.</p><p><italic>3) More care must be taken when defining and discussing</italic> “<italic>transcription noise”. In the current work, neither transcription kinetics (e.g. using MS2-GFP) nor mRNA statistics (using single-molecule FISH) are directly measured, but instead a protein (GFP) reporter is used. Thus, interpreting the measured variability as</italic> “<italic>transcription noise” involves important caveats (see e.g. Paulsson, Nature 2004; Pedraza and Paulsson, Science 2008). These need to be explicitly discussed</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that we did not discuss this point in sufficient detail and have expanded the discussion of this issue in the revision. In particular, the discussion that we added in the revision covers the following points. First, we note that the reporter constructs we use were designed with the aim of measuring transcriptional noise, i.e. attempts were made to miminize the variation in the translation rates, the mRNA life-time distributions of the constructs, and the protein decay rates. Regarding the latter, since the GFP protein is long-lived, the protein decay is dominated by dilution, which, since all constructs show virtually identical growth rates, are virtually identical for all constructs.</p><p>Regarding variation in translation and mRNA decay, we note that the only difference be-tween the constructs is the promoter sequence fused upstream of GFP. As a result, the mRNAs transcribed from different constructs vary only in the few nucleotides between the TSS and the insertion site. In addition, downstream of the insertion site, is a fixed 5' UTR with a strong ribosomal binding site, intended to ensure similar translation rates of all constructs. To confirm that translation rates vary little across the constructs we performed qPCR experiments that show a high correlation between protein and mRNA levels. Since dilution/decay rates of proteins are constant, this implies that translation rates indeed vary little across the constructs, as we detail in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1">Appendix 1</xref>. Although we did not directly measure the variation in mRNA decay rates across the constructs, the fact that the mRNAs only vary in the initial few nucleotides downstream of TSS, and the fact that these variations do not appear to significantly affect translation rates, suggest that the variations in mRNA decay rates are likely also modest.</p><p>Together these observations suggest that the observed large differences in GFP number fluctuations result mostly from transcriptional noise. This is not to say that other fluctuations do not contribute to the noise, indeed all constructs are subject to noise in translation, to fluctuations in growth rates, to fluctuations in the copy number of the plasmid, and so on. However, these all contribute the same amount of noise for each construct. Indeed, we observe a fixed minimal amount of extrinsic noise that is exhibited by all our constructs. However, the differences in the noise levels across constructs are most likely due to differences in transcriptional noise, for the reasons given above. The fact that there is a very significant association between noise level and the occurrence of binding sites for particular TFs further supports this interpretation.</p><p><italic>4) In multiple places, the authors make very strong statements, which require additional evidence to support them or otherwise need to be reworded. Examples</italic>:</p><p>“<italic>Many studies have used</italic> circumstantial evidence <italic>to suggest that selection generally acts to minimize noise […] there is</italic> empirical evidence <italic>that selection has acted to increase expression noise in some cases” (Introduction). What makes the former studies merely</italic> “<italic>circumstantial” while the latter rise to the level of</italic> “<italic>empirical</italic>”<italic>?</italic></p><p>We agree this was not clear and have added clarification as to what precisely these studies show, i.e. showing association between noise and proxies for organismal fitness (which we called ‘circumstantial’), versus showing a causal relationship between noise and growth (which we called ‘empirical’).</p><p>“<italic>Whenever fluctuations are small relative to the mean, which applies to most promoters” (Results). No reference is given to support this statement</italic>.</p><p>We have now clarified this. Our own results show that, for the large majority of promoters, the fluctuations are small relative to the mean (which manifests itself as the variance in log-scale being clearly less than 1, i.e. as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>“<italic>We concluded that constitutively expressed</italic> E. coli <italic>promoters exhibit low excess noise levels by default” (Results). How was this conclusion reached? In particular, what is a</italic> “<italic>constitutive promoter” (or</italic> “<italic>unregulated promoter”, as mentioned later in the same section of the manuscript)? All known promoters in</italic> E. coli <italic>are regulated by multiple parameters: growth rate, nutritional state, temperature, etc. So how can a specific promoter be</italic> “<italic>constitutive”/</italic>“<italic>unregulated</italic>”<italic>?</italic></p><p>Although the term ‘constitutive promoter’ is commonly used in the field, we agree with the reviewers that it is often not clearly defined what precisely is meant with the term, and we are here also guilty of being vague about the term. We now realize our statement in fact confounded two separate issues that we have now tried to separate more clearly in the revision. First, and most importantly, our experiments show that promoters which were only selected to show a particular (constant) expression level in one given condition, without selecting on their noise properties, and starting from completely random sequence, naturally exhibit low noise. This is what we mean when we say that promoters have low noise ‘by default’. Second, our analysis of the noise levels of the native promoters shows that native promoters that have no known regulatory sites beyond the sigma-factor binding site of the polymerase, also tend to show low noise levels. This is what we call ‘constitutive’ promoters, i.e. not regulated by specific TFs. In the revision these points have been clarified.</p></body></sub-article></article>
