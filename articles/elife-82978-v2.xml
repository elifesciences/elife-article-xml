In non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish, regeneration of missing hair cells can occur throughout life. While a comparative approach has the potential to reveal the basis of such differential regenerative ability, the degree to which the inner ears of fish and mammals share common hair cells and supporting cell types remains unresolved. Here, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing of the zebrafish inner ear at embryonic through adult stages to catalog the diversity of hair cells and non-sensory supporting cells. We identify a putative progenitor population for hair cells and supporting cells, as well as distinct hair and supporting cell types in the maculae versus cristae. The hair cell and supporting cell types differ from those described for the lateral line system, a distributed mechanosensory organ in zebrafish in which most studies of hair cell regeneration have been conducted. In the maculae, we identify two subtypes of hair cells that share gene expression with mammalian striolar or extrastriolar hair cells. In situ hybridization reveals that these hair cell subtypes occupy distinct spatial domains within the three macular organs, the utricle, saccule, and lagena, consistent with the reported distinct electrophysiological properties of hair cells within these domains. These findings suggest that primitive specialization of spatially distinct striolar and extrastriolar hair cells likely arose in the last common ancestor of fish and mammals. The similarities of inner ear cell type composition between fish and mammals validate zebrafish as a relevant model for understanding inner ear-specific hair cell function and regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>inner ear</kwd><kwd>supporting cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DC019948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raible</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DC020898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beaulieu</surname><given-names>Marielle O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hamilton and Mildred Kellogg Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raible</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Whitcraft Family Gift</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raible</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002046</institution-id><institution>Hearing Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raible</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paul G.

Hair cells are notoriously susceptible to damage from multiple types of insults, including noise and ototoxic drug exposure. Studies of hair cell physiology in mammals are limited by the location of the inner ear within the temporal bone, which precludes many targeted manipulations and in vivo imaging beyond the neonatal stage. As a result, non-mammalian vertebrates with analogous, more easily accessible hair cells have become useful models for studying hair cell development, death, and regeneration. Non-mammalian vertebrates such as birds and fish can regenerate hair cells of the auditory and vestibular systems that are lost due to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stone and Cotanche, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Monroe et al., 2015</xref>). This differs from mammals, where cochlear hair cell death leads to permanent hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corwin and Cotanche, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamasoba and Kondo, 2006</xref>), and limited regeneration of vestibular hair cells results in minimal recovery of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Golub et al., 2012</xref>). Non-mammalian model systems of hair cell regeneration have the potential to reveal conserved pathways that can be targeted to promote hair cell survival and regeneration in humans. However, the extent of hair cell molecular homology across vertebrates remains unclear.</p><p>Due to its accessibility for manipulation and imaging, the zebrafish lateral line system has been widely used to study mechanisms of hair cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pickett and Raible, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sheets et al., 2021</xref>). The lateral line is an external sensory system that allows aquatic vertebrates to detect local movement of water. Sensory organs of the lateral line, called neuromasts, contain hair cells and supporting cells that share properties with those of the inner ear. However, relative to the lateral line, cells in the zebrafish inner ear are likely more similar to their mammalian counterparts, raising the potential for it to be a more comparable system in which to study hair cell function.</p><p>Zebrafish and mammals share several inner ear sensory organs. Three semicircular canals with sensory end organs called cristae sense angular rotation of the head. Two additional sensory end organs detect linear acceleration and gravity: the utricular and saccular macula each with an associated otolith crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Fish lack a specific auditory structure such as the mammalian cochlea and instead sense sound through the saccule, utricle, and a third otolith organ, the lagena. Although historically the utricle was thought to be for vestibular function and the saccule and lagena analogous to the cochlea for sound detection, there is now substantial evidence for all three otolith end organs being used for sound detection with diverse specializations across fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Popper and Fay, 1993</xref>). Zebrafish exhibit behavioral responses to sound frequencies between 100 and 1200 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zeddies and Fay, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhandiwad et al., 2013</xref>), and neural responses up to 4000 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Poulsen et al., 2021</xref>). In larval zebrafish, both saccule and utricle hair cells respond to vibration stimuli, with the utricle responding to relatively lower frequencies than the saccule, as well as additive effects when both are stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Favre-Bulle et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Anatomy of zebrafish and mouse inner ears.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration of the lateral line system of a 5 dpf zebrafish.

Hair cells are broadly classified by their morphology and innervation, with Type I hair cells having calyx synapses surrounding the hair cell body and Type II hair cells having bouton synapses. Both Type I and Type II cells can be found within the central region of the macular organs known as the striola and in the surrounding extrastriolar zones. Although the role of spatial segregation into striolar versus extrastriolar zones has not been fully elucidated, hair cells across these regions vary in morphology, electrophysiology, and synaptic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2008</xref>). The striola is characterized by hair cells with taller ciliary bundles and encompasses a line of polarity reversal where hair cells change their stereocilia orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Whereas distinct Type I and Type II hair cells, and in particular the calyx synapses typical of Type I cells, have not been identified in the maculae of fishes, afferent innervation with some calyx-like properties has been reported in goldfish cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lanford and Popper, 1996</xref>). Spatial heterogeneity in the maculae, including those of zebrafish, has also been previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Platt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). However, the homologies of cells at the cellular and molecular levels have remained unknown.</p><p>Recent single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing efforts have generated a wealth of transcriptomic data from hair cells in several model systems, facilitating more direct comparison of cell types and gene regulatory networks between species. Although single-cell transcriptomic data have recently been published for the zebrafish inner ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jimenez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qian et al., 2022</xref>), the diversity of hair cell and supporting cell subtypes has not been thoroughly analyzed. In order to better understand the diversification of cell types in the zebrafish inner ear, and their relationships to those in mammals, here we perform single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing of the zebrafish inner ear from embryonic through adult stages. We find that hair and supporting cells from the zebrafish inner ear and lateral line are transcriptionally distinct, and that hair and supporting cells differ between the cristae and maculae. All of these distinct cell types are present during larval development and are maintained into adulthood. In situ hybridization reveals that these hair cell subtypes occupy distinct spatial domains within the utricle, saccule, and lagena, and computational comparison of hair cell types reveals homology with striolar and extrastriolar hair cell types in mammals. These findings point to an origin of striolar and extrastriolar hair cell types in at least the last common ancestor of fish and mammals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inner ear hair cells and supporting cells are distinct from those of the lateral line</title><p>To assess differences between inner ear and lateral line cells, we analyzed a subset of cells from a large single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset of whole zebrafish at embryonic and larval stages (36–96 hours post-fertilization (hpf)), which was prepared by single-nucleus combinatorial indexing and sequencing (‘sci-Seq’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Saunders et al., 2022</xref>).

A strength of this algorithm is that it compares not only homologous gene pairs but also close paralogs, which is especially useful considering the extensive paralog switching observed between vertebrate clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Postlethwait, 2007</xref>), as well as the extra round of genome duplication in the teleost lineage leading to zebrafish. When comparing adult zebrafish maculae with the postnatal mouse utricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jan et al., 2021</xref>), we find the highest alignment score between supporting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Consistent with the spatial domains revealed by our in situ gene expression analysis, we find that mouse striolar Type I hair cells exclusively map to zebrafish Cluster 4 (<italic>cabp2b</italic>+) hair cells, and mouse extrastriolar Type I and Type II hair cells predominantly to zebrafish Cluster 1/3 (<italic>cabp1b</italic>+) hair cells.

As much of our knowledge about zebrafish hair cell regeneration comes from studies of the lateral line, understanding similarities and differences between the lateral line and inner ear has the potential to uncover mechanisms underlying the distinct regenerative capacity of inner ear hair cell subtypes. Recent tools to systematically damage inner ear hair cells in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jimenez et al., 2021</xref>) should enable such types of comparative studies.</p><p>We identify hair cells and supporting cells specific for maculae versus cristae, as well as two spatially segregated types of zebrafish inner ear hair cells with similarities to mammalian striolar and extrastriolar hair cells. These molecular signatures are conserved across larval and adult stages. However, consistent with other recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jimenez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Qian et al., 2022</xref>), we were not able to resolve distinct clusters of hair cells or supporting cells corresponding to the distinct types of maculae: i.e. utricle, saccule, and lagena.</p><p>The division of auditory and vestibular function across the otolith organs in zebrafish remains somewhat unclear. The saccule is thought to act as the primary auditory organ of larval zebrafish, as the utricle is not necessary for sound detection above low frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). In the zebrafish adult, excess sound exposure can damage the saccule, while damage to the utricle is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schuck and Smith, 2009</xref>). Conversely, the utricle is critical for larval vestibular function, while input from the saccule is unnecessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Riley and Moorman, 2000</xref>). However, there is contrasting evidence for overlap in function of both saccule and utricle for sound detection in larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Favre-Bulle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Poulsen et al., 2021</xref>). Currently we are not able to identify clearly distinct hair cell types in the utricle compared to the saccule that might reflect functional differences; whether such genetic signatures exist remains an important question that will require further in-depth analysis. It is interesting to note that mammalian vestibular end organs are also capable of responding to high-frequency sound stimuli (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curthoys, 2017</xref>), suggesting that sound detection by hair cells may not be linked to a distinct end organ-specific molecular signature.</p><p>Our study supports zebrafish possessing distinct types of striolar and extrastriolar hair cells in the maculae and cristae, with molecular differences between these subtypes implying different physiological properties. In the zebrafish utricle, vibration is preferentially transduced by striolar cells while static tilt is received by extrastriolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tanimoto et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with use of a s100s-hs:tdTomato transgene to mark striolar cells in this previous study, s100s is a highly specific marker for our striolar hair cell cluster (Figure 3E). We also find zebrafish striolar and extrastriolar hair cell subtypes express distinct combinations of ion channel genes and mechanotransduction components, consistent with previous reports of distinct current profiles in central versus peripheral hair cells in the zebrafish utricle, saccule, and lagena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Olt et al., 2014</xref>), as well as spatial differences in ciliary bundle morphology and synaptic innervation in the larval zebrafish utricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). The distinct spatial distribution, channel expression, and hair bundle morphologies in these hair cells resembles the known spatial, electrophysiological, and hair bundle compositional differences seen in the striolar versus extrastriolar hair cells in the amniote vestibular end organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kharkovets et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lapeyre et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meredith and Rennie, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moravec and Peterson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rüsch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xue and Peterson, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In each of the zebrafish end organs, striolar and extrastriolar hair cells can be defined by differential expression of calcium binding proteins, in particular <italic>cabp1b</italic> versus <italic>cabp2b</italic>. As these calcium binding proteins closely interact with synaptic calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Picher et al., 2017</xref>) with potential functionally different consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), their differential expression may confer unique electrophysiological properties to each cell type.

Even though we chose <italic>cabp1b</italic> and <italic>cabp2b</italic> as characteristic markers for zebrafish extrastriolar and striolar regions, it is worth noting that <italic>Cabp2</italic>, but not <italic>Cabp1</italic>, is expressed in all mouse postnatal utricular hair cells with differentially higher expression in the striola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jan et al., 2021</xref>). Of note, lateral line hair cells express higher levels of <italic>cabp2b</italic> than <italic>cabp1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lush et al., 2019</xref>), despite our analysis suggesting that they are more closely related to extrastriolar hair cells. These observations emphasize the importance of examining global patterns of gene expression rather than individual markers when assigning homology of cell types.</p><p>By contrast, we found no clear homology of zebrafish inner ear hair cells with mammalian Type I and Type II hair cells. The lack of molecular signatures corresponding to Type I hair cells is consistent with previous reports that one of their major features, calyx synapses, are absent from macular organs in fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lysakowski and Goldberg, 2004</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lanford and Popper, 1996</xref> for evidence of calyx synapses in goldfish cristae). These findings suggest that the diversification of inner ear hair cells into Type I and Type II cells may have largely emerged after the evolutionary split of ray-finned fishes from the lineage leading to mammals.</p><p>We recognize that identifying cell type homology across tissues and species through molecular analysis has several potential caveats. Although we have collected transcriptomic data from the zebrafish inner ear from a wide range of developmental stages, we are limited by the fact that the publicly available datasets for zebrafish lateral line and mouse utricle and cristae are restricted to immature stages. Thus, cell maturity could be a confounder in our analyses. However, when we limited the comparison of lateral line hair cells and postnatal mouse vestibular hair cells to 3–5 dpf inner ear hair cells, we see similar alignments as when we used our 12 mpf data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we collected fewer supporting cells from adult zebrafish than expected, skewing cell type representation towards hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, additional optimization may be needed to further interrogate the cell subtypes within zebrafish inner ear supporting cell populations.</p><p>Nonetheless, our integrated dataset reveals distinct molecular characteristics of hair cells and supporting cells in the zebrafish inner ear sensory organs, with conservation of these patterns from larval stages to adults. Although not discussed in detail here, our data include additional cell populations of the zebrafish inner ear that express extracellular matrix-associated genes important for otic capsule structure and ion channel-associated genes associated with fluid regulation. These data form a resource that can be further explored to inform molecular aspects of hair cell electrophysiology, mechanotransduction, sound versus motion detection, maintenance of inner ear structure and ionic balance, and inner ear-specific hair cell regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish lines</title><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

zebrafish inner ear at single-cell resolution in embryonic through adult stages. These solid results catalogue transcriptomic data and show evidence that distinct cell subtypes exist between cells of the ear and the lateral line as well as within subcellular compartments in the inner ear. These findings provide information towards comparative studies of inner ear hair cell function and regeneration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82978.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Sheets</surname><given-names>Lavinia</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01yc7t268</institution-id><institution>Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Sheets</surname><given-names>Lavinia</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01yc7t268</institution-id><institution>Washington University School of Medicine in St Louis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Burgess</surname><given-names>Shawn M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.08.507120">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.08.507120v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Lavinia Sheets as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shawn M Burgess (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Address concerns about how the expression and function of Cabp1 &amp; 2 in mammals corresponds with the observations made in zebrafish.</p><p>2) Address reviewer-specific comments on the content of the manuscript without further experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Introduction:</p><p>The statement &quot;In larval zebrafish, both saccule and utricle hair cells respond to sound stimuli of frequencies between 100-4000 Hz&quot; is not accurate and is not supported by the studies the authors cited. Several specific points: (1) none of the studies cited tested frequencies above 1000 Hz (2) microphonic potential recordings in larvae (Yao et al., 2016) showed that microphonic thresholds increased particularly at low frequencies when the utricular otolith was displaced (i.e. removed) and high frequencies when the saccular otolith was displaced, indicating differences in hair cell frequency tuning (3) numerous behavior studies in larval zebrafish have shown that the utricle is the gravity sensing organ of the fish and maximally sensitive to lower frequencies (4) studies in larval and adult zebrafish support that the saccule is more sensitive to higher frequencies, contributes to a sound-evoked startle response, and can be damaged by excess sound. A few suggested studies for your reference: Mo et al., BMC Neuroscience, 2010; Bagnall &amp; Schoppik, Current Op in Neuroscience, 2018; Bhandiwad, JARO, 2018; Smith, Hearing Research, 2009</p><p>– Results and Discussion</p><p>That inner ear hair cells and supporting cells are distinct from those of the lateral line is an interesting observation but is only examined until 96 hpf, when the lateral line is still reaching functional maturation. Do the authors predict similar segregation of expression profiles in more mature lateral-line organs? This seems like an important distinction, given the subsequent SAMap analysis with data from 5 dpf larvae.</p><p>Given that the saccule and the utricle in zebrafish have different frequency selectivity and specific functional roles, it would be informative to understand how their expression profiles are different. Further, even though hearing is discussed at the beginning of this study, conservation between expression profiles observed in hair cells and supporting cells of the cochlea are not examined. This seems like an oversight given that these organs (particularly the saccule) are known to be used for hearing in fish.</p><p>Clarification and more in-depth discussion on the significance of differential capb1b and capb2b expression in the zebrafish inner ear are needed. The expression data in this study suggests that cabp2b + cells are related to striolar cells of the mouse utricle while cabp1b + are more closely related to extrastriolar cells. Yet these observations regarding Cabp1 &amp; 2 do not correspond with what is reported from expression studies in the mammalian utricle (gEAR database). Further, the database of gene expression in 5 dpf lateral line hair cells reported by Lush et al. shows high expression of cabp2b in lateral line hair cells and minimal expression of cabp1b, contradicting the conclusion that lateral line hair cells are more closely related to extrastriolar/ cabp1b + cells. In mammals, Cabp2 is known to inhibit presynaptic CaV1.3 inactivation, which is critical for sound encoding, while Cabp1 is important for the proper function of auditory nerves (see Yang et al., Hearing Research, 2018). The different expression patterns reported here in zebrafish are striking; contextualizing these observations with what is known about the expression and function of these genes in mammals would provide more useful context for hearing and balance researchers.</p><p>SAMp analysis – it appears expression data from adult fish ears (12 mpf) was integrated with lateral line neuromast data from 5 dpf larvae. Given that the properties of hair cells are functionally more mature in older fish (Olt et al., J Physiol., 2016) is this a valid comparison?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall the data are nicely presented and there is some limited validation of new markers. The presence of striolar and extrastriolar regions of the utricle and saccule are demonstrated, although this is, perhaps, not that surprising given that striolar and extrastriolar regions of these structures have been reported in other fish species. My primary hesitation with this study is whether the overall level of advancement is sufficient for <italic>eLife</italic>? Single-cell data sets are now quite common, so I have to wonder what the advance is here.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Page 5, 3rd paragraph: comment about otolith crystals should be clarified as fish have just single otoliths while mammals have multiple smaller crystals.</p><p>Page 7, I'm unclear on the usefulness of this first analysis, in particular regarding non-sensory inner ear cells. Known markers of the inner ear and lateral line non-sensory cells were used to identify individual cells within the data set. So wouldn't this bias the collection of cells towards those that are different? And if this is the case, is it remarkable that the cells don't overlap given that differential gene expression was used to select them?</p><p>This would not appear to be the case for the comparison of hair cells which were selected using pan-hair cell markers.</p><p>Page 10, end of the first paragraph: given all the regeneration data and analysis of notch mutants, it seems like a pretty safe bet that HCs and SCs arise from a common progenitor, even without lineage tracing data.</p><p>Figure 3: the data set seemed to be highly skewed towards hair cells with relatively few non-sensory cells collected. Is this the case, or are there more hair cells than non-sensory cells?</p><p>Figure 3D: it would be helpful to include a feature plot for <italic>atoh1a</italic> as dla does not intuitively appear to be a nascent hair cell marker given the large number of progenitors that also express this transcript.</p><p>Figure 4B: so are the crista HCs and crista SCs not included in the trajectory?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Review of the Results and Figures</p><p>The authors' main goal in the manuscript is to understand the diversity in hair cell and support cell subtypes in the zebrafish inner ear and their relationship to the mammalian inner ear. Overall, the manuscript's readability can be revised to improve the flow of the text, but there is sufficient information presented for readers to follow the rationale, procedures, and insights. The results are clear, and the methods are appropriate.</p><p>Some recommendations to strengthen the readability and conclusions of the manuscript:</p><p>The authors find that hair cells and support cells in the inner ear are transcriptionally distinct from the lateral line systems.</p><p>Figure 1 should include a schematic of the lateral line systems. It should also be described in the figure legend that the zebrafish and mouse inner ears represent adult structures.</p><p>There are 2 paragraphs in the Results section that describe inner ear vs lateral line results on page 7 (of the merged file) and page 11. The results related to the distinct molecular signatures of the lateral line and inner ear should be moved earlier in the text and combined with the results on page 7 to improve the flow of the text. Figure S5 is a great figure showing that the lateral line and inner ear clusters do not overlap which indicates their differences, but this figure is redundant since a similar UMAP is shown in Figure 2B. If the Results section regarding the differences between the lateral line and inner ear are combined, then the authors can also combine Figure S5B with Figure 2. Tables of marker gene data for each partition related to Figure 2B and Figures 2C-F should be provided as a supplement and indicated in the Results section of the text.</p><p>Figure 2. The colors along the horizontal axes in Figure 2C-2F correspond to the colors in Figure 2B, but they should be clearly described in the figure legend for readers.</p><p>The authors identify distinct hair cells and supporting cell types in juvenile and adult inner ears of zebrafish. They also identify an additional putative progenitor cluster.</p><p>Figure S2 represents UMAPs of 12 mpf zebrafish inner ear. However, this is the first and only time we are seeing these UMAPs of 12 mpf ears exclusively. It would be beneficial to the reader if there was a UMAP of the unsupervised clustering adjacent to the feature plots. Labels should be included to guide the reader to the structural cells that the author is describing. OR, the authors can remove this figure as it doesn't contribute new information and appears to be a processing step that can be described in the methods section.</p><p>Figure S3 represents feature plots of genes expressed in the integrated scRNA-seq dataset and clearly displays hair cell genes and support cell genes. The progenitor cell markers selected for this figure do not clearly show that the transcriptional signature of the putative progenitor cell type is distinct from the other cell types. From Figure S3, it appears that the pan-supporting markers overlap with putative progenitor markers. Are there other markers in the progenitor pool from Table S2 that can be selected to display their transcriptional distinctiveness? The authors should draw an outline or point to where the progenitor cell types are in the UMAP plots.</p><p>Figure 3 also displays feature plots of genes expressed in hair cells, support cells, and progenitor cell types. The authors state that the putative progenitor cells show weak expression of hair cells and support cell markers. However, according to Figure 3D, macula and cristae support cells have high expression of the progenitor cell gene <italic>Fgfr2</italic>. Visually, the observation they write about isn't clear. It might be helpful to include the fold change in gene expression relative to the other clusters to support their observation that the novel progenitor cell genes are enriched.</p><p>The authors propose that the progenitor cells represent a transition state cell type that may contribute to either hair cells or support cells which is also supported by recent work on regenerating zebrafish inner ears. Although lineage tracing is required to validate this idea, the authors explore cell fate trajectories using Monocle3 to examine gene expression as differentiation progresses. They provide the Morans I test results in Table S3, but it would be more informative if the authors clustered genes into modules that are co-expressed across cells. An additional layer of Monocle3 analysis (i.e. gene_module_df) will uncover novel regulatory interactions governing the support cell to progenitor cell transition and the progenitor cell to hair cell transition.</p><p>Considering that the authors have beautifully labelled hair cell and support cell subtypes to validate their transcriptomic findings, can they also label progenitor cells at the single cell level with spatial information in the inner ear tissues using in situ hybridization assays?</p><p>The authors carefully describe support cell types in cristae versus maculae. According to the methods section, the authors performed single-cell experiments on the lagena. What are the differences between the lagena, saccule, and utricle? Can information about the lagena be extracted from the integrated analysis?</p><p>For Figure 5, it would be helpful to have a schematic of the zebrafish 5dpf inner ear anatomy with labels. Alternatively, a schematic of the 5dpf inner ear can be added to Figure 1.</p><p>Similarly, Figure 6 can include schematics of the adult saccule and utricle OR these structures could be shown in Figure 2. In Figure 6, the utricle, saccule, and lagena should be outlined and have arrows to guide the reader. Figure 8 should also include outlines of the utricles.</p><p>Review of the Methods Section</p><p>For Single-cell preparation and analysis, it should be clear whether separate libraries for lagena, saccule, and utricle were prepared or if the dissected structures were combined before library preparation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82978.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Introduction:</p><p>The statement &quot;In larval zebrafish, both saccule and utricle hair cells respond to sound stimuli of frequencies between 100-4000 Hz&quot; is not accurate and is not supported by the studies the authors cited.

We agree that the relative contribution of utricle and saccule to hearing is an interesting one, related to our observations that these end organs are not well-distinguished by our scRNA-seq analysis. Although there is some evidence supporting a clear distinction between saccule and utricle with respect to hearing, particularly across fishes, we note that there is also good evidence for both of these end organs involved in hearing in zebrafish. We now include a more thorough analysis of this issue in the introduction (lines 73-77) and discussion (lines 316-334).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results and Discussion</p><p>That inner ear hair cells and supporting cells are distinct from those of the lateral line is an interesting observation but is only examined until 96 hpf, when the lateral line is still reaching functional maturation.

We also note that the available mouse data for which we performed the SAMap analysis is from early postnatal tissue, so it is not readily apparent that it is just a matter of immature vs mature samples driving cross-species differences.

However, we were only able to identify and verify a handful of genes that are differentially expressed between these two end organs (Figure 7). The lack of drastic molecular differences between the two agrees with findings from Jimenez et al. 2022, where they built single-cell libraries separately from the utricle and saccules. This suggests that the expression profiles of these two sensory patches are more similar to each other than one might predict.</p><p>We agree that it would be insightful to further compare zebrafish otic hair cells to mouse cochlear hair cells. Unfortunately, the publicly available mouse cochlear dataset contained a limited number of hair cells, which has been a challenge for us in preliminary analysis to identify clear correlations between gene expression profiles of zebrafish otic and mouse cochlear hair cells. Full analysis awaits the availability of more comprehensive mouse data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clarification and more in-depth discussion on the significance of differential capb1b and capb2b expression in the zebrafish inner ear are needed.

We now clarify that we used cabp1b and cabp2b as characteristic markers for the expression clusters because of their relatively strong levels of expression and differential distribution in the inner ear rather than as specific probes for function, and we now clarify that we are comparing clusters throughout the Results section. We also note that comparisons between tissues incorporate the whole gene expression profile of a cluster, not just a single marker. So while cabp1b may be expressed in the lateral line, the other genes differentially expressed across clusters are not. We also include more discussion of functional roles for these calcium binding proteins (lines 350-355).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>SAMp analysis – it appears expression data from adult fish ears (12 mpf) was integrated with lateral line neuromast data from 5 dpf larvae.

However we note that the SAMap analysis does not directly compare lateral line to zebrafish inner ear but rather to mouse inner ear. Perhaps a more relevant discrepancy is that the available mouse data is early postnatal, when the ear is clearly immature. To address this issue we limited analysis to zebrafish inner ear from 3 and 5 dpf larvae and 5 dpf neuromast and performed the same SAMap analysis to mouse utricle. The resulting alignment is similar to what we have found with adult zebrafish ear data.

Although lineage tracing is required to validate this idea, the authors explore cell fate trajectories using Monocle3 to examine gene expression as differentiation progresses. They provide the Morans I test results in Table S3, but it would be more informative if the authors clustered genes into modules that are co-expressed across cells. An additional layer of Monocle3 analysis (i.e. gene_module_df) will uncover novel regulatory interactions governing the support cell to progenitor cell transition and the progenitor cell to hair cell transition.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion as it has allowed us to better separate putative progenitor cells from mature support cells. We now include this gene module information for the embryonic and integrated datasets in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 4, and Supplemental Tables 2 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Considering that the authors have beautifully labelled hair cell and support cell subtypes to validate their transcriptomic findings, can they also label progenitor cells at the single cell level with spatial information in the inner ear tissues using in situ hybridization assays?</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted HCR-FISH with probes for <italic>Fgfr2</italic>, but unfortunately we were not able to distinguish gene expression differences. Instead we performed ISH with the Notch ligand <italic>dla,</italic> which is enriched in in progenitors and is also expressed in nascent hair cells (see dotplots in Figure 3E). HCR-FISH on 5 dpf fish shows <italic>dla</italic> expression in hair cells and in a subset of supporting cells adjacent to hair cells. We have added images of the <italic>dla</italic> ISH in new Figure 4—figure supplement 2. Unfortunately, clarifying progenitor identity and location is going to require further transcriptome analysis, labeling, and lineage tracing, which is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors carefully describe support cell types in cristae versus maculae. According to the methods section, the authors performed single-cell experiments on the lagena. What are the differences between the lagena, saccule, and utricle? Can information about the lagena be extracted from the integrated analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>Since we had combined the sensory patches prior to library preparation, we were not able to pull out cells from individual macula organs based on barcode information. Our analysis suggests that, while macula and crista hair cells can be fairly easily distinguished from each other, hair cells from within different macular organs are more difficult to discern. While we were able to identify some markers specific to the utricle <italic>(skor2</italic>+) and saccule (<italic>loxhd1b</italic>+), we find that overall the expression profiles of macular hair cells are relatively similar and hence we were not able to confidently assign an organ of origin. This finding agrees with recent evidence from Jimenez et al., 2022 showing that adult zebrafish utricle and saccule have similar expression profiles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 5, it would be helpful to have a schematic of the zebrafish 5dpf inner ear anatomy with labels.
