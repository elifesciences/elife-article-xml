pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36656.001</object-id><p>Protein kinases are major drug targets, but the development of highly-selective inhibitors has been challenging due to the similarity of their active sites. The observation of distinct structural states of the fully-conserved Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) loop has put the concept of conformational selection for the DFG-state at the center of kinase drug discovery. Recently, it was shown that Gleevec selectivity for the Tyr-kinase Abl was instead rooted in conformational changes after drug binding. Here, we investigate whether protein dynamics after binding is a more general paradigm for drug selectivity by characterizing the binding of several approved drugs to the Ser/Thr-kinase Aurora A. Using a combination of biophysical techniques, we propose a universal drug-binding mechanism, that rationalizes selectivity, affinity and long on-target residence time for kinase inhibitors. These new concepts, where protein dynamics in the drug-bound state plays the crucial role, can be applied to inhibitor design of targets outside the kinome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36656.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Protein kinases are a family of enzymes found in all living organisms. These enzymes help to control many biological processes, including cell division. When particular protein kinases do not work correctly, cells may start to divide uncontrollably, which can lead to cancer. One example is the kinase Aurora A, which is over-active in many common human cancers. As a result, researchers are currently trying to design drugs that reduce the activity of Aurora A in the hope that these could form new anticancer treatments.</p><p>In general, drugs are designed to be as specific in their action as possible to reduce the risk of harmful side effects to the patient. Designing a drug that affects a single protein kinase, however, is difficult because there are hundreds of different kinases in the body, all with similar structures. Because drugs often work by binding to specific structural features, a drug that targets one protein kinase can often alter the activity of a large number of others too.</p><p>Gleevec is a successful anti-leukemia drug that specifically works on one target kinase, producing minimal side effects. It was recently discovered that the drug works through a phenomenon called ‘induced fit’. This means that after the drug binds it causes a change in the enzyme’s overall shape that alters the activity of the enzyme. The shape change is complex, and so even small structural differences can change the effect of a particular drug.</p><p>Do other drugs that target other protein kinases also produce induced fit effects? To find out, Pitsawong, Buosi, Otten, Agafonov et al. studied how three anti-cancer drugs interact with Aurora A: two drugs specifically designed to switch off Aurora A, and Gleevec (which does not target Aurora A).</p><p>The two drugs that specifically target Aurora A were thought to work by targeting one structural feature of the enzyme. However, the biochemical and biophysical experiments performed by Pitsawong et al. revealed that these drugs instead work through an induced fit effect. By contrast, Gleevec did not trigger an induced fit on Aurora A and so bound less tightly to it.</p><p>In light of these results, Pitsawong et al. suggest that future efforts to design drugs that target protein kinases should focus on exploiting the induced fit process. This will require more research into the structure of particular kinases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>drug binding</kwd><kwd>enzyme kinetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>Dorothee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM100966-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>Dorothee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-05ER15699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kern</surname><given-names>Dorothee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2114-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Otten</surname><given-names>Renee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Slow conformational changes after drug binding rationalize selectivity, affinity and long on-target residence time for kinase inhibitors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein kinases have become the number one drug target of the 21th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cohen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hopkins and Groom, 2002</xref>), due to their central role in cellular processes and involvement in various types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carvajal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gautschi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Katayama and Sen, 2010</xref>). Despite their therapeutic significance, the development of specific kinase inhibitors proves to be extremely challenging because they must discriminate between the very similar active sites of a large number of kinases in human cells. One of the biggest success stories is Gleevec: a highly selective drug that specifically targets Abl kinase, providing an efficient treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and minimizing side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Iqbal and Iqbal, 2014</xref>). Despite being a multi-billion-dollar cancer drug, the mechanism responsible for its impressive selectivity has been elusive until recently. Seminal work by the Kuriyan lab demonstrated that Gleevec can only bind to an inactive DFG (for Asp-Phe-Gly) loop conformation in the ‘out-conformation’ due to steric clash of the active, DFG-<italic>in</italic> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nagar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schindler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Seeliger et al., 2007</xref>). Since then it has long been proposed that the conformational state of the fully-conserved DFG loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Taylor et al., 2012</xref>) dictates the selectivity for Gleevec and other kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lovera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nagar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schindler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Treiber and Shah, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 1997</xref>). The orientation of the DFG-motif and its possible steric clashes is indeed important for the ability of a class of inhibitors to bind to the kinase, but proved insufficient to explain drug selectivity and affinity. Earlier elegant work on Src and Abl recognized this and explored other hypotheses (e.g., differences in drug-binding pocket, energetic changes remote from the binding site and a conformational-selection mechanism) to reconcile the differences in Gleevec binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Levinson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Seeliger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">2009</xref>), but without conclusive success. Recent quantitative binding kinetics combined with ancestral sequence reconstruction put forward a mechanism where an induced-fit step after drug binding is the key determinant for Gleevec’s selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agafonov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>), and fully recapitulates the binding affinities.</p><p>Here we ask the question whether this fundamentally different mechanism is a more general principle for drug efficacy and selectivity not only for Tyr kinases such as Abl, but also for Ser/Thr kinases. To this end, we chose the Ser/Thr kinase Aurora A and investigated the binding kinetics of three distinct kinase drugs: Danusertib, AT9283, and Gleevec. Aurora A kinase is one of the key regulators of mitotic events, including mitotic entry, centrosome maturation and spindle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lukasiewicz and Lingle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Marumoto et al., 2005</xref>), as well as assisting in neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nikonova et al., 2013</xref>). Aurora A has attracted significant attention for the development of targeted agents for cancer because it is overexpressed in a wide range of tumors, including breast, colon, ovary and skin malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carvajal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gautschi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Katayama and Sen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lok et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Marzo and Naval, 2013</xref>). The focus was mainly on ATP-competitive inhibitors, but more recently inhibition by allosteric compounds has also been pursued with the aim of achieving higher selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asteriti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bayliss et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burgess et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Janeček et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McIntyre et al., 2017</xref>). So far, only the clinical significance of Aurora A inhibition by ATP-competitive drugs has been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bavetsias and Linardopoulos, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borisa and Bhatt, 2017</xref>), but little is known about their binding mechanisms. Many high-resolution X-ray structures of Aurora A kinase bound to different inhibitors have been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bavetsias et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dodson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fancelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ferguson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heron et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Howard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kilchmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Martin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>), but the selectivity profile of those kinase inhibitors remains very difficult to explain.</p><p>The drugs used in this study are small, ATP-competitive inhibitors. Danusertib (PHA739358) and AT9283 were developed for Aurora kinases, whereas Gleevec is selective for the Tyr kinase Abl. Danusertib inhibits all members of the Aurora family with low nanomolar IC<sub>50</sub> values (13, 79 and 61 nM for Aurora A, B and C, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carpinelli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fraedrich et al., 2012</xref>) and was one of the first Aurora kinase inhibitors to enter phase I and II clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kollareddy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Steeghs et al., 2009</xref>). A crystal structure of Danusertib bound to Aurora A kinase shows an inactive kinase with the DFG-loop in the <italic>out</italic> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fancelli et al., 2006</xref>). AT9283 inhibits both Aurora A and B with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Howard et al., 2009</xref>) and has also entered several clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borisa and Bhatt, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the crystal structure of Aurora A with AT9283 shows that this drug binds to the DFG<italic>-in</italic>, active conformation of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Howard et al., 2009</xref>). Both drugs are high-affinity binders that reportedly bind to a discrete kinase conformation and would allow us to probe for a conformational-selection step. Lastly, we selected Gleevec as a drug that is not selective for Aurora A and should, therefore, have a weaker binding affinity. We reasoned that this choice of inhibitors could reveal general mechanisms underlying drug selectivity and affinity.</p><p>The combination of X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and comprehensive analysis of drug binding and release kinetics delivered a general mechanistic view. Differential drug affinity is not rooted in the overwhelmingly favored paradigm of the DFG-conformation, but instead in the dynamic personality of the kinase that is manifested in conformational changes after drug binding. Notably, such conformational changes have evolved for its natural substrates, and the drugs take advantage of this built-in protein dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dephosphorylated Aurora A samples both an inactive and active structure</title><p>A plethora of X-ray structures and functional assays led to the general notion that dephosphorylated Aurora A and, more universally, Ser/Thr kinases are in an inactive conformation and that phosphorylation or activator binding induces the active structure. A comparison of many X-ray structures of inactive and active forms of Ser/Thr kinases resulted in an elegant proposal of the structural hallmarks for the active state by Taylor and collaborators: the completion of both the regulatory and catalytic spines spanning the N- and C-terminal domains, including the orientation of the DFG-motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kornev and Taylor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2015</xref>). X-ray structures, however, provide merely static snapshots of possible kinase conformations that do not necessarily reflect the situation in solution. In fact, recent experimental data postulate that phosphorylation of Aurora A does not ‘lock’ the kinase in the active conformation, and that the activation-loop still exhibits conformational dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gilburt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ruff et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, X-ray crystallography provides high-resolution structural data that cannot readily be obtained from FRET or EPR and IR spectroscopy.</p><p>Two crystals from the same crystallization well capture both the inactive and active conformations of dephosphorylated Aurora A bound with AMPPCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). As anticipated, the first structure (PDB 4C3R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zorba et al., 2014</xref>]) superimposes with the well-known inactive, dephosphorylated Aurora A structure (PDB 1MUO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheetham et al., 2002</xref>]) and the activation loop is not visible as commonly observed for kinases lacking phosphorylation of the activation loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zorba et al., 2014</xref>). The second structure (PDB 6CPF; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) adopts the same conformation as the previously published phosphorylated, active structure (PDB 1OL7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bayliss et al., 2003</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the first part of the activation loop could be built, although the B-factors are high. Every hallmark of an active state is seen for this dephosphorylated protein, including the DFG-<italic>in</italic> conformation that is essential for completing the regulatory spine. In contrast, the DFG-loop is in the <italic>out</italic> position for the inactive form of Aurora A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, cyan). In the active, non-phosphorylated structure, electron density is seen in the canonical tighter Mg<sup>2+</sup>-binding site, where the metal ion is coordinated to the α- and β-phosphates of AMPPCP and Asp274. The presence of the metal is supported by the CheckMyMetal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) validation, except that the coordination is incomplete. We surmise that two water molecules, not visible in our data, complete the coordination sphere as is seen in several higher-resolution structures.

This Trp moiety is unique for the Aurora kinase family in the Ser/Thr kinome and its position is suggested to be important for tuning the substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). We used this Trp residue as probe to monitor the DFG flip and drug binding in real time as described below.</p><p>The fact that the inactive and active states are seen in the crystal implies that both are sampled; however, it does not deliver information about the relative populations or interconversion rates. Therefore, we set out to monitor the conformational exchange of the DFG-<italic>in</italic>/<italic>out</italic> flip in solution. Owing to the reported importance of the DFG flip for activity, regulation and drug design, there have been extensive efforts to characterize this conformational equilibrium by computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badrinarayan and Sastry, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barakat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sarvagalla and Coumar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shukla et al., 2014</xref>). The general notion of these computational studies is that in the absence of phosphorylation the inactive form of the kinase is most favored, in agreement with experimental evidence. Nevertheless, short-lived excursions to the active state are observed.</p><p>As an experimental approach, NMR spectroscopy is an obvious choice; however efforts on several Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases led to the general conclusion that the activation loop, including the DFG motif and most of the active-site residues, cannot be detected due to exchange broadening, and at best can only be seen after binding of drugs that stabilize conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campos-Olivas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Langer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vajpai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vogtherr et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>[<sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N]-TROSY-HSQC experiments on uniformly <sup>15</sup>N-labeled samples of Aurora A proved to be no exception: many peaks are missing and only three out of four tryptophan side chain indole signals are seen in the 2D spectra of a [<sup>15</sup>N]-Trp labeled sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Therefore, we sought a strategy to overcome this general problem of exchange broadening that hampers the detection of the DFG equilibrium. Aurora A was produced containing 5-fluoro-tryptophan residues to allow for one-dimensional <sup>19</sup>F spectroscopy to deal with exchange broadening while providing sensitivity close to proton NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kitevski-LeBlanc and Prosser, 2012</xref>). Now, we observe as expected four peaks in our NMR spectra for apo- and AMPPCP-bound wild-type Aurora A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). A deconvolution of the spectrum yields almost identical integral values for all four peaks, whereas the linewidth of one resonance is approximately 5-fold larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, purple signal). This broad peak is a prime candidate to originate from Trp277, directly adjacent to the DFG-loop. The W277L mutation confirmed our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and the extensive line broadening of this signal in a one-dimensional spectrum is consistent with its absence in the [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N]-TROSY-HSQC spectrum. Of note, the W277L mutant is still active, as confirmed by a kinase assay, most likely because this Trp is not conserved in Ser/Thr kinases, where a Leu residue is found at that position for several Ser/Thr family members. Mutating any of the other, more conserved Trp residues resulted in insoluble proteins. The broad line shape for the Trp277 peak hints at severe exchange broadening in the surrounding of the DFG-loop and is consistent with the high B-factors for Trp277 and its neighboring residues observed in all crystal structures described here. Determination of relative populations and rate constants of interconversion is not possible from this data, but this missing piece of information was obtained by stopped-flow kinetics of drug binding.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36656.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NMR spectra indicate extensive dynamics of the DFG-loop.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The four tryptophan residues in Aurora A are shown on the structure (PDB 4C3R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zorba et al., 2014</xref>]) in stick representation; Trp277 in the DFGW-loop is highlighted in red.

We hypothesize that the lack of this step in our kinetic traces is due to a too small amplitude of this phase, or not observable because of photobleaching having a bigger effect at the longer measurement times. To lessen potential photobleaching, we reduced the enzyme concentration and increased the temperature to 35°C.

To resolve this issue, we repeated the Aurora A–Gleevec experiment at 25°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) and obtained reliable rate constants (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf37"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.09 ± 0.01 s<sup>−1</sup> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf38"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.06 ± 0.005 s<sup>−1</sup>) for the conformational selection step in Aurora A, which will be used as ‘knowns’ in what follows. We hypothesize that the conformational selection step reflects the interconversion between inactive/active conformations and is correlated with the DFG-<italic>out</italic> and -<italic>in</italic> position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The following observations support our hypothesis: (i) two crystal structures for the apo-protein show Trp277 in very different environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), (ii) Danusertib has been proposed to selectively bind to the DFG-<italic>out</italic> conformation based on a co-crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fancelli et al., 2006</xref>), and (iii) the same slow step is observed for binding of both Gleevec and Danusertib.</p><p>Next, the dissociation kinetics for Danusertib was measured by fluorescence and appeared to be extremely slow with an observed slow-off rate of (3.2 ± 0.3) × 10<sup>−4</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Rationalization of complex binding kinetics cannot be done anymore by visual inspection and kinetic intuition, which can, in fact, be misleading.

It is an orthogonal technique that sidesteps notable issues associated with fluorescence methods (e.g., photobleaching and inner-filter effects).

In other words, inhibitors take advantage of the inherent plasticity of the enzyme that is required for its activity and regulation. The main difference between ATP and inhibitor binding is the rate constant for the reverse induced-fit step (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf95"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>). In the case of ATP, this rate is much faster and, therefore, does not significantly increase the overall affinity. Faster conformational changes and weaker binding are of course prerequisites for efficient turnover; whereas slow conformational changes, particularly the reverse induced-fit step, are at the heart of action for an efficient drug, because it results in tight binding and a long lifetime on the target. In summary, binding of different ligands to the ATP-binding site, such as nucleotides or ATP-competitive inhibitors, is comprised of the physical binding step followed by an induced-fit step. By definition, it is the nature of the induced-fit step that varies for the different ligands since it happens as a result of ligand binding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Characterizing the detailed kinetic mechanisms of drug binding is not just an academic exercise but delivers fundamental knowledge for developing selective inhibitors with high affinity. An induced-fit step turns out to be key for all tight-binding inhibitors studied. From our results on Aurora A kinase presented here and earlier data on Tyrosine-kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agafonov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>), we propose that this may be a general mechanism for different kinases and multiple inhibitors, thereby providing a platform for future computational and experimental efforts in rational drug design. Albeit, we note that verification of this proposition requires a larger sampling of small molecules and different protein kinases throughout the kinome.</p><p>The ‘use’ of a highly-skewed equilibrium towards E*:D for a promising drug is logical for the following reasons: (i) it increases the affinity for the drug by this coupled equilibrium, (ii) it prolongs the residence time of the drug on the target due to the often slow reverse rate, (iii) it is specific for each drug as it happens after the drug binding, and (iv) it can add selectivity for the targets because it likely involves residues more remote from the active site. An increased drug residence time has significant pharmacological advantages as it can lead to a prolonged biological effect, a decrease of side effects, and a lower risk of metabolic drug modification. Such inhibitors have long been described as slow tight-binding inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Copeland, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Copeland et al., 2006</xref>). The concept of the advantageous roles of induced-fit steps is based on simple thermodynamics and protein flexibility, and is, therefore, likely of relevance for drug design to other targets outside of the kinome.</p><p>Additionally, our data provides unique insight into the extensively discussed DFG flip. Combining X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and stopped-flow kinetics of drug binding establish the nature of this DFG flip both structurally, thermodynamically and kinetically, and resolves the longstanding question of its role for drug affinity and selectivity. Selective binding of a specific DFG-state by Gleevec has been first proposed as the reason for selectivity towards Abl. This conformational selection principle has ever since been at the center of drug discovery for many kinases, including Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badrinarayan and Sastry, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu and Gray, 2006</xref>). Based on our results, we argue that conformational selection of the DFG-state by ATP-competitive inhibitors is a mistakenly pursued concept in drug design for the following reasons: (i) conformational selection by definition weakens the overall ligand affinity, (ii) active site binders are automatically inhibitors, therefore selective binding to a specific DFG-state has no advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badrinarayan and Sastry, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu and Gray, 2006</xref>), (iii) kinases interconvert between both states. High selectivity gained by DFG-state selective binding could only be achieved in the scenario of a highly skewed population towards the binding-competent state for one kinase relative to all others, which is unfounded.</p><p>Our results exemplify why rational drug design is so challenging. The characterization of the complete free-energy landscape of drug binding is needed, which will require more sophisticated computational approaches guided by experimental data such as provided in our study. A good illustration of this point are the computational reports that focused on the DFG flip as a key determinant drug selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badrinarayan and Sastry, 2014</xref>) that now have been ruled out by our kinetic measurements. Our data suggest that future design efforts should be focusing on understanding and exploiting induced-fit steps. To this end, the different dynamic personalities of kinases or, more general, drug targets need to be investigated at atomic resolution and used to guide small-molecule design. The findings presented here are encouraging for developing selective inhibitors even for kinases with very similar folds and drug binding pockets since the action does not happen on a single structural element of the protein, but on a complex energy landscape that is unique to each kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning, expression and purification of dephosphorylated Aurora A (122-403) and inhibiting monobody</title><p>Dephosphorylated Aurora A proteins were expressed and purified as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zorba et al., 2014</xref>) and analyzed by mass spectrometry to confirm their phosphorylation state.

All chemicals were purchased from GE Healthcare, unless otherwise stated. The protocols in the WAVE control software for conditioning of the chip, immobilization of proteins and performing kinetics experiments were followed. In short, the polycarboxylate chip (PCH) was activated by injection of a 1:1 mixture with final concentrations of 200 mM N-ethyl-N’-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and 50 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), followed by streptavidin immobilization (50 μg/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate pH 5.0). Unreacted sites on the chip were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine pH 8.0.

Biotinylated T288V Aurora A (70 μg/mL) was immobilized on the PCH-streptavidin chip with 10 μL/min injection and 15 s injection duration over channel 1 only (channel 2 was used as reference channel). All experiments were run in 50 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM TCEP, 0.03 mg/mL BSA, 0.005% Tween-20, pH 7.30 as running buffer. Binding experiments were evaluated over a range of Danusertib (0.13–66.67 nM), AT9283 (0.03–64.8 nM), and Gleevec (0.37–40 μM) concentrations. Gleevec binding experiments contained 5% DMSO in the running buffer (see above) to enhance Gleevec’s solubility. Double-jump experiments of Aurora A/drugs were performed by injecting 1 μM Danusertib or AT9283 with 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 2 s injection duration for Danusertib and 1 and 3 s injection duration for AT9283 followed by a 60 s dissociation duration per injection. The slow-off experiments were performed by injecting 5 μM Danusertib or AT9283 with 5–10 s injection duration (to fully saturate Aurora A) followed by a 180 s injection of buffer to remove the excess drug and the dissociation was measured for a duration of 10800 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Spectrofluorometer experiments</title><p>The spectrofluorometer FluoroMax-4 (Horiba Scientific) with temperature controller was used to study the slow-off rate of Aurora A with Danusertib at 25°C. For this experiment, a solution containing 30 nM Aurora A and 30 nM Danusertib was pre-incubated for an hour, before diluting 30-fold into degassed buffer (ratio 1:30). A significant decrease in the fluorescence intensity of Aurora A (excitation at 295 nm, emission at 340 nm) can be seen due to the Danusertib release. The fluorescence signal was recorded every 160 s for a duration of six hours using the photobleaching minimization option that will close the shutter after each acquisition. A control experiment was performed, using the same experimental conditions, but without drug in order to account for photobleaching.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Overall dissociation constant

Increasing amounts of Aurora A/Danusertib complex (4 nM Aurora A and 150 nM Danusertib) or Aurora A/mant-ATP (1 µM Aurora A and 2 mM mant-ATP) were titrated into an Aurora A solution (4 nM and 1 µM Aurora A for experiments with Danusertib and mant-ATP, respectively). To measure Danusertib affinity, the excitation wavelength was 295 nm (5 nm bandwidth) and emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 450 nm (20 nm bandwidth) in increments of 2 nm and the temperature was maintained at 25°C. For the mant-ATP experiment, the dissociation constant was measured at 10°C using fluorescence energy transfer from tryptophan residues in Aurora A to mant-ATP by setting the excitation wavelength to 290 nm (5 nm bandwidth) and collecting the emission intensity from 310 to 550 nm (5 nm bandwidth) in increments of 2 nm. A control experiment in the absence of Aurora A was performed using the same experimental settings and used to correct for the mant-ATP interference. In all experiments, a 5 min equilibration time was used after each addition of Aurora A/Danusertib complex or Aurora A/mant-ATP complex.</p><p>The fluorescence intensity at 368 nm versus Danusertib concentration or the change in fluorescence at 450 nm (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf111"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>450</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) versus mant-ATP concentration was fitted to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 6</xref> using Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear fitting algorithm included in KaleidaGraph to obtain the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf112"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>.<disp-formula id="equ7"><label>(6)</label><mml:math id="m7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf113"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf114"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are the fluorescence and initial fluorescence intensities, respectively. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf115"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf116"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are the total concentration of the drug or mant-ATP and the Aurora A, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank C.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: John Kuriyan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript by the Kern group presents an important advance in our understanding of why different ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors have dramatically different binding properties for the same kinase. The authors use an elegant combination of kinetic measurements using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, NMR, and X-ray crystallography, to identify discrete conformational states of the Ser/Thr kinase Aurora A, and to correlate the adoption of these states with drug binding. While the flipping of the DFG motif in the activation loop of kinases is often noted as a commonly-observed conformational change that impacts drug binding, here, the authors identify additional conformational changes, on top of the DFG flip, that impact the fast or slow off-rates of different drugs for Aurora A. The nature of these conformational changes is not defined in the paper, but the paper makes an important contribution by establishing these additional conformational changes are important for Aurora, as well as for the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases for which the Kern group first established this property.</p><p>Collectively, these experiments shed light on the nuanced interplay of inhibitor binding and kinase dynamics, and provide an experimental approach to dissect kinetic mechanisms of drug binding that could play an important role in future kinase inhibitor design strategies. The main conclusion is that the dynamical response to inhibitor binding that was established earlier (by this group) for the tyrosine kinases Src and Abl also applies to Aurora, a Ser/Thr kinase. As such, this work merits publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, after revision. While revising the manuscript, the authors should pay careful attention to placing this work in proper context within what is already known and appreciated about how kinases respond to inhibitors. Also, the work would be strengthened by being clearer about what is actually learned, rather than overstating the conclusions. This work advances the field in an important way, and would be valued all the more if it represented past insights more appropriately. In this regard, the title of the paper should be made more specific, and not imply that a broad cross-section of kinases have been studied, or that a single mechanism has been uniquely defined.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The way the paper is written the reader may get the mistaken impression that the DFG conformational change is irrelevant (or less important) for drug selectivity.</p><p>Indeed, although previous work from the Kern group established that an induced conformational change after Gleevec binding to Abl, but not to Src, contributes to differential inhibition of these two kinases, it remains true that Gleevec can only bind to either of these kinases in the DFG-out state. Prior to the original observation of the DFG flip in Abl kinase, by the Kuriyan group, the DFG-out state was not known to be an accessible conformational state of protein kinases, let alone one that could bind a drug.</p><p>Related to this point, the authors aim to describe a new, generalizable paradigm for kinase-inhibitor interactions, one that decreases the importance of the DFG-flip. While this is intriguing, it awaits further analysis of the conformational landscape of other kinases, in the presence and absence of inhibitors. The authors should consider rephrasing sections so that they do not downplay the significance of the DFG-out conformation in drug binding. In other words, nothing that has followed since the original crystal structure of Abl bound to Gleevec (Schindler et al.) has overturned the conclusion drawn by the Kuriyan group that Gleevec specifically recognizes a DFG-flipped conformation of the kinase. What is now appreciated is that the DFG-flip is not the only requirement for drug binding, and many (if not all) kinases can undergo this conformational change. The way this paper is written, this is not obvious. Also, at points where the &quot;seminal&quot; observation of Gleevec selectivity is described, the authors cite much more recent papers, rather than the original discoveries. The work from the Kuriyan group is cited, but in a throw-away sentence in the middle of the paper.</p><p>2) The authors somewhat mischaracterize our general understanding of the role of activation loop phosphorylation. While it is true that many seminal studies have established a correlation between activation loop phosphorylation and the adoption of an active, rather inactive configuration, several studies have actually suggested that this is a conformational selection, rather than induced fit, phenomenon. Indeed, some protein kinases lacking activation loop phosphorylation have been crystalized in an active conformation, and molecular dynamics calculations suggest that this the active state is accessible to the protein kinases in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation, albeit at a higher energetic cost (see work by Benoit Roux, and also Vijay Pande). Most recently, the work by Ruff et al. on Arora A (2018), the same kinase studied in this report, has convincingly shown that activation loop phosphorylation does not preclude access to an inactive conformation in this kinase.</p><p>3) The issue of an unphosphorylated kinase domain adopting different conformations in crystals is presented as surprising, but this is well appreciated. These points were also made in Levinson et al. (2006) (not cited here) where the authors present &quot;crystal structures of the Abl kinase domain bound to substrate-mimicking ATP analog-peptide conjugates that represent four distinct conformations of the unphosphorylated kinase domain&quot;. The idea that two different conformations can be found in the same crystal is also not new. Crystallographically, this was noted in Seeliger et al., 2007, who report a crystal structure in which two molecules of Src are found, one bound to Gleevec, and the other in an active conformation. Given these points, the authors could consider rewording parts of the first two paragraphs of the Results section so as not to suggest that their observation of an active-like unphosphorylated kinase is unexpected.</p><p>4) The authors introduce the paper by pointing out that it remains a challenge to understand why certain drugs are selective for individual or few kinases out of the whole kinome (~500 related enzymes). They present the work in this manuscript with the intention of solving this problem. The work presented here, however, only explains how different inhibitors interact with one individual kinase, not why the same inhibitor might have differential binding properties for different kinases. This crossing of concepts is misleading to the readers.</p><p>5) The fact that kinases can undergo a conformational change that results in remarkably slow off-rates for inhibitors has been appreciated from work such as the binding of Tykerb to EGFR (Wood et al., 2004). This point should be made in the revised paper, and the appropriate papers cited.</p><p>6) The concept that the DFG flip is not the sole determining factor in determining the binding of Gleevec to Abl vs Src was first established by determining the structures of high-affinity compounds bound to Src in a DFG-flipped conformation by Seeliger et al. 2009, Cancer Research and Dar et al., 2008, Chemical Biology. Neither paper is cited in the present paper, which gives readers the misleading impression that the field was not aware of this fact prior to the Kern contributions.</p><p>7) As noted earlier, a related paper was just published in <italic>eLife</italic> by Ruff et al. (2018), examining the impact of activation loop phosphorylation on kinase dynamics and the DFG-flip. In that report, the investigators conclude that Aurora A can sample the DFG-in and DFG-out states with and without activation loop phosphorylation, and that another drug, SNS-314 induces further conformational changes upon binding the DFG-in state of Arora A. These results are pertinent to several points in the manuscript reviewed here and should be discussed.</p><p>8) The paper relies heavily on elegant kinetic studies using stopped-flow fluorescence measurements, and these measurements yield multi-step kinetic models for drug binding. These models are crucial to this study, but multi-step reactions are hard to intuitively understand. It would be worthwhile for the authors to model and graphically depict the outcomes of several scenarios varying one or two parameters in their kinetic models at a time, to show why, for example, conformational selection between the DFG-in and DFG-out states does not substantially contribute to Danusertib binding, whereas the induced fit step does. Similar analyses could be done for the other inhibitors as well and would greatly facilitate the readers' understanding of these important concepts.</p><p>9) It might be interesting to examine the kinetic mechanism of one drug against a few different kinases. The authors already did this in their previous paper, comparing Gleevec binding with Src and Abl, and now with Aurora A in this manuscript. To infer that their observed induced fit phenomena underly a general principle of drug binding, perhaps the authors could compare Danusertib binding kinetics for Aurora A with a few other kinases. If this is not feasible, then the revised manuscript should state that the generality of the principles awaits further study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36656.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] While revising the manuscript, the authors should pay careful attention to placing this work in proper context within what is already known and appreciated about how kinases respond to inhibitors.

The seminal work by the Kuriyan lab on Gleevec binding to Abl and Src, and other examples by various research groups, have provided unequivocal evidence for this fact. We certainly did not intend to downplay any of these contributions nor the significance of the orientation of DFG-motif in the physical drug-binding step. We had elected to cite reviews and several of the more recent papers, but the reviewers are correct that we should include more of the original research papers. We have now added these references. A conformational-selection mechanism alone has however proved insufficient to explain drug affinity and selectivity, and in fact, will by definition weaken the overall affinity. We show here (and in our earlier work on Gleevec) that conformational dynamics after drug binding plays the crucial role in understanding overall selectivity and affinity. We realize that our original wording created some misunderstanding and have edited the manuscript to reflect this sentiment more clearly; in the introduction it now states:</p><p>“Seminal work by the Kuriyan lab demonstrated that Gleevec can only bind to an inactive DFG (for Asp-Phe-Gly) loop conformation in the “out-conformation” due to steric clash of the active, DFG-in conformation (Nagar et al., 2002; Schindler et al., 2000; Seeliger et al., 2007). […] Recent quantitative binding kinetics combined with ancestral sequence reconstruction put forward a mechanism where an induced-fit step after drug binding is the key determinant for Gleevec’s selectivity (Agafonov, Wilson, Otten, Buosi, and Kern, 2014; Wilson et al., 2015), and fully recapitulates the binding affinities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors somewhat mischaracterize our general understanding of the role of activation loop phosphorylation. While it is true that many seminal studies have established a correlation between activation loop phosphorylation and the adoption of an active, rather inactive configuration, several studies have actually suggested that this is a conformational selection, rather than induced fit, phenomenon. Indeed, some protein kinases lacking activation loop phosphorylation have been crystalized in an active conformation, and molecular dynamics calculations suggest that this the active state is accessible to the protein kinases in the absence of activation loop phosphorylation, albeit at a higher energetic cost (see work by Benoit Roux, and also Vijay Pande). Most recently, the work by Ruff et al. on Arora A (2018), the same kinase studied in this report, has convincingly shown that activation loop phosphorylation does not preclude access to an inactive conformation in this kinase.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly did not intend to mischaracterize the understanding of the role of activation loop phosphorylation. We describe the general notion from X-ray crystallography data that unphosphorylated, apo Aurora A kinase is mostly found in an inactive conformation, whereas an active conformation is observed when the activation loop is phosphorylated or upon TPX2 binding. Whether the interconversion from an inactive to the active conformation happens before (i.e., conformational selection) or after (i.e., induced fit) phosphorylation of the kinase is a question of flux. This can only be addressed by measuring the kinetics of Aurora A phosphorylation in concert with its conformational interconversion between the inactive and active conformation. In other words, a kinetic flux analysis for protein phosphorylation would be required, similarly to the kinetic flux analysis performed here for the inhibitors. This topic is outside of the scope of this manuscript and not addressed here, and, to the best of our knowledge, such kinetics analysis has not been reported thus far.</p><p>We fully agree with the reviewers that in the absence of phosphorylation the protein can sample an active conformation. In fact, the data in our manuscript on the dephosphorylated kinase provides three lines of evidence for this: (1) structures of apo and AMPPCP-bound Aurora A crystallized in the active conformation, (2) stopped-flow fluorescence data showing the presence of a conformational-selection mechanism, and (3) NMR spectra indicating exchange between different states. We have expanded the section describing the computational efforts and included more references:</p><p>“Owing to the reported importance of the DFG flip for activity, regulation and drug design, there have been extensive efforts to characterize this conformational equilibrium by computation (Badrinarayan and Sastry, 2014; Barakat et al., 2013; Meng, Lin, and Roux, 2015; Meng, Pond, and Roux, 2017; Sarvagalla and Coumar, 2015; Shukla, Meng, Roux, and Pande, 2014). The general notion of these computational studies is that in the absence of phosphorylation the inactive form of the kinase is most favored, in agreement with experimental evidence. Nevertheless, short-lived excursions to the active state are observed.”</p><p>More recently, experiments on Aurora A kinase described by Cyphers et al. (2017), Gilburt et al. (2017) and Ruff et al. (2018) report on the position of the activation loop of (un)phosphorylated kinase in the absence/presence of various small molecules. For monitoring the DFG-loop, an IR probe was chemically incorporated into a position that hydrogen-bonds to the DFG-loop in the wild-type protein, resulting in a large reduction in kinase activity. We therefore opt for caution in the interpretation of these data in respect of the DFG-loop conformation for the wild-type protein. Our results are consistent with their observations in that Aurora A samples several activation loop conformations in its unphosphorylated form and that binding of nucleotides merely affects the equilibrium constant (Cyphers et al., 2017). Since our manuscript only pertains to dephosphorylated Aurora A, we have no data to compare to the experiments described by Gilburt et al. and Ruff et al.that report on phosphorylated Aurora A.We have extended the first paragraph of the Results section to include these more recent papers:</p><p>“X-ray structures, however, provide merely static snapshots of possible kinase conformations that do not necessarily reflect the situation in solution. In fact, recent experimental data postulate that phosphorylation of Aurora A does not “lock” the kinase in the active conformation, and that the activation-loop still exhibits conformational dynamics (Gilburt et al., 2017; Ruff et al., 2018). On the other hand, X-ray crystallography provides high-resolution structural data that cannot readily be obtained from FRET or EPR and IR spectroscopy.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The issue of an unphosphorylated kinase domain adopting different conformations in crystals is presented as surprising, but this is well appreciated. These points were also made in Levinson et al. (2006) (not cited here) where the authors present &quot;crystal structures of the Abl kinase domain bound to substrate-mimicking ATP analog-peptide conjugates that represent four distinct conformations of the unphosphorylated kinase domain&quot;. The idea that two different conformations can be found in the same crystal is also not new.

We have reworded the paragraph owing to the well-known fact that different conformations out of the structural ensemble have been captured by X-ray crystallography on a number of systems before. We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and we have included additional references.</p><p>“Our results are consistent with other crystallographic studies on wild-type, dephosphorylated Aurora A in its apo or nucleotide bound state, where the kinase was also found in the active conformation (Gustafson et al., 2014; Janecek et al., 2016; Nowakowski et al., 2002).”</p><p>We further clarify that in our case we have “Two crystals from the same crystallization well”, not two different conformations within one crystal, or two molecules in the asymmetric unit that are different in structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors introduce the paper by pointing out that it remains a challenge to understand why certain drugs are selective for individual or few kinases out of the whole kinome (~500 related enzymes).

This crossing of concepts is misleading to the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that the work presented here explains how different inhibitors interact with Aurora A kinase and not the whole kinome. We note, however, that the inhibitor Gleevec was used both for Aurora A and in our earlier work on Src, Abl, and their evolutionary intermediates (Agafonov et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2015). We find it interesting that the physical binding step of Gleevec to these different kinases is virtually unaltered and that the major contribution for a tight-binder is due to the induced-fit step after binding. The critical role of the dynamics in the drug-bound state holds true when looking at the binding of different small molecules to the Aurora A kinase. We fully agree that the presented results raise the interest to extend our knowledge of the interaction of other inhibitors with a broader cross-section of the kinome (see also point 9, added to the Discussion), which we hope to provoke with our work. We thank the reviewers for bringing up our misleading wording. We have changed the text accordingly and made the comparison for Gleevec binding to the different protein kinases clearer in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The fact that kinases can undergo a conformational change that results in remarkably slow off-rates for inhibitors has been appreciated from work such as the binding of Tykerb to EGFR (Wood et al., 2004). This point should be made in the revised paper, and the appropriate papers cited.</p></disp-quote><p>While we referred in the Discussion section to literature reviews on the “drug-target residence time”, we can certainly make this more specific and describe some of the earlier work on kinases. We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and have included this in the revised manuscript in the Results section when describing the danusertib experiments:</p><p>“Earlier examples of protein kinases that also show remarkable slow off-rates, presumably caused by conformational changes, include the epidermal growth factor receptors (Berezov, Zhang, Greene, and Murali, 2001; Wood et al., 2004) and CDK8 (Schneider, Bottcher, Huber, Maskos, and Neumann, 2013) amongst others (Willemsen-Seegers et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, we present here for the first time a detailed stopped-flow kinetics analysis for Aurora A that unequivocally shows the slow off-rate is caused by the conformational change within the drug-bound state, and not the dissociation step.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The concept that the DFG flip is not the sole determining factor in determining the binding of Gleevec to Abl vs Src was first established by determining the structures of high-affinity compounds bound to Src in a DFG-flipped conformation by Seeliger et al. 2009, Cancer Research and Dar et al., 2008, Chemical Biology. Neither paper is cited in the present paper, which gives readers the misleading impression that the field was not aware of this fact prior to the Kern contributions.</p></disp-quote><p>It was indeed recognized earlier that the DFG-flip alone could not rationalize the binding of Gleevec to Abl/Src, and other hypotheses were put forward. We had no intent to represent this otherwise and, for clarification, we have modified the introduction to reflect this (see under point 1). Here, we provide now the relative contribution of the individual steps in the coupled equilibria for the binding of inhibitors to Aurora A via quantitative kinetic experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) As noted earlier, a related paper was just published in eLife by Ruff et al.

In panels A and B, we change the equilibrium constant for the conformational selection mechanism (K<sub>1</sub>) or induced-fit step (K<sub>3</sub>) by two orders of magnitude in both directions, starting from unity. For comparison, the K<sub>D</sub> value is shown when only the physical drug-binding step would be present (the value for K<sub>2</sub>, 14 𝜇M, is taken from our stopped-flow experiments, see Figure 5). In panel C we show the effect of changing the same equilibrium constants for the combined, four-state model (see Figure 5I, Equation 4). Both K<sub>1</sub> and K<sub>3</sub> are changed by two orders of magnitude around the experimentally determined values of 0.67 and 3.7·10<sup>-5</sup>, respectively, and the overall K<sub>D</sub> is plotted on the y-axis.
