mainly focus on the muscle tissue reconstruction in vitro, but lack the formation of intramuscular fat, which is a crucial factor in determining taste, texture, and nutritional contents. Therefore, incorporating fat into cultured meat is of superior value. In this study, we employed the myogenic/lipogenic transdifferentiation of chicken fibroblasts in 3D to produce muscle mass and deposit fat into the same cells without the co-culture or mixture of different cells or fat substances. The immortalized chicken embryonic fibroblasts were implanted into the hydrogel scaffold, and the cell proliferation and myogenic transdifferentiation were conducted in 3D to produce the whole-cut meat mimics. Compared to 2D, cells grown in 3D matrix showed elevated myogenesis and collagen production. We further induced fat deposition in the transdifferentiated muscle cells and the triglyceride content could be manipulated to match and exceed the levels of chicken meat. The gene expression analysis indicated that both lineage-specific and multifunctional signalings could contribute to the generation of muscle/fat matrix. Overall, we were able to precisely modulate muscle, fat, and extracellular matrix contents according to balanced or specialized meat preferences. These findings provide new avenues for customized cultured meat production with desired intramuscular fat contents that can be tailored to meet the diverse demands of consumers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>intramuscular fat</kwd><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd><kwd>meat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31771617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Heng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GZC20230775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Ruimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Taishan Scholar Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>202211100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Heng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Scientific Research Innovation Team of Young Scholar of Shandong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Heng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007925</institution-id><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SZYJY2021009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Heng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005196</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SZYJY2021009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Heng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Efficient myogenic and lipogenic transdifferentiation of chicken fibroblasts in 3D culture produces meat with precisely controlled levels of intramuscular fat and extracellular matrix.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cultured meat is an innovative and emerging technique that produces meat directly from cell cultures, potentially providing a high-quality, safe, and stable source of animal protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chriki and Hocquette, 2020</xref>). In comparison to traditional livestock and poultry farming, cultured meat generates fewer greenhouse gases, utilizes less arable land, and causes less animal harm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mattick et al., 2015</xref>). Proper selection of seed cells is one of the keys to the success of cultured meat production. The starting cells must be easily obtainable and be able to proliferate numerous times to enable mass production. While the stem cells like muscle stem cells and pluripotent stem cells have frequently been utilized as the cellular source for cultured meat, these stem cells are rare in the animal body and difficult to obtain and amplify on a large scale. In contrast, the somatic cells, which constitute the body, could be efficiently converted into muscle cells under certain conditions. The fibroblast is one of the most abundant and widely distributed cell types present in the body and could be easily collected via minimally invasive biopsy procedure without sacrificing the farm animals. The fibroblasts can replicate indefinitely in vitro and are amenable to myogenesis, adipogenesis, and chondrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">French et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yin et al., 2010</xref>), which produce muscle, fat, and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that constitute the meat and the associated texture and flavor. Recently, the fibroblast cells from farm animals have been utilized as the source cells for cultured meat production, with or without myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pasitka et al., 2023</xref>), demonstrating the feasibility of somatic cell-derived seed cells as a sustainable and ethical option for cultured meat production.</p><p>We have previously developed a protocol for the controlled transdifferentiation of chicken fibroblasts into myoblasts, which subsequently form multinucleated myotubes and express mature muscle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ren et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, chicken fibroblasts could also be efficiently converted into fat-depositing lipocytes by treating them with chicken serum (CS) medium or other substances such as fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hausman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the induced myogenic and adipogenic competency, along with the inherent fibrogenic collagen-producing ability of chicken fibroblasts, can enable us to simultaneously synthesize muscle, fat, and collagen during the cultured meat production. Nevertheless, further techno-functional research is necessary to precisely control the composition of the end product of fibroblast-derived cultured meat in order to achieve a more balanced and personalized nutritional profile and meet the specific consumer preferences.</p><p>In this study, the chicken fibroblast cells were implanted into the hydrogel scaffold to analyze the 3D cellular dynamics involving cell proliferation and myogenic/adipogenic transdifferentiation. We also optimized the low-serum culture conditions of chicken fibroblasts to reduce the cost of mass production. The myogenic transdifferentiated cells were confirmed to be skeletal muscle lineage but not myofibroblasts. Importantly, the cells were subjected to myogenesis and adipogenesis sequentially in 3D hydrogel matrix to resemble the whole-cut meat with the controllable intramuscular fat and collagen content. By using transdifferentiation strategies, the depositing ratio of fat into the cultured meat could be manually and precisely adjusted, allowing the nutrients to be naturally synthesized from the organized muscle structure. This demonstrates the potential for manipulating cultured meat to meet consumer preferences for specific fat content and texture.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chicken fibroblasts proliferate stably in low-serum conditions</title><p>The chicken fibroblast cells were chosen as the ideal cell source for cultured meat production because they can propagate indefinitely and undergo myogenesis whenever the induction is provided. These cells can be readily obtained from fertilized eggs without the need to harvest animals. We have previously constructed an inducible myogenic transdifferentiation system in chicken fibroblasts with the stable integration of Tet-On-MyoD cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ren et al., 2022</xref>). The MyoD is the key myogenic transcription factor, and the chicken fibroblasts could be converted into striated and elongated myotubes (myofibers) upon forced expression of MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weintraub et al., 1989</xref>). The Tet-On-MyoD cassette enables the inducible and reversible activation of chicken MyoD factor, and in the current fibroblast cells, the myogenic transdifferentiation is only switched on by adding doxycycline (DOX). Without the DOX treatment, the control chicken fibroblast cells (Tet-On-MyoD) do not differ from the wild-type cells in terms of morphology, proliferation rate, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Hence, as a proof-of-concept experiment, we utilized this inducible myogenic fibroblast cell line to develop protocols for cultured chicken meat production.</p><p>To achieve sustainable and cost-effective cell production, it is essential to minimize the serum usage in the culture medium. Therefore, we implemented a progressive serum reduction approach to acclimate the cells in the prospect of obtaining a stable cell source that can be propagated in low serum concentrations. In the initial experiment, we used 12% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 1640 basal medium, which served as the control group. The results showed that the cells were able to proliferate normally at 6, 3, and 1.5% serum concentrations, but at decreasing rates as shown by the EdU assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We also tested the CS as an alternative to bovine serum in order to avoid cross-species contamination of animal derivatives. The results showed that chicken fibroblasts could proliferate stably in the 1% CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and the cell populations multiplied three times in 3 d as demonstrated by the CCK-8 assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the low-serum medium can effectively support the stable propagation of chicken fibroblasts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chicken fibroblasts proliferate stably in low-serum conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cellular morphology and EdU staining of chicken fibroblasts under different low-serum conditions.

To simulate the 3D natural growth environment of cells in vivo, we utilized the gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)-based hydrogels as scaffolds for chicken fibroblasts. GelMA hydrogel can form a stable and porous structure for cell implantation and is commonly used in tissue engineering because of its great biocompatibility and mechanical tenability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pepelanova et al., 2018</xref>). We created hydrogels with varying concentrations at 3, 5, 7, and 9wt%, and then observed their surface characteristics when immersed in culture medium using an emission scanning electron microscope. The porosity was measured to be 83.27, 65.01, 62.47, and 57.96%, respectively. Thus, the higher the mass concentration of hydrogels, the tighter the 3D mesh structure formed and the smaller the porosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The pore diameters in the scaffolds were determined to range from 3 µm<sup>2</sup> to 100 µm<sup>2</sup>, showing the biggest pore size in 3% hydrogel and the smallest in 9% hydrogel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, the porosity and pore size of the scaffold could be adjusted to achieve optimal physical strength and nutrients delivery that are suited for long-term cell culturation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>3D culture of chicken fibroblasts in gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Microscopic images of GelMA hydrogels at different concentrations (3, 5, 7, and 9 wt%) taken by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and their corresponding simplified maps of pore distributions.

The cells adhered to the gels immediately and started to exhibit typical extended and irregular fibroblast cell morphology after 1 d, indicating the hydrogel’s good biological compatibility with chicken fibroblast cells. However, the 3% hydrogel collapsed in the medium 2 d after cell implantation and thus did not support the long-term cell growth. We continued to monitor the 3D cell proliferation and found that the cells successfully propagated in 5, 7, and 9% hydrogels for the entire duration of the experiment. Among the tested hydrogels, the 5% concentration was found to be the best option for cell attachment and growth as shown by the densest cellular structure formed, and thus be utilized for the subsequent analysis.</p><p>Due to the challenges of observing and distinguishing the cells and pores within the hydrogel scaffold using the brightfield of ordinary light microscopy, we then used the PKH26 fluorescent cellular dye to accurately observe the cellular morphology and quantify the cell numbers. The cells were firstly labeled with PKH26 in 2D culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and then transferred into the gel matrix. Upon implantation, the cells appeared mostly round on the first day, but gradually extended and expanded within the hydrogel scaffold. By the fifth day, most of the cells were elongated with irregular shape and short tentacles and packed tightly, and by the ninth day they multiplied more than 15 times and formed dense fibrous bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). We also examined the proliferation dynamics of the cells in 3D scaffold via the EdU assay. The proliferation efficiency of chicken fibroblast cells gradually increased over time in 3D culture and reached replication levels even higher than those in 2D culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E,F</xref>). This result indicates that 3D culture conditions provide a more favorable environment for cell growth. Moreover, when the 3D cultured cells were detached from the gel by collagenase dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and seeded back in 2D monolayer culture plates, the cells again exhibited similar morphology but slightly increased proliferation capacity compared to the original fibroblasts in 2D conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Thus, the chicken fibroblast cells cultured in 3D maintain their normal physiological characteristics and we continue to stimulate the cellular myogenesis and lipogenesis to prepare them for cultured meat production.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transdifferentiation of chicken fibroblasts into muscle cells in 3D</title><p>Despite the complexity of the composition of fresh meat and processed products, muscle cells are the major and indispensable component of meat foods. The muscle cell-derived myotubes (myofibers) provide a rich source of proteins and nutrients and constitute the meat texture. To this end, we aimed to transform the chicken fibroblast into muscle cells through the established MyoD overexpression protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ren et al., 2022</xref>). We first tested and optimized the myogenic transdifferentiation parameters in 2D culture through the DOX-induced MyoD expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed elongated multinucleated myotubes and abundant expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) after 3 d of myogenic induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). The ‘serum deprivation’ protocol was the classical strategy to stimulate terminal myogenic differentiation in myoblasts of various species including chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakashima et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we examined the myogenic transdifferentiation efficiency (myotube fusion index) in the chicken fibroblast cells overexpressing MyoD in combination with reduced concentrations of bovine or horse serums. However, we found that reducing serum concentrations did not increase the myotube formation but instead caused massive cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Therefore, it seems that the ‘serum deprivation’ could not further improve the myogenic transdifferentiation in chicken fibroblast cells and a simple MyoD overexpression strategy is sufficient for efficient production of mature muscle cells.</p><p>After demonstrating the feasibility of induced transdifferentiation of chicken fibroblasts into muscle cells in 2D culture, we continued myogenic transdifferentiation in 3D to simulate the construction of concrete whole-cut meat. The cells were inoculated into a hydrogel scaffold and allowed to proliferate for 7 d before inducing transdifferentiation with MyoD overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We used whole-amount MHC immunofluorescence staining to examine the myotube formation directly inside the gel. We identified abundant multinucleate MHC<sup>+</sup> myotubes at multiple focal planes within the gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>), indicating successful myogenic transdifferentiation of 3D cultured chicken fibroblasts.

With the assistance of confocal Z-stack analysis, the stacked images showed densely packed MHC<sup>+</sup> myotubes from a piece of cellular hydrogel complex at a depth of 68 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The separate XY axis views of the orthogonal projections at different depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and a multiangle video (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>) also showed that several myotubes were aligned together.

We also evaluated the expression of several myogenic markers by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). MyoG (myogenin) is a transcription factor regulating terminal skeletal muscle differentiation and could be induced by MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2006</xref>).

All myogenic factors, including MyoG, MYH6, and MCK, significantly increased upon transdifferentiation in both 2D and 3D. In addition, the transdifferentiated cells exhibited significantly higher expression of MyoG and MCK in 3D conditions compared to that in 2D, indicating more robust myogenic differentiation and maturation of cells in the 3D microenvironment.

To confirm that the myogenic transdifferentiated cells were indeed skeletal muscle cells but not the myofibroblasts, we utilized a panel of cell lineage-specific markers to delineate the cell conversion progress and determine the cellular identity of fibroblasts, myoblasts, and myofibroblasts, respectively. The immunofluorescence staining of 3D cultured cells showed that the muscle-specific intermediate filament Desmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paulin and Li, 2004</xref>) was expressed only in the MyoD-transdifferentiated cells, but not in the original fibroblasts or the embryonic skin-derived myofibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, the classical myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hinz et al., 2007</xref>) was expressed only in myofibroblasts, but not in the fibroblast or the transdifferentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

These results confirmed that the MyoD indeed transdifferentiate the cells toward the skeletal muscle lineage but not the myofibroblast. Furthermore, the RT-qPCR showed that, after myogenic induction in 3D, the skeletal muscle-specific genes Desmin and Six1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Relaix et al., 2013</xref>) were significantly elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), whereas the fibroblast gene Thy-1 was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

The chicken fibroblasts have been reported to be amenable to lipogenesis through various stimuli, including CS, insulin, fatty acids, and retinoic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). We first attempted different lipogenic stimulations on 2D cultured cells and stained them for Oil Red O to visualize and quantify fat deposition in the fibroblasts. Very few scattered Oil Red O signals were found in the treatments consisting of only serums (12.5% FBS, 1% CS, or 2% CS), indicating no lipogenesis during normal proliferation conditions. However, when we added insulin and fatty acids (oleic/linoleic acid) to the medium, lipid droplets in the cells dramatically increased as detected by the Oil Red O staining. After extensive optimization of the concentrations of supplements in the medium, we identified that the 8 µg/ml fatty acids plus 60 µg/ml insulin (abbreviated as FI, F: fatty acids, I: insulin) can induce lipogenesis most efficiently in 2D chicken fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).</p><p>Next, the same lipogenesis induction strategy was applied to the 3D cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The RT-qPCR analysis illustrated the expression of genes involved in lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis was significantly higher in the cells with lipogenic stimulation compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Notably, the genes encoding for PPARγ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma), Gpd1 (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and FABP4 (fatty acid binding protein 4) all showed higher expression in 3D than that in 2D. Interestingly, the expression of Znf423 (zinc finger protein 423), which is a PPARγ transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Longo et al., 2018</xref>), only increased upon lipogenic induction in 3D but not in 2D conditions. It seems that the cells grown in 3D hydrogel showed enhanced lipogenesis compared to the flat surface cultured cells, similar to the myogenic transdifferentiation process in 3D. In addition to the lipogenic induction with fatty acids and insulin (FI), we also validated the use of CS in promoting lipid accumulation as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2021</xref>).

Next, we tried to combine the myogenic and lipogenic stimuli together to modulate the fat deposition in the cultured meat to simulate the various intramuscular fat contents in the conventionally raised meat. Rather than converting fibroblasts into muscle cells and fat cells separately and mixing them later, we adopted a new strategy that can induce de novo lipid deposition in the muscle by first inducing myogenic transdifferentiation and then followed by lipid induction in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

In contrast, the control cells without any induction or with only myogenic stimulation do not show apparent triglyceride accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Therefore, the fat content in the cultured meat could be synthesized in a controlled manner, and then we tried to purposely manipulate the triglyceride contents in the meat matrix by adjusting the potency of adipogenic stimulation. By fine-tuning the concentrations of insulin and fatty acids during lipogenic induction, the triglyceride contents in the final product of cultured meat can precisely reach any customized levels across the range from 1.5 mg/g to 7 mg/g (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), which overlap and surpass the levels in the fresh chicken breast and leg meat. As a result, this strategy greatly expands the diversity and category of cultured meat products, allowing for precise control over intramuscular fat contents to meet consumer preferences.

In theory, the fibroblast should generate abundant ECM to produce a more realistic meat product. We then examined the collagen content in the cultured meat and found that the total collagen protein gradually increased and reached the plateau at 1.59 µg/mg in the final product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Nevertheless, the RT-qPCR showed that the genes encoding the major components of ECM exhibited various expression patterns with the extension of culture time. The expression of COL1A1 (collagen, type I, alpha 1) and COL1A2 (collagen, type I, alpha 2) gradually decreased, whereas the fibronectin increased during the time course of meat synthesis.

To illustrate the relationship between these cell groups, we conducted an unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of the whole transcriptome. The findings revealed that the 3D+FI group clustered distinctly from the others, while the 3D_MyoD and 3D_MyoD + FI groups exhibited greater similarity. Moreover, the 3D_fibroblasts formed a distinct sub-cluster on their own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), suggesting that myogenic or adipogenic transdifferentiation drives these cells away from their original fibroblastic state. The principal component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptomes also showed that distinct trajectories of myogenic and adipogenic transdifferentiation routes were derived from the original fibroblasts and finally integrated together into the myogenic/adipogenic cells (3D) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). It indicates that the myogenic and adipogenic signalings could operate simultaneously and separately during the generation of the culture meat composed of muscle and fat. We also compared the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from ‘3D_MyoD vs 3D_fibroblast’, ‘3D+FI vs 3D_fibroblast’, and ‘3D_MyoD + FI vs 3D_fibroblast’. The results showed that the majority (78%) of DEGs in the 3D_MyoD+FI are overlapped with 3D_MyoD and 3D+FI, indicating that sequential myogenic/adipogenic induction in 3D_MyoD+FI is consistent with myogenic or adipogenic function individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The heat map also highlighted the representative myogenic or adipogenic genes that were upregulated in the myogenic, adipogenic, or myogenic/adipogenic cells constitute the culture meat. In contrast, the fibroblast genes were diminished during the transdifferentiation, confirming the loss of fibroblast identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). In addition, the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of upregulated DEGs in 3D_MyoD+FI cells confirmed that myogenic-specific pathways such as ‘muscle organ development’ and adipogenic-specific pathways such as ‘PPAR signaling pathway’ were enriched. In addition, we also identified several multifunctional signaling pathways such as ‘JAK-STAT signaling pathway’, ‘NF-kappa B signaling pathway’, and ‘MAPK signaling pathway’ that were simultaneously activated during myogenic/adipogenic transdifferentiation, which should have profound effects on both myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bakkar and Guttridge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jang and Baik, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keren et al., 2006</xref>) and adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batista et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bost et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richard and Stephens, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

In conclusion, the transcriptome analysis of the different types of transdifferentiated cells revealed important molecular mechanisms including not only the myogenic- and adipogenic-specific pathways driving the muscle formation and fat deposition respectively, but also several key multifunctional signaling pathways that can promote the cell fate transition and differentiation in different cellular contexts including the muscle and fat tissues.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Gene expression profiles during transdifferentiation and fat deposition in 3D.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of the RNA-seq samples marked by different colors.

In addition to myofibers, muscle tissue contains a variety of other cell types, including fibroblasts and adipocytes, all of which play important roles in the structure and function of the tissue. The ECM, which is mainly secreted by fibroblast cells, provides support and structural integrity to the muscle tissue. It is made up of a complex network of proteins and molecules, such as collagen, that provide a scaffold for the cells to attach to and interact with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franco-Barraza et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these components contribute to the unique features of the skeletal muscle tissue and the fresh meat, including its strength, flexibility, and elasticity. It has been and still is challenging to recreate those characteristics in an in vitro condition of cultured meat production. One of the main obstacles in this process is the co-culturing of different cell types with distinct properties. In this study, we overcame this limitation of co-culturing different types of cells by utilizing a single-source cell to generate various meat components, including muscle, fat, and collagen. Precisely, we employed chicken fibroblasts to produce muscle, deposit fat, and synthesize collagen in a well-controlled and adjustable manner within a 3D setting to produce meat with desirable characteristics.</p><p>Fibroblasts are one of the most common cell types in animals and could serve as the seed cells for cultured meat production due to their unique and versatile features. First, the fibroblast cells are widely available in the bodies of agricultural animals and could be easily isolated and cultured in vitro. Second, many groups have successfully transformed the chicken fibroblasts into immortalized cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Himly et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pasitka et al., 2023</xref>). These cell lines can provide an unlimited cellular resource for cultured meat production and eliminate the need for animal or embryo harvest. Third, fibroblasts are capable of adapting to low serum concentration medium or even serum-free medium, which greatly reduce the culturing cost and risk of serum-bound pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Genbacev et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lohr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pasitka et al., 2023</xref>). Lastly, the fibroblast cells can also undergo transformation to enable high-density propagation in suspension culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bürgin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fluri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shittu et al., 2016</xref>), which is a crucial step toward scaling up to mass production. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already approved the use of chicken fibroblast cells for cultured meat production, and recently, Eat Just Inc successfully utilized chicken fibroblasts for the commercial production and sale of cultured meat in Singapore and the USA (FDA, 2023). One latest study has also demonstrated the feasibility and consumer acceptance of cultured meat derived solely from native chicken fibroblast cells, indicating a very promising development. However, the resulting meat products do not seem to contain any muscle components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pasitka et al., 2023</xref>). We have previously established an effective strategy for myogenic transdifferentiation, allowing for the production of muscle cells from fibroblast cells of various species including chicken and pig in 2D culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ren et al., 2022</xref>). In the present study, we further enhanced the myogenic transdifferentiation process in 3D and simultaneously simulated the fat deposition to create cell-based meat that more closely resembles real meat. As a proof of concept, we utilized the transgene method to achieve maximum myogenic induction and the final products still retain the foreign transgene fragment in the cells’ genome. It is therefore posing a risk of genetic modified food that is not suitable for mass production. In the next step, other non-transgenic means such as non-integrating vectors, chemical reprogramming, modified RNAs, and recombinant transgene removal techniques will be explored to develop transgene-free end products. Another food safety concern in this study is the use of GelMA hydrogel for culture meat production. Due to its excellent biocompatibility and mechanical flexibility, GelMA-based hydrogel has demonstrated significant potential in scalable 3D cell culture for creating artificial tissue ranging in sizes from millimeters to centimeters. It is widely used in 3D cell culture and tissue engineering for regenerative medicine, but less common in food processing and agricultural applications. Due to its special photo-crosslinking properties, biocompatibility, and degradability, it allows this material to be shaped into complex tissue structures by 3D printing or modeling. Many researchers have also used GelMA hydrogel as a scaffold for culture meat production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). Later research will carefully consider hydrogel as well as other types of scaffold biomaterials for cost-effective and food-safety-compliant culture meat production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bomkamp et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have identified the crucial role of fat in the aroma, juiciness, and tenderness of meat. In general, a very low level of intramuscular fat results in dry meat with a plain taste, whereas the high intramuscular fat contents can improve the cooking flavor and greatly increase the value of meat products, such as the high marbling beef from Japanese Wagyu cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gotoh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Motoyama et al., 2016</xref>). The fat content of fresh meat mainly comes from lipids contained in the fat cells. Thus, closely mimicking the intramuscular fat properties in cultured meat would require co-culturing of muscle cells with fat cells. For example, co-culturing pre-adipocytes with myoblasts may increase the intramuscular fat content, tenderness, and taste intensity of cultured meat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lau et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pandurangan and Kim, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zagury et al., 2022</xref>). However, co-culture of different cell types is technically challenging since each cell type grows and differentiates in the specific optimized medium. When different cell types are cultured in the same medium, these culture conditions may be suboptimal for one cell type or the other and result in inefficient cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pallaoro et al., 2023</xref>). Previous studies have underlined the influence that adipocytes growing near muscle cells can impair myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Takegahara et al., 2014</xref>). Simultaneous or sequential induction of both myogenic and lipogenic differentiation in the same starting seed cells would resolve these co-culture conflicts, and the multi-lineage competent chicken fibroblast cells were chosen to explore this double transdifferentiation strategy. As a proof of concept, we successfully transformed chicken fibroblast cells into muscle cells and deposited fat into the same cells in 3D hydrogel matrix. Notably, the intramuscular fat content in the cultured meat could be tailored to any specific level within a certain range. From a nutritional point of view, a direct comparison with the traditional chicken meat was performed. The triglyceride content in the cultured meat is comparable to that of chicken meat, and, more importantly, the amount of fat could be easily manipulated in order to achieve a more attractive nutritional profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for myogenic and lipogenic transdifferentiation of chicken fibroblasts in 3D culture to produce meat with precisely controlled levels of intramuscular fat and extracellular matrix.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93220-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In this study, the deposition of fat in the myotubes/myofibers facilitated the storage of significant lipid quantities in transdifferentiated muscle cells, known as intramyocellular lipids. Additionally, we observed Oil Red O staining in the remaining un-transdifferentiated fibroblasts, resembling cells of intramuscular adipocytes (extramyocellular lipids) found within muscle tissue. Hence, current adipogenic induction treatment caused lipogenesis in both the MyoD-transdifferentiated cells and un-transdifferentiated fibroblasts. At present, we do not know whether the fatty acids profile would be different between the two types of origins. Unsaturated fats are conventionally regarded as 'healthier' than saturated fats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berglund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamley, 2017</xref>). One of the superior assets of cultured meat production is the ability to increase the unsaturated fat levels by adjusting the additive fatty acids, oleic/linoleic acids in this case, in the culture medium. In the future, further comprehensive analysis of the fatty acids profile in the cultured meat is required to elucidate the fat-associated attributes similar or distinct to real meat.</p><p>The current transcriptome analysis during the cellular transdifferentiation also revealed that key regulatory signaling pathways control the formation of cultured meat derived from fibroblasts. Notably, we found that several multifunctional pathways such as JAK-STAT and MAPK signaling pathways were significantly enriched in the final cells that underwent double myogenic/adipogenic transdifferentiation. These signalings could drive the differentiation process of many different types of cells, including muscle and adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bost et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jang and Baik, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richard and Stephens, 2011</xref>), and may be manipulated in more settings to further improve the generation of final cultured meat with tunable fat content.</p><p>In conclusion, we have effectively utilized immortalized chicken fibroblasts in conjunction with classical myogenic/adipogenic transdifferentiation approaches within the 3D hydrogel to establish a cultured meat model. This model allows for the precise regulation of the synthesis of key components of conventional meat, including muscle, fat, and ECM. This approach can be readily extrapolated to other species such as pigs and cows, and presents promising avenues for the large-scale production of customized and versatile meat products that may cater to varying consumer preferences.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell preparation and inducible myogenic transdifferentiation</title><p>The cellular transdifferentiation was constructed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ren et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ren et al., 2023</xref>).

RNA-seq library-preparation protocol was based on the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, #E7530L). Insert size was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system and qualified insert size was accurate quantification using StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Library valid concentration＞10 nM) and then paired-end sequencing using an Illumina platform. RNA-seq was performed on triplicates for each sample. Sequencing data have been deposited in SRA database under accession code PRJNA1102033.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA-seq data analysis</title><p>The RNA-seq raw data were first trimmed adapters by trim_galore software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) and then the clean data of RNA-seq was mapped to the chicken genome (Ensembl, GRCg7b) using hisat2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2019</xref>) with default parameters. Because of using paired-end reads, the concordant unique mapping reads/pairs were kept based on the mapping flags. The duplications were removed based on the coordinates of the reads/pairs. The de-duplication unique mapping reads/pairs were used for further analysis in this study. The read counts for each sample were computed with the featureCounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2014</xref>) software, and the RefSeq gene annotation for chicken genome assembly is GRCg7b. The transcript per million (TPM) was normalized using the read counts. DEGs of RNA-seq data were analyzed using DESeq2 called by q&lt;0.01 and fold change &gt;2 thresholds. The chicken genes were transformed to homolog human genes using the ensemble bioMart database, the GO in this study was conducted in Metascape, and the enriched top pathways are shown. All plots were generated with R (v4.0.3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Measurement of total collagen content in cultured meat</title><p>Total collagen content was determined by the concentration of hydroxyproline. The medium was replaced with fresh medium in the incubator for 2 hr before the assay and washed three times with PBS. According to the instructions of the Hydroxyproline Assay Kit (Jiancheng, #A030-1-1, China), 1 volume of saline was added to dried cultured meat at a 1:1 ratio of weight and volume. After mechanical homogenization in an ice-water bath, the digestion solution was incubated at 37°C in a water bath for 4 hr. Hydroxyproline content was measured by the absorbance at 550 nm using an EnSpire multifunctional spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). For each measurement of cultured meat, the hydroxyproline content of the corresponding blank cell-free hydrogel was subtracted. The amount of collagen was calculated from the hydroxyproline concentration with a conversion factor of 7.25 in μg/mg wet tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vasanthi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Measurement of triglyceride content in cultured meat</title><p>The triglyceride content in cultured meat was measured using the kit (Solarbio, #BC0620, China). Before the assay, the culture system was washed three times with PBS and uniformly added to the same medium containing 12% FBS in an incubator for 2 hr. It was then removed and washed three more times with PBS. The cultured meat was taken out and churned, and the precipitate is obtained by centrifugation, which should be well air-dried. The precipitate was weighed and Trizol was added to lyse cell for 2 hr. A mixture of n-heptane and isopropanol at a ratio of 1:1 was then added, shaken, and mixed. Then, potassium hydroxide was added and fullly shaken to produce glycerol and fatty acids, and the other reagents were added in sequence according to the instructions. The final triglyceride content was measured by the specific light intensity at 420 nm, as described previously.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Emission scanning electron microscope</title><p>The cell hydrogels were washed three times with PBS and then fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hr.

The authors used genetically modified fibroblasts, which can be forced to differentiate into muscle cells, and formulated 3D tissues with these cells and a biphasic material (hydrogel). The degrees of muscle differentiation and lipid deposition in culture were determined by immunohistochemical, biochemical, and molecular biological evaluations. Notably, the protocol successfully achieved the process of myogenic and lipogenic stimulation in the 3D tissues.</p><p>As addressed after the initial review process, the manuscript is clearly written with well-supportive figures. The study design is reasonable with adequate analysis. In the revised manuscript, the authors further discussed the ideas in terms of the approach using genetic modification for cell-based meat production. However, more careful considerations may still be helpful when actually using the technology for cultivated meat production.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93220.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Tongtong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Ruimin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lv</surname><given-names>Jianqi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taian</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ruipeng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taian</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Xinyi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taian</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Huazhong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Wuhan</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Guiyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taian</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Heng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Shandong Agricultural University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Taian</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This solid study investigates the transdifferentiation of chicken embryonic fibroblasts into muscle and fat cells in 3D to create whole-cut meat mimics. The study is important and provides a method to control muscle, fat, and collagen content within the 3D meat mimics and thus provides a new avenue for customized cultured meat production. Limitations of this study include the use of transgene for transdifferentiation and thus the creation of GMO food.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the substantial effort that editors and reviewers put into assessing our manuscript and providing insightful feedback. We have tried to address, as much as possible, all comments and criticisms. We believe that we have now a significantly improved manuscript.

We have now described this drawback in the discussion part.</p><p>As a proof-of-concept study, we sought to explore the potential of utilizing the transdifferentiation integrated transgene tools for overexpressing a transdifferentiation factor to achieve the maximum muscle production. However, it is important to acknowledge that genetically modified meat products derived from the genetic engineering of cultured cells will not be suitable for consumer acceptance and market viability. We are currently testing other non-genomic integrating delivery means such as modRNAs and chemical cocktails to induce myogenic transdifferentiation in fibroblasts.

The authors used genetically modified fibroblasts which can be forced to differentiate into muscle cells and formulated 3D tissues with these cells and a biphasic material (hydrogel). The degrees of muscle differentiation and lipid deposition in culture were determined by immunohistochemical, biochemical, and molecular biological evaluations. Notably, the protocol successfully achieved the process of myogenic and lipogenic stimulation in the 3D tissues.</p><p>Overall, the study is reasonably designed and performed including adequate analysis. The manuscript is clearly written with well-supported figures. While it presents valuable results in the field of cultivated meat science and skeletal muscle biology, some critical concerns were identified. First, it is unclear whether some technical approaches were really the best choice for cell-based meat production. Next, more careful evaluations and justifications would be required to properly explain biological events in the results. These points include additional evaluations and considerations with regard to myocyte alignment and lipid accumulation in the differentiated 3D tissues.

However, the cells are not in a healthy state under these low levels of serum, as shown by the abnormal cell morphology and nearly no cell growth.

We have quantified the cell growth in 3D by measuring the PHK26 stained cells. Since the cells were implanted into the gel, they propagated exponentially from 1 day to 9 days. The cell proliferation data provide good reference for the future meat manufacturing (Figure 2D). We have tried the long-term expansion in 3D but failed to measure the cell proliferation. Because the 3D gel always collapsed during 12-15 days in cell culture for some unknown reasons, either the cells are grown too crowded to compromise the gel structure or the gel matrix itself is not strong enough for standing long-term. We believe the cells will grow well in long-term if we provide enough 3D attachment surface, since they grow indefinitely in 2D.

Specifically, the cells were cultured as 3D and induced muscle differentiation and lipid deposition. The manuscript contains a good set of data, which would be valuable to researchers in the fields of both cell-based meat and skeletal muscle biology. From the aspect of cultivated meat science, the rationale behind the idea is understandable, but it remains unclear whether the proposed approach was really the best choice to achieve their final goal. On the other hand, when we read this manuscript as a paper in skeletal muscle biology, the overall approach was not innovative enough and several uncertain issues remain. The authors should add more sufficient justifications, arguments, and discussions.</p><p>(1) When considering their goal to produce edible meat products, the current approach has some concerns. First, there are issues with the approach used for the induction of myogenesis by MyoD transgene. This makes the end products GMO foods, which are not easily acceptable to a wide range of consumers. Next, the hydrogel was used for 3D tissue formation, but it is unclear whether this matrix type is edible, safe, and bio-comparable for cell-based meat production. The authors already discussed these points by excusing that the current work remains proof-of-concept. However, more careful considerations and justifications would be required.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.</p><p>We acknowledge that the current transgene myogenic induction method is not suitable for mass production of culture meat because of the GMO food concerns.

We totally agree that the current approaches including MyoD overexpression, 3D cell culture and lipogenic induction, were routine experiments in muscle cell biology. However, we want to highlight that utilization of these classical and robust muscle cell approaches, combine with the unique advantages of fibroblast cells (easily accessible, immortalized, cost-effective, ...) would provide a novel and practical avenue for culture meat production. We stated these issues in the revised manuscript in the discussion part.</p><p>Please see lines 511-515.</p><p>“In conclusion, we have effectively utilized immortalized chicken fibroblasts in conjunction with classical myogenic/adipogenic transdifferentiation approaches within 3D hydrogel to establish a cultured meat model.

As the authors described, skeletal muscle is a highly aligned tissue. In this study, some results successfully demonstrated advantages in terms of myocyte alignment, maturation, and lipid deposition. However, the current results cannot address whether the entire 3D tissues maintained these advantageous characteristics or not. Because the method for 3D formation does not have any additional modifications to make the cells aligned, like micropatterning, scaffolding, or bioprinting.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the skeletal muscle tissues are composed of well organized, directional bundles of fibers, and the cell alignment would greatly affect the meat tenderness and sensory properties. Therefore, it is a desired attribute if the cells in the culture meat matrix could be aligned together. But this alignment would require sophisticated biomaterial engineering mainly involved in the scaffold manipulation which is beyond the scope of this study. The hydrogel used in this study formed different sizes of pores at random directions and we would expect the embedded cells to be totally non-directional. But we still found localized cell alignments in some parts of the gel matrix which confirming the cell-cell interactions, please see figure 3D. We describe this feature in the results part. In the future, we will be testing the application of physical or electrical stimulations to the matrix to see if we can align the cells better to make all the muscle cells in the whole matrix to align together.</p><p>Please see lines 186-190.</p><p>“The separate XY axis views of the orthogonal projections at different depths (Figure 3D) and a multi-angle video (Supplementary Video 2) also showed the several myotubes were aligned together. Nevertheless, many myotubes were oriented in different directions, preventing the entire matrix from aligning in one direction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In the skeletal muscle, fat accumulation mainly occurs in adipocytes between myocytes. This means that &quot;intra-&quot; muscular fat deposition is identified. However, lipid deposition within myocytes also occurred in this preparation (Supplementary Figure 7C). This situation is not &quot;intra-&quot; muscular accumulation, which sounds different from what is going on in normal skeletal muscle tissues. Please explain what happened and what biological situations accounted for this. Also, the authors should clarify better how lipogenesis was induced in the 3D tissues, such as cell types (transdifferentiated myocytes, remained/un-transdifferentiated fibroblasts, or both).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the very insightful question. We have revised the corresponding text to further explain the intramuscular fat distribution in different cell types in culture meat.</p><p>We totally agree with the reviewer that intramuscular fat accumulation may occur mainly in the intramuscular adipocytes. However, under some pathological and physiological conditions in human and animals, the lipid droplets were also abundantly observed inside myofibers (intramyocellular lipids within myofiber cytoplasm). For instance, high intramyocellular lipid content was found in insulin resistance patients and paradoxically in endurance trained athletes, (doi.org/10.1016/j.tem.2012.05.009), as well as in some farm animals under intensive selective breeding (doi:10.2174/1876142910901010059). In the current study, with the Oil Red O staining of lipid droplets, we identified lipid deposition in both the transdifferentiated myocytes and the remained un-transdifferentiated fibroblasts in the culture meat. This lipid distribution pattern is comparable to the intramuscular fat storage pattern observed in some human and animals, in which fat accumulation occurs in both myofibers (intramyocellular lipids) and intramuscular adipocyte cells (extramyocellular lipids) which reside within the muscle tissue bundle but between myofibers. We reason that current adipogenic induction treatment caused lipogenesis in both the MyoD-transdifferentiated cells and un-transdifferentiated fibroblasts. It is difficult to compare the absolute amount of lipids between these two types of cells via the Oil Red O staining. Also, it is almost impossible to separate these two types of cells from the 3D meat mimics. Thus, we can only confirm the lipid deposition occurs in both transdifferentiated myocytes and un-transdifferentiated fibroblasts, but without knowing which one is dominant and the major contributor to the intramuscular fat content in the culture meat.</p><p>Please see lines 486-492.</p><p>“In this study, the deposition of fat in the myotubes/myofibers facilitated the storage of significant lipid quantities in transdifferentiated muscle cells, known as intramyocellular lipids. Additionally, we observed Oil Red O staining in the remaining un-transdifferentiated fibroblasts, resembling cells of intramuscular adipocytes (extramyocellular lipids) found within muscle tissue. Hence, current adipogenic induction treatment caused lipogenesis in both the MyoD-transdifferentiated cells and un-transdifferentiated fibroblasts.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
