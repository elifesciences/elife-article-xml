Its impact on junctional integrity, however, remains obscure. To dissect the events leading to neoplasia, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on wing imaginal discs temporally depleted of the ESCRT-III core component Shrub. We find a specific requirement for Shrub in maintaining septate junction (SJ) integrity by transporting the claudin Megatrachea (Mega) to the SJ. In absence of Shrub function, Mega is lost from the SJ and becomes trapped on endosomes coated with the endosomal retrieval machinery retromer. We show that ESCRT function is required for apical localization and mobility of retromer positive carrier vesicles, which mediate the biosynthetic delivery of Mega to the SJ. Accordingly, loss of retromer function impairs the anterograde transport of several SJ core components, revealing a novel physiological role for this ancient endosomal agent.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are large molecules responsible for a variety of activities that cells needs to perform to survive; from respiration to copying DNA before cells divide. To perform these roles proteins need to be transported to the correct cell compartment, or to the cell membrane. This protein trafficking depends on the endosomal system, a set of membrane compartments that can travel within the cell and act as a protein sorting hub. This system needs its own proteins to work properly. In particular, there are two sets of proteins that are crucial for the endosomal systems activity: a group of proteins known as the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery and a complex called retromer. The retromer complex regulates recycling of receptor proteins so they can be reused, while the ESCRT machinery mediates degradation of proteins that the cell does not require anymore. In the epithelia of fruit fly larvae – the tissues that form layers of cells, usually covering an organ but also making structures like wings – defects in ESCRT activity lead to a loss of tissue integrity.</p><p>This loss of tissue integrity suggests that the endosomal system might be involved in transporting proteins that form cellular junctions, the multiprotein complexes that establish contacts between cells or between a cell and the extracellular space. In arthropods such as the fruit fly, the adherens junction and the septate junction are two types of cellular junctions important for the integrity of epithelia integrity. Adherens junctions allow cells to adhere to each other, while septate junctions stop nutrient molecules, ions and water from leaking into the tissue. The role of the endosomal system in trafficking the proteins that form septate junctions remains a mystery.</p><p>To better understand the role of the endosomal system in regulating cell junctions and tissue integrity, Pannen et al. blocked the activity of either the ESCRT or retromer in wing imaginal discs – the future wings – of fruit fly larvae. Pannen et al. then analyzed the effects of these endosomal defects on cellular junctions using an imaging technique called transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that both ESCRT and retromer activities are necessary for the correct delivery of septate junction components to the cell membrane. However, neither retromer nor ESCRT were required for the delivery of adherens junction proteins.</p><p>These findings shed light on how retromer and the ESCRT machinery are involved in the epithelial tissue integrity of fruit fly larvae through their effects on cell junctions. Humans have their own versions of the ESCRT, retromer, and cell junction proteins, all of which are very similar to their fly counterparts. Since defects in the human versions of these proteins have been associated with a variety of diseases, from infections to cancer, these results may have implications for research into treating those diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Retromer</kwd><kwd>ESCRT</kwd><kwd>septate junctions</kwd><kwd>claudins</kwd><kwd>tight junctions</kwd><kwd>neoplasia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sachbeihilfe KL 1028/11-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pannen</surname><given-names>Hendrik</given-names></name><name><surname>Rapp</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel role of endosomal machineries retromer and ESCRT in membrane delivery of Drosophila septate junction components is required for maintenance of junction integrity and epithelial barrier function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Developmental and physiological functions of epithelia rely on a set of cellular junctions, linking cells within the tissue to a functional unit. While E-cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs) provide adhesion and mechanical properties, formation of the paracellular diffusion barrier depends on tight junctions (TJs). Proteins of the conserved claudin family play a key role in establishing and regulating TJ permeability in the intercellular space by homo- and heterophilic interactions with Claudins of neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Günzel and Yu, 2013</xref>). Arthropods, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, do not possess TJs but a functionally similar structure in ectoderm-derived epithelia termed pleated septate junction (pSJ, SJ hereafter), characterized by protein dense septa lining the intercellular space in electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gilula et al., 1970</xref>). Structure and function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> SJs depend on a convoluted multiprotein complex containing at least a dozen components. Three claudins, among them Megatrachea (Mega), have been shown to be required for SJ formation and barrier function in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behr et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). Besides claudins, several transmembrane proteins (TMPs) such as Neurexin-IV (NrxIV), Neuroglian (Nrg) or ATPα contribute to the formation of the stable SJ core complex, which is characterized by low mobility within the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgartner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Genova and Fehon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oshima and Fehon, 2011</xref>). At the intracellular side of the junction, cytoplasmic proteins such as Coracle (Cora), Varicose (Vari), and Discs large (Dlg) associate with the transmembrane components, contributing to the formation of a stable fence-like scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lamb et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laval et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Woods and Bryant, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). While junction formation during embryogenesis requires the SJ localized cytoplasmic protein Dlg, this basolateral cell polarity factor is not a structural part of the immobile junction core complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oshima and Fehon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woods et al., 1996</xref>). This explains the functional separation of barrier formation and apicobasal polarity despite the close association of Dlg-complex components with the SJ. Albeit growing knowledge about the structural composition of SJs, the intracellular events required for assembly and maintenance of SJ complexes remain largely unknown. Specifically, how proliferative tissues, such as the imaginal disc epithelium, maintain SJ integrity is not well established.</p><p>It was recently shown that newly synthesized SJ components integrate into the junction from the apical side (in between AJ and SJ) in a ‘conveyor belt-like’ fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babatz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Daniel et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, SJ components are frequently associated with endosomal compartments, suggesting a role for the endosomal system in coordinating transport and turnover of SJ complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nilton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tempesta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tiklová et al., 2010</xref>). Consistently, endocytosis is required to concentrate SJ components at the junctional region during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tiklová et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that passage of SJ TMP components (or the whole SJ protein complex) through the endosomal system may be a requirement for SJ formation, with the underlying mechanisms remaining poorly characterized.</p><p>The endosomal system fulfils a plethora of physiological functions by tightly regulating the intracellular transport of TMPs and membranes within the cell. Following endocytosis from the plasma membrane, TMPs enter the endosomal system where they undergo cargo specific sorting. This process provides separation of proteins destined for degradation from those that exit the endosomal system to be recycled. Two evolutionary conserved endosomal sorting machineries, the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) and the retromer complex, mediate cargo sorting into the degradative and recycling pathway, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>). To coordinate these opposing transport activities, the endosomal system comprises a highly dynamic membrane network governing retromer-dependent tubulation for recycling and ESCRT-mediated generation of intraluminal vesicles (ILV) for degradation.</p><p>Endocytosed proteins can evade ESCRT-dependent packaging into ILVs by exiting the maturing endosome (ME) through tubular retrieval domains induced by specialized recycling machineries such as retromer. Initially characterized as a regulator of endosome-to-Golgi cargo retrieval in yeast, this endosomal agent comprises two subcomplexes that cooperatively drive cargo sorting into tubular recycling carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carlton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Horazdovsky et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seaman et al., 1997</xref>). Similar to the ESCRT machinery, cargo clustering and membrane deformation is performed by distinct functional units within the retromer pathway. Motif-based cargo recognition and aggregation is mediated by the endosomally localized Vps26:Vps29:Vps35 complex, which has been termed cargo-selective complex (CSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lucas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nothwehr et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seaman et al., 1997</xref>). Since the ancient CSC does not possess membrane bending activity, cooperation with tubulating factors such as proteins of the SNX-BAR (Sorting Nexin-Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) family is required for recycling carrier generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cullen, 2008</xref>). Proteins containing the curved BAR-domain can assemble into regular helical coats on endosomes, thereby inducing cytoplasm faced tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frost et al., 2009</xref>). Concerted action of CSC stably complexed with SNX-BAR proteins to retrieve endosomal cargo was initially characterized as the classical retromer pathway in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Horazdovsky et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>). In metazoans however, retromer function is not restricted to SNX-BAR-dependent pathways. Specifically, cooperations of CSC with SNX3 or SNX27 (both lacking BAR-domains) emerged as alternative routes for endosomal retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harterink et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lauffer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>). Proteomic data from mammalian cells suggest that surface levels of well over 100 TMPs depend on retromer and many of these proteins seemingly interact with CSC or SNX27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has proven invaluable for assessing and confirming the physiological relevance of some of these putative retromer cargos in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Strutt et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Cargo proteins within the endosomal system that do not undergo recycling can enter the degradative trafficking route starting with their sorting into ILVs. Generation of ILVs at the limiting membrane of MEs requires the canonical ESCRT function, which is performed by four in sequence acting complexes (ESCRT-0, -I, -II, III) and the ATPase Vps4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babst et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babst et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babst et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bilodeau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katzmann et al., 2001</xref>). Ubiquitination of TMPs serves as the primary degradative sorting signal and sequestration of TMPs into ILVs is an essential prerequisite to complete lysosomal degradation. Several ESCRT components such as Vps27/Hrs (ESCRT-0) and Vps23/TSG101 (ESCRT-I) possess ubiquitin interacting motifs, which allow them to bind and cluster ubiquitinated TMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bilodeau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katzmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shih et al., 2002</xref>). Consequently, local concentration of ubiquitinated cargo by ESCRT complexes establishes a degradative subdomain at the endosomal membrane that is spatially separated from the retrieval subdomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Norris et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raiborg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raiborg et al., 2001</xref>). While ESCRT-0-II complexes provide cargo recognition and clustering, the membrane-deforming activity required to bud and abscise ILVs into the endosomal lumen depends on ESCRT-III components, which polymerize into helical arrays at the endosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saksena et al., 2009</xref>). The most abundant ESCRT-III component is the highly conserved yeast Snf7/Vps32, encoded by the gene <italic>shrub</italic> (<italic>shrb</italic>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sweeney et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Teis et al., 2008</xref>). Unlike upstream ESCRT components, ESCRT-III proteins only transiently assemble into a heterooligomeric complex at the endosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Teis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wollert et al., 2009</xref>). In consequence of ESCRT activity, the maturing endosome accumulates cargo-containing ILVs and is recognized in electron micrographs as a multi-vesicular body (MVB). The ESCRT/MVB pathway ends with Vps4-dependent dissociation of ESCRT-III components from the endosomal membrane. This step is required for the release of the nascent ILV and subsequent rounds of ILV formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babst et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wollert et al., 2009</xref>). Loss of ESCRT function was initially studied in yeast cells in which it led to the emergence of an aberrant pre-vacuolar endosomal organelle, termed class E compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raymond et al., 1992</xref>). This defective endosomal structure is characterized by accumulation of degradative cargo and a failure to fuse with the vacuole/lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doyotte et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raymond et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>The physiological relevance of ESCRT-mediated degradative TMP trafficking is particularly evident in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal disc tissue. Here, loss of ESCRT function induces severe overgrowth, multilayering, apoptosis, and invasive behavior of the tissue; a phenotype attributed to mis-regulation of cellular signaling pathways, such as the Jak/Stat-, Jun-Kinase-, and Notch pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thompson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vaccari and Bilder, 2005</xref>). Consequently, ESCRT components were classified as endocytic neoplastic tumor suppressor genes (nTSG) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hariharan and Bilder, 2006</xref>). While induction of over-proliferation and apoptosis in nTSG mutants have been extensively characterized, the events leading to loss of cell polarity and ultimately neoplastic transformation of the tissue remain poorly understood.</p><p>Here, we have analyzed the integrity of cellular junctions in an ESCRT-depleted wing imaginal disc epithelium to gain insight into the initial events leading to neoplastic transformation. To our surprise, preceding neoplastic overgrowth, we found a strong and specific reduction in the density of SJ. We show that ESCRT and retromer functions are required for anterograde transport of SJ components. By dissecting the intracellular trafficking itinerary of the claudin Megatrachea, we reveal that biosynthetic delivery of this core SJ component depends on a complex basal to apical transcytosis route relying on ESCRT and retromer functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ESCRT knockdown specifically affects SJ integrity</title><p>To analyze the impact of ESCRT loss of function on junctional integrity, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used on wing imaginal discs that have been depleted of ESCRT function. We devised an RNAi-based approach allowing spatiotemporal knockdown of the ESCRT-III component Shrub. By using <italic>hh</italic>Gal4 and the temperature sensitive Gal4 Repressor (<italic>tub</italic>Gal80<sup>ts</sup>), we specifically inhibited Shrub protein expression in the posterior compartment by expressing a UAS-<italic>shrub</italic>-RNAi construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sweeney et al., 2006</xref>) for specified durations. After 32 hr of RNAi expression, Shrub protein was effectively reduced in the posterior compartment as visualized by antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). ESCRT loss of function is known to induce high levels of apoptosis in imaginal disc tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thompson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vaccari and Bilder, 2005</xref>).

Interestingly, while 48 hr expression of <italic>p35 + shrub-</italic>RNAi yielded discs with no apparent morphological defects seen in a thin section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), discs after 65 hr of expression were disorganized and multi-layered in the posterior compartment as reported for <italic>shrub</italic> null mutant clonal eye disc tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vaccari et al., 2009</xref>).

In the wildtype anterior control compartment, the membrane basal to the AJ was lined with the ladder-like electron-dense structures that represent the SJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In the posterior (<italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi) compartment however, only few electron-dense structures basally to the AJ were detected and an obvious ladder pattern was rarely seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>´). Interestingly, we did not find AJ appearance to differ noticeably between wildtype and <italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E/E</xref>´). We sought to quantify SJ integrity by measuring the total length of electron-dense structures basally to the AJ in a region of interest (ROI) with specified length of 2 μm. In anterior control compartments, roughly 32% of membrane within ROIs was lined with SJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This value decreased to about 15% in posterior compartments, indicating that 48 hr expression of <italic>p35 + shrub-</italic>RNAi reduces SJ density in wing discs by more than 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Due to the lack of apparent neoplastic transformation at the 48 hr stage, we conclude that reduction in SJ density does not reflect indirect effects resulting from ESCRT induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), but rather suggests a direct involvement of ESCRT in maintaining SJ density in wing imaginal discs.</p><p>We turned to fluorescence microscopy to analyze the subcellular localization of junctional proteins upon Shrub depletion. Again, we used depletion for 48 hr, which does not show apparent neoplastic overgrowth and thus preserves epithelial monolayer organization. We used antibodies against E-cadherin and the claudin Mega to reveal AJ and SJ, respectively. Both proteins localized almost exclusively at the apical membrane in wildtype cells of the anterior compartment of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, left arrowheads). However, in the Shrub-depleted posterior compartment, Mega was not detected at the SJs, while E-cad showed wildtype AJ localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, right arrowheads). The absence of Mega from SJs is also visible in maximum intensity projections of the junctional region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Importantly, Mega accumulated in vesicle like structures at the basal side of the cells, suggesting that it might be trapped in intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, arrow). This basal fraction of Mega colocalized with the endosomal marker Rab7, suggesting that Mega was trapped within maturing endosomes (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>´).</p><p>We reasoned that junctional loss of Mega together with the decreased SJ density revealed by TEM analysis point toward defects in SJ integrity/function in <italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi tissue. Indeed, dye exclusion experiments suggest that epithelial barrier function is compromised in <italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi expressing wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Results from another experiment also support this notion: The GPI-anchored SJ protein Lachesin (Lac) is required for barrier function and localized at the outer membrane leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Llimargas et al., 2004</xref>). We visualized endogenous Lac localization by using a GFP protein trap line in <italic>p35 + shrub-</italic>RNAi expressing discs. While Lac::GFP was restricted to SJ in the anterior control compartment, the protein spread more laterally in <italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, arrowheads).</p><p>Interestingly, this phenotype resembles mis-localization of SJ proteins in mutants of individual complex components during junction formation in the embryo. For example, in <italic>mega</italic> deficient embryos, NrxIV fails to concentrate at the SJ and localizes along the entire lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behr et al., 2003</xref>). We conclude that Shrub function maintains integrity of the SJ complex required for containment of Lac within the junction of the wing disc epithelium. Strikingly, when we depleted posterior wing disc compartments of Mega, we could only detect a faint lateral spreading of Lac::GFP basal to the SJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggested that in wing discs, Shrub depletion more severely affects integrity of the SJ complex with respect to Lac::GFP confinement to the junction compared to Mega depletion. This made us wonder whether junction levels of other SJ core components might be affected upon Shrub depletion. Indeed, when we analyzed subcellular localization of the SJ core component ATPα upon 48 hr of <italic>shrub</italic>-RNAi expression, we found a strong and specific reduction of its junctional level in the Shrub-depleted compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This result indicates that the function of Shrub in regulating junctional membrane levels is not limited to Mega.</p><p>The lateral spreading of Lac::GFP within the membrane in Shrub-depleted tissue also suggested that its mobility might be increased. We measured fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of Lac::GFP to test this hypothesis. Consistent with a very stable and immobile SJ complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oshima and Fehon, 2011</xref>), Lac::GFP fluorescence recovery at the junction was low in the anterior control compartment, with GFP signal intensities barely reaching 20% of the pre-bleach levels half an hour after photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, green graph). In the <italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi compartment however, Lac::GFP fluorescence recovery at the SJ was quick and reached a plateau at roughly 40% of pre-bleach levels after a few minutes. This suggests that a fraction of Lac::GFP molecules shows increased mobility within the SJ membrane region in <italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi expressing cells, in line with a defective barrier/fence function of the SJ complex.</p><p>Altogether, these results indicate that SJ integrity critically depends on ESCRT function and suggest that Shrub is required for intracellular transport of Mega from an endosomal compartment toward the junction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The retromer CSC regulates membrane levels of SJ core components</title><p>The loss of Mega from the SJ and concomitant accumulation in basal aggregates cannot easily be explained with a role of Shrub in Mega degradative trafficking but rather suggest that its export from the endosomal system might be impaired in Shrub-depleted tissue. Consistent with a non-degradative ESCRT role in transport of Mega, we did not find Mega to accumulate intracellularly when we interfered with endosomal maturation or prevented endolysosomal fusion downstream of ESCRT function, in contrast to the canonical ESCRT cargo Notch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that Mega undergoes very little (if any) lysosomal turnover in wing imaginal discs and point toward an ESCRT function that is distinct from the degradative MVB pathway in trafficking of Mega.</p><p>We hypothesized that biosynthetic delivery of Mega to the SJ might require an endosomal recycling pathway depending on ESCRT for its proper function. To test this idea, we depleted imaginal discs of proteins known to regulate endosomal recycling and analyzed the impact on junctional Mega levels. We found that expression of an RNAi construct targeting the retromer CSC component Vps35 led to a significant reduction of Mega at the SJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which led us to investigate the function of retromer in transport of SJ components.

This is in line with Mega being trapped in aberrant Rab7 and CSC positive endosomal compartments residing in the basal cytoplasm of ESCRT deficient cells. Our analysis of these basal aggregates revealed that besides containing Mega, they are enriched in ubiquitinated cargo and are coated with retromer components, Hrs and endosomal GTPases Rab5 and Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

While the regularly shaped and sized wildtype MVBs were absent in Shrub-depleted cells, we found a variety of enlarged, abnormal membranous compartments that are reminiscent of class E compartments in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doyotte et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stuffers et al., 2009</xref>).

Consequently, the SJ phenotype seen in <italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) could be explained by basal displacement of retromer-dependent carriers, which are required for targeting SJ components to the junctional region.</p><p>The apical bias of Vps35::RFP positive vesicles in wildtype cells suggests a polarized movement of CSC carriers along the apicobasal axis with relatively long dwell times at the apical hub. We reasoned that in wing discs, a majority of CSC-dependent cargo might be released preferentially at the apical pole of the cells. We turned to live imaging to study movement of CSC positive vesicles in wildtype and Shrub-depleted cells. We visualized CSC using Vps35::RFP or a transgene encompassing the genomic region of <italic>Vps26</italic> fused to a C-terminal EGFP-tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In anterior control compartments, Vps26-EGFP localized in a vesicular pattern throughout the cells with increased abundance at the apical hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, arrow). In the posterior Shrub-depleted cells however, Vps26-EGFP localization at the apical hub was reduced and basal accumulation was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Therefore, live imaging of Vps26-EGFP recapitulates the apical to basal shift of Vps35::RFP in ESCRT-depleted fixed tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). We used Vps35::RFP/Vps26-EGFP to record time series of CSC positive carrier vesicles within wildtype and Shrub-depleted tissue. We applied the Fiji plugin TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>) to map individual trajectories of Vps35::RFP/Vps26-EGFP vesicles over a timeframe of 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>'). The results show that the CSC carriers in anterior control cells were highly mobile along the apicobasal axis with a subset of vesicles moving rapidly and relatively long distances between the apical and basal poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>', arrows). This suggests that CSC carriers, although preferentially residing at the apical hub, are highly mobile and occasionally shuttle between the apical and basal poles of wing disc cells. In contrast, long-distance movement of Vps35::RFP/Vps26-EGFP vesicles was severely reduced in the posterior Shrub-depleted compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E' and F</xref>). Importantly, the large basal CSC aggregates (class E-like compartments) were mostly immobile, showing no apparent movement along the apicobasal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>', arrowheads).

Mega::YFP vesicular structures overlapped extensively with Vps26 not only at the junctional level but also in vesicles with close proximity to the basal pole of the cells (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Colocalization analysis revealed that 71.9% of Mega::YFP vesicles along the apicobasal axis were positive for Vps26 (n = 3 discs/128 vesicles). This suggests that Mega and possibly other SJ components shuttle along the apicobasal axis in CSC positive carrier vesicles. We confirmed this by live imaging of Mega::YFP together with Vps35::RFP, which revealed extensive co-mobility of this retromer component with the vesicular fraction of Mega::YFP (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Animation 1</xref>).

While certain retromer cargos are transported directly from endosomes to the plasma membrane, the classical retromer route involves cargo recycling in a detour via the Golgi. Besides these two endosomal recycling pathways, retromer has also been shown to regulate transcytosis from one membrane domain to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vergés et al., 2004</xref>). Prior to all retromer and ESCRT-dependent trafficking events, endocytosis of cargo is required for subsequent sorting within the endosomal system.

Since membrane proteins accumulate at their site of endocytosis when the internalization process is inhibited, this result argues against Mega undergoing clathrin-dependent endocytosis at the apical membrane. Importantly, we found Mega::YFP accumulating at the most basal region of the lateral membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>&quot;'), suggesting that Mega is continuously removed from a basal membrane pool by endocytosis.

This process depends on the endocytic and early endosomal machinery as interference with dynamin, clathrin and Rab5 function leads to reduced SJ levels of Mega accompanied by its accumulation at the basodistal membrane. These results suggest that Mega needs to traverse through the endosomal system prior to reaching the SJ and argue against a conventional recycling function of retromer in this process. This notion is further supported by our comparative analysis of Mega trafficking to that of Crumbs (Crb), an established retromer recycling cargo in wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pocha et al., 2011</xref>).

We therefore reasoned that basodistal membrane accumulation might be a short-lived intermediate step in Mega transport toward the SJ. To proof this assumption, we conducted a pulse-chase experiment using the Gal4/Galt80ts system and found that HA-Mega localization was much more confined to the SJ (similar to endogenous Mega localization) when its expression was halted for 14 hr after continuous expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). After this chase, the basodistal membrane pool was almost completely diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>'). This is consistent with a transient localization of Mega at the basodistal membrane prior to endocytosis and subsequent targeting to the SJ.</p><p>Next, we investigated the roles of ESCRT and retromer in HA-Mega trafficking. Strikingly, when we expressed HA-Mega in <italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi tissue, it failed to reach the SJ altogether and instead was trapped within aberrant endosomal compartments in the basal cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, arrow). Colocalization with Vps35::RFP confirmed that HA-Mega accumulated in basal retromer CSC positive compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, arrows), consistent with the results obtained from Mega staining in <italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). When we expressed HA-Mega in CSC-depleted tissue (<italic>Vps35</italic>-RNAi), a similar, albeit weaker trapping of HA-Mega in basally localized vesicular compartments was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, arrows). In contrast to exclusive localization of HA-Mega in basal aggregates upon <italic>shrub-</italic>RNAi expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, arrows), we also detected a pool of HA-Mega at the SJ level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). However, imaging the SJ plane revealed that apical HA-Mega was mostly vesicular with no apparent membrane staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). This is in strong contrast to HA-Mega localization in wildtype tissue, characterized by a distinct junctional honeycomb pattern in both the disc proper and the overlaying peripodial disc cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). These results suggest that HA-Mega fails to integrate into the SJ in retromer or ESCRT-depleted wing disc cells.</p><p>Recognition of proteins by the ESCRT machinery requires cargo ubiquitination, serving as a sorting signal for the ILV pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bilodeau et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katzmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shih et al., 2002</xref>). To test whether HA-Mega requires ubiquitination for its integration into SJ, we devised a UAS-HA-Mega construct in which all intracellular lysines (K) were changed to arginines (R) (UAS HA-Mega<sup>K2R</sup>). This construct should be devoid of any potential ubiquitination, thereby preventing a possible recognition by ESCRT and sorting into the ILV pathway. However, upon expression in wing disc cells, HA-Mega<sup>K2R</sup> targeting to the junctional membrane was not impaired and the subcellular localization of the construct was indistinguishable from wildtype HA-Mega (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result suggests that Mega transcytosis and SJ integration does not require ubiquitination and that direct interaction with ESCRT components and sorting into ILVs is dispensable during anterograde transport of Mega. These data are compatible with a model of indirect regulation of Mega trafficking by ESCRT that is based on the requirement for ESCRT function in maintaining apical hub localization and mobility of the retromer CSC.</p><p>Based on above findings, we conclude that a functional endosomal system is critically required for Mega transcytosis from the basodistal to the apical membrane, which is an essential prerequisite for its delivery to the SJ. Importantly, our data indicate a crucial role for ESCRT and retromer in a pathway that regulates anterograde trafficking of an apically localized membrane protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mega translation and subsequent exit from the Golgi occurs in the basal cytoplasm</title><p>The previous experiments suggested that Mega, despite residing in apical SJs, requires crucial trafficking steps at the basodistal plasma membrane prior to its integration into the junction.

Thus, the discrepancy in RNA and protein localization may explain the necessity for a transcytosis route from the basodistal membrane to the SJ. We reasoned that Mega mRNA is translated basally, which may result in its initial targeting to the basodistal membrane following passage through the Golgi. Consistent with this idea, we found robust colocalization of HA-Mega with the Golgi marker Golgin84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Riedel et al., 2016</xref>) at the basal pole of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, arrows). In contrast, little colocalization was found in the apical region in proximity to the SJ. This is surprising, since the majority of Golgi stacks appeared to reside apically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>'). To further study the early biosynthetic trafficking of Mega, we induced a short <italic>hh</italic>Gal4-driven expression of UAS-HA-Mega for 2 hr.

Our data reveal that the retromer CSC functions downstream of ESCRT to export Mega from the endosome. We propose a novel physiological role for the retromer CSC in regulating membrane levels of several SJ core components. While our data suggest that retromer fails to export Mega from aberrant endosomes induced by ESCRT depletion, the exact mechanism behind this remains to be determined.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Requirement for ESCRT function in CSC-dependent endosomal retrieval of Mega</title><p>Our data reveal a critical requirement for ESCRT in a transport pathway that depends on retromer-mediated transcytosis to deliver newly synthesized Mega to its apical destination. Defects in endosomal retrieval upon ESCRT inactivation have been previously described in other systems, such as yeast or mammalian cells and, thus, appear to represent a common feature of the pleiotropic ESCRT deficient phenotype. In yeast, the endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of the sorting receptor Vps10p and its cargo carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) depends on retromer function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seaman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>). ESCRT mutant strains accumulate CPY in class E compartments from which retrieval to the Golgi is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babst et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Piper et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raymond et al., 1992</xref>). Similarly, the mammalian retromer cargo mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) also failed to recycle from endosomes to the Golgi in HeLa cells depleted of TSG101/ESCRT-I function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doyotte et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, the authors suggested that generation of class E compartments occurs at the expense of endosomal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doyotte et al., 2005</xref>). Consistently, the retromer-associated tubulation factor SNX1 and its yeast homolog Vps5p were found on the rims of mammalian and yeast class E compartments, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doyotte et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>). Together with our finding of CSC accumulation on <italic>Drosophila</italic> class E-like compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), this suggests that ESCRT deficient endosomes remain coated with retromer components but fail to export specific cargo.</p><p>While we cannot rule out the possibility of ESCRT components directly cooperating with retromer to form recycling tubules (note that SNX-BAR, Snx3, and Snx27 are not required for Mega transport; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), we favor an indirect mechanism linking ESCRT and retromer in this transport pathway. Our analysis of the aberrant endosomal compartments induced upon Shrub depletion revealed that they are enriched in endosomal organizers such as Rab5 and Rab7, which could potentially interfere with retromer-dependent export when their activity at the limiting membrane is unrestrained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). While the role of Rab7 in endosomal recruitment of the CSC is well established, the necessity for Rab7 GDP/GTP cycling during retromer-dependent carrier generation is still under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jimenez-Orgaz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seaman et al., 2009</xref>). Rab7 and its GTPase-activating protein (GAP) Tbc1d5 are interaction partners of the CSC and can modulate its capability to retrieve endosomal cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seaman et al., 2009</xref>). For example, interfering with Rab7-GTP hydrolysis by Tbc1d5 depletion yielded defects in retromer-dependent transport in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jia et al., 2016</xref>). Strikingly, under these conditions, retromer cargo was trapped in CSC-coated endosomes, paralleling our observation of Mega subcellular localization upon ESCRT depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jia et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, by exposing the interplay between the CSC component Vps29, Tbc1d5, and Rab7 in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> brains, the authors of a recent study reported the capability of endosomal Rab7 to interfere with retromer CSC function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ye et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While the exact mechanism rendering retromer dysfunctional at <italic>Drosophila</italic> class E compartments remains to be determined, our data support the mounting pool of evidence that ESCRT is required for multiple endosomal retrieval pathways. It is therefore likely that aspects of the pleiotropic ESCRT phenotype in metazoans stem from defective export of proteins from the endosomal system. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, leaky SJ could support ESCRT-mediated neoplastic transformation by permitting diffusion of signaling molecules within the imaginal disc tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Transcytosis as a means to provide biosynthetic delivery of SJ components</title><p>We here found that biosynthetic delivery of Mega depends on a transcytosis-like mechanism from the basodistal to the apical plasma membrane. This long-distance transport required sequential action of endocytic (clathrin, dynamin, Rab5) and endosomal (ESCRT, retromer CSC) machineries. Importantly, the finding that overexpressed HA-Mega is unable to reach the SJ in absence of retromer and ESCRT function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) is in agreement with biosynthetic delivery of Mega relying on endosomal function. Therefore, although we cannot exclude the possibility that Mega transiently passes the Golgi after endocytosis at the basodistal membrane, we favor the unconventional transcytosis model. Strikingly, while retromer-dependent endosomal recycling has been extensively documented, only one mammalian cell culture study implicated retromer in transcytosis from one membrane domain to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vergés et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, SJ delivery of Mega in imaginal discs represents a novel physiological role of retromer to study this process in vivo. The finding that CSC-mediated anterograde transport of Mega is independent of retromer-associated sorting nexins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) indicates that this transcytosis pathway is distinct from many established CSC-dependent routes and suggests that it may require unknown cofactors (or does not require endosomal tubulation).</p><p>Our analysis of <italic>Vps35</italic> clones in pupal wings or leg imaginal discs revealed that in these tissues, clones completely devoid of the SJ core component NrxIV occur frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, <italic>shrub</italic> mutant clones in the pupal notum were entirely lacking junctional ATPα (Roland Le Borgne, personal communication, July 2020). This is in contrast to surface levels of SJ components in <italic>Vps35</italic> mutant wing discs, which were consistently reduced by about 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This provokes the hypothesis that a parallel endosomal export pathway for SJ components may exist in wing discs that could partially compensate for loss of retromer. However, we think this is unlikely since overexpressed HA-Mega fails to reach the SJ not only upon Shrub but also upon Vps26 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–J</xref>). One has to keep in mind that this experiment specifically monitors delivery of newly synthesized HA-Mega while the <italic>Vps35</italic> clonal analysis assesses the impact of retromer loss of function on pre-existing SJ. Thus, in a clonal situation, a ‘thinning out’ of junctions is expected with consecutive rounds of cell division, which could explain incomplete phenotypic expressivity in wing disc <italic>Vps35</italic> clones. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined why in leg discs and pupal wings, SJ appear to be more sensitive toward CSC loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). During metamorphosis, wing imaginal disc cells undergo drastic morphogenetic changes to form the pupal wing epithelium, a process known to require AJ remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Classen et al., 2005</xref>). It is therefore possible that analogously to AJ, SJ may also be actively remodeled during pupal wing formation. This could explain the strong requirement for retromer function in maintaining SJ integrity in a tissue undergoing morphogenetic changes.</p><p>Paralleling our findings described here, a previous study showed that embryonic SJ formation depends on endocytosis and subsequent redistribution of junction components from the lateral membrane to the SJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tiklová et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, transcytosis of SJ components is a mechanism likely required for both initial SJ formation as well as maintenance of SJ integrity in non-embryonic tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While we did not assess the roles of ESCRT and retromer CSC in initial SJ formation, it is conceivable that they are already required for transporting SJ components during embryogenesis. Consistently, <italic>shrub</italic> mutant embryos display a defective epithelial barrier function, suggesting they fail to form functional SJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dong et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The reason for SJ maintenance to rely on such an elaborate trafficking of its components remains to be determined. It has been suggested that SJ components form stable complexes prior to integration into the junction. Potentially, essential post-translational modifications of certain SJ components required for complex formation may occur exclusively at the basodistal membrane or during the passage through the endosomal system. If transient localization of SJ components at the basodistal membrane is a prerequisite for efficient SJ core complex formation, depositing transcripts for structural components such as Mega in the basal cytoplasm would shorten the route individual SJ components need to pass prior to SJ complex formation at the basodistal membrane domain. Alternatively, the finding that Mega mRNA predominantly localizes in the basal cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) provides the foundation for another hypothesis: It is widely accepted that apical and basolateral cargos undergo motif-based sorting leading to secretion toward the respective membrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stoops and Caplan, 2014</xref>). Basal subcellular localization of Mega transcripts could potentially reflect an apical/basolateral sorting divergence at the mRNA level. Accordingly, basal translation and exocytosis of Mega (induced by a putative basal/basolateral sorting signal) may lead to its targeting toward the basodistal membrane, despite the fact that the SJ resides apically in wing disc cells. Thus, transcytosis may serve as an adaptation for redistribution of cargos to their destined membrane domain when they are initially secreted to a different one due to early sorting signals. Since the columnar wing imaginal disc cells have a very elongated shape and possess Golgi stacks all along the apicobasal axis, it is conceivable that certain Golgi stacks residing at the apical and basal poles are specialized in secreting apical and basolateral cargos, respectively. Although this is highly hypothetical, systematic analysis of transcript localization for apical (e.g. E-cad) and basolateral (e.g. SJ components) cargos could reveal a potential spatial separation of distinct secretory routes already at the mRNA level.</p><p>In wing imaginal discs, a similarly complex transcytosis route (albeit with an apical to basal direction) has been described for the signaling molecule Wingless, which is translated apically, transiently presented at the apical membrane and finally transcytosed toward the basal membrane where it is secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yamazaki et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, distinct transcytosis pathways in the wing disc epithelium provide a mechanism for targeting certain proteins to their site of action, specifically when the protein is translated far away from its terminal destination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A novel retromer function in transport of SJ proteins</title><p>In this study, we unravel a novel physiological retromer function in regulating surface levels of a claudin and other structural SJ components (e.g. Nrg, ATPα, Lac, NrxIV, Cont) in several <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Presently, we do not know how the SJ components are selected for this retromer-dependent pathway, and whether it requires physical interaction with CSC components. Since SJ proteins may traverse the endosomal system in complex, the vast number of different components brings about a plethora of possible interaction sites. Importantly, a mass-spectrometry-based study of the Mega interactome did not detect any retromer CSC components or associated factors but confidently found SJ core components as well as clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jaspers et al., 2012</xref>).

This suggests they could represent a novel set of conserved retromer cargos. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that ESCRT/retromer-mediated transport of SJ components may be evolutionary conserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mammals. Depletion of ESCRT-I component TSG101 in mammalian epithelial cells led to a reduction of trans-epithelial resistance (TER), indicating defects in TJ-mediated barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dukes et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, Claudin-1, an essential TJ component, continuously underwent endocytosis and recycling back to the plasma membrane in several mammalian cell lines in a process requiring ESCRT function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dukes et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the mechanism behind reduced recycling and entrapment of Claudin-1 in ubiquitin-positive aberrant endosomes upon interference with ESCRT function remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dukes et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is unknown how the export of Claudin-1 from the endosomal system in mammalian cells is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dukes et al., 2011</xref>). By revealing an ESCRT-dependent function of the retromer CSC in claudin endosomal export in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, our data may provide an explanation for a possibly conserved trafficking pathway of claudins. In support of this, Claudin-1 and Claudin-4 membrane levels were significantly reduced in a mass spectrometry-based surface proteome study of Vps35-depleted human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the TJ protein Zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2) was strongly enriched in a Vps26 interactome, suggesting that a presumptive retromer function in TJ maintenance in mammalian cells may not be limited to claudins, similar to our findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> presented here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>).

Late L3 larvae or pupae were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) on ice and immediately fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Following three 10 min wash steps in PBT (0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS), tissue was blocked with 5% normal goat serum (NGS, Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBT and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies in 5% NGS in PBT for 2 hr. After three 15 min wash steps with PBT, discs were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies (Alexa-488, –568, −647 from Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 2 hr in 5% NGS in PBT. For nuclear staining, Hoechst 33258 (Sigma Aldrich) was used at a concentration of 1:10,000. Discs or pupae were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and imaged with a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 wide field microscope equipped with a Zeiss Apotome. For SJ length measurements, ROIs were manually assigned with Fiji and the total length of electron-dense SJ within ROIs was measured to yield a SJ length/ROI length ratio. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 7.0 d.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Live imaging</title><p>Late L3 instar larvae were dissected in PBS and immediately mounted on coverslips in Schneider's <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium (Pan Biotech). Double-sided tape containing a punchhole was used both as a spacer to avoid tissue damage during mounting and as a short-term imaging chamber that restricted wing disc movement. Imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning microscope equipped with an Airyscan detector. For time series, frames were acquired in 1–4 s intervals and line switching was used for dual channel acquisition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)</title><p>Wing discs were mounted as described above (see Live Imaging). Photobleaching and imaging were performed on a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal microscope using a gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) detector and 40x objective with a numeric aperture of 1.2. A 15x digital zoom was applied to yield a detection area of 14.17 × 14.17 micron, equivalent to 512 × 512 pixels. In the focal plane of the junctions, a bicellular SJ ROI (0.83 × 0.83 microns) was bleached with 100% excitation laser intensity and 10 repeats. The laser dwell time for each pixel was 4.1 μs. After bleaching, the tissue was imaged in 2 min intervals for 30 min and any potential drifting (x-, y-, z-axis) was corrected manually. Images were merged into a time series with Fiji and the mean gray values within the ROI were plotted against time/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).

A Dog detector with estimated blob diameter of 2 micron and threshold 1 were used as a fixed setup. Tracks were analyzed by the simple LAP tracker with following parameters: Linking max distance: 2. Gap closing distance: 2. Gap closing max frame gap: 20. Mean velocity was used as the parameter for comparing vesicles within wildtype and Shrub-depleted tissue.

Following five 5 min washsteps with 0.1M PO<sub>4</sub>, tissue was postfixed with osmium tetroxide (2% in 0.1M PO<sub>4</sub>) for 1 hr on ice. After three 5 min washsteps with 0.1M PO<sub>4</sub> and further washsteps with ddH<sub>2</sub>O, the specimens were gently dehydrated with ethanol in concentrations ranging from 50 to 100%. Acetone was used as an intermediate solvent to support Epoxy Embedding Medium (Epon, Sigma Aldrich) infiltration into the tissue. Specimens were stored over night in 100% Epon and subsequently embedded and sectioned. Semi-thin sections were stained with Richardson blue. Ultra-thin sections were contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate prior to imaging. Sections were analyzed with an EM 902 (Zeiss) microscope at 80 KV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</title><p>For generation of Mega RNA antisense probe, the Mega/Pickel cDNA containing LD14222 clone from DGRC was linearized by EcoRI digestion following T7 polymerase-dependent in vitro transcription and digoxigenin (DIG) labeling. RNA probes were purified with a NucleoSpin Gel and PCR clean-up kit before use in the hybridization reaction. For FISH, late L3 larvae were dissected in PBS on ice and fixed for 20 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Specimens were handled according to standard protocols. Briefly, larval tissue was incubated with RNA probes in formamide-based hybridization buffer at 65°C over night. To detect probes, HRP-conjugated anti-DIG antibodies (Perkin Elmer) were used, followed by a tyramide signal amplification reaction (TSA plus Cyanine 3 Fluorescence Kit, Perkin Elmer). Wing discs were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and imaged with a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 wide field microscope equipped with a Zeiss Apotome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Dye penetration assay</title><p>Late L3 larvae were dissected in PBS and briefly rinsed (30 s) in PBS containing 10 kDa Texas-dsRed labeled Dextran (Molecular Probes D-1828) in a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Following two quick wash steps in PBS, imaginal discs were dissected from the carcasses and immediately mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) on microscope slides. To avoid tissue damage due to compression, double-sided tape was used as a spacer between slide and cover slip. Images were acquired on a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 wide field microscope immediately after mounting (within a timeframe of 5 min).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Colocalization analysis</title><p>For measuring colocalization of Mega::YFP with either Vps26 or Chc, dual channel images of single fluorescent planes (either lateral views or basal planes) were adjusted for brightness in FiJi.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Raghu Padinjat (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162).

Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript presented by Pannen et al. addresses the question on the role of trafficking in epithelia (here: the wing disc of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae). In particular the authors revisit the consequence of loss of the ESCRT-complex on the integrity of septate junctions (SJ), which may potentially have an impact on the induction of neoplastic overgrowth. The major findings are: i) Loss of Shrub, a major component of ESCRT, results in defects in septate junction formation and function by preventing the proper apical delivery of Megatrachea (Mega), a SJ component. ii) Loss of Shrub/ESCRT affects the proper apical localization of Retromer. iii) Improper localization of Retromer, in turn, affects transcytosis of Mega and other SJ components from the basal to the apical side. These are novel data, interesting for people working on trafficking in epithelia and tumour formation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall this is an interesting, excellent and substantial body of work. The major conclusions put forward are justified by the data. Experiments are well done and the results presented very clearly. There are a few points that the authors may want to consider:</p><p>1) The authors themselves point out that many elements of the pathway described here have already been presented in the context of polarized cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. They highlight the importance of their work in the wing disc as the demonstration of these findings in the epithelium of a mitotic cell that is actively dividing. Bearing this in mind, could they present the effect of retromer depletion on wing disc morphology? Will depletion of retromer components result in the neoplastic phenotype presented in Figure 1B, C. This would be a small but important addition.</p><p>2) It is proposed that Mega RNA is enriched near the basal (lateral) membrane, transcytosed and delivered to the apical domain. The authors have pointed out that it is unclear why this complex route of protein trafficking is used. It would be good to discuss why this is the case, i.e. why does it have to be translated near the basal membrane. Does it mean that some other basal membrane component is needed to associate with Mega prior to its transport to the apical domain?</p><p>3) Figure 3G: I suggest to quantify the overlap between Mega-YFP and Vps26 to make the conclusion more robust.</p><p>Points that could contribute to clarification (Please address if this is feasible.

Dlg or Cora? ii) Does the reduction of Mega upon loss of retromer affect the structure of the SJ?</p><p>6) Figure 4E: I suggest to quantify the overlap between Mega-YFP and Chc to make the conclusion more robust, in particular to demonstrate that the overlap is predominantly on the basal side.</p><p>7) The authors write that transcytosis &quot;appears to serve as a universal mechanism. &quot;. I find this conclusion somewhat premature. Tiklova et al., 2010 only checked for Cora as a SJ marker.</p><p>8) In the manuscript here, Cora seems to be unaffected upon loss of Vps35 (Figure 2F). So different SJ components behave differently upon blocking endocytosis in embryonic and larval epithelia. It would also be interesting to get to know the opinions of the authors with respect to the different behaviour of SJ components in their experiments.</p><p>9) Along the same line: what is the authors' opinion on the function of the retromer CSC (Vps35, Vps26), which seems to act independent of other retromer components (e.g. sorting nexins, as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 5)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61866.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall this is an interesting, excellent and substantial body of work.

We have added a semi thin section of a Vps26-RNAi expressing wing disc to Figure 2—figure supplement 4, showing the intact epithelial monolayer organization. These are the discs we used to quantify SJ density, which revealed a significant reduction in the amount of electron dense septa found in the posterior Vps26 depleted compartment. Thus, although having defects in SJ integrity, Retromer mutant / depleted tissue does not lose apicobasal cell polarity (also note the wildtype E-cad and Dlg levels within Vps35 mutant clones; Figure 2). We believe that the major driver of neoplasia in ESCRT deficient wing discs is the high amount of simultaneously misregulated signaling pathways (such as ectopic Notch activation, overview in (Vaccari and Bilder, 2009)). In contrast, Vps26 depletion does not lead to ectopic Notch signaling activation (Gomez-Lamarca et al., 2015), Thus, an important difference between Retromer and ESCRT loss / depletion is the impact on cellular signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is proposed that Mega RNA is enriched near the basal (lateral) membrane, transcytosed and delivered to the apical domain. The authors have pointed out that it is unclear why this complex route of protein trafficking is used. It would be good to discuss why this is the case, i.e. why does it have to be translated near the basal membrane. Does it mean that some other basal membrane component is needed to associate with Mega prior to its transport to the apical domain?</p></disp-quote><p>At this stage we can only speculate about the reason for Mega being translated basally and initially transported to the basodistal membrane. Currently we do not know whether this route is specific to Mega or shared with other SJ core components. It is possible that the milieu at the basodistal membrane facilitates SJ complex formation, which could require SJ components to be translated in proximity. Alternatively, basal subcellular localization of Mega transcripts could reflect early / transcriptional spatial separation of apical (such as E-cad) and basolateral (such as SJ components) cargos. This would mean that the complex transcytosis route is an adaptation for tissues in which apical and basolateral cargos reside in close proximity at the apical pole of the cells (as is the case in imaginal discs). It would be interesting to test the transcript localizations of other SJ components and compare those to apical cargos such as Notch, Crumbs and E-cad. At this stage, these hypotheses remain highly speculative but we added these to the Discussion for the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3G: I suggest to quantify the overlap between Mega-YFP and Vps26 to make the conclusion more robust.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the overlap of Mega::YFP vesicles with the Retromer component Vps26, which revealed a 71,9% Vps26 positivity rate for Mega::YFP vesicles throughout wing imaginal disc cells. Additionally, we included a live-imaging video showing colocalization and co-movement of Mega::YFP with Vps35::RFP (Animation 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Points that could contribute to clarification (Please address if this is feasible. At least address the issues in the revised draft)</p><p>1) Figure 1H/subsection “ESCRT knockdown specifically affects SJ integrity”: This figure is not clear, I guess H and H' show the same part of the disc? And what does the inset show? Part of the same image? What does the sentence mean &quot;This basal fraction of Mega was strongly labelled with the endosomal marker Rab7.…&quot;? Does &quot;strongly&quot; mean co-localisation? Could this quantified?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, Figure 1H and H´ show two channels (Mega and Rab) of the same basal part of the wing disc tissue. The inset (both channels merged, colocalization in white) is a magnification of some of these basal endosomes that show large overlap between Mega and Rab7. We agree that this was not very evident for the reader, so we revised this part of the figure by outlining the origin of the inset. The strong colocalization of Mega / HA-Mega with Rab7 on basal aberrant endosomal compartments induced by Shrub depletion is also shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “ESCRT knockdown specifically affects SJ integrity”: the role of Mega with respect to localising other SJ components is deduced from its role in embryos. What about the consequences of loss of Mega in discs?</p></disp-quote><p>We now have included a figure that shows slight lateral spreading of Lac::GFP upon Mega depletion in wing imaginal discs (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). This suggests that similar to SJ in the embryo, the imaginal disc SJ complex (partially) loses its integrity and confined localization upon loss of individual SJ components. Since this phenotype is much weaker compared to Lac::GFP lateral spreading upon Shrub depletion (Figure 1I), the data also indicate that loss of Mega alone is insufficient to strongly destabilize Lac::GFP within the junction. Thus, the more severe Lac::GFP phenotype observed upon Shrub depletion suggests that besides Mega, apical levels of more SJ core components might be affected in ESCRT depleted tissue. We added another figure in which we confirmed this by visualizing the SJ core component ATPα in Shrub depleted wing disc tissue, revealing a strong reduction at the SJ level (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), similar to the phenotype observed for Mega (Figure 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1I: is the mis-localised Lac-GFP really localised on the lateral membrane? This is only obvious on sites indicated by the arrowheads. What are the blobs seen in other cases?</p></disp-quote><p>The lateral spreading of Lac::GFP is particularly evident at the level of the nuclei. The plasma membrane at this level is devoid of Lac::GFP in the anterior control compartment but enriched with Lac::GFP in the Shrub depleted compartment. The phenotype might be more apparent in the upper half of the image, which shows parts of the epithelium that do not represent a sagittal section. We have added further arrows to highlight this part of the image, which might help in understanding this phenotype easier. Also note how this lateral membrane fraction (in the upper part of the image) sharply appears at the a/p compartment boundary. The Lac::GFP blobs are most likely endosomal compartments, although we did not stain for the endosomal marker Rab7 in this particular experiment. Note that most TMPs and / or membrane anchored proteins that we analyzed show endosomal accumulation to varying extents upon ESCRT loss / depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1J: what are the error bars in this figure?</p></disp-quote><p>The error bars indicate standard deviation from the mean fluorescence signal intensity at each individual time point. We have included this in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “The Retromer CSC regulates membrane levels of SJ core components”: the authors show that loss of retromer components differentially affects components of the SJs.

The effect of Retromer depletion on SJ density is displayed in Figure 2—figure supplement 4. The reduction of SJ density by about 50% also makes Retromer depleted wing disc tissue leaky, indicated by defective epithelial barrier function (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 4E: I suggest to quantify the overlap between Mega-YFP and Chc to make the conclusion more robust, in particular to demonstrate that the overlap is predominantly on the basal side.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the amount of Mega::YFP vesicles that overlap with Chc (colocalization) and included this data in the revised draft. Quantification revealed a Chc positive rate of 55,2% for Mega::YFP vesicles throughout the entire cell, while the rate was slightly increased to 63,01% in basal planes of the epithelium. This is consistent with Mega::YFP undergoing clathrin dependent endocytosis at the basodistal membrane and being trafficking in clathrin coated vesicles along the apico-basal axis in wing imaginal discs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors write that transcytosis &quot;appears to serve as a universal mechanism. &quot;. I find this conclusion somewhat premature. Tiklova et al., 2010 only checked for Cora as a SJ marker.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this statement is premature. We have revised the section, now stating that transcytosis is likely required for both initial formation and maintenance (e.g. in imaginal discs) of SJ in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, besides Cora, Tiklova and colleagues also showed a similar effect of clathrin loss on Melanotransferrin / Mtf localization (lateral membrane spreading) (Tiklova et al., 2010). Although not being a TMP, the GPI-anchor of Mtf suggests a tight membrane association of this SJ component, which sets it apart from cytoplasmic SJ associated proteins such as Dlg and Cora (Tiklova et al., 2010). Unfortunately, the Mtf antibody did not work in our hands on imaginal disc tissue to test whether its SJ delivery in wing discs requires ESCRT / Retromer functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the manuscript here, Cora seems to be unaffected upon loss of Vps35 (Figure 2F). So different SJ components behave differently upon blocking endocytosis in embryonic and larval epithelia. It would also be interesting to get to know the opinions of the authors with respect to the different behaviour of SJ components in their experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed an interesting observation that concentration of Cora during SJ formation in the embryo requires clathrin / endocytosis (Tiklova et al., 2010) while junctional Cora levels in imaginal discs are independent of Retromer (Figure 2F). If we assume a similar pathway relying on endocytosis and potentially Retromer dependent junctional delivery of SJ TMP components in larval tissues and the embryo, this could mean that clathrin deficient embryos might fail to initially form septa at all (due to the lack of SJ TMP complex trafficking). The potential lack of septa might prevent cytoplasmic scaffolding components such as Cora from concentrating at the SJ membrane region. In tissues with stably established polarity and junctional integrity (imaginal discs), even a small amount of SJ complexes / septa residing at the junctional region (e.g. by introduction of Vps35/Vps26 null mutant clones) might be sufficient to serve as a positional cue for scaffolding components. It is therefore possible that Retromer function in the embryo is even more essential to SJ formation than it is for maintenance in proliferating tissues. This of course is hypothetical and demands investigation. It is important to note that FRAP kinetics of Cora in the embryo were similar to FRAP rates of SJ TMP core components (Oshima and Fehon, 2011). Thus, Cora may be part of the core SJ complex in embryos and consequently dependent on the TMP components for its localization. Our data in wing discs however support the idea that Cora might not traffic in complex with the TMP SJ components in wing imaginal discs but is rather independently targeted to the SJ. It would be interesting to test whether Cora FRAP kinetics in the wing disc lean more towards the TMP fraction or if they resemble the quick recovery kinetics of Dlg (Oshima and Fehon, 2011). This could help unravel a potential difference in core complex composition between embryonic and larval SJ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Along the same line: what is the authors' opinion on the function of the retromer CSC (Vps35, Vps26), which seems to act independent of other retromer components (e.g. sorting nexins, as shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 5)?</p></disp-quote><p>The data we present in this manuscript suggest that the CSC is required to export Mega (and likely other TMP SJ core components) from the endosomal system to target the proteins to the junctional membrane. Since the CSC itself does not possess membrane deforming activities, we can only speculate on how Mega is sorted out of the maturing endosome. It is possible that previously uncharacterized CSC co-factors may aid Retromer during formation of Mega containing transport carriers / tubules. Alternatively, CSC interaction with Mega / SJ components within maturing endosomes may save these proteins from the degradative ILV route without actually exporting them from the endosome, although it is unclear how they could reach the SJ directly from maturing endosomes (without formation of a specific CSC/SJ transport carrier). Thus, we favor the model of a classical Retromer export route (formation of a CSC dependent carrier vesicle / tubule from maturing endosomes), with the detailed mechanism of carrier generation being obscure. We have discussed this briefly in the revised manuscript.</p><p>References:</p><p>Gomez-Lamarca, M.J., L.A. Snowdon, E. Seib, T. Klein, and S.J. Bray. 2015.
