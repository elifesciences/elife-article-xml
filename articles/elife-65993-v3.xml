Some of these interactions such as those of transcription factors and promoters have been studied extensively. However, predicting phenotypes of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) remains a major challenge. Here, we use a well-defined synthetic GRN to study in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> how network phenotypes depend on local genetic context, i.e. the genetic neighborhood of a transcription factor and its relative position. We show that one GRN with fixed topology can display not only quantitatively but also qualitatively different phenotypes, depending solely on the local genetic context of its components. Transcriptional read-through is the main molecular mechanism that places one transcriptional unit (TU) within two separate regulons without the need for complex regulatory sequences. We propose that relative order of individual TUs, with its potential for combinatorial complexity, plays an important role in shaping phenotypes of GRNs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>genetic context</kwd><kwd>genotype phenotype map</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011264</institution-id><institution>FP7 People: Marie-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>628377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagy-Staron</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3901-B32</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guet</surname><given-names>Calin C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The phenotype of a gene regulatory network depends both qualitatively and quantitatively on the local genetic context of its individual components and cannot necessarily be predicted solely from network's topology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Changes in regulatory connections between individual transcriptional units (TUs) or, in other words, the rewiring of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), is a major genetic mechanism underlying phenotypic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shubin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wagner and Lynch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wray, 2007</xref>). A lot of effort has been put into understanding how mutations in transcription factors and their DNA binding sites within promoter regions influence GRN behavior, plasticity, and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaji et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Igler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Isalan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nocedal et al., 2017</xref>). However, we are still unable to predict GRN phenotypes from first principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Browning and Busby, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Genes and the genetic elements that regulate them, promoters, are arranged in a linear manner on chromosomes. Thus they are embedded into a larger genetic context, represented by the changing genetic background of the rest of the genomic sequence or by their specific physical location on the chromosome. The genetic context in which GRNs find themselves in, influences and modulates the way these respond to the environment and interact with other GRNs and it also shapes the interactions within the GRN itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardinale and Arkin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu and Rao, 2010</xref>). In bacteria, gene expression levels are thought to be determined by RNA polymerase recognizing promoter sequences and subsequently initiating transcription, which is the key step at which a large part of transcriptional regulation takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browning and Busby, 2004</xref>). However, context effects resulting from occupying a particular location within the genome can significantly alter expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lagomarsino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scholz et al., 2019</xref>). Distance to the origin of replication influences transcription levels due to gene dosage effects, the presence of transcriptionally active and silent regions, as well as spatial and temporal variation in DNA superhelicity, while collisions between DNA replication and transcription influence gene expression levels differently on leading and lagging strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckwith et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bryant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mirkin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sobetzko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vora et al., 2009</xref>). At a local scale, transcriptional interference, transcription-coupled DNA supercoiling, presence of <italic>cis</italic>-antisense RNA, as well as transcriptional read-through, all link together the expression of neighboring TUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cambray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Georg and Hess, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Wang, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reynolds et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shearwin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu and Fang, 2003</xref>). Within operons, number, length, and order of genes can all affect gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacob and Monod, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zipser, 1969</xref>). All of these factors that can individually modulate gene expression vary simultaneously across the genome, with potential for significant combinatorial effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scholz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While these multiple local context-dependent mechanisms are known to modulate gene expression, the qualitative phenotype of a GRN is often thought to be defined solely by the network topology and the gene expression levels of GRN components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mangan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Payne and Wagner, 2015</xref>), and thus determined simply by the promoter sequences, independent of the physical location of the genes. One of the reasons for this assumption is the belief that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes are less pleiotropic than changes to the protein itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prud'homme et al., 2006</xref>), although some have questioned this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stern and Orgogozo, 2008</xref>). However, other non-coding genetic factors such as transcriptional read-through or supercoiling have the potential to change gene expression with the same pleiotropic freedom as <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes. Here, we ask how the immediate local genetic context outside of individual TUs of a GRN can alter both the qualitative and quantitative phenotype of a network, and how many phenotypes are accessible for this particular GRN, while the network topology per se remains unchanged. In order to keep the number of genetic interactions to a minimum, we chose to study a synthetic GRN. This tractable system allows for a simplified description of more complex naturally occurring GRNs, where a large number of inherently complex interactions make such a question very difficult to answer experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mukherji and van Oudenaarden, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wolf and Arkin, 2003</xref>). Here, we shuffle individual TUs (understood here as the unit formed by: the mRNA coding sequence, the promoter driving its expression and the transcriptional terminator marking the end of the transcribed sequence) of a GRN. In doing so, we alter solely the <italic>local genetic context,</italic> while keeping the actual interactions (topology) within the GRN unchanged and thus the number of interactions to a tractable minimum. We then define the <italic>phenotype of the GRN</italic> as the levels of gene expression measured across four different environments, defined by the presence or absence of two different chemical inducers that alter the binding state of two different well-characterized transcription factors. Qualitative phenotypes are here based on a set of binary output values for each input state, therefore defining different logical operators (e.g. NOR, ON, OFF) (for details see <italic>Threshold for assigning a phenotype to individual GRNs</italic>). Quantitative phenotypes are defined as a set of four expression values varying continuously within one particular behavior. In this way, we systematically explore the space of possible phenotypes of the GRN and thereby we can disentangle the effects of local genetic context from multiple other factors that can affect gene expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our GRN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is composed of the genes coding for three of the best characterized repressors: LacI, TetR, and lambda CI (abbreviations used throughout the text: L, T, and C, respectively), and the promoters they control, P<italic><sub>lac</sub></italic>, P<italic><sub>tet</sub></italic>, and P<sub>R</sub>. The three repressor genes are transcriptionally interconnected into a GRN, with LacI repressing both <italic>tetR</italic> and its own expression, and TetR repressing expression of <italic>cI</italic>. The controlled promoters are synthetic variants of the P<sub>L</sub> promoter of phage lambda with two <italic>tet</italic> or <italic>lac</italic> operator sites located in the direct vicinity of the −35 and −10 promoter elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lutz and Bujard, 1997</xref>). The binding state of TetR and LacI changes in the presence of inducers: anhydrotetracycline (aTc) and isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), respectively. A <italic>yfp</italic> gene, expressed from a CI-controlled P<sub>R</sub> promoter, serves as output. The <italic>yfp</italic> gene is located separately from the rest of the genetic circuit at a transcriptionally insulated locus on the chromosome (<italic>attB</italic> site of phage P21). In our synthetic system, each individual promoter and transcription factor gene it controls are separated from the neighboring one by a strong transcriptional terminator T1 of the <italic>rrnB</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orosz et al., 1991</xref>), forming an individual TU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

First, we developed a simple mathematical model of the mechanistic basis of gene expression for this specific network topology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This model tracks the concentrations of all three repressors as their respective promoter activities are influenced by their known specific network interactions. The predicted phenotype of our GRN will depend on the presence of aTc, but not on the presence of IPTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We wanted to test if this phenotype is independent of the relative TU order and orientation, and we aimed to build plasmids with all possible 48 relative TU order permutations with fixed positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Riordan, 2003</xref>) such that: (i) every TU can occupy any of the three positions, (ii) every TU is present only once, (iii) both forward and reverse orientations are possible, and (iv) network topology stays the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To facilitate comparisons among all GRNs we used a threshold on the expression of the YFP output for assigning a binary output value to each environment and so defined a phenotype the GRN can achieve (for thresholds used to assign a particular phenotype to individual networks, see <italic>Supplementary material</italic>).</p><p>The phenotype of strains carrying the resulting 37 plasmids (multiple attempts to clone eleven of the TU order permutations failed, see <italic>Supplemental material</italic>) varied widely both quantitatively and qualitatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). More than half (20) of the tested GRN permutations showed a phenotype which was qualitatively different than what was predicted <italic>ab initio</italic>. We also observed multiple quantitative differences in expression levels within one class of logical phenotypes (e.g. permutations CLT, CTL<sub>r</sub>, T<sub>r</sub>CL, and LT<sub>r</sub>C<sub>r</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GRN phenotype is influenced by local genetic context independently of the replicon</title><p>We then asked how and why the changes in relative order of individual TUs affect the phenotype of the GRN, although network topology and individual genetic components of the GRN (i.e. individual TUs) remain unchanged. In order to disentangle the specific interactions between network components we focused on six GRNs which differ in relative TU order but not in gene orientation. These six GRNs show two qualitatively different phenotypes (NOR and NOT [aTc]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper panel). In four out of six strains (LCT, LTC, TCL, and TLC), induction with IPTG shifted <italic>yfp</italic> expression levels to the OFF state. These population-level findings are also observed at the single cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lower panel).

We find that our GRN can access multiple phenotypes by simply shuffling the relative order of TUs without any changes in promoters and coding sequence. Thus, changes in regulatory connections between single regulons can be achieved solely by changes in local genetic context, which represent a category of mutations that is to be contrasted from single base pair mutations.

Reported rates span a wide range (from 10<sup>−3</sup> to 10<sup>−8</sup> per cell per generation), but are typically orders of magnitude higher than rates of point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hudson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sousa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tomanek et al., 2020</xref>). Given this elevated frequency of small- and large-scale genomic rearrangements in various bacterial species, changes in local genetic context have the potential to shape bacterial phenotypes even in the absence of sequence changes. Specific local genetic contexts could have arisen in response to selection for changes in gene expression levels. Indeed, genomic rearrangements were found to significantly change expression patterns in numerous organisms, including <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic>, and <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brinig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douillard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raeside et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weigand et al., 2017</xref>). It needs to be stressed that the impact of local genetic context of GRN elements on fitness will strongly depend on the network’s output. Examples of how even a small effect can be strongly amplified further downstream in a regulatory network are the regulatory circuit governing lysogenic and lytic states of phage lambda, or the processes behind entry into sporulation or genetic competence in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dubnau and Losick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narula et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ptashne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smits et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Growing evidence has been emerging that transcriptional read-through is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cambray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conway et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lalanne et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). This raises the question of whether (potentially ubiquitous) the lack of clearly defined gene and operon boundaries can be disruptive, or alternatively if this lack of precise functional boundaries is used for the benefit of the cell. The answer is likely gene-specific, reflecting the complexity of the numerous molecular mechanisms acting at the level of a single gene. On one hand, in order to impact the phenotype, transcriptional read-through into neighboring genes needs to reach an effective threshold, and increases in expression levels can be down-regulated post-transcriptionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lalanne et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, fitness benefits have been observed in strains with global changes in Rho-dependent termination levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freddolino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Helmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Steinrueck and Guet, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tenaillon et al., 2012</xref>), and it is likely that local transcriptional read-through at specific intrinsic terminators is also beneficial under certain conditions. As rates of transcriptional read-through can be condition-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yan et al., 2018</xref>), there are many complex molecular interactions left to disentangle regarding the fitness effects, whether beneficial or detrimental, of inefficient transcriptional termination.</p><p>We find that transcriptional read-through is an important molecular mechanism behind the effects we observe in our synthetic GRN system. Changes in the strength of transcriptional termination generally require just a small number of mutations, often only individual point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">San Millan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schuster et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weigand et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, despite our synthetic GRN having been designed to restrict transcriptional read-through by using a single very strong transcriptional terminator, we observed a variety of phenotypes our GRN can access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cambray et al., 2013</xref>). Naturally occurring transcriptional terminators cover a wide range of efficiencies and hence have potential to create a large number of regulatory connections between neighboring TUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cambray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reynolds et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>Most studies on chromosomal position effects focus explicitly on molecular mechanisms other than transcriptional read-through by insulating a reporter system with strong terminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Block et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sousa et al., 1997</xref>). Given the fact that endogenous terminators vary widely in their efficiency, we argue that transcriptional read-through from neighboring genes is an inherent component of chromosomal position effects. It can significantly add to other genetic context-dependent effects resulting from gene dosage or DNA supercoiling. Such complex interplay of mechanisms can be seen in our synthetic genetic system, as not all phenotypes we see can be explained by transcriptional read-through alone and there are likely other molecular mechanisms of a more global nature influencing the phenotypes of our GRN. This observation highlights how challenging it is to disentangle all of the complex genetic interactions even in a very simplified synthetic GRN built out of the best-characterized transcription factors. Using simple synthetic systems helps to dissect and understand the dynamics of more intricate and complex cellular interactions, following the tradition of simple model systems that have been powerful throughout the history of molecular biology. Understanding of how synthetic genetic systems behave can be greatly aided by modeling approaches. However, often times the mathematical models can be complex in their implementation and thus difficult to interpret. As we show here, simple, minimalistic models can give important insights into fundamental biological mechanisms. Moreover, transcriptional read-through is a component rarely included in the modeling of GRNs. Yet, its effect can be readily added into any modeling framework.</p><p>Gene expression and its regulation are influenced by multiple coexisting molecular mechanisms, through the concerted action of DNA binding proteins, including RNA polymerase, transcription factors, topoisomerases, and nucleoid-associated proteins acting at different levels of organization: from short promoter sequences to mega-base large DNA macro-domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Junier, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lagomarsino et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we show that the local genetic context created by the relative TU order can act as one of the genetic mechanisms shaping regulatory connections in regulons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Changes in local genetic context have the potential to place an individual TU into two independent regulons without the need to evolve complex regulatory elements. Transcriptional read-through, by enabling a diversity of gene expression profiles to be accessed by shuffling of individual TUs, may be one of the mechanisms shaping the evolutionary dynamics of bacterial genomes. Indeed, the fact that gene expression levels of one gene can be influenced by the gene expression levels of its immediate neighbor has important consequences for the evolution of operons. For a long time it has been debated whether any selective advantage is gained from the physical proximity of two TUs and how this physical proximity can be maintained before common transcription factor-based transcriptional regulation can evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lawrence and Roth, 1996</xref>). We suggest that physical proximity alone can result in increased co-expression due to transcriptional read-through and thus can be advantageous by changing gene expression patterns without the need for any changes in promoter sequences or to the specificity of transcription factors. Indeed, correlated expression of genes reaching beyond the level of an operon has been recently observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Junier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Junier and Rivoire, 2016</xref>). Our results also have important implications for comparative genomics, as sequence conservation does not necessarily equal functional conservation. Finally, there is a lesson for engineering living systems, as our results underscore the importance of understanding how nature itself can compute with GRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guet et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kwok, 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Architecture of a regulon depends on local genetic context.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of interactions within our gene regulatory network (GRN) in two different transcriptional unit (TU) arrangements: CLT and TLC.

simple as we thought. Indeed, We think insights into the effects of transcriptional read-through will interest many concerned with the connection between genotype and phenotype.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Local genetic context shapes the function of a gene regulatory network&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after considerable consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>It was not easy coming to this decision. All reviewers and the reviewing editor found much merit in the work. Particularly appreciated was the extensive generation of gene combinations and evidence of effects on the GRN. But the agreed position among the reviewers that more was required in order to rise about the bar necessary for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular, all felt that lack of insight into the molecular basis of the observed effects amounted to a significant shortcoming.</p><p>Recognising that this is something that could be overcome there was discussion as to whether this could be achieved within a two-month window. Of course all recognised that in the time of covid this is an unrealistic time frame, but nonetheless, it was felt that significant additional work was required. This said, we would be happy to consider a fresh resubmission at some future time if the authors were able to deliver additional information as to the effect of the GRN on transcriptional read-through.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I flipped about with this manuscript, from mildly enthusiastic to very enthusiastic; back and forth. On balance though, I think it provides useful additional understanding of factors affecting the evolution of GRN. Like amplification, and various structural changes, those affecting the relative placement of genes can have unrecognised effects.</p><p>The work itself is thorough and clean. A very simple contrived construct is used and the various permutations of possible gene placements are comprehensively analysed. The work in chromosomal context is very nice, and especially so the work placing the three genes in separate chromosomal locations.</p><p>Where I was left hanging was with regard to the molecular mechanism. I buy the data showing that the mechanism involves transcriptional read-through, but the reader is left with no additional understanding. The obvious unaddressed question is why does transcriptional read through occur given otherwise identical terminators?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors describe an issue well-known to synthetic biologist who are trying to build synthetic gene circuits in a predictive manner, namely context-dependent effects. More specifically, they are focusing on the order of the individual transcriptional units of a circuit and observe different behaviours, not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively. I like the approach of using a synthetic circuit, I think it is interesting to quantify such an effect in more detail and also to put it into an evolutionary context. However, I did not enjoy the manuscript as much as I was hoping for after reading the Abstract, due to following reasons:</p><p>1) Very little thought was put into making the figures self-explanatory. I had to go several times for and back between text, figure and figure captions to understand what is actually shown, how the experimental results compare to the expectations and how the results compare across the different systems. Some extra schemes might help here. This applies to all of the figures, but I will explain it in more detail for Figure 1 and Figure 4</p><p>Figure 1A: Explain and show in detail what phenotype is expected. Maybe use the mathematical model used later to illustrate the expression level of each involved protein under all conditions. As the networks involve a negative feedback loop, I find this non-trivial. The expected behaviour will depend on the repression strength of <italic>lacI</italic>. B. also label the prompters. C: instead of only the labels &quot;CfLfTf&quot; etc, add the small schemes, including labelling.</p><p>Figure 4A: Add the interactions into the scheme and the expected behaviours for each case (with/without readthrough). Also include YFP in this scheme. This might be trivial for the authors, but it is not for a reader, who has not worked years on that project</p><p>The figures would also be easier to read if you used some colours.</p><p>2) The experimental evidence for the author's conclusion that transcriptional read-through is the main factor for some of the unexpected phenotypes is rather slim. The only evidence is Figure 4. I would like to see more evidence. They say a RNAse site prevents it to detect in Western blotting. But as the system is synthetic, it is very simple to remove that site. Moreover, they should insert about 10 different terminators and use qPCR or RNAseq to quantify the read-through in order to get an idea how wide-spread this phenomenon is. It would also be easy to put multiple terminators in a row and see if that recovers the expected behaviour. The beauty of a synthetic system is that those experiment are done in few weeks. (Of course not if the lab is shut down due to COVID-19…)</p><p>We observed that it is very easy to get unwanted promoter in sequences. That is supported by literature that shows that is very easy to get promoters from random sequences. Could this be an alternative explanation? Please discuss whether and how this can be distinguished from read-through?</p><p>3) The effect in the native circuit is rather modest. Is this even significant? No statistical test was performed. Again, the read-through should be quantified by qPCR or RNAseq.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Overall, there are some conceptual issues with the study, as presented. The study does demonstrate physical context of genes does impact outputs. However, there are some issues.</p><p>The research and findings are not well placed in the field. There are a number of notable studies that have examined physical location of genes and their impact on regulatory networks and/or physiological outputs using natural and synthetic systems. For example, phage T7 was refactored and these synthetic T7 phages have notable differences in infectivity, etc. from their WT T7 counterpart (Chan, 2005). Additionally, a study by Wu and Rao (2010) has examined the impacts of genetic arrangement on the outputs of autoregulatory circuits. There are several other similar studies, beyond the few cited in this manuscript. How this approach builds on these studies is not made very clear.</p><p>The study seems to have honed in on one particular aspect that may affect a regulatory network – transcriptional readthrough. This seems to be explanatory for this system, and is likely a direct use of using very strong promoters (P_L derivatives). Use of such strong promoters, regardless of the efficiency of a terminator, will result in significant amounts of readthrough. How transcriptional readthrough generally contributes to regulatory networks is debatable. The data presented to support the importance of readthrough (Figure 5), while possibly statistically significant, does not provide convincing evidence for strong effects. Building on this point, how frequently are transcription factors in a multicomponent network encoded in close proximity?

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I flipped about with this manuscript, from mildly enthusiastic to very enthusiastic; back and forth. On balance though, I think it provides useful additional understanding of factors affecting the evolution of GRN. Like amplification, and various structural changes, those affecting the relative placement of genes can have unrecognised effects.</p><p>The work itself is thorough and clean. A very simple contrived construct is used and the various permutations of possible gene placements are comprehensively analysed. The work in chromosomal context is very nice, and especially so the work placing the three genes in separate chromosomal locations.</p><p>Where I was left hanging was with regard to the molecular mechanism. I buy the data showing that the mechanism involves transcriptional read-through, but the reader is left with no additional understanding. The obvious unaddressed question is why does transcriptional read through occur given otherwise identical terminators?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the encouraging words and appreciation of this work. We also thank the reviewer for having pushed us to dig deeper in to the mechanistic aspects definitely improved our work. We hope that in the revised version we managed to address the criticism such that the level of enthusiasm is “very” across the entire manuscript.</p><p>Specifically, the extensive new experimental data we provide (strains with promoter mutations or exchanged terminator strength using different naturally occuring terminators; qPCR to verify expression levels, Northern blot to visualize read-through transcripts) addresses some of the conundrum related to molecular mechanism. We have also clarified why transcriptional read-through, although likely happening at all terminators in our GRN, has a measurable effect only if it increases expression levels of only one repressor, namely λ CI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors describe an issue well-known to synthetic biologist who are trying to build synthetic gene circuits in a predictive manner, namely context-dependent effects. More specifically, they are focusing on the order of the individual transcriptional units of a circuit and observe different behaviours, not only quantitatively, but also qualitatively. I like the approach of using a synthetic circuit, I think it is interesting to quantify such an effect in more detail and also to put it into an evolutionary context. However, I did not enjoy the manuscript as much as I was hoping for after reading the Abstract, due to following reasons:</p><p>1) Very little thought was put into making the figures self-explanatory. I had to go several times for and back between text, figure and figure captions to understand what is actually shown, how the experimental results compare to the expectations and how the results compare across the different systems. Some extra schemes might help here. This applies to all of the figures, but I will explain it in more detail for Figure 1 and Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. We only realized in retrospect how heavy the presentation was. We therefore made a number of changes to all figures, most importantly adding color coding which helps to connect the repressors with conditions in which they change their promoter affinity. We have simplified the labelling of networks, with a capital letter (e.g. C) signifying a gene in forward orientation, and a capital letter with ‘r’ (e.g. C<sub>r</sub>) signifying a gene in reverse orientation, making the figures easier to read. We also added – as suggested – schemes where applicable. Former Figure S1, depicting all permutations of our GRN has been split into two easier to read Figures 1—figure supplement 2 and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1A: Explain and show in detail what phenotype is expected. Maybe use the mathematical model used later to illustrate the expression level of each involved protein under all conditions. As the networks involve a negative feedback loop, I find this non-trivial. The expected behaviour will depend on the repression strength of lacI. B. also label the prompters. C: instead of only the labels &quot;CfLfTf&quot; etc, add the small schemes, including labelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions – predicted behavior of the network is now illustrated in Figure 1A. We labeled the prompters in Figure 1B by adding a legend as well. Genetic architecture and labelling was added in Figure 1C (as well as in other relevant figures).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4A: Add the interactions into the scheme and the expected behaviours for each case (with/without readthrough). Also include YFP in this scheme. This might be trivial for the authors, but it is not for a reader, who has not worked years on that project.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the figure benefits from more explanation. We added interactions within the GRN, including YFP. We also added a short explanation of expected results to the figure caption: “We expected that if GRN behavior is due to transcriptional read-through, mutating the P<italic><sub>tet</sub></italic> promoter should not affect the responsiveness to IPTG. If, on the other hand, expression of <italic>cI</italic> was driven only by P<italic><sub>tet</sub></italic>, mutating the -10 promoter element should lead to an ALL ON phenotype. Lack of repression in strains with P<italic><sub>tet-10</sub></italic> variant after aTc induction further confirms that this promoter variant is inactive.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The figures would also be easier to read if you used some colours.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion on using colors. We used a consistent color scheme in majority of the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The experimental evidence for the author's conclusion that transcriptional read-through is the main factor for some of the unexpected phenotypes is rather slim. The only evidence is Figure 4. I would like to see more evidence. They say a RNAse site prevents it to detect in Western blotting. But as the system is synthetic, it is very simple to remove that site. Moreover, they should insert about 10 different terminators and use qPCR or RNAseq to quantify the read-through in order to get an idea how wide-spread this phenomenon is. It would also be easy to put multiple terminators in a row and see if that recovers the expected behaviour. The beauty of a synthetic system is that those experiment are done in few weeks. (Of course not if the lab is shut down due to COVID-19)</p></disp-quote><p>We added a significant amount of additional experimental data to substantiate our conclusions:</p><p>a) We constructed a number of strains with <italic>tet</italic> promoter mutations (Figure 4—figure supplement 1)</p><p>b) We changed terminator strength by changing T1 terminator to either: stronger double terminator T1T2, weaker T<italic>crp</italic> or T<italic>tonB</italic>, or a combined T1-T<italic>crp</italic> terminator (Figure 5)</p><p>c) We also visualized read-through transcripts by Northern blotting (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>The RNase site within T1 cannot be removed without influencing terminator strength, as it is located within the hairpin. Therefore, as suggested by the reviewer, we exchanged terminators and inserted two stronger double terminators (T1T2 and T1-T<italic>crp</italic>) and two weaker ones (T<italic>crp</italic> or T<italic>tonB</italic>). The strongest terminator recovers the expected phenotype, the second double terminator recovers it only partially. Weaker terminators lead to more transcriptional read-through. We also visualized read-through transcripts using Northern blot.</p><p>We find that it is beyond the scope of this paper to demonstrate how widespread transcriptional read-through is especially since this is still a hard and open problem both bioinformatically and experimentally. We are currently preparing a manuscript reporting on measurements of termination efficiency of over 150 <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. enterica</italic> terminators, which in majority of the cases are weaker than T1 we used in this study. A paper by Cambray et al., 2013, shows that termination efficiencies cover a large range, and that terminators in <italic>E. coli</italic> are in general not 100% efficient in stopping transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We observed that it is very easy to get unwanted promoter in sequences. That is supported by literature that shows that is very easy to get promoters from random sequences. Could this be an alternative explanation? Please discuss whether and how this can be distinguished from read-through?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very valid point. To rule out that there is spurious transcription emerging from a DNA fragment between repressor-encoding genes, we cloned these fragments in front of a promoterless <italic>yfp</italic> gene, but detected no fluorescence (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Moreover, Northern blots show full length readthrough transcripts. Another important point is that read-through is dependent on IPTG concentration (in all networks showing NOR phenotype, for IPTG gradient see Figure 3D). With all this evidence, we are confident that the effects we see do not come from cryptic promoters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The effect in the native circuit is rather modest. Is this even significant? No statistical test was performed. Again, the read-through should be quantified by qPCR or RNAseq.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted ANOVA to compare the effect of genomic localization on Plac activity (Results section and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Transcriptional read-through was quantified by qPCR (Figure 6C) and demonstrated presence of the read-through transcript by end-point PCR (Figure 6D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Overall, there are some conceptual issues with the study, as presented. The study does demonstrate physical context of genes does impact outputs. However, there are some issues.</p><p>The research and findings are not well placed in the field. There are a number of notable studies that have examined physical location of genes and their impact on regulatory networks and/or physiological outputs using natural and synthetic systems. For example, phage T7 was refactored and these synthetic T7 phages have notable differences in infectivity, etc. from their WT T7 counterpart (Chan, 2005). Additionally, a study by Wu and Rao (2010) has examined the impacts of genetic arrangement on the outputs of autoregulatory circuits. There are several other similar studies, beyond the few cited in this manuscript. How this approach builds on these studies is not made very clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. Indeed we failed to more properly place the study in a larger context. We thank the reviewer for the suggested references which we used in addition to few others as we revised the Introduction accordingly to better address the literature on context in general, how it affects GRNs, and why GRNs are considered usually to be determined mainly by topology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study seems to have honed in on one particular aspect that may affect a regulatory network – transcriptional readthrough. This seems to be explanatory for this system, and is likely a direct use of using very strong promoters (P_L derivatives). Use of such strong promoters, regardless of the efficiency of a terminator, will result in significant amounts of readthrough. How transcriptional readthrough generally contributes to regulatory networks is debatable. The data presented to support the importance of readthrough (Figure 5), while possibly statistically significant, does not provide convincing evidence for strong effects. Building on this point, how frequently are transcription factors in a multicomponent network encoded in close proximity? Would transcriptional readthrough provide any explanation as to the broader patterns we see in genome structure – even for <italic>E. coli</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>These are important and valid points, thank you for raising them. The</p><p>P<italic>lac</italic> variant we use is indeed a strong promoter, but so is the terminator T1, which is one of the strongest terminators in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Generally, while promoters are indeed not as strong as the PL derived P<italic>lac</italic>, more importantly the terminators are far less efficient across the genome, hence read-through is a common issue. A high-resolution transcriptome map of <italic>E. coli</italic> shows the extent of transcriptional read-through, with e.g. 75% of convergent operons showing transcription into an adjacent operon (Conway et al., 2014). Also, correlated expression of genes reaching beyond the level of an operon has been observed, suggesting that at least some broader patterns can be explained by transcriptional read-through or rather, transcriptional read-through is likely one of the many factors acting on genomic patterns in a combinatorial fashion (Junier, 2014, Junier and Rivoire, 2016). Bioinformatic studies are very difficult to perform, as predicting terminator strength is still very unreliable.</p><p>We would like to point out that we do not claim that transcriptional readthrough leads to <italic>strong</italic> effects (see Discussion: “It needs to be stressed that the impact of local genetic context of GRN elements on fitness will strongly depend on the network’s output. Examples of how even a small effect can be strongly amplified further downstream in a regulatory network are the regulatory circuit governing lysogenic and lytic states of phage λ, or the processes behind entry into sporulation or genetic competence in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>”).</p><p>Please note that our conclusions are not limited to multicomponent networks, but we are rather showing that transcriptional read-through can lead to emergence of additional links between nodes in GRN (Figure 7A, B). We rephrased the Discussion of this point in order to be clearer: “The local genetic context is not limited to proximal transcription factors which are part of the same GRN, like our synthetic plasmid system that represents the most direct example. In fact, the local context effects and in particular transcriptional read-through can occur anywhere on the chromosome (Figure 6), indicating that any chromosomal rearrangement has the potential to alter not only the expression levels of a gene but importantly also the function of a GRN.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is very little explanation for why readthrough into cI has such strong effects, when readthrough into lacI or tetR have smaller (or no) effects on network behavior. Are these effects on cI strongest because CI is most proximal to your output (YFP production)? Do these effects correlate in any way to DNA binding affinity of each transcription factor?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a more detailed clarification for why transcriptional readthrough, although likely happening at all terminators in our GRN, has a measurable effect only if it increases expression levels of only one repressor, namely λ cI.</p></body></sub-article></article>
