The cortex is organized during development into a laminar structure, with each layer composed of a distinct set of cell types with different morphological, electrophysiological, and connectional properties. These diverse cellular phenotypes are established and maintained by complex interactions of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs), and they are reinforced by chromatin modifiers. Defining cell-type specific chromatin signatures will provide an understanding of the regulatory landscapes that influence transcription, as well as identification of putative cell type-specific cis-regulatory elements. Most variation associated with phenotypic differences in humans identified through genome-wide association studies is located in non-coding regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tak and Farnham, 2015</xref>). However, the exact function of these polymorphisms and the cell types that they affect is established only in a minority of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soldner et al., 2016</xref>). Assigning regulatory elements to cell types provides insight into their potential function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corces et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, specific regulatory elements could be used to build cell-type specific genetic tools similar to those created by careful selection of well-studied regulatory regions near genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bou-Gharios et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pinkert et al., 1987</xref>) or by large genomic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shima et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Until recently, two major hurdles have restricted access to epigenetic landscapes of specific primary cell types: selective access to those types, and the large numbers of cells required as an input for epigenomic characterization using ChIP-seq, DNAse-seq, or FAIRE-seq. Recent development of a number of Cre-recombinase transgenic lines allowed access to specific cortical cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harris et al., 2014</xref>), and has enabled transcriptomic characterization and classification of cells from the visual cortex using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>). Though these transgenic lines have differing degrees of cell type heterogeneity, they provide a platform for accessing populations of related cell types from different layers of the cortex. New techniques, including ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>) and THS-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sos et al., 2016</xref>), enable measurement of chromatin accessibility from a few hundred or even single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corces et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cusanovich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have started to probe the correspondence between transcription and epigenetics in cortical cell types labelled by the expression of somatostatin (<italic>Sst</italic>), parvalbumin (<italic>Pvalb</italic>), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (<italic>Camk2a</italic>) from whole mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mo et al., 2015</xref>), rod and cone photoreceptor cells in retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mo et al., 2016</xref>), and in the developing and adult cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank et al., 2015</xref>). These studies have profiled the chromatin accessibility landscapes of broad cell classes, but did not examine layer-specific differences in the neocortex. Here, we take advantage of pan-GABAergic and layer-specific glutamatergic Cre-driver lines, low-input ATAC-seq, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to investigate chromatin accessibility landscapes in a specific cortical region, the adult mouse visual cortex (VISp).</p><p>Each layer of VISp contains distinct populations of glutamatergic cells with different transcriptional, functional, and connectional properties: layer 4 cells are the primary recipients of the visual signals from the dorsal portion of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd); layer 2/3 cells receive signals from L4, and communicate with L5 cells within the same cortical region and other cortical regions; layer 5 cells are highly diverse, and include cells that project to many other cortical and subcortical regions; and the layer 6 cells we examine in this study project to the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bortone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sorensen et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, within even a small region of the cortex, there is great diversity of cell types, each of which carries out a distinct transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>). However, the regulatory programs that produce these different transcriptional and cellular phenotypes are not known. In order to define potential regulatory elements and corresponding transcriptional regulators, we examined chromatin landscapes of these cell classes.</p><p>We found broad differences between GABAergic and glutamatergic cell types, as well as layer-specific differential chromatin accessibility in glutamatergic cell types that correlated with differential gene expression. Putative regulatory elements were identified through TF motif searches and comparisons to existing ChIP-seq datasets for each cell class. With these components, we built a putative regulatory network of TF binding sites near layer-specific TF genes that may govern layer-specific transcriptomic states. This network suggests that <italic>Cux1/2</italic>, <italic>Foxp2</italic>, <italic>Nfia</italic>, <italic>Pou3f2, and Rorb</italic> are key regulators for the maintenance of molecular identity of deep layer and upper-layer cortical cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Layer-specific chromatin accessibility profiling by ATAC-seq</title><p>To access layer-specific glutamatergic cells in the mouse visual cortex, we used four previously characterized Cre lines crossed to the <italic>Ai14</italic> reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), which expresses tdTomato (tdT) after Cre-mediated recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Although these lines mostly label cells in specific cortical layers, we note that each contains at least two closely related cell types based on scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>).

Because each of these Cre line-derived populations contains more than one transcriptomic cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>), we will refer to these populations as cell classes. We tried to minimize other potential sources of heterogeneity that may be caused by age, sex, or cortical region by restricting our analysis to eight week-old male mice, and cells microdissected only from the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

As a control for the ATAC-seq assay, we profiled chromatin accesibility landscapes of 500-cell populations of mouse ES (mES) cells. Low-depth sequencing was performed to identify libraries that have high read diversity within mouse genome-aligned reads, indicating that the library did not consist of many PCR duplicates, as well as a characteristic fragment size pattern that demonstrates protection of DNA by nucleosomes. High-quality libraries were then sequenced using Illumina HiSeq or MiSeq (min: 13.2 M, median: 83 M, max: 241 M, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD24-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), yielding &gt;3 million unique, unambiguous fragments per replicate (min: 3.29 M, median: 6.9 M, max: 16.1 M, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD24-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Each sample showed fragment size patterns characteristic of open chromatin and mono-, di-, and tri-nucleosomal fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as a clear accessibility footprint around motifs for the ubiquitously-expressed transcription factor ATF2 throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In comparison, data obtained from Tn5 tagmentation of purified genomic DNA from 500 mES cells do not display these characteristic signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We next identified accessible sites throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD24-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>, Materials and methods), and then assigned each ATAC-seq peak to the nearest gene based on annotated transcription start sites (TSS). We call these peaks positionally associated with the nearby gene. This simple peak-gene association rule based on the gene nearest to the peak may not be accurate in all cases. Chromatin assumes cell-type specific conformation in the nucleus that may bring elements that are distant in linear DNA sequence or even on separate chromosomes together in space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dekker et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, our approach may misassign some peaks to genes that are closest to them based on the linear sequence of the genome. To assess if there are common patterns of peak positioning relative to TSS, we analyzed the distribution of ATAC-seq peak positions relative to genome-wide transcription start site (TSS) annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The distribution of accessible sites revealed six peak populations: distal upstream (&gt; 2 kb upstream of TSS; abbreviated −3), upstream (&lt; 2 kb upstream, &gt; 200 bp upstream; −2), proximal upstream (&lt; 200 bp from TSS; −1), proximal downstream (&lt; 200 bp; +1), downstream (200 bp to 2 kb; +2), and distal downstream (&gt; 2 kb; +3). We found very similar distributions of peak locations in different cell classes, and found our distribution to be very similar to the one derived from previously published neuronal ATAC-seq data (<italic>Camk2a-Cre</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mo et al., 2015</xref>]), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We also found associations between peak modules and gene modules that had similar but non-identical patterns. For example, the Lower+ peak module was significantly associated with genes that are highly expressed only in L6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>We next looked for TFs that may be responsible for layer-specific transcription by searching for differentially-enriched motifs between our peak modules using Analysis of Motif Enrichment (AME, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). For this analysis, we relied on a JASPAR TF motif database (Materials and methods), and thus our motif searches carry the biases of database-driven TF motif search analyses – databases may be incomplete, and depend on previous studies. Despite this caveat, we were able to distinguish many differentially enriched motifs by comparing each of the peak accessibility modules to peak modules with dissimilar patterns of accessibility. For example, peaks in the L2/3+ module were contrasted with peaks from L4+, L5+, L6+ and Lower+ modules, but not Upper+, L4−, or L6−, which include many peaks that show high accessibility in L2/3 (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis yielded a set of enriched TF binding site motif families that we used for downstream analysis: CUX, DLX, EGR1, FOS, FOXP, MEF2, MEIS, NEUROD, NFIA, POU3F, RFX3, RORB, and TBR1. For each module, we were able to identify at least one significantly enriched motif family. In layer 2/3 cells, we detect high enrichment of CUX, EGR1, FOXP, MEF2, POU3F, and RFX. In L4, we found enrichment of RORB and NEUROD motifs. Layers 4 and 5 both show enrichment of FOS motifs. L6 cells have a very different profile of enriched TF motifs, with depletion of many of the factors listed above, but enrichment of CUX, MEIS, NFIA and TBR1 motifs.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21883.031</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Peak module analysis reveals layer-specific enrichment of transcription factor motifs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Select TF motif families are significantly enriched or depleted in specific peak modules.

We used the TreeFam database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ruan et al., 2008</xref>) to identify closely related TFs which may bind similar motifs. We then removed genes with low expression in the single cell RNA-seq dataset, and those previously found not to bind the motifs in our motif sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, Materials and methods). For most of the motifs differentially enriched in the peak modules, we find at least one corresponding TF family member with correlated or anticorrelated differential gene expression. For example, enrichment of accessible ROR motifs is positively correlated with <italic>Rorb</italic> expression in L4. In L2/3, we see strong enrichment of RFX3 motifs, which corresponds to high <italic>Rfx3</italic> and <italic>Rfx7</italic> expression in L2/3. Conversely, open FOXP motifs are enriched in upper layers (enriched in L2/3+, Upper+ and L6− modules; depleted in L6+ and Lower+), while <italic>Foxp2</italic> is most highly expressed in L6. This is in agreement with the previously reported repressive function of FOXP2, which has been shown to recruit histone deacetylase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chokas et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, CUX motif enrichment is inversely correlated with <italic>Cux1</italic> and <italic>Cux2</italic> expression, consistent with the role of these TFs as repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the accessibility of the motifs with a single base-pair resolution (TF footprinting) using Tn5 transposase insertion sites, as has been done previously with ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mo et al., 2015</xref>) and similarly with DNase-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vierstra and Stamatoyannopoulos, 2016</xref>). The FOXP, NEUROD, and RFX motifs found in all peaks in our dataset displayed expected patterns of accessibility that corresponded to the enrichment of motifs within layer-specific modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>): FOXP motifs are most accessible on L2/3, L4, and L5, with the least insertions in L6, where <italic>Foxp2</italic> may repress chromatin accessibility at FOXP motifs. In L4, NEUROD motifs were significantly more accessible than in L2/3, L5, or L6, which may be driven by coexpression of <italic>Neurod1</italic> and <italic>Neurod6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). For RFX motifs, we see the most Tn5 insertion sites in L2/3 cells than in other layers, possibly due to expression of <italic>Rfx1</italic> and <italic>Rfx3</italic> in L2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Transcription factor networks underlying layer-specific transcriptomes</title><p>We next sought to identify interactions between key TFs that may underlie layer-specific transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For this analysis, we focused on the targets of 12 highly differentially expressed TFs: <italic>Cux1</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>, <italic>Fos, Mef2c, Neurod6</italic>, <italic>Pou3f2</italic>, <italic>Rfx3</italic>, and <italic>Rorb</italic>, which are highly expressed in upper layers; and <italic>Foxp2</italic>, <italic>Meis2</italic>, <italic>Nfia</italic>, and <italic>Tbr1</italic>, which are highly expressed in lower layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We then designated each TF as a likely activator (<italic>Egr1, Fos, Mef2c, Nfia, Neurod6</italic>, <italic>Pou3f2</italic>, <italic>Rfx3</italic>, <italic>Rorb</italic>, <italic>Meis2</italic>, and <italic>Tbr1</italic>) or repressor (<italic>Foxp2</italic> and <italic>Cux1</italic>). A full schematic for the selection of these putative key regulators is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. Next, we searched our peaks for differentially enriched motifs that are putative targets of these TFs. For each motif, we applied filtering criteria to find putative regulatory targets based on motif enrichment in peak modules, association of peak module with a gene module, differential accessibility of the peak, differential expression of the nearest gene, and correlation with expression of the associated TF (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then built a network using our 12 key regulators as nodes, and linked the nodes using their putative target motifs as directional edges (from the regulating factor to its target motif, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Expanding the network to include additional targets that are TF genes outside of the set of 12 key regulators reveals additional regulatory interactions that may be important for maintenance of layer-specific transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These networks show only interactions that were strongly coherent with our peak and gene module analysis (Materials and methods). The relative transcription levels of each of the genes in the resulting network show a sharp division between upper (L2-3 and L4) and lower (L5 and L6) layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21883.039</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Putative regulatory interactions that govern layer-specific chromatin and transcriptomic state in glutamatergic cell classes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Putative regulatory interactions between key TFs.

As a first step in uncovering layer-specific regulatory networks, including regulatory transcription factors and their targets, we performed ATAC-seq on small populations of cells derived from layer-specific transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Comparisons of our data to previously published ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) enabled identification of potentially significant regulatory sites. By restricting our analysis to a single cortical region, the mouse visual cortex, and through the use of layer-specific Cre lines, our data provide examination of the chromatin accessibility state at the resolution of layer-specific cortical cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Previous studies have examined the state of cells across whole brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yue et al., 2014</xref>), in the whole cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frank et al., 2015</xref>), or in pooled GABAergic or glutamatergic cells across all layers in the entire mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mo et al., 2015</xref>). The cell class resolution of our study allowed us to identify open chromatin sites that are unique to each layer-specific cell class, and assign accessible sites from previous studies on more heterogeneous populations to more specific cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). In doing so, we were also able to build a network of transcription factor interactions that may be responsible for maintaining the identity of layer-specific cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of TF motif enrichment and accessible motif targets were used to identify putative regulatory TFs for cell classes from L2/3, L4, and L6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, distinct transcription factor families for L5 were not clearly identified by our analysis. This result may be due to the heterogeneity of cell types that are present in the L5 cell class defined by the <italic>Rbp4-Cre</italic> line. <italic>Rbp4-Cre</italic> labels at least nine transcriptomic cell types, including Layer 5a cells, which show some similarity to L4 cell types, and L5b types, which share some transcriptomic patterns with L6 cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>). This heterogeneity may mask detection of distinct networks that regulate the cell types within L5, which could be uncovered in future studies that will require new Cre-driver lines or other labeling strategies to access L5 subtypes. We also note that L6 includes several transcriptomic cell types that were not surveyed in the current study: only corticothalamic L6a cells are labeled by the <italic>Ntsr1-Cre</italic> driver line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Development of laminar cell type identities occurs through several waves of differentiation driven by sequential changes in chromatin and transcriptional landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Telley et al., 2016</xref>). In our analysis, we see largely distinct networks of interactions that define upper and lower layers of the cortex. Previous studies have shown that layer-specific populations arise at distinct times in development. Several of the TFs we predict to be key regulators of layer-specific transcription have been examined for their function in cortical development. Loss of <italic>Tbr1</italic>, which is a key lower-layer regulator expressed by lower-layer neurons, results in gross abnormalities in cortex. Curiously, in rostral cortical regions, <italic>Tbr1</italic> knockouts appear to lack L6, while other layers appear normal, whereas in caudal regions, <italic>Tbr1</italic> knockouts present a generally disorganized cortical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hevner et al., 2001</xref>). These findings suggest that independent networks may be involved in upper versus lower laminar development in these regions. Double knockout of <italic>Pou3f2</italic> and <italic>Pou3f1</italic>, which we predict are key regulators in upper cortical layers, results in incorrect migration of upper cortical neurons (layers 2/3 and 4), but not lower layer neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McEvilly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sugitani et al., 2002</xref>). Loss of key TFs can also affect layer-specific cortical projection patterns: knockdown of <italic>Cux1</italic> ablates ipsilateral cortico-cortical projections of upper-layer neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rodríguez-Tornos et al., 2016</xref>), and loss of <italic>Tbr1</italic> results in truncated corticothalamic projections by L6 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hevner et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>While these broad phenotypes show the importance of these factors in the development of cortical structure and function, specific interactions previously studied in development are frequently not found in our accessibility data from adult cortex. For example, a previously described regulatory interaction between RORB and its biding site near <italic>Pou3f2</italic>, which results in down-regulation of <italic>Pou3f2</italic> during laminar development of L2/3 and L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oishi et al., 2016</xref>), is not part of our putative regulatory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In single-cell RNA-seq of adult visual cortex, we often see simultaneous expression of <italic>Rorb</italic> and <italic>Pou3f2</italic> in Layer 2/3 and Layer 4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that this interaction may not be present in the adult visual cortex. We investigated this discrepancy between adult and developmental states by examining the RORB target sites that were previously described near the <italic>Pou3f2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We found very little chromatin accessibility at or around these RORB-binding sites, which suggests that the chromatin state in adult cells prevents this interaction, thus allowing coexpression of <italic>Rorb</italic> and <italic>Pou3f2</italic> after differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our network also lacks a previously reported interaction between POU3F2 and <italic>Foxp2</italic> through a highly conserved POU3F2-binding site in the <italic>Foxp2</italic> gene that is mutated in human compared to most other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maricic et al., 2013</xref>). In reporter assays, the conserved POU3F2 motif, which is present in mouse, acts as a cis-regulatory enhancer element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maricic et al., 2013</xref>). In adult visual cortex, the chromatin is inaccessible near this POU3F2 motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), suggesting that POU3F2 does not bind to this site to regulate <italic>Foxp2</italic> expression. This is consistent with gene expression data from adult cortex, where we see no expression of <italic>Foxp2</italic> in cell classes that express <italic>Pou3f2</italic> (layers 2–5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Thus, we expanded our search to all FOXP motif-containing peaks near <italic>Mef2c</italic> in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). We found two peaks upstream of the <italic>Mef2c</italic> TSS that are less accessible in L6 than in upper layers. Therefore, FOXP2 may regulate <italic>Mef2c</italic> by binding different sites in these different tissues: sites upstream of TSS in the cortex, and sites near exon three in the striatum. This hypothesis could be tested by future experiments that measure the chromatin accessibility landscape of the striatum, and genome-wide interaction sites of FOXP2 by ChIP-seq in striatum and cortex, as well as the effect of decreasing FOXP2 levels through cell-type specific knockout or knockdown on these chromatin landscapes.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21883.050</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>FOXP motif accessibility within or near the <italic>Mef2c</italic> gene.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chromatin accessibility upstream of the <italic>Mef2c</italic> TSS.

We note that several transcription factors identified in our network are known to be expressed in development. Some of their target sites in development may be retained in adulthood, while others may be different due to changes in accessibility. Future studies performed on layer-specific cell classes in development will be needed to determine how changes to the epigenetic landscape affect transcription during development.</p><p>Our sampling strategy utilized only Cre lines that yielded at least 500 tdTomato-positive FACS-isolated cells per animal. This limited our genetic access to relatively abundant cell classes in the visual cortex, all of which label multiple cell types that can be distinguished by single-cell RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because GABAergic cell types are much less abundant in the neocortex than glutamatergic cells, we sampled only a single, pan-GABAergic cell line, <italic>Gad2-IRES-Cre</italic>.

The higher spatial resolution of our glutamatergic data, but lower cell-type resolution among GABAergic types makes our study complementary to this work. Further advances in low-input chromatin accessibility assays, low input ChIP-seq methods, and improvements in Cre-driver specificity will increase our ability to analyze the epigenomic state of specific neural cell types.</p><p>Our integrated analysis of chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and TF motif enrichment provides an unprecedented look at the key interactions that underlie layer-specific transcriptomes. We were able to identify layer-wide patterns of TF accessibility from analysis of the entire set of peaks from each layer, and found interactions that may drive expression of key transcriptomic regulators <italic>Nfia</italic> and <italic>Cux1</italic> by looking at coordinated TF expression and motif accessibility. Further research into the roles that these and other TFs play in development and maintenance of layer-specific cell classes will enhance our understanding of the functional consequences of these transcriptomic programs. Conditional loss-of-function experiments in specific cell classes at specific times in development or adulthood would help to disentangle the specific roles from more global roles of these TFs. For instance, constitutive, homozygous loss-of-function of <italic>Foxp2</italic> is lethal by postnatal day 21, and causes developmental delays and motor dysfunction that may interfere with studies of adult brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">French et al., 2007</xref>), whereas heterozygous <italic>Foxp2</italic> knockout mice display few differences in cortical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujita et al., 2008</xref>). Our network suggests that <italic>Foxp2</italic> could be a key regulator of L6-specific transcriptional program in VISp. Investigation of this role of Foxp2 would require generation of a conditional knockout in specific cortical cell populations, and perhaps at specific times in development or adulthood (for example, through conditional alleles combined with Cre/CreER lines). Another area that would greatly benefit from further study is assessing the correspondence between chromatin modifications and chromatin accessibility. New techniques for ChIP-seq enable enrichment of modified histones from as few as 500 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014</xref>), which may allow the correspondence between accessibility and chromatin modifications in specific cell classes to be studied directly. The synthesis of these data modalities will further our understading of the mechanisms of cell type-specific transcriptional regulation. This new knowledge will be useful for building new cell-type specific genetic tools, and for testing the reprogramming potential of layer-specific cell classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">De la Rossa et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse breeding and husbandry</title><p>All mice were housed at the Allen Institute for Brain Science under Institutional Care and Use Committee protocols 0703, 1208, and 1508.

We then scaled peak accessibility scores between 0 and 1 for each peak by subtracting the minimum value for each peak across glutamatergic classes, and then dividing by the maximum. For building gene expression modules, we selected only differentially expressed genes and performed the same scaling as for peaks (DESeq2 pval &lt; 0.05, fold change &gt; 2).

The vectors used for clustering were scaled average peak accessibility values (for peak module analysis) and scaled average gene expression values (for gene module analysis), described above. These vectors each have four dimensions, one for each glutamatergic cell class. Because unsupervised <italic>k</italic>-means clustering is dependent on random selection of initial cluster centroids, we manually selected a set of 8 clusters based on the initial <italic>k</italic>-means cluster results as seeds for a second round of clustering to obtain a convergent set of modules. We chose four patterns based on selective, high accessibility/expression for each of the four glutamatergic cell classes, as well as four other patterns that were frequently observed in both peaks and genes (Upper+, high in L2/3 and L4; Lower+, high in L5 and L6; L4-, low in L4 only; and L6-, low in L6 only).

We then ran <italic>k</italic>-means clustering on the selected peaks and genes using these eight cluster centers as seed values to generate final peak and gene modules.

This selection ensured that peaks in the foreground module and background module did not share the same accessibility pattern in any of the glutamatergic cell classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next removed any peaks with a width &gt; 400 bp, and retrieved the sequences corresponding to each peak in the foreground and background sets.

We examined the AME results for each module, and compiled a set of motifs that were found to be highly significantly associated with differential peak accessibility: CUX, DLX, etc. To find depleted motifs, AME was also performed with foreground and background peak sets reversed. AME results for each peak module are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD25-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>.

We then assigned a gene module to each TF, by calculating the Pearson correlation between the average gene expression and the <italic>k</italic>-means centers of each gene module. The module with the highest score was assigned to the gene. We then looked at literature to determine if the gene product was a likely repressor or activator of transcription. If the gene product was likely to be an activator, we checked to see if the TF target motif was enriched among peaks in the peak module that matched the assigned gene module. If the gene product was likely to be a repressor, we checked for depletion of the TF target motif in the corresponding gene module.

We then filtered motifs to obtain only those that were significantly associated with at least one peak module (Fisher’s exact test p-value &lt; 0.01), then filtered for motifs that were found in peaks that were positively associated with a gene expression module (Fisher’s exact test p-value &lt; 0.01). We then selected motifs that were found in peaks that were significantly differentially accessible in at least one pairwise comparison between glutamatergic cell classes (DiffBind p &lt; 0.001), and were associated with a differentially expressed gene (DESeq2 p &lt; 1×10<sup>−5</sup>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use ATAC-seq to probe chromatin accessibility profiles in four layer-specific classes of mouse visual cortical neurons, to identify regulatory elements that maintain layer-specific neuron identity. They present careful descriptive analyses of the data, combined with previous Allen Institute single-cell RNA-seq data from the same cortical region, and compared against relevant histone modification and RNA-seq data from other previously published work. Having identified a likely set of candidate regulatory regions, they present plausible guesses at the transcriptional factor regulatory network that maintains layer-specific adult cortical cell types, such as <italic>Foxp2</italic> being expressed in lower layers and repressing TFs for upper layers, and <italic>Cux1</italic> doing the reverse.</p><p>The referees unanimously agreed that as a data resource, the work is of extraordinarily high rigor and quality, and likely to be a treasure trove for future studies. The referees also agreed that the transcriptional network proposed in the latter half of the paper was speculative and lacked experimental validation. After discussion, we agreed that the paper is a strong contribution as a data resource, suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, and that rather than asking for additional experimental validation, various revisions could be made to strengthen the biological interpretation and significance of the data. We also propose some necessary revisions for clarity and for improving access to the data resource.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The lack of experimental validation of any of the predicted roles for transcription factors and their sites is problematic. Are there published data, such as relevant loss-of-function phenotypes, that you can interpret in light of your data, and test your predictions against?</p><p>2) The biological motivation of the work should be clearer, especially for non-neuroscientists. Explain why these neuronal cell classes are of particular interest. The data are for just four layer-specific but heterogeneous cell classes, and cortical cell types are vastly more complicated than this, but you describe the data as &quot;high resolution&quot;. Revise the Introduction and the Discussion to be more clear that these data are of intermediate resolution (albeit at the forefront of a rapidly advancing field) and to explain why inferring a transcriptional network at this level of resolution is biologically useful.</p><p>3) If in the Discussion you could make one or two specific, important, experimentally testable predictions from your proposed network, this would be a way of clarifying the biological utility of the data resource, and helping to motivate others to make use of it.</p><p>4) Clarify the k-means analysis of modules (subsection “ATAC-seq and RNA-seq module analysis” of Methods). Define precisely what vectors you are clustering, how many dimensions they have, and how you define a distance between them. Explain why you use a two-stage clustering approach. Explain what choosing &quot;cluster centers &gt; 0.5&quot; means: the centroids in a K-means clustering are n-dimensional vectors, not single scalar numbers. Explain what you mean by changing cluster centers from &gt;0.5 to 1: arbitrarily moving k-means centroids makes no sense either. Explain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> what you mean by &quot;Pearson correlation coefficients for comparisons between cluster centers&quot;: two k-means centroids are just two points in n-space, and it's not clear how one calculates a correlation coefficient between two points.</p><p>5) Please make the data accessible other than as a raw deposition in GEO. How could an interested biologist use these data with minimal computational overhead? We suggest finding a way to have these data hosted as tracks in a public genome browser such as at UCSC.</p><p>6) Clarify whether you believe this TF network is only involved in cell fate maintenance, or its establishment in development, and why.</p><p>7) In places, log p-values are being plotted and interpreted as if they measure effect strength (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Be more careful with this. A p-value is a function of both effect size and sample number, and it isn't clear that you are always comparing across equal sample numbers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21883.061</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The lack of experimental validation of any of the predicted roles for transcription factors and their sites is problematic. Are there published data, such as relevant loss-of-function phenotypes, that you can interpret in light of your data, and test your predictions against?</italic> </p><p>We have searched the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database for each key regulator to find loss-of-function experiments for each gene. In all but a few cases, previous studies focused on brain regions other than cortex, and examined the role these genes play in development rather than adulthood. We now include discussion of several loss-of-function studies for key transcription factors predicted by our study: <italic>Cux1, Pou3f2</italic>, and <italic>Tbr1</italic>:</p><p>“In our analysis, we see largely distinct networks of interactions that define upper and lower layers of the cortex. […] Loss of key TFs can also affect layer-specific cortical projection patterns: knockdown of <italic>Cux1</italic> ablates ipsilateral cortico-cortical projections of upper-layer neurons (Rodriguez-Tornos et al., 2016), and loss of <italic>Tbr1</italic> results in truncated corticothalamic projections by L6 neurons (Hevner et al., 2001).”</p><p>While these previous loss-of-function studies are informative, we have also included suggestions that conditional loss-of-function studies be performed to isolate the role that these factors play in specific cell classes (see point 3, below).</p><p>In addition, we have expanded our Discussion to include a recent publication which has shown that <italic>Mef2c</italic> is a direct target of FOXP2 through binding of FOXP2 at motifs near <italic>Mef2c</italic> exon 3 in the striatum (Chen et al., Nat. Neurosci., 2016). Mutation of these FOXP motifs in a transient transfection assay demonstrated FOXP2-induced repression. In our network, we also predict that FOXP2 may act as a repressor of <italic>Mef2c</italic> expression. We examined FOXP motif-containing accessible sites near <italic>Mef2c</italic> in our own data, including the previously reported <italic>Mef2c</italic> exon 3-proximal region. The <italic>Mef2c</italic> exon 3-proximal region displayed a modest, but statistically insignificant decrease in chromatin accessibility in lower compared to upper cortical layers in our data. Therefore, it was not included in our analysis. However, we found additional FOXP motif-containing sites upstream of the <italic>Mef2c</italic> TSS that are significantly less accessible in lower vs. upper layers of the cortex, and that we hypothesize contribute to repression of the <italic>Mef2c</italic> gene. It is possible that <italic>Mef2c</italic> repression in stratum and cortex may be achieved through FOXP2- binding of different genomic elements, and further experiments would be needed to address this hypothesis. We address this new study in the Discussion and we include an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).</p><p>“A recent publication has shown that FOXP2 directly suppresses <italic>Mef2c</italic> expression in the striatum, where knockout of <italic>Foxp2</italic> allows higher <italic>Mef2c</italic> expression, which, in turn, suppresses synaptogenesis (Chen et al., 2016). […] This hypothesis could be tested by future experiments that measure the chromatin accessibility landscape of the striatum, and genome-wide interaction sites of FOXP2 by ChIP-seq in striatum and cortex, as well as the effect of decreasing FOXP2 levels through cell-type specific knockout or knockdown on these chromatin landscapes.”</p><p><italic>2) The biological motivation of the work should be clearer, especially for non-neuroscientists. Explain why these neuronal cell classes are of particular interest. The data are for just four layer-specific but heterogeneous cell classes, and cortical cell types are vastly more complicated than this, but you describe the data as &quot;high resolution&quot;. Revise the Introduction and the Discussion to be more clear that these data are of intermediate resolution (albeit at the forefront of a rapidly advancing field) and to explain why inferring a transcriptional network at this level of resolution is biologically useful.</italic> </p><p>We have added an additional paragraph to the Introduction to clarify the reasoning for studying cortical layers:</p><p>“Each layer of VISp contains distinct populations of glutamatergic cells with different transcriptional, functional, and connectional properties: layer 4 cells are the primary recipients of the visual signals from the dorsal portion of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd); layer 2/3 cells receive signals from L4, and communicate with L5 cells within the same cortical region and other cortical regions; layer 5 cells are highly diverse, and include cells that project to many other cortical and subcortical regions; and the layer 6 cells we examine in this study project to the thalamus (Bortone, 2014; Sorensen, 2015). […] In order to define potential regulatory elements and corresponding transcriptional regulators, we examined chromatin landscapes of these cell classes.”</p><p>To more accurately define the resolution of our study, we no longer use “high resolution”:</p><p>“[…]our data provide examination of the chromatin accessibility state at the resolution of layer-specific cortical cell classes.”</p><p><italic>3) If in the Discussion you could make one or two specific, important, experimentally testable predictions from your proposed network, this would be a way of clarifying the biological utility of the data resource, and helping to motivate others to make use of it.</italic> </p><p>We have added more specific recommendations to the end of the Discussion section:</p><p>“Further research into the roles that these and other TFs play in the development and maintenance of layer-specific cell classes will enhance our understanding of the functional consequences of these transcriptomic programs. Conditional loss-of-function experiments in specific cell classes at specific times in development or adulthood would help to disentangle the specific roles from more global roles of these TFs. […] New techniques for ChIP-seq enable enrichment of modified histones from as few as 500 cells (Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014), which may allow the correspondence between accessibility and chromatin modifications in specific cell classes to be studied directly.”</p><p><italic>4) Clarify the k-means analysis of modules (subsection “ATAC-seq and RNA-seq module analysis” of Methods). Define precisely what vectors you are clustering, how many dimensions they have, and how you define a distance between them.</italic> </p><p>We now explicitly state the dimensions of the vectors in the Methods section:</p><p>“The vectors used for clustering were scaled average peak accessibility values (for peak module analysis) and scaled average gene expression values (for gene module analysis), described above. These vectors each have 4 dimensions, one for each glutamatergic cell class.”</p><p><italic>Explain why you use a two-stage clustering approach. Explain what choosing &quot;cluster centers &gt; 0.5&quot; means: the centroids in a K-means clustering are n-dimensional vectors, not single scalar numbers.</italic> </p><p>We performed a two-stage clustering approach because unsupervised k-means clustering is a stochastic process, which randomly selects centroids to establish initial conditions. In order to converge on common modules of peak accessibility and gene expression, we performed an initial round of clustering without providing starting centroids, then used the resulting patterns to seed comparable initial conditions to identify similar modules across both peak accessibility and gene expression datasets. This is now more clearly stated in the Methods section:</p><p>“Because unsupervised k-means clustering is dependent on random selection of initial cluster centroids, we selected a set of 8 clusters from the initial k-means cluster results to seed a second round of clustering to find a convergent set of modules.”</p><p><italic>Explain what you mean by changing cluster centers from &gt;0.5 to 1: arbitrarily moving k-means centroids makes no sense either.</italic> </p><p>For each of the n-dimensions, we binarized the centroid values to generate 4-dimensional centroid seeds for each cluster in the second round of clustering. This allowed us to use the same starting conditions for both peak and gene clustering. Final centroids of the k-means clusters are not pinned to these values, as the k-means clustering will converge to a result based on multiple iterations (100 in our case). We have changed the wording in the Methods section to reflect this analysis:</p><p>“We chose 4 patterns based on selective, high accessibility/expression for each of the glutamatergic cell classes, and 4 other patterns that were frequently observed in both peaks and genes (high in L2/3 and L4, high in L5 and L6, low in L4 only, and low in L6 only). To use these patterns as seed centroids, we generated binarized centroid vectors. For each dimension, values &gt; 0.5 were set to 1, and &lt; 0.5 were changed to 0. We then ran k-means clustering on the selected peaks and genes using these 8 cluster centers as input to assign final peak and gene modules.”</p><p><italic>Explain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> what you mean by &quot;Pearson correlation coefficients for comparisons between cluster centers&quot;: two k-means centroids are just two points in n-space, and it's not clear how one calculates a correlation coefficient between two points.</italic> </p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, we used Pearson correlation to calculate the similarity between the centroid values for each of the initial clusters. We think that the use of Pearson correlation coefficients is reasonable in this limited context, in which we are simply comparing these initial clusters to see how many distinct patterns are common among genes and peaks. The centroid vectors have only 4 dimensions, and we realize that these calculations do not have high statistical power. However, they are still useful for the simple comparisons we perform in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> to assess how similar or dissimilar our initial clusters are.</p><p><italic>5) Please make the data accessible other than as a raw deposition in GEO. How could an interested biologist use these data with minimal computational overhead? We suggest finding a way to have these data hosted as tracks in a public genome browser such as at UCSC.</italic> </p><p>We have built a track hub on the UCSC Genome Browser website at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=mm10&amp;hubUrl=http://goldenpathcollaboration:acm0se3@download.alleninstitute.org/goldenpath/hub.txt">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=mm10&amp;hubUrl=http://goldenpathcollaboration:acm0se3@download.alleninstitute.org/goldenpath/hub.txt</ext-link>. We are now working to configure this track hub for inclusion as a registered Public Hub on the UCSC Genome Browser.</p><p><italic>6) Clarify whether you believe this TF network is only involved in cell fate maintenance, or its establishment in development, and why.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an important, open question in neurodevelopment and epigenetics. While our study provides some insight into the state of TF networks in the adult visual cortex, we feel that extrapolating our results to a role in development is beyond the scope of our data and data available currently in the field. We note in the Discussion that specific interactions previously identified in development or in other cell types are not found in our adult ATAC-seq data (<italic>RORB</italic> regulating <italic>Pou3f2</italic> and POU3F2 regulating <italic>Foxp2</italic>). However, genome-wide data for ATAC-seq in the developing cortex have yet to be generated. To address this question, we have expanded on the possible, but not certain, role that the TF network we uncover in adult cortex may play in development:</p><p>“These comparisons emphasize the importance of developmental, anatomical, and cell type context in studies of chromatin accessibility and transcriptomic regulation. […] Future studies performed on layer-specific cell classes in development will be needed to determine how changes to the epigenetic landscape affect transcription during development.”</p><p><italic>7) In places, log p-values are being plotted and interpreted as if they measure effect strength (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Be more careful with this. A p-value is a function of both effect size and sample number, and it isn't clear that you are always comparing across equal sample numbers.</italic> </p><p>We agree with this reviewer, and we have been careful throughout the manuscript with p-value interpretation to avoid statements that are misleading. In our interpretation of the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and 6, we treat these p-values as independent measures of significance, and do not use them to compare between calculations with different sample sizes. The p-values are also not used to define association criteria for building the TF network, as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>To assist readers in interpreting these results, we now include a supplementary figure that shows the log-odds ratios for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> so that effect size and p-value are both present. Both p-value and log-odds are also provided in the figure source data file we have provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, we do not present an odds ratio, because this is a non-parametric test of significance (Mann-Whitney). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, adjusted p-values were calculated using AME, which does not output an odds ratio for Fisher’s exact test calculations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
