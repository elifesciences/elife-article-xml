Scx-DTR recapitulates many aspects of tendon aging including comparable declines in cellularity, alterations in ECM structure, organization, and composition. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated a conserved decline in tenocytes associated with ECM biosynthesis in aged and Scx-DTR tendons, identifying the requirement for Scleraxis-lineage cells during homeostasis. However, the remaining cells in aged and Scx-DTR tendons demonstrate functional divergence. Aged tenocytes become pro-inflammatory and lose proteostasis. In contrast, tenocytes from Scx-DTR tendons demonstrate enhanced remodeling capacity. Collectively, this study defines Scx-DTR as a novel model of accelerated tendon ECM aging and identifies novel biological intervention points to maintain tendon function through the lifespan.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>Scleraxis</kwd><kwd>tendon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR073169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loiselle</surname><given-names>Alayna E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR077527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loiselle</surname><given-names>Alayna E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 AR080757</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nichols</surname><given-names>Anne EC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Age-related tendon degeneration is initiated by loss of tenocytes associated with synthesis of high-turnover rate proteoglycans and glycoproteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tendons are dense connective tissues that transmit muscle-generated forces to bone to enable skeletal movement and joint stability. Recent studies from our group and others have demonstrated the presence of multiple tendon resident cell populations, with Scleraxis-lineage (Scx<sup>Lin</sup>) cells being the predominant population during adult mouse homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Best et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Micheli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Best and Loiselle, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kendal et al., 2020</xref>).

During adulthood, tendon homeostasis is maintained via ongoing turnover of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Samiric et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Samiric et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinemeier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rees et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korcari et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neidlin et al., 2018</xref>). Homeostatic disruptions can lead to the development of tendon pathologies such as tendinopathy, which are characterized by significant pain and permanent decline in tissue performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Millar et al., 2021</xref>). While repetitive loading in sports or occupational contexts disrupt homeostasis, natural aging is also associated with impaired tendon homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pardes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connizzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peffers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehwolf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kostrominova and Brooks, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marqueti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korcari et al., 2021a</xref>). Tendinopathy prevalence increases substantially with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riel et al., 2019</xref>), making aging a key risk factor for loss of tendon health. Despite this increased risk, the factors responsible for inducing age-related tendinopathy are not well defined.</p><p>We have previously shown that depletion of Scx<sup>Lin</sup> cells results in a relatively rapid loss of ECM structural and organizational integrity of the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Best et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that Scx<sup>Lin</sup> cells are required to maintain tendon homeostasis. However, the specific mechanisms by which Scx<sup>Lin</sup> cells maintain tendon homeostasis have not been identified. Moreover, while the initial ECM organizational changes that occur with Scx<sup>Lin</sup> cell depletion mimic those that occur during natural aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connizzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehwolf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunkman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ippolito et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Connizzo et al., 2016</xref>), it is unknown whether sustained Scx<sup>Lin</sup> cell depletion in young mice may induce an aged tendon phenotype.</p><p>In the present study, our primary objective was to identify the underlying changes in the cellular and molecular environment that result from Scx<sup>Lin</sup> cell depletion in young adult tendons and determine how these structural and compositional shifts compare to those observed during natural aging. Here, we define the mechanisms that are conserved between Scx<sup>Lin</sup> depletion and natural aging to establish the key drivers that underpin the initiation of tendon degeneration and identify novel intervention points to maintain tendon health through the lifespan. Conversely, by defining the divergent molecular programming shifts in the tendon cells that remain during natural aging and inducible depletion of Scx<sup>Lin</sup> tenocytes in young animals, we have identified cell populations and processes that may dictate differences in tendon healing capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Scleraxis-lineage cell depletion in young adults disrupts tendon homeostasis and mimics the cell density and ECM structural alterations of tendon aging</title><p>To determine the long-term depletion efficiency of this Scx-DTR (DTR) model, we quantified cell density in DTR mice at 3-, 6-, and 9 months (3, 6, 9 M) post-depletion, and compared to age-matched DT-treated wildtype (WT) littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Tenocytes 1 and 2 exhibited a loss of both autocrine and paracrine communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). A majority of the signaling pathways were expressed only in the 6 M WT group, suggesting that with natural aging there is a substantial and widespread loss of tenocyte-tenocyte communication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6IâK</xref>). Interestingly, SPP1 and WNT pathways were present only in the aged group in both an outgoing and incoming pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J and K</xref>).

In addition, clinical studies have shown that age-related tendon changes are associated with impaired dynamic stability and increased risk of falling, factors that significantly increase both morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Onambele et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tomlinson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karamanidis et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, we identified the cell and molecular mechanisms that maintain tendon homeostasis during adulthood and demonstrate how these mechanisms are disrupted with aging. Moreover, we demonstrated that depletion of Scleraxis-lineage cells in the adult tendon mimics age-related impairments in cellular density, ECM structure, composition, and material quality. By comparing these two models, we were able to delineate the mechanisms that regulate tendon homeostasis, independent of the systemic effects of aging, while also establishing the tendon-specific response to aging. More specifically, we have demonstrated that loss of a critical mass of biosynthetic tenocytes, or biosynthetic tenocyte function initiates a degenerative cascade in tendon. This is particularly striking as it demonstrates that it is the decline in cell density and the accompanying loss of cell function itself that drives age-related tendon degeneration, rather than age-related programmatic shifts. Finally, these data provide more granular information on the timeline in which age-associated declines in tendon cell density occur and provide a functional and mechanistic link between declines in tendon cell density and initiation of tendon degeneration. Moreover, we have identified preventing the loss of biosynthetic tenocytes (whether via apoptosis or other mechanisms) as a critical intervention point for maintaining tendon structure-function.</p><p>While we have previously shown that this Scleraxis-lineage depletion strategy results in a ~60% decrease in tendon cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Best et al., 2021</xref>), it was unknown whether this was a sustained or transient depletion event that eventually results in re-population of the tendon via compensation by non-depleted populations. Indeed, this model results in sustained cell depletion, thus allowing assessment of the long-term impact of Scleraxis-lineage cell deficiency. It is important to note that this model likely depletes any âprogenitorâ cell populations due to the use of non-inducible Scx-Cre, further inhibiting any potential cellular rebounding post-depletion. We observed that Scleraxis-lineage cell depletion resulted in almost identical cellular density with older (12 M old) and geriatric (31 M old) tendons, indicating that with depletion, there is an acceleration of the natural age-related tendon cell loss. An age-related decline in tendon cell density has been extensively documented, with consistent decreases across anatomically distinct tendons and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korcari et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sugiyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stanley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Freedman et al., 2022</xref>). However, the fact that Scleraxis-lineage depletion in young animals results in a comparable decline in cellularity suggests there may be mechanisms that maintain a minimum level of cellularity and prevents complete cell loss, although these mechanisms remain to be defined. Moreover, the recapitulation of many established hallmarks of tendon aging, including altered ECM structure, organization, and material quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Connizzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gehwolf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunkman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sugiyama et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ippolito et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Watanabe et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watanabe et al., 1997</xref>), further supports the utility of defining the consistent underlying mechanisms between DTR and aging to define previously unappreciated drivers of age-related tendon pathology. Indeed, the combination of transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in these models has facilitated identification of the key alterations in ECM composition that are associated with initiation and progression of tendon degeneration. Consistent with declines in high-turnover rate proteoglycans and glycoproteins with aging in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ewald, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariosa-Morejon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCabe et al., 2020</xref>), these classes of proteins were decreased in both aged and young depleted tendons, demonstrating that Scleraxis-lineage cells are required to directly regulate the synthesis and maintenance of multiple GPs and PGs, which are crucial to maintain tendon structure-function, since their decrease results in significantly impaired collagen fibril organization and biomechanical properties. While other studies have shown through genetic KO models, that high turnover rate GPs and PGs are required to maintain tissue (tendon, bone, cartilage, skin) homeostasis during adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Watanabe et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Watanabe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hessle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">PÃ¶schl et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cosgrove et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hecht et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tiedemann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sakai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dex et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kokenyesi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qabar et al., 1994</xref>), they have been primarily descriptive. In contrast, we demonstrate that Scleraxis-lineage cells are a âmaster-regulatorâ of multiple ECM-related proteins during tendon homeostasis. More specifically, we identified decreased expression of COCH and CHAD protein in the tendon ECM in these models, as well as a consistent decline in Coch + and Chad + cells. Interestingly, COCH expression is observed in the spiral ligament of the inner ear, and <italic>Coch</italic>-/- results in degeneration of this ligament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kommareddi et al., 2007</xref>), further supporting the potential importance of this molecule in maintenance of tendon structure.</p><p>Consistent with prior scRNAseq studies in mouse and human tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Micheli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kendal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaji et al., 2021</xref>), we have identified substantial heterogeneity of the tendon cell environment. We have further built on this by establishing the functional consequences of decreasing the subpopulation that is primarily characterized by ECM biosynthetic functions. Interestingly, age-related declines in ECM biosynthetic function have also been identified in mouse and human skin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">SolÃ©-Boldo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Salzer et al., 2018</xref>), thus, future work will focus on establishing and disrupting the mechanisms that drive age-related declines in biosynthetic tenocyte number and function. In addition, we found that Guanylate binding protein 2 (GBP2) was a unique marker for the biosynthetic tenocytes 1, allowing us to track and identify this tenocyte biosynthetic subpopulation. While there are no studies that have assessed the function of GBP2 in tendon, other studies have shown that GBP2 exhibits host-defense and anti-microbial functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tretina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kutsch and Coers, 2021</xref>). Based on the innate immune and defense response BPs of tenocytes 1, in addition to their biosynthetic capacity, it could be speculated that this subpopulation may play a role in the immune defense response of tendons after injury. Since tenocytes 1 decreases with aging, it might drive additional tendon intrinsic immune dysregulation after an injury, further impeding the healing capacity of aged tendons. However, future studies are needed to define the function of GBP2 in tendon cells. As such, GBP2 is exclusively used as a marker of Tenocytes 1 in this study. Finally, our CellChat analyses identified that Thbs2-Sdcn4 signaling was significantly impaired with both DTR and aging, suggesting that this pathway might be important for maintenance of tendon homeostasis. While this specific pathway has not been extensively studied in tendon, previous work has shown that Sdcn4 is required for muscle development, homeostasis, and healing after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornelison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">RÃ¸nning et al., 2020</xref>). As such, future studies can better define the role of this signaling axis in tendon health, as it may represent promising therapeutic target.</p><p>In addition to comparable declines in biosynthetic function and subsequent initiation of tendon degeneration in these models, there are several informative areas of divergence. First, the tenocytes that remain in aged tendons demonstrate programmatic skewing, including an increased pro-inflammatory signature and loss of proteostasis. While these shifts are not necessary for homeostatic disruption, as evidenced by comparable disruptions in DTR tendons in the absence of this skewing, it is possible that these changes drive subsequent degeneration at timepoints beyond those included in this study. Consistent with this, 31 M B6 tendons exhibit substantial increases in ECM disorganization, relative to DTR. Moreover, while no enrichment of senescent markers was observed in aged tenocytes, it is possible that the pro-inflammatory signature and loss of proteostasis may be a precursor to subsequent tenocyte senescence, which could be an important driver of additional tendon degeneration. Finally, in addition to the unique programmatic shifts observed in aged tenocytes vs. the young depletion model, aged tendon resident macrophages demonstrate similar shifts in biological processes toward a response to protein unfolding, suggesting this may be a conserved feature of tendon cell natural aging. Another intriguing consideration is how these divergent shifts in tenocyte programs may relate to the divergent healing outcomes observed between these models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with impaired healing capacity in many aged tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Browder et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sgonc and Gruber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamaguchi et al., 2021</xref>), we have previously shown that 22 month-old tendons heal in a mechanically inferior manner, relative to young tendons, and fail to form the provisional ECM needed for successful healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, establishing how these intrinsic programmatic shifts may impair specific aspects of the healing process will be necessary to develop strategies to rescue the aged tendon healing process. In contrast, the cells that remain in DTR tendons display programmatic shifts associated with enhanced remodeling capacity. Moreover, DTR tendons demonstrate improved healing capacity relative to age-matched WT repairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Best et al., 2021</xref>). As such, understanding the signals that drive this programmatic shift in DTR, and establishing the mechanisms by which Scleraxis-lineage cell depletion enhances tendon healing holds tremendous potential for tendon tissue engineering and therapeutic strategies. Finally, these data highlight the surprising finding that homeostatic disruptions including decreased cell density and altered ECM composition, quality and organization are not of central relevance to the quality of the tendon healing response, suggesting a de-coupling of the mechanisms that regulate homeostasis and healing capacity.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic highlighting key findings and proposed models for divergent healing responses in young depleted vs aged tendons.</title><p>Both young DTR and aged WT tendons have similar decreases in tissue structure, organization, material quality, and total cell density. They also follow the same mechanism of ECM degeneration via a substantial decrease in the number of proteoglycans and glycoproteins with high turnover rate. However, in terms of cell composition shifts with depletion and natural aging, young DTR tendons are comprised mainly of tenocytes specialized in tissue organization and remodeling. What is more, young DTR have little to no inflammatory/reactive tenocytes. In contrast, old WT tendons are comprised predominantly of inflammatory and age-related functionally impaired tenocytes and exhibit little to no presence of tissue remodeling tenocytes. We speculate that these significantly different cellular compositions are some of the main causes resulting in divergent healing responses, with young DTR tendons showing improved healing while old WT tendons exhibiting impaired healing response.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84194-fig7-v3.tif"/></fig><p>One limitation of the study is that the <italic>Scx-Cre; DTR <sup>F/+</sup></italic> targets all Scleraxis-lineage cells, and the Scleraxis-lineage is known to contribute to tissues in addition to tendon (<italic>e.g.</italic> bones and muscle) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoshimoto et al., 2017</xref>). However, our initial plans to deplete Scleraxis-lineage cells by utilizing the inducible <italic>Scx-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic> crossed to the diphtheria toxin A-subunit gene (DTA) mouse model, resulted in insufficient cell depletion. <italic>Scx-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup></italic>; Rosa-DTR mice could be an alternative to inducibly deplete only adult Scleraxis-lineage cells, although this model requires both TMX and DT administration, and discrepencies in labelling vs. depletion may be observed. In addition, while we clearly demonstrate programmatic skewing in aged (21 M) tendons, relative to young, it is not clear when cells begin to undergo this programmatic shift. Future work to define the temporal nature will the establish the onset of these shifts as an additional important intervention point for maintaining physiological tendon cell function.</p><p>In summary, our morphological and multi-omics analyses identified Scleraxis-lineage cell depletion as a novel model of accelerated tendon ECM aging based on comparable changes in ECM organization, composition, and material quality with aged tendons. Moreover, we defined loss of a critical mass of biosynthetic tenocyte function as a conserved initiator of disrupted tendon homeostasis and degeneration in both young and aged animals. Thus, identifying strategies to prevent apoptosis of this population is an important priority for maintaining tendon health through the lifespan. Finally, we have demonstrated divergent programmatic skewing between Scleraxis-lineage cell depletion in young animals, and natural aging, and suggest that these differences may underpin the divergent healing capacity observed in these models. Therefore, it will be necessary to develop different strategies to address or prevent these two distinct manifestations of aging in the tendon to preserve both tendon homeostasis and healing capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Scx-Cre mice were crossed to ROSA26-iDiphtheria Toxin Receptor<sup>Lox-STOP-Lox</sup> (DTR<sup>F/F</sup>) mice to generate a model of Scleraxis-lineage tendon cell depletion (Scx-Cre<sup>+</sup>; DTR<sup>F/+</sup>; referred to as DTR). Expression of DTR is inhibited prior to Cre-mediated recombination due to the presence of a STOP cassette flanked by loxP sites (Lox-STOP-Lox).

For immunofluorescence, sections were stained with an anti-GBP2 antibody (1:500, Proteintech Cat#: 11854â1-AP, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2109336">AB_2109336</ext-link>), followed by a Donkey anti-rabbit Rhodamine-Red-X secondary antibody (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch, #711-296-152, RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2340614">AB_2340614</ext-link>). Sections were counterstained with DAPI to visualize nuclei and imaged using a VS120 Virtual Slide Microscope (Olympus, Waltham, MA). GBP2 + cells and total nuclei within the ROI were manually counted and the number of GBP2 + cells was normalized by the total nuclei number to quantify the percent of GBP2 + cells. All quantification was conducted in a blinded manner. An n=6â8 mice per group were used for quantification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Second harmonic generation two-photon confocal imaging</title><p>Five-micron paraffin sections of DTR, WT<italic>,</italic> and C57BL/6 J hind paws were utilized for second harmonic generation (SHG) imaging. Sections were scanned with a Spectra-Physics MaiTai HP DeepSee Ti:Sapphire Laser, tuned to 1000 nm, under Ã25 magnification, 2.5 X optical zoom, and step size of 0.25 mm. 3D projections of image stacks were generated using the 3D-Project macro in ImageJ and analyzed for collagen fibril uniformity using the built-in Directionality macro function. The Directionality (dispersion) macro utilizes Fourier transform analysis to derive spatial orientation of image stacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lobo et al., 2015</xref>). Sections were analyzed from n=3â5 mice per group per age.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantification of biomechanical properties</title><p>DTR and WT and C57BL/6 J FDL tendons were harvested from the hind paws. Specifically, each FDL tendon was carefully separated at the myotendinous junction under a dissecting microscope. The tarsal tunnel was then cut and the FDL tendon was slowly released from the tarsal tunnel, isolated until the bifurcation of the digits and then cut and released. Under the dissecting microscope, any additional connective tissues (e.g., muscle) were removed and the FDL tendon was prepared for uniaxial testing. Two pieces of sandpaper were placed on each end of the tendon and glued together using cyanoacrylate (Superglue, LOCTITE). All the steps above were performed with the tissue periodically submerged in PBS to avoid any potential tissue drying. Each gripped tendon was transferred into a semi-customized uniaxial microtester (eXpert 4000 MicroTester, ADMET, Inc, Norwood MA). The microtester, along with the sample, was transferred to an inverted microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus) to visualize the tendon and quantify the gauge length, width, and thickness. The gauge length of each sample was set as the end-to-end distance between opposing sandpaper edges and was set the same for all samples tested. The cross-section of the tendon was assumed to be an ellipse, where the width of the tissue represents the major axis and the thickness of the tissue represents the minor axis. Based on the optically measured width and thickness of each tendon, the area of the elliptical cross-section was computed. After measurement of the tendonâs gauge length, a uniaxial displacement-controlled stretching of 1% strain rate until failure was applied. Load and grip-grip displacement data were recorded and converted to stress-strain data, and the failure mode was tracked for each mechanically tested sample. The load-displacement and stress-strain data were plotted and analyzed to determine structural (<italic>stiffness)</italic> and material (<italic>modulus</italic>) properties. Specifically, the slope of the linear region from the load displacement graph was determined to be the stiffness of the tested sample. The slope of the linear region from the stress-strain graph was taken to equal the elastic modulus parameter of each tested tendon. Note that this calculation assumes that stress and strain are uniform within each specimen. A sample size of n=7 animals per group was utilized for biomechanical testing and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Sample preparation for mass spectrometry</title><p>Homogenization of each tendon tissue was performed by adding 150 Î¼L of 5% Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS), 100 mM Triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Samples were vortexed and then sonicated (QSonica) for 5 cycles, with a 1 min resting period on ice after each cycle. Lysates were then centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 5 min to collect cellular debris, and the supernatant was collected. Next, the total protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA; Thermo Scientific), after which samples were diluted to 1 mg/mL in 5% SDS, 50 mM TEAB. A mass of 25 Âµg of protein from each sample was reduced with dithiothreitol to 2 mM, followed by incubation at 55 Â°C for 60 min. Iodoacetamide was added to 10 mM and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature to alkylate the proteins. Phosphoric acid was added to 1.2%, followed by six volumes of 90% methanol, 100 mM TEAB. The resulting solution was added to S-Trap micros (Protifi) and centrifuged at 4000 x g for 1 min. S-Traps with the trapped protein were washed twice by centrifuging through 90% methanol, 100 mM TEAB. One Âµg of trypsin was brought up in 20 Î¼L of 100 mM TEAB and added to the S-Trap, followed by 20 ÂµL of TEAB to ensure the sample did not dry out. The cap to the S-Trap was loosely screwed on but not tightened to ensure the solution was not pushed out of the S-Trap during digestion. Samples were placed in a humidity chamber at 37 Â°C overnight. The next morning, the S-Trap was centrifuged at 4000 x g for 1 min to collect the digested peptides. Sequential additions of 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA in 50% acetonitrile were added to the S-trap, centrifuged, and pooled. Samples were frozen and dried down in a Speed Vac (Labconco), then re-suspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to analysis. Three tendons per genotype per timepoint were used for proteomic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Mass spectrometry (MS)</title><p>Peptides were injected onto a homemade 30 cm C18 column with 1.8 Âµm beads (Sepax), with an Easy nLC-1200 HPLC (Thermo Fisher), connected to a Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in water, while solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Ions were introduced to the MS using a Nanospray Flex source operating at 2 kV. The gradient began at 3% B and held for 2 min, increased to 10% B over 6 min, increased to 38% B over 95 min, then ramped up to 90% B in 5 min and was held for 3 min, before returning to starting conditions in 2 min and re-equilibrating for 7 min, for a total run time of 120 min. The Fusion Lumos was operated in data-dependent mode, with MS1 scans acquired in the Orbitrap, and MS2 scans acquired in the ion trap. The cycle time was set to 2 s. Monoisotopic Precursor Selection (MIPS) was set to Peptide. The full scan was done over a range of 375â1400 m/z, with a resolution of 120,000 at m/z of 200, an AGC target of 4e5, and a maximum injection time of 50 ms. Peptides with a charge state between 2 and 5 were picked for fragmentation. Precursor ions were fragmented by collision-induced dissociation (CID) using a collision energy of 30% with an isolation width of 1.1 m/z. The Ion Trap Scan Rate was set to Rapid, with a maximum injection time of 35ms, an AGC target of 1e4. Dynamic exclusion was set to 45 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>MS data filtering</title><p>Raw data was searched using the SEQUEST search engine within the Proteome Discoverer software platform, version 2.4 (Thermo Fisher), using the SwissProt <italic>Mus musculus</italic> database.

Libraries were prepared using a Chromium Single Cell 3 Reagent Kit (version 3, 10 X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA) following the directions of the manufacturer. Cells were loaded into the kit and processed using a chromium controller (10 X Genomics). Following library preparation and quality control (QC), libraries were sequenced using the S2 NovaSeq flow cell system (Illumina, San Diego, CA), generating an average of 65,000 reads per cell for all groups. Raw data quality control and downstream analyses were performed with R-4.1.2 and the Seurat package (4.0.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). Cells with &lt;1000 or&gt;5000 genes, as well as cells with &gt;10% mitochondrial genes were removed from the dataset. After filtering out low quality cells, there were 8359 cells for the young (6 M old) WT group, 6554 cells for the young (6 M old) DTR group, and 4798 cells for the 21 M old C57BL/6 J WT group. All three different datasets were integrated to determine alterations of different cell subpopulations between groups using the âFindIntegrationAnchorsâ function (dims = 1:20). The function âIntegrateDataâ was applied in the anchor set with the default additional arguments. Next, data was scaled using the âScaleDataâ with default parameters and principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the integrated dataset to compute 20 principal components (PCs). Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction was applied, and the Shared Nearest Neighbor (SSN) graph was constructed by utilizing dimensions 1:20 as input feature. To identify cell clusters, the âFindClustersâ function was utilized on the integrated dataset at a resolution of 0.1, resulting in seven distinct cell clusters. To identify genetic markers of each single cluster and annotate the different clusters to known cell types, the top differentially expressed genes of each cluster were identified in the heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Next, the âFindAllMarkersâ function was used to identify upregulated genes for each cluster. The average gene expression level was calculated across each cluster. The minimum percentage of cells in which the gene is detected in each cluster was set to 50%. The average log2 change threshold was set to at least 0.25.

To assess tenocyte-tenocyte communication, tenocyte clusters 1â3 from the integrated data were subsetted and a CellChat object of tenocytes 1â3 was created for each condition using the âcreateCellChatâ function. After proper annotation, the âCellChatDB.mouseâ database was utilized for our study To identify overexpressed genes, the âidentifyOverExpressedGenesâ function was utilized. To identify significant cellular interactions, the âidentifyOverExpressedInteractionsâ function was utilized. Finally, to infer communication probabilities, the âcomputeCommunProbâ function was utilized. Next, to study the effect of depletion and natural aging on tenocyte-tenocyte communication, a merged CellChat object was created for the 6 M WT vs 6 M DTR, and 6 M WT vs 21 M B6 groups, respectively, using the âmergeCellChatâ function. To assess tenocyte-macrophage communication, tenocytes and macrophage clusters from the integrated data were subsetted. The same steps mentioned above for the tenocyte-tenocyte communication analysis were also followed for tenocyte-macrophage communication. To identify the differential number of interactions between two conditions, the ânetVisual_diffInteractionâ function was utilized. To identify specific signaling pathways that were conserved or expressed only in one condition, the ârankNetâ function was utilizes. Next, the ânetAnalysis_signalingRole_heatmapâ function were applied to identify the âoutgoingâ and âincomingâ patterns of signaling pathways for each different cell population and how that compares between 2 conditions.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nathanial Dyment (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This is a generally well-executed set of study, the data from which largely supports the conclusions. The manuscript would be strengthened by (1) improved clarity of the methods and figures as pointed out by the reviewers; (2) including more introduction/discussion on Gbp2; and (3) including more discussion on the limitations of using the DTA mice to model the aging process (eg. artificial, not a perfect model of agingâ¦).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study developed a novel model of accelerated tendon extracellular matrix (ECM) aging via depletion of Scleraxis-lineage (ScxLin) cells in young mice (DTR). The authors found the depletion reduced cell numbers to similar baselines as aged tendons, indicating that a minimum cell number threshold exists to maintain tendon. This cell loss coincided with disrupted ECM organization and reduced mechanical properties. The DTR and aged tendons had similar protein composition with the main difference compared to young healthy tendons being a loss of high turnover ECM proteins. Via sc-seq, DTR and aged tendon had fewer biosynthetic cells, correlating with loss of certain ECM proteins. Interestingly, the remaining cells in the DTR model differed from aged tendons. While somewhat artificial, this depletion model system is an interesting way to investigate mechanisms that lead to reduced ECM turnover and matrix degeneration. I commend the authors for conducting this extensive study and have mostly minor comments to help with data interpretation and presentation.</p><p>1. In Figure 3E, the authors show the relative proportions of tenocytes in the 6M WT, 6M DTR, and 21M B6 groups, what about other cell types? It would be great to show pie charts of all of the cell clusters in one of the supplemental figures (maybe Figure S4). Did the other cell populations increased or decrease? I know that the authors plan to publish the epitenon data in a separate paper but it would still help the readers in this paper to understand the relative proportions.</p><p>2. In Figure 4F, it appears that there is a subset within the Tenocyte 1 cluster (right 1/3 of the heatmap for Tenocyte 1). Is this a unique subset? Did the authors conduct upregulated biological processes on this subset?</p><p>3. The authors used GBP2 as a unique marker for the tenocyte 1 population but didn't discuss it further. What is the function of GBP2 and does it help explain some of the degenerative changes seen in aging tendons?</p><p>4. Similar to my previous point, Thbs signaling was demonstrated to be a common pathway in both DTR and aging. What do we know about this signaling axis and its role in tendon? It would be great to touch on Thbs and GBP2 in the discussion.</p><p>5. Can the authors please clarify the following sentence in the discussion?

Reference 1 and 36 are the same.</p><p>7. The fact that the cell density 3M after DTR reached the same minimum threshold as aged tendons and that DTR tendons didn't progressively lose more cells with age is quite interesting, as the authors indicated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors characterize the proteomic and single RNA Seq profiles of tendons that are aged or depleted of Scx+ cells. They show that the tendons depleted of Scx+ cells share a similar cellularity, collagen disorganization, and impaired biomechanics as the aged tendon. They find that ECM proteins/regulators are mis-expressed in Scx depleted and aged tendons, with the aged tendons having a population of tenocytes that expression a program of inflammatory markers.</p><p>1) In all figures, font on the heat maps are out of focus and very small â would make it easier for the reader if this was improved.</p><p>2) Methods â For the biomechanical testing â it is not clear how was the strain applied to the tendon controlled to be the same for each tendon.</p><p>3) Methods â For the DT toxin injections, what time points were the mice injected?</p><p>4) Figure 1D- there may be a labeling error of the graph â 3M post DT is not the same as 6M old WT.</p><p>5) With the proteomics data, how do you know if the decrease in protein expression of these ECM molecules is due to the decrease in cellularity or each tendon cell has decreased expression of these markers?

Key take homes from these data include the high proportion of epitenon cells that are captured, including 58% of cells in the 21M WT group. While we speculate this may be due to combination of the low cellularity in the aged tendons, as well as the superficial nature of the epitenon, which may make these cells more amenable to digest. However, further work is needed to validate this speculation. Furthermore, there was a greater proportion of tendon resident macrophages captured in the depleted and aged groups, suggesting these populations may be more resistant to age-related declines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As we discuss in Figure 5F-J, these aged cells demonstrate up-regulation of age-related and pro-inflammatory genes such as IL6, Hspa1a, Hspa1b, Mt1, Mt2 and the downregulation of genes related to ECM/collagen biosynthesis and ECM organization such as Col6a3, Col1a1, Sparc, Vcan, Chad, Col1a2, and thus demonstrate shifts in biological processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors used GBP2 as a unique marker for the tenocyte 1 population but didn't discuss it further. What is the function of GBP2 and does it help explain some of the degenerative changes seen in aging tendons?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Based on this, we now provide additional text related to GBP2. While GBP2 has not been studied in the context of tendon, or musculoskeletal biology, GBP2 is downstream of IFN-Î³ signaling and exhibits host defense and anti-microbial functions [Tretina et al., J. Exp Med 2019; Kutsch et al., FEBS J 2021]. Consistent with this, Tenocytes 1, which are defined by specific expression of GBP2, demonstrate biological processes (BPs) related to innate immune and defense response such as response to cytokine, innate immune response, response to IL-1 (Figure 4F, G). We have clarified that expression of GBP2 is an effective marker of Tenocytes 1, but the functional role of GBP2 in tenocytes remains to be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Similar to my previous point, Thbs signaling was demonstrated to be a common pathway in both DTR and aging. What do we know about this signaling axis and its role in tendon? It would be great to touch on Thbs and GBP2 in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have added additional text to the discussion to address this. Syndecans are one of the main transmembrane proteins that bind with (thrombospondins) TSPs and since there was a decrease of TSPs in both DTR and aging, that resulted in a similar loss of TSP-Syndecan pathway among the two conditions. TSP2 -Syndecan 4 pathway exhibited the highest ligand-receptor communication in terms of statistical significance and communication probability in the young WT, and it was completely lost with both DTR and aging.</p><p>While there are no studies focusing on the roles of Syndecans in the tendon field, there is a limited number of studies regarding the roles of Syndecans in musculoskeletal tissues. Cornelison et al., as well as Ronning et al., have shown that Syndecan-4 KO mice exhibit impairments muscle development, homeostasis, and healing after injury [Cornelison et al., Genes Dev 2004; Ronning et al., Front Cell Dev Biol 2020].</p><p>The text now states: âFinally, our CellChat analyses identified that Thbs2-Sdcn4 signaling was significantly impaired with both DTR and aging, suggesting that this pathway might be important for maintenance of tendon homeostasis. While this specific pathway has not been extensively studied in tendon, previous work has shown that Sdcn 4 is required for muscle development, homeostasis, and healing after injury <sup>82, 83</sup>. As such, future studies can better define the role of this signaling axis in tendon health, as it may represent promising therapeutic target.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Can the authors please clarify the following sentence in the discussion? Which data in the paper support this statement? &quot;Finally, these data suggest that the initiation and early evidence of degeneration occurs much earlier in life than previously appreciated.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been clarified. Our intention was to highlight the greater understanding of the timeline of age-related tendon degeneration that our data provide. More specifically, since we show that the decline in cell density occurs at 10-12M of age (approximately middle age), and subsequently initiates a degenerative cascade, including loss of high-turnover rate ECM components, these data provide greater temporal context on the age-related degeneration phenotypes identified in prior studies. For example, many prior studies have identified substantial declines in tendon cell density with advanced aging (e.g., 21-24M), relative to young mice. However, based on these studies it was unknown when precisely the drop in tendon cell density occurred, or even whether this was related to age-related degeneration.</p><p>The revised text now states: âFinally, these data provide more granular information on the timeline in which age-associated declines in tendon cell density actually occur and provide a functional and mechanistic link between declines in tendon cell density and initiation of tendon degeneration.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Reference 1 and 36 are the same.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out, we have removed reference 36.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The fact that the cell density 3M after DTR reached the same minimum threshold as aged tendons and that DTR tendons didn't progressively lose more cells with age is quite interesting, as the authors indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. As the reviewer notes, there seems to be a minimum threshold for cell density, and the mechanisms that regulate this threshold representing an intriguing mechanism that we will pursue in the future. For example, would a higher dose of DT, or additional doses of DT be able to force cell density below this threshold?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors characterize the proteomic and single RNA Seq profiles of tendons that are aged or depleted of Scx+ cells.

They find that ECM proteins/regulators are mis-expressed in Scx depleted and aged tendons, with the aged tendons having a population of tenocytes that expression a program of inflammatory markers.</p><p>1) In all figures, font on the heat maps are out of focus and very small â would make it easier for the reader if this was improved.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this. We have updated these figures with higher resolution and larger font.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Methods â For the biomechanical testing â it is not clear how was the strain applied to the tendon controlled to be the same for each tendon.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. To clarify, after prepping the tendons for biomechanical testing, we measured the gauge length of each tendon and applied a displacement-controlled stretching of 1% of the initial gauge length per second until failure (1% strain rate). The gauge length was kept consistent between all groups, thus the strain rate applied to all tendons was consistent. Moreover, we have previously validated the experimental measurements of the tendon biomechanical properties using Finite Elements Analysis (Korcari et al., JMBBM, 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Methods â For the DT toxin injections, what time points were the mice injected?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment, as shown in Figure 1A, 3M old mice (both WT and DTR) were injected with DT for 5 consecutive days and then harvested after 3, 6, and 9M post depletion. To increase clarity in the manuscript, we have also included this info in the methods Mice section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1D- there may be a labeling error of the graph â 3M post DT is not the same as 6M old WT.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying this issue. To clarify- both WT (Cre-) and DTR (Cre+) mice were injected with DT at 3M of age. The 3M post-DT cohort was thus harvested at 6M of age. In Figure 1D, data from both the 6M old WT (3M post-DT) and the 6M old DTR (3M post-DT) groups are included as comparisons lines. We have added additional information to Figure 1A to make the experimental timeline and relative ages more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) With the proteomics data, how do you know if the decrease in protein expression of these ECM molecules is due to the decrease in cellularity or each tendon cell has decreased expression of these markers? Would be useful to validate this with expression of a candidate protein marker in WT /DT treated/aged tenocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. To address this, we used Chad and Coch as example. These ECM proteins were significantly decreased in aged and DTR tendons in the proteomics analysis (Figure 2M). We then examined these genes in the single cell RNA seq dataset (Figure 2âfigure supplement 3). At the transcript level, Tenocytes 1 and Tenocytes 3 are the predominant populations expressing Coch and Chad. While the cells that remained in the 6M DTR and the 21M B6 group demonstrated high levels of Coch and Chad expression (Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A and D), there was a substantial decline in the total number and the proportion of CocH<sup>+</sup> and Chad+ cells in these groups (Figure 2âfigure supplement 3C and F). To further confirm the data in Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A and D, we have plotted the mRNA expression levels of <italic>Coch</italic>, <italic>Chad</italic> and other ECM components that are down-regulated with DTR and/or aging in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Collectively, these data suggest that it is a decline in the number of cells that express these ECM components rather than down-regulation of expression on a per-cell basis.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84194-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please define Gbp2 â what is this molecule?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Based on this, we now provide additional text related to GBP2. While GBP2 has not been studied in the context of tendon, or musculoskeletal biology, GBP2 is downstream of IFN-Î³ signaling and exhibits host defense and anti-microbial functions [Tretina et al., J. Exp Med 2019; Kutsch et al., FEBS J 2021]. Consistent with this, Tenocytes 1, which are defined by specific expression of GBP2, demonstrate biological processes (BPs) related to innate immune and defense response such as response to cytokine, innate immune response, response to IL-1 (Figure 4F, G). We have clarified that expression of GBP2 is an effective marker of Tenocytes 1, but the functional role of GBP2 in tenocytes remains to be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 5 â there is graphic representation of genes enhanced in the different mouse groups, but are there any genes downregulated compared to WT?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this question. As shown in Figure 5 there are many differentially expressed (significantly increased or decreased) genes, across each set of comparisons. Using Figure 5B as an example, we compare differential gene expression in 6M WT Tenocytes 1 vs. 6M DTR Tenocytes 1. Genes in blue are significantly increased in 6M WT Tenocytes 1 vs. 6M DTR Tenocytes 1, that is, these are genes that are downregulated in the 6M DTR Tenocyte 1 cluster. In contrast, genes that are significantly reduced in 6M WT Tenoctyes 1 vs. 6M DTR Tenocytes (increased expression in 6M DTR Tenocyte 1) are shown in red. In addition, the heatmaps in Figure 5C, H, and M show up-regulation (purple) and down-regulation (yellow) of genes in 6M WT, relative to their respective comparison (Figure 5C: 6M DTR Tenocytes 1, Figure 5H: 21M B6 Tenocytes 1, Figure 5M: 6M DTR Tenocytes 2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the discussion, the authors mention that it would be helpful to prevent apoptosis of tenocytes during aging â where is the evidence or citation that shows cell death is increased in aged tenocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. While we do have preliminary data supporting an age-dependent degree of apoptosis (increased cleaved caspase 3 at 9-10 months, followed by a decline at 12-13 months), we have not included these data in this manuscript, and have therefore revised this statement. The revised text now states: âAs such, we have identified preventing the loss of biosynthetic tenocytes (whether via apoptosis or other mechanisms) as a critical intervention point for maintaining tendon structure-function.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
