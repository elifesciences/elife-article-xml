Flow cytometry is one of the standards that offers a method to characterize and isolate cells at high throughput. When performing flow cytometry, cells are molecularly stained with fluorescent labels to adopt biomolecular specificity which is essential for characterizing cells. However, molecular staining is costly and its chemical toxicity can cause side effects to the cells which becomes a critical issue when the cells are used downstream as medical products or for further analysis. Here, we introduce a high-throughput stain-free flow cytometry called in silico-labeled ghost cytometry which characterizes and sorts cells using machine-predicted labels. Instead of detecting molecular stains, we use machine learning to derive the molecular labels from compressive data obtained with diffractive and scattering imaging methods. By directly using the compressive ‘imaging’ data, our system can accurately assign the designated label to each cell in real time and perform sorting based on this judgment. With this method, we were able to distinguish different cell states, cell types derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, and subtypes of peripheral white blood cells using only stain-free modalities. Our method will find applications in cell manufacturing for regenerative medicine as well as in cell-based medical diagnostic assays in which fluorescence labeling of the cells is undesirable.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>flow cytometry</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>ips cells</kwd><kwd>leukocytes</kwd><kwd>imaging flow cytometry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ota</surname><given-names>Sadao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003051</institution-id><institution>New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakagawa</surname><given-names>Keiji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJPR14F5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ota</surname><given-names>Sadao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005865</institution-id><institution>Mochida Memorial Foundation for Medical and Pharmaceutical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ota</surname><given-names>Sadao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008884</institution-id><institution>Nakatani Foundation for Advancement of Measuring Technologies in Biomedical Engineering</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ota</surname><given-names>Sadao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJPR1302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sato</surname><given-names>Issei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJPR17PB</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horisaki</surname><given-names>Ryoichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stain-free ‘imaging’ flow cytometry enables high-throughput cell classification and sorting based on machine-predicted labels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Characterization and isolation of a large number of single live cells are of critical importance in life sciences and medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dudley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fraietta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Knoepfler, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reya et al., 2001</xref>). During qualitative or quantitative characterization of cells, it is most popular to use molecular staining such as those adopting antibody-antigen binding, where fluorescent markers are physically added (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Wittwer, 2000</xref>). Combined with a magnetic or flow-based sorting system, this enables selective isolation of the cells of interest at high throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herzenberg et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miltenyi et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shapiro, 2005</xref>). However, molecular staining has numerous disadvantages: the staining process is costly in terms of both time and money; number of detectable markers with fluorescence detection are limited by the spectral overlap of fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perfetto et al., 2004</xref>); multiple spectral compensation is complex and time consuming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roederer, 2001</xref>); immunocytochemistry staining is inconsistent due to the wide variability of antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weigert et al., 1970</xref>); and molecular staining potentially causes side effects to the cells by chemical toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fried et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patil et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Progatzky et al., 2013</xref>). These disadvantages become an issue in medical applications. For instance, when producing cell therapy products, the chemical toxicity of molecular staining may affect the final product. Another example is that, during medical diagnosis, the labor and financial cost limits the tests to be used in only large hospitals that can afford them.</p><p>On the other hand, microscopic image-based cell classification of unstained cells is free from such limitations of molecular labeling and is a promising approach for evaluating cell functions or potentials in fields such as cell manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buggenthin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niioka et al., 2018</xref>). Although unstained cell images were thought to lack specific biomolecular information, recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christiansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ounkomol et al., 2018</xref>) revealed the potentiality of bridging between images and molecular labels: prediction of labels from imaging information or ‘in silico labeling.’ However, these approaches utilizing conventional microscopes sacrifice the high throughput and sorting capability which exist in molecular labeling methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindström, 2012</xref>). This restriction arises from the fact that the acquisition of microscopy images is slow, and the processing of high-content images is even slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pepperkok and Ellenberg, 2006</xref>). Especially, to achieve real-time image-based cell analysis and isolation at high throughput, the processing speed becomes one of the substantial bottlenecks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nitta et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, conventional flow-based cell sorting systems that process simple cell information such as total fluorescence intensity fast enough to operate at around 10,000 cells/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sutermaster and Darling, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To achieve in silico-labeling-based cell classification at high throughput, we hypothesized that we do not need to construct the two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional ‘images’ for computationally predicting the labels. Previously, we have demonstrated ghost cytometry, an ‘imaging’ cytometry that is able to predict cell types based on fluorescence signals encoded with morphological information of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ota et al., 2018</xref>). However, the usage of fluorescence staining was inevitable and, therefore, could not suffice applications where cell staining is unfavorable. In this work, we developed a biologically supervised imaging cytometry method free from fluorescence labels called in silico-labeled ghost cytometry (iSGC) while we do not intend to produce any full 2D images in this work to prioritize the speed, we use terms of image or imaging for simplicity. This method performs ultrafast real-time prediction of biological labels by machine learning-based analysis of compressively measured image information of cells in a processing time of down to the order of microseconds on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Herein, the machine learning models are pre-trained by the stain-free imaging data and biological labels obtained by fluorescence staining; afterward, it becomes able to predict the biological labels without the measurement of fluorescence labeling. In other words, iSGC performs high-throughput flow cytometry without fluorescence stains but as if cells are fluorescently stained.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Principle of iSGC and cell sorting</title><p>In iSGC, morphological information of the cells is obtained with a stain-free compressive ghost imaging technique which we call diffractive ghost motion imaging (dGMI). Similar to previously reported fluorescence ghost cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ota et al., 2018</xref>), an imaging waveform is obtained from cells passing through a structured illumination at a speed where the signal width is shorter than 100 µs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, instead of collecting the whole photons with a bucket detector, to perform stain-free imaging, one to several fringe patterns in the diffractive speckle pattern from the transmitted light are acquired with a single-pixel detector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While full image reconstruction was demonstrated either with iterative acquisition using different structured illuminations or structured masks with a single-pixel detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horisaki et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Horisaki et al., 2017b</xref>), iSGC adopts a reduced acquisition for performing high-speed cell classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> depicts an overall workflow that enables biologically supervised in silico labeling of ultrafast dGMI signals without image production. We first prepare a training data set by simultaneously acquiring the dGMI waveform and the fluorescence label from each cell. We then train the machine classifier using this data set of biologically labeled waveforms. Once the classifier is trained, in turn, it is able to predict the fluorescence label from the stain-free imaging waveform. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we here performed iSGC with two cell-line samples of HeLa S3 cells and MIA PaCa-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The two cell lines are similar in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and mixed at equal concentration with only one of them stained with green fluorescence using LIVE/DEAD Fixable Green Dead Cell Stain (Invitrogen) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This mixture was hydrodynamically focused and flowed through the structured illumination within a microfluidic channel, where the dGMI waveform and green fluorescence of the cells were obtained simultaneously. Using the training data set comprised of the stain-free dGMI waveforms and the fluorescence labels, we trained a classifier based on support vector machine (SVM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boser et al., 1992</xref>). SVMs are stable in terms of optimization, and their generalization abilities are sufficiently analyzed on the basis of statistical learning theory. When the trained classifier was implemented on a FPGA, it judged the cells in real time using only the stain-free dGMI waveforms and then enabled subsequent sorting of the cells according to the judgment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The actual time lapsed during the judgment for a single cell with the FPGA was 6.0 µs. In iSGC, using a high-content modality, the classifier can find a decision boundary in a higher-dimensional space and is able to make decisions based on the complex information. As a result, iSGC was able to infer the fluorescence label corresponding to the cell type in this first case from a fluorescence-free measurement at a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.963 for cells flowed after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). In the actual sorting process, iSGC classified the cells at an accuracy of 0.917 according to the FPGA classifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and the purity of the actual sorted cells was 97.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, such accurate and high-speed classification and selection are challenging using existing flow cytometers that rely on low-content stain-free data such as forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), or back scatter (BSC), which is SSC’s analogy and can be used interchangeably with SSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

A structured illumination is created using a coherent light at the focus of an objective. After the focus, the coherent light spreads out and creates a speckle pattern due to diffraction. At a substantial length away from the focus, the speckle pattern is large enough so that with an iris, a single to a few fringe patterns can be obtained while the rest is blocked. This small portion of the original speckle pattern is detected with a PMT. When a cell passes through the structured illumination, the phase and intensity changes in the transmitted light result in a change in the speckle pattern. This leads to a change in the intensity of the light detected at the PMT. Therefore, from the modulation of the detected signal, the phase and intensity information of the cell can be obtained.

Similar to the fluorescence in previously reported ghost cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ota et al., 2018</xref>), when the cell passes through the structured illumination, the side scatter resulting from the overlap of the cell with the structured illumination is directed orthogonal to the illumination light path. This is collected with a lens and detected by a PMT (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The structured illumination was combined with other light sources using a dichroic mirror (DM1, ZT405rdc, Chroma) and focused on the flow channel using a 20× objective (OBJ1, UPLSAPO 20×, Olympus). The transmitted structured illumination was collected with a 10× objective (OBJ2, UPLFLN 10×, Olympus) and separated from other transmitted light using a dichroic mirror (DM6, ZT405rdc, Chroma). This was further passed through a 20× objective (OBJ3, UPLSAPO 20×), and in front of the objective at a distance of ~350 mm, an iris was put at an aperture size of ~3 mm. The light that entered the iris was detected with a PMT (PMT4) with a bandpass filter (405 nm, ET405/10×, Chroma) in front of it. ssGMI was measured using the same structured illumination as dGMI. However, instead of collecting the transmitted light, the scattered light from the flow channel orthogonal to the illumination light was collected using a plano-convex lens (f=50 mm, Thorlabs). Then it was separated from other scattered light using a dichroic mirror (DM7, ZT405rdc, Chroma) and detected with a PMT (PMT5) with a bandpass filter (ET405/10×, Chroma) in front of it. Fluorescence labels for training and validation were measured with either the 405 nm structured illumination, a 488 nm laser (Cobolt), or a 635 nm laser (Stradus 637-140, Vortran). The 488 nm laser and 637 nm laser were combined with a dichroic mirror (DM3, ZT488rdc), reflected with another dichroic mirror (DM2, ZT405/488/635rpc) for separating the returning fluorescence light, and combined with the 405 nm structured illumination with DM1. The three light sources were focused on the flow channel using OBJ1. The fluorescence was collected using the same objective and passed through DM1 and DM2. This was further separated into different colors with dichroic mirrors DM4 and DM5 and detected using PMTs (PMT1, PMT2, and PMT3) with different bandpass filters (ET440/40×, ET525/50m, ET675/50m, respectively, all from Chroma) in front of them. In the case of WBC differential classification, a similar setup for four-color detection using three dichroic mirrors and four PMTs was used. Forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) for triggering acquisition and initial cell population gating were measured using the 488 nm laser or the 637 nm laser. The figure is depicted for the case of the 488 nm laser. For the FSC, from the flow channel, the transmitted 488 nm light was collected with OBJ2 and passed through DM6. Then the main transmitted beam was blocked with an obscuration bar, and the scattered light that came around the obscuration bar was collected with a lens and detected with a photodetector (PDA100A, Thorlabs) with a bandpass filter (ZET488/10×, Chroma) in front of it. For the SSC, the scattered light from the flow orthogonal to the illumination light was collected using a plano-convex lens (f=50 mm, Thorlabs).

We here demonstrate the iSGC-based cell analysis in a cell production line using human iPSCs. The production line starts from thawing frozen-preserved iPSCs which are then passed through multiple differentiation steps, leading to the final cell product. Throughout this production line, monitoring viability, liveliness, expressions states, and purity of the cell population, and often their selective enrichment are of critical importance. Up to now, these examinations have required molecular staining, which is often toxic to cells and, if not toxic, the cells can be affected, for instance, by immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Progatzky et al., 2013</xref>).

To enable effective classification of cells, especially in dead cell discrimination, here, we introduce other stain-free modalities called side scatter GMI (ssGMI) and back scatter GMI (bsGMI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), which are SSC and BSC variants, respectively, of their fluorescence waveform counterpart in ghost cytometry.

In the final stage of production, the discrimination of contaminants at high accuracy is necessary to remove potentially cancerous cells, which may lead to tumors after their transplantation. We chose retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, the first iPSC-derived cells tested clinically, as a product of regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cyranoski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cyranoski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garber, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mandai et al., 2017</xref>). We applied our method for classifying a mixed population of RPE cells and Y-79 retinoblastoma cells, model epithelial cancer cells that can potentially remain in the RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reid et al., 1974</xref>). Only the retinoblastoma cells were stained with CellMask Green Plasma Membrane Stain (Invitrogen) prior to mixing the two cell populations. Using dGMI and ssGMI waveforms labeled based on the intensity of CellMask Green as training data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), the AUC for classification of RPE cells with Y-79 cells was 0.994±0.002 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In contrast, simultaneously using FSC and SSC information for the SVM-based classification, the AUC was limited to 0.966±0.004 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This difference becomes substantial when purifying RPE cells at a low false positive rate, or low number of overlooked cancer cells. For instance, to achieve a false positive rate of less than 1%, 92% of the RPE cells can be recovered with iSGC but only 52% of the RPE cells can be recovered with FSC and SSC (see Materials and methods). Therefore, iSGC can be used to distinguish and remove cancerous cells from the final products of cell manufacturing at high sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional stain-free methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>White blood cell differentiation</title><p>Other than cell manufacturing, iSGC can be used for medical diagnosis based on cell classification. For example, peripheral white blood cell (WBC) differential count is necessary for the diagnosis of diseases such as inflammatory states, sepsis, allergy, and hematologic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blumenreich, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roussel et al., 2012</xref>).

Recently, studies have been ongoing to replace the reference method with flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cherian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hubl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roussel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roussel et al., 2010</xref>). Still, because one CD marker can differentiate only one cell type at the most, using antibodies for multiple CD markers expands the cost of diagnostic tests to be performed as a routine basis. With iSGC, peripheral WBC differential counting can be performed based on the morphology of the cells without CD markers, but objectively and with thousands of cells.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate stain-free peripheral WBC differential classification with iSGC using healthy blood samples spiked with model CD45+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). To train and validate our system, the WBCs were stained with five fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies that each bind to one of these types of CD markers; CD45, CD123, CD14, CD16, and CD34. Using these markers, the cells were labeled as neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, or HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), corresponding to a widely performed, five-part peripheral WBC differential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hubl et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roussel et al., 2010</xref>) and HSC enumeration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brocklebank and Sparrow, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Venditti et al., 1999</xref>). Here, we additionally utilized two other stain-free modalities which we call forward scatter GMI (fsGMI) and bright field GMI (bfGMI), which are analogs to forward scattering in flow cytometry and bright field images in microscopy, respectively, to improve classification performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Also, convolutional neural network (CNN) was adopted to build a classifier for this sorting-free task. After training the iSGC classifier with the CD-marker-based labels, we predicted the peripheral WBCs as one of the cell types using dGMI, bsGMI, fsGMI, bfGMI, FSC, and BSC modalities. When we performed the classification for two donors in an intra-donor manner by training a model using data from one donor and applying it to data from the same donor, macro-average F1-scores of 0.906±0.003 and 0.906±0.002 were obtained, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, when we performed the classification for the same two donors in an inter-donor manner by training a model using a data set from one donor and applying it to a data set from another donor, and vice versa, macro-average F1-scores of 0.901±0.002 and 0.884±0.004 were obtained, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Slight false negatives can be seen for basophils, which can be thought to be due to their limited number in the population used for training and testing the model. In the proportion of each cell in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>) and the flow cytometry scatter plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G and H</xref>) compared to the CD-marker-based labeling, the predictions made by iSGC performed well across samples. The class ratio by CD marker and prediction were in good agreement for both intra- and inter-donor predictions, even if the predictions included cells that were not gated and were difficult to clearly label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

For instance, with conventional FSC and SSC, each modality yields a single scaler value, and therefore, even combined, the gating is only in a 2D space. However, iSGC utilizes a waveform containing over 100 points and performs classification in this high-dimensional space. While it is difficult for humans to perceive such high-dimensional data, employing machine learning allows us to directly interpret them and perform classification fast enough to enable high-throughput sorting.</p><p>Because iSGC utilizes ‘image’ information, which is a generic indicator of cell morphology just as the 2D cell images, it shares the limitations and advantages with other image-based cell classification methods. For example, iSGC often shows poor classification performances when morphological differences are not easily visually recognizable between cells to be classified. From our experiences, differentiation of CD4 and CD8 T cells are one example which have been challenging to both ghost cytometry and our eyes. On the other hand, transferability of a model can be advantageous: a model developed using different data can be applied to a new sample or application in general, just as those using 2D images can be applied to a new sample or application. Moreover, the iSGC machine is currently equipped with a self-calibration system for controlling the position of flow streams of cells relative to the illumination pattern, which is analogous to a situation where objects come to the same position in the 2D images, consequently enhancing the robustness of models over a long time or between experiments. This is evidenced by the good results of inter-donor classification of the six cell types.</p><p>In addition to the modalities of conventional FSC and SSC, dGMI, fsGMI, bsGMI, ssGMI, and bfGMI, we used in this work, the concept of iSGC is not limited to those—other label-free modalities with high dimensions can also be used and combined. For example, imaging techniques such as holography may be able to be adapted for iSGC. What is critical is that such modalities are acquired so that the data can be processed quickly for classification. In the case of holography, the reconstruction of the object image from compressive measurements have been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brady et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marim et al., 2010</xref>), These holographic measurements may be further compressed for classifying the cells based on iSGC.</p><p>The potential applications of this method are similar to those of other image-based cell classification, including purification and quality control of cell manufacturing products and diagnostic tests using blood cells, as we demonstrated in this work. These include image-based classification of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>), differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Teramoto et al., 2019</xref>), and WBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lippeveld et al., 2019</xref>). The advantage over conventional image-based cell classification is that iSGC is able to perform cell classification at higher throughputs which is necessary for analyzing large populations of cells in manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sutermaster and Darling, 2019</xref>) and in diagnostic tests where rare cell detection is often required. Furthermore, in contrast to microscopy image-based cell classification, iSGC-based high-throughput enrichment of the desired cells allows us to use them for their downstream uses in manufacturing as well as molecular assays in further detailed analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grün and van Oudenaarden, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the concept of iSGC can be used with a variety of ground truth labels. Depending on the characteristics of cell populations and the purpose of classifications, ground truth labels in training data sets can be prepared with various surface markers, genetic reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), and functional assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barros et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, if we have separated cell populations showing characteristics such as responder versus non-responder cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belzeaux et al., 2012</xref>), or disease versus healthy cells, they can be used as a label training a model to classify and selectively sort the unknown cells. In addition, it is often the case that molecular labels suitable as ground truth labels are unavailable or less-biased clustering of the morphological information is preferred. One approach for this issue is to use the same high-dimensional modalities for clustering cells based on morphological information via dimension reduction and then adopt these visualized clusters as new labels for training the supervised learning model in iSGC.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a high-speed, stain-free cytometry that predicts labels based on compressive imaging information without image reconstruction. This staining-free technology will find its applications in a wide range of medical fields such as cell manufacturing in regenerative cell therapy and blood cell enumeration and differentiation in clinical diagnosis. The key to this technology is in turning imaging modalities that are incomprehensible to humans practical for cell characterization by using machine learning to correlate them to biological labels. In the current era where machines can outperform humans, we believe in the potential of utilizing modalities that are machine suitable, rather than human suitable, and that such concept will accelerate not only the field of flow cytometry, but also other areas of science.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electronics</title><p>All photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) used in this work were purchased from Hamamatsu Photonics Inc PMTs of 10 MHz with built-in amplifier (H10723-210 MOD, MOD2, H10723-Y2, A2, MOD2) were used for detecting the dGMI, ssGMI, bsGMI, and fsGMI signals, while PMTs of 200 kHz (H10723-20 Y1, H10723-20 MOD, H10723-210 Y1), 1MHz (H10723-210 MOD3, H10723-20 MOD3), or 10MHz (H10723-210 MOD2) were used to detect fluorescence signals, SSC, and BSC signals.

Then neural ectodermal progenitor cells were differentiated into RPE cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuroda et al., 2019</xref>). After differentiation, RPE cells were cultured on a laminin-coated 12-well plate. 43.2 µl of 0.5 mg/ml iMatrix-511 (Nippi) was added to 12 ml of PBS, and 1 ml of the solution was added to each well. The well plate was incubated at 37°C under 5% CO2 for 2 hr, and the PBS was removed before use. The thawed RPE cells were seeded onto this laminin-coated well plate and were cultured using an RPE culture medium provided by HEALIOS. The medium was changed every 2 days. The RPE cells were cultured for 8 weeks after thawing before the analysis with iSGC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Experimental conditions for iSGC</title><p>The cells were flowed through either a quartz flow cell (Hamamatsu) or a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based microfluidic device using a customized pressure pump and/or a syringe pump (KD Scientific). The quartz flow cell had a channel cross-section dimension of either 250×500, 250×250, or 150×150 µm<sup>2</sup> at the measurement position, and when using this, the sheath fluid (IsoFlow, Beckman Coulter) was driven at a pressure of about 25, 85, or 305 kPa, respectively. The PDMS device had a channel with a cross-section dimension of 37×50 µm<sup>2</sup> at the measurement position, and when using this, the sheath flow was driven at a pressure of about 185 kPa. The sample fluid was driven at a flow rate between 10 and 40 µl/min.</p><p>For the binary classification of the cells, an SVM algorithm using either linear or radial basis function kernel was used. The regularization coefficient and kernel coefficient in the SVM were tuned by grid search. Except for the classification and sorting of HeLa S3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, all trainings and validations of the algorithms were performed using equal amounts of samples for each class label, and the accuracies, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, AUCs, and the macro-average F1-scores were validated with 10 times random sampling and presented with the mean and standard deviation of the 10 trials. The number of samples was determined as sufficient amount to perform learning and evaluation of the SVM model. SVM score histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> were derived from the trials with the best AUC. The mean and standard deviation of AUCs in the caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in the main text were derived from the 10 AUCs, whereas the means and standard deviations of AUCs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> were derived from the mean ROC curve. Therefore, the AUCs will slightly alter. All data and codes are available on Zenodo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ugawa et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>For the multiclass classification of six subtypes of WBC, we created a CNN model with two types of feature inputs. For input, we used both waveforms and scalar features derived from GMI (fsGMI, bsGMI, dGMI, and bfGMI) and FSC, BSC features, respectively. bfGMI was obtained by focusing the image plane on the detector. Our model includes five convolutional layers, one fully connected layer, and one softmax layer. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization, rectified linear unit (ReLU), and max pooling layers. Waveforms were used as inputs for the convolutional layer. Scalar features were concatenated to the previous outputs of the fully connected layer. For training, categorical cross-entropy was used as a loss function. The model was trained for 500 epochs with Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.00001 and batch size of 1024. If the validation loss did not improve in 30 epochs, we stopped training and adopted the weights with the best validation loss. The macro-average F1-scores were validated with 10-fold stratified splitting of training data and presented with the mean and standard deviation of 10 folds. Confusion matrices and predictive labels for quantifying the in-sample class ratios were derived from the folds with the best macro-average F1-scores. Detailed information such as number of cells from donors are available in the data and codes on Zenodo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ugawa et al., 2021</xref>). The number of cells was determined as sufficient amount to perform learning and evaluation of the CNN model.</p><p>The throughput of iSGC was deduced with the following procedures. Assuming that cells are evenly spaced with a distance equal to the length of the structured illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), resulting in consecutive acquisition of the waveforms, the throughput of iSGC in this ideal condition can be estimated as the inverse of the acquisition time. For instance, if the acquisition time is 100 µs per cell, the throughput can be estimated as 10,000 cells/s. Such estimation of throughput based on acquisition time is often adopted in imaging cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diebold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han and Lo, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Classification and sorting of HeLa S3 cells and MIA PaCa-2 cells</title><p>HeLa S3 and MIA PaCa-2 cells were detached from the culture flask using trypsin.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gregory R. Johnson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Address all the comments from the two reviewers; there are concerns regarding applicability and limitations brought up by both reviewers.</p><p>2) Reviewer two noted that the presentation could be improved to enhance readability.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This novel technique provides a method of cell sorting without the conventional use of fluorescent probes which can effect cell viability. They also showed that ghost cytometry can differentiate between live and apoptotic cells giving a more accurate reflection of cell viability. Retaining specimen viability is particularly important for obtaining cell lines and for therapeutic applications such BM transplant or CAR T therapy.</p><p>This paper also demonstrates the ability to generate an accurate white cell differential which could have diagnostic utility to potentially replace manual counts which has interobserver biases. However, this paper did not demonstrate the capacity to differentiate B and T cells, count blasts or detect pathologic hematopoietic cells. It would be interesting to see if this platform could identify cells of different levels maturity as hematopoietic pathologies lie all along the maturation spectrum.</p><p>While separating cells at different levels of maturation was demonstrated in cell lines, this is differentiating undifferentiated cells from terminally differentiated cells and does not demonstrate intermediate stages of differentiation.</p><p>CD34 should probably have been added to the flow panel to demonstrate if ghost cytometry can count blasts. A white cell differential is incomplete without this capacity.</p><p>Another marker that would have been helpful would be using CD138 for plasma cells. Plasma cells are known to be inaccurately counted by flow cytometry. Demonstrating an accurate plasma cell count on ghost cytometry compared to a manual differential could have provided a potential area of superiority diagnostically of ghost cytometry compared to flow cytometry.</p><p>The white cell differential was also only done on one patient. Having several patient samples should have been used to validate this method.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Flow cytometry typically relies on images and/or multiple chemical labels to identify cellular phenotypes. By training a machine-learning based model on a ground-truth labeled dataset, Ugawa et al. demonstrate that some cellular phenotypes can be accurately determined from a one-dimensional waveform of a cell passing through a field of structured illumination without the use of chemical labels. In combination with ultra-fast cell sorting this method opens the door for tasks where sorted cells may be utilized for downstream applications where staining is undesirable.

They also showed that ghost cytometry can differentiate between live and apoptotic cells giving a more accurate reflection of cell viability. Retaining specimen viability is particularly important for obtaining cell lines and for therapeutic applications such BM transplant or CAR T therapy.</p><p>This paper also demonstrates the ability to generate an accurate white cell differential which could have diagnostic utility to potentially replace manual counts which has interobserver biases. However, this paper did not demonstrate the capacity to differentiate B and T cells, count blasts or detect pathologic hematopoietic cells. It would be interesting to see if this platform could identify cells of different levels maturity as hematopoietic pathologies lie all along the maturation spectrum.</p><p>While separating cells at different levels of maturation was demonstrated in cell lines, this is differentiating undifferentiated cells from terminally differentiated cells and does not demonstrate intermediate stages of differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We first would like to thank the reviewer 1 for her or his appreciation on the particular importance of our methods named in silico ghost cytometry (iSGC) in the field of cell therapy as well as its potential utility in a wide range of diagnosis. As the reviewer commented, differentiation of further various types of cells including B and T cells, pathological hematopoietic cells, and cells at intermediate stages of differentiation would be of great interest, which motivate us to explore the exciting future applications of our iSGC by classifying more detailed morphological information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>CD34 should probably have been added to the flow panel to demonstrate if ghost cytometry can count blasts. A white cell differential is incomplete without this capacity.</p><p>Another marker that would have been helpful would be using CD138 for plasma cells. Plasma cells are known to be inaccurately counted by flow cytometry. Demonstrating an accurate plasma cell count on ghost cytometry compared to a manual differential could have provided a potential area of superiority diagnostically of ghost cytometry compared to flow cytometry.</p></disp-quote><p>We first appreciate Reviewer 1’s critical comments on iSGC’s demonstration for the classification of peripheral white blood cells (WBC). Following the recommendation, we performed additional experiments where iSGC was used to differentiate the five normal WBC types plus spiked CD34 positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, resulting in demonstration of accurate differentials of these six cell types (Figure 5 and Figure S7). The results are shown as confusion matrices in Figure 5B and 5C as well as the ratios of each cell type in Figure 5D and 5E in the modified manuscript. When we performed intra-donor classifications for two donors (healthy donors), macro-average F1-scores of 0.906 ± 0.003 and 0.906 ±0.002 were obtained, respectively. Here the intra-donor classifications were performed by training a model using a data set from one donor and applying it to a data set for the same donor. When we performed inter-donor classifications for the same two donors, macro-average F1-scores of 0.884 ± 0.004 and 0.901 ± 0.002 were obtained, respectively. Here the inter-donor classifications were performed by training a model using a data set from one donor and applying it to a data set from another donor, and vice versa. We added explanations about these newly added experiments and their results in the main text in page 7 as well as in the method section.</p><p>Regarding the suggestion of using CD138 cells for plasma cells, we agree that it is of interest and expands the utility of label-free ghost cytometry if it becomes possible to predict cell types even if suitable molecular markers are not available. However, it is out of scope of the concept of this work, <italic>in silico</italic> labeling, which is an approach for predicting molecular staining/markers from label-free morphological information [1]. In other words, the molecular labels in conventional flow cytometry are used as ground truth labels in ghost cytometry, but they are not compared to claim superiority of ghost cytometry.</p><p>Nevertheless, we appreciate the reviewer’s sharp and constructive comment. Predicting cell types of which molecular staining methods suitable as ground truth is unavailable is quite interesting and potentially powerful. We added sentences explaining its future importance and potentials in the Discussion section in page 10 of the manuscript as following:</p><p>“In addition, it is often the case that molecular labels suitable as ground truth labels are unavailable or less-biased clustering of the morphological information is preferred. One approach for this issue is to use the same high-dimensional modalities for clustering cells based on morphological information via dimension reduction and then adopt these visualized clusters as new labels for training the supervised learning model in iSGC.”</p><p>[1] Christiansen, E.

The results were consistent in both manners as shown in the modified Figure 5 as well as good macro-average F1-scores: it was recorded as 0.906 ± 0.003 when a model from donor 1 was applied to donor 1, as 0.906 ±0.002 when a model from donor 2 was applied to donor 2, and as 0.884 ± 0.004 and 0.901 ± 0.002 between donors when a model from donor 1 was applied to donor 2 and vice versa, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Flow cytometry typically relies on images and/or multiple chemical labels to identify cellular phenotypes.

This manuscript adds to growing number of applications of “in silico labeling” where machine-learning models can be utilized to predict chemical labels from unlabeled samples.” Regarding the critical comments on the “discarded” populations and inter-experimental variability, we modified the manuscript to show that iSGC analysis is robustly consistent even when the “discarded” populations are included. Moreover, we demonstrated that inter-donors samples can be robustly classified using an implemented model. These are described in more detail in the response to the “Recommendations for the authors”.

In the modified manuscript, we newly performed classification of six (five normal white blood cells + spiked CD34 positive hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells) cell types for two donors in both intra-donor and inter-donor manners (Figure 5 and Figure S7). The intra-donor classifications were performed by training a model using a data set from one donor and applying it to a data set for the same donor.

Are there applications where iSGC falls flat? Can we apply multiple models from different data to a new application?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for constructive comments. As a response to the 1st question, simplest speaking, iSGC can fall flat when morphological differences are not easily visually recognizable between cells to be classified, which is often the case in reality. Differentiation of CD4 and CD8 T cells are one example which have been challenging to both ghost cytometry and our eyes.</p><p>Regarding the second question, while we have not ever tried inter-application trials, multiple models from different data can be applied to a new application in principle, just as those from different 2D images can be applied to a new application in general. This is because the temporal waveforms in iSGC are generic indicators of cell morphology just as the 2D images are. Moreover, the iSGC machine is currently equipped with a self-calibration system for controlling the position of flow streams of cells relative to the illumination pattern, which is analogous to a situation where objects come to the same position in the 2D images, consequently enhancing the robustness of models over a long time or between experiments. This is evidenced with the results of inter-donor classification of the six cell types.</p><p>These discussions are additionally included in the main text of the manuscript in page 8 as following:</p><p>“Because iSGC utilizes “image” information, which are generic indicators of cell morphology just as the 2D cell images, it shares the limitations and advantages with other image-based cell classification methods. […] This is evidenced with the good results of inter-donor classification of the six cell types. ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall the discussion of flow versus image cytometry (starting at line 60) could be improved.

[…] Even though perceptually it may look difficult to extract features, machine learning algorithms can extract features from the raw image [Sinha et al. Optica 2017, Rivenson et al.
