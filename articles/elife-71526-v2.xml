The hemostatic protein von Willebrand factor is produced in vascular endothelial cells and packaged into specialized secretory granules, Weibel–Palade bodies (WPBs) at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN). Here, we reported that V0a1, a V-ATPase component, is required for the membrane fission of WPBs. We identified two V0a isoforms in distinct populations of WPBs in cultured endothelial cells, V0a1 and V0a2, on mature and nascent WPBs, respectively. Although WPB buds were formed, WPBs could not separate from the TGN in the absence of V0a1. Screening using dominant–negative forms of known membrane fission regulators revealed protein kinase D (PKD) as an essential factor in biogenesis of WPBs. Further, we showed that the induction of wild-type PKDs in V0a1-depleted cells does not support the segregation of WPBs from the TGN; suggesting a primary role of V0a1 in the membrane fission of WPBs. The identification of V0a1 as a new membrane fission regulator should facilitate the understanding of molecular events that enable membrane fission.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hemostasis</kwd><kwd>organellegenesis</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>membrane fission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K07401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamazaki</surname><given-names>Yasuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K07358</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kokame</surname><given-names>Koichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003478</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMH20FC1024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kokame</surname><given-names>Koichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008667</institution-id><institution>SENSHIN Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamazaki</surname><given-names>Yasuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP20ek0210154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kokame</surname><given-names>Koichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A V-ATPase component and protein kinase D are required for the segregation of Weibel–Palade bodies from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately one-third of newly synthesized proteins, including secretory proteins, transition from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, thereby allowing versatile protein modifications, such as disulfide bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farquhar and Palade, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klumperman, 2011</xref>). Subsequently, the proteins reach the membrane compartment, called the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klumperman, 2011</xref>). At the TGN, the proteins are sorted and packaged as cargos into distinct transport carriers that are targeted to individual subcellular destinations, such as the plasma membrane, endosomes, and/or secretory granules in specialized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Matteis and Luini, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kienzle and von Blume, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pakdel and von Blume, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anitei and Hoflack, 2011</xref>). Biogenesis of such membrane-bound structures is initiated by the deformation of the TGN membrane, which functions as a donor membrane, to form a bud where cargo proteins are packaged. The formation of nascent buds is sometimes associated with the recruitment of the coat proteins, clathrin, and coat protein I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kümmel and Reinisch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonny, 2006</xref>). Lastly, the buds separate from the TGN membrane for transport. The process of division of one membrane into two is termed membrane fission, which is expected to occur in leak-free luminal contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campelo and Malhotra, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Renard et al., 2018</xref>). To achieve such a high-fidelity system, cells must employ elaborate machinery; however, the mechanism of membrane fission remains elusive. One plausible reason is the difficulty in segregating the membrane fission process from the other steps of biogenesis in cells due to the small membrane-bound structures, such as secretory vesicles that are 50–100 nm in diameter, formed at the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campelo and Malhotra, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Renard et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The von Willebrand factor (VWF) is an extra-large multimeric glycoprotein involved in primary hemostasis by adhering platelets to the sites of vascular injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sadler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wagner, 1990</xref>). The multimers found in plasma vary in size; the largest multimer has a molecular mass of 20 MDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fowler et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng, 2015</xref>). Larger multimers recruit platelets more efficiently; thus, the multimerization of VWF is crucial for hemostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Federici et al., 1989</xref>). VWF is synthesized in vascular endothelial cells as a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of 350 kDa in the endoplasmic reticulum and immediately forms a disulfide bond-dependent dimer. The dimers are then transported through the Golgi apparatus, where they convert dimers to multimers via disulfide bond formation. The multimers are stored in large secretory granules called Weibel–Palade bodies (WPBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCormack et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Metcalf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mourik and Eikenboom, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Valentijn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weibel, 2012</xref>). WPBs are endothelial cell-specific, elongated, rod-shaped secretory organelles varying in size from 0.5 to 5 μm. VWF multimers in WPBs are exocytosed in response to several stimulants, such as histamine. In electron tomography, VWF multimers in the WPB lumen are found as striated, paracrystalline matrices called VWF tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berriman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Valentijn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zenner et al., 2007</xref>). As VWF tubules are aligned in parallel along the longitudinal axes of WPBs, it is thought that the formation of VWF tubules drives the formation of the unique, elongated shape of the organelles. In vitro reconstitution studies suggest that VWF tubule formation is a highly coordinated process of the alignment of multiple VWF dimers into a right-handed coil and the conversion of the aligned dimers into large multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCormack et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mayadas and Wagner, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). This tubulation allows approximately 50-fold compaction of the VWF in WPBs. The tubulation process requires acidic pH and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Springer, 2011</xref>) thus, VWF is expected to be exposed in such a subcellular environment during maturation, presumably at the TGN and/or in the newly forming WPB buds from the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Springer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wagner et al., 1986</xref>). The biological significance of the acidic milieu in mature WPBs is also evident. Forced neutralization of the WPB lumen by a chemical treatment causes a loss of visible VWF tubules, resulting in rounding of WPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Michaux et al., 2006</xref>). Neutralization does not reduce agonist-evoked VWF exocytosis; instead, it markedly reduces platelet recruitment because the multimers are unable to disperse efficiently upon exposure to an extracellular neutral environment. Thus, this evidence indicates the biological importance of the subcellular acidic milieu in primary hemostasis mediated by VWF; nevertheless, the mechanism by which endothelial cells achieve such an environment has not yet been addressed.</p><p>Vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (V-ATPase), an ATP-driven proton pump, is a major regulator of the subcellular acidic pH in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins and Forgac, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maxson and Grinstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakanishi-Matsui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vasanthakumar and Rubinstein, 2020</xref>). It is a multi-subunit complex composed of two large domains, V0 and V1. V0 is a membrane-embedded domain that translocates protons across the membrane, whereas the V1 domain hydrolyzes ATP. In mammalian cells, several subunits exist in multiple isoforms encoded by distinct genes, suggesting a large structural diversity of the V-ATPase complex in cells. This study focused on identifying the localization of V0a isoforms (‘subunit a’ in the V0 domain) in WPBs. We further analyzed the separation of newly forming WPB buds from the TGN, and investigated the role of V0a1 in PKD-dependent biogenesis of WPBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human umbilical vein endothelial cell culture</title><p>Although VWF is the most commonly used vascular endothelial cell marker in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wagner, 1990</xref>), not all cultured endothelial cells express VWF, particularly when cells are maintained in rather sparse conditions. To use cultured endothelial cells in physiologically relevant conditions, we optimized our culture and gene transfer conditions. Primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) form a stable monolayer with a characteristic cobblestone-like appearance when cells are maintained on fibronectin for 5–6 days. Under these conditions, essentially all cells expressed VWF at a comparable level, and the cellular junction proteins were located along the cell boundary, as expected in differentiated endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although our tested lipofection- and electroporation-based transfection considerably disturbed the cellular junction, recombinant lentivirus-mediated expression of EGFP showed virtually no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, we used a recombinant lentivirus system throughout this study.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cellular V-ATPase activity promotes VWF multimer dispersion</title><p>The acidic milieu of the WPB lumen is crucial for the hemostatic function of VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Springer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Michaux et al., 2006</xref>). V-ATPase is a major regulator of the subcellular acidic pH in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins and Forgac, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maxson and Grinstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakanishi-Matsui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vasanthakumar and Rubinstein, 2020</xref>). To address whether V-ATPase is a determinant of the acidic milieu of WPBs, we used bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A, which are well-characterized specific V-ATPase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins and Forgac, 2020</xref>). Four hours of exposure to the inhibitors caused rounding of WPBs without affecting the secreted amount of VWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), as previously observed in chemically neutralized cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Michaux et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting the possible role of V-ATPase in WPBs. Note that prolonged exposure to bafilomycin A1 (16 h) is reported to reduce the basal/constitutive secretion of VWF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Torisu et al., 2013</xref>). Upon exocytosis, VWF tubules in the acidic pH inside WPBs are instantly exposed to the extracellular neutral pH. The rapid change in pH causes the unfurling of VWF tubules, resulting in an efficient dispersion of VWF multimers on the cellular surface (as observed in the histamine-exposed cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Michaux et al., 2006</xref>). While pretreatment with the V-ATPase inhibitors did not alter the regulated exocytosis induced by histamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), it impaired the dispersion of VWF multimers, as observed in the cells exposed to NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which neutralizes subcellular acidic compartments. The strings formed by tangled VWF multimers upon histamine exposure of the V-ATPase inhibitor- or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl-pretreated cells were rather thin and fragile compared to the prominent, thick structures observed in the non-pretreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These observations suggest the contribution of V-ATPase activity in the acidic milieu inside WPBs. Indeed, we confirmed the WPB localization of V0c and V1A, two common subunits of the mammalian V-ATPase complex, in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The V0a isoforms are found on the distinct populations of WPBs</title><p>To gain further insight into the role of V-ATPase, we used confocal microscopy to observe and screen the subcellular localization of multiple V-ATPase subunits by expressing them as EGFP-fusion proteins in HUVECs. As a result, we found that two out of four isoforms of V0a (‘subunit a’ in the V0 domain) were localized in distinct populations of WPBs. As observed in the EGFP-tagged V0a1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), the endogenous V0a1 (isoform 1 of the V0a subunit) was mainly found in WPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The signal was evident on the WPBs observed in the cell periphery, whereas virtually no signal was observed on the WPBs in the perinucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). WPBs are formed at the TGN and transported to the cell periphery upon maturation, suggesting V0a1 localization in mature WPBs. Rab27a, a small GTPase, is a well-characterized molecule recruited to WPBs during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bierings et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nightingale et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rojo Pulido et al., 2011</xref>). Post-budded WPBs from the TGN move along microtubules to the cell periphery, where they are anchored to actin fibers. Rab27a is required for anchoring WPBs to actin. We found well-matched colocalization of V0a1 and EGFP-Rab27a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Accordingly, endogenous V0a2 protein was detected in the buds emerging from the TGN as well as on the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Super resolution microscopy revealed that V0a2-EGFP is located on the perinuclear WPB buds; however, they are not often found in post-budded WPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The signal intensity of VWF found in the V0a2-positive WPBs was rather faint compared to the strong signal observed in the post-budded WPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Live cell imaging confirmed that V0a2-EGFP was considerably localized in the newly forming bud and disappeared as soon as the bud segregated from the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The V0a2 buds found around the TGN were completely absent from EGFP-Rab27a, a mature WPB marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These observations indicated the limited localization of V0a2 in nascent WPBs. Newly forming WPB buds in the TGN are clathrin-coated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zenner et al., 2007</xref>. Depletion of the Golgi-associated clathrin adaptor protein-1 (AP-1) results in an almost total loss of visible WPBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lui-Roberts et al., 2005</xref>. Thus, clathrin appears to be an essential factor for biogenesis of WPBs, presumably required for a very early step, such as the bud-forming process at the TGN. Corroborating the findings of earlier studies, nascent WPBs found in the perinucleus were partially decorated with the components of AP-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>); however, this was not as evident as observed in V0a2-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

Conditioned media was collected at the indicated time points and evaluated using VWF multimer analysis (top). A schematic illustration of the experiments is shown on the right. Densitometric analysis was performed using Fiji software (bottom).

To test whether cellular V-ATPase activity is required for the maturation of VWF, we examined the effects of V-ATPase inhibitors on VWF multimerization. VWF is secreted at a low level, even in the absence of exogenous agonist stimulation. The secretion occurs from the WPBs and the TGN (referred to as ‘basal’ and ‘constitutive’ secretions, respectively). Although the secretion is at a low level, it is thought that the continuous supply of VWF multimers via these pathways is crucial for the maintenance of plasma VWF levels for the immediate hemostatic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giblin et al., 2008</xref>). While V-ATPase blockage did not change the amount of basally/constitutively secreted VWF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), the multimer analysis revealed that it caused a selective induction of dimer secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting a requirement for cellular V-ATPase activity in multimerization. As the dimer secretion is blocked by brefeldin A, an ER-to-Golgi transport inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), it is likely that the dimer secretion caused by V-ATPase blockage occurs from the TGN via the constitutive secretion pathway. The V-ATPase inhibitor exposure also caused a rapid disappearance of the nascent WPB buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The above observations suggested that VWF multimerization occurring at the TGN and/or in nascent WPB buds require V-ATPase activity. Next, we tested whether the V0a isoforms found in WPBs contribute to multimerization. Although the depletion of either V0a1 or V0a2 caused an increase in the secreted amount of VWF multimers, unexpectedly, no detectable alteration was observed in the multimer status even when both isoforms were depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). V-ATPase contributes to the formation of intracellular acidic microenvironment in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins and Forgac, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maxson and Grinstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakanishi-Matsui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vasanthakumar and Rubinstein, 2020</xref>). We introduced ratiometric pHluorin coupled with beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (GalT-pHluorin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Llopis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole et al., 1996</xref>) to see if the V0a isoforms are involved in the luminal pH regulation of the TGN where WPBs are formed. GalT-pHluorin is able to measure pH in a range of 5.5–7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A exposure caused almost complete neutralization of the TGN, whereas the depletion of each V0a isoform resulted in a modest increase of the pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These observations suggest that the luminal acidic environment of the TGN is largely maintained by V-ATPase activity in HUVECs, but the contribution of V0a1 and V0a2 is limited or masked by functional redundancies. Consistent with the nascent WPB/TGN localization, V0a2 depletion resulted in a slight but homogenous increase of the luminal TGN pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, although no statistical difference was observed when the whole TGN pH was compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), V0a1 depletion caused relatively large pH increase only in the some TGN subdomains (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>); suggesting an involvement of V0a1 in the pH regulation of the TGN, although the main cellular pool is found on peripheral WPBs. Taken together, despite the considerable localization on WPBs as well as the partial contribution on the acidic microenvironment of the TGN, V0a1 and V0a2 appear to be dispensable for multimer formation; however, the roles of these V0a isoforms remain elusive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The V0a isoforms are required for the biogenesis of WPBs</title><p>An increase in basal/constitutive VWF secretion is often observed in cells showing an alteration in biogenesis of WPBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nightingale et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lui-Roberts et al., 2005</xref>). To evaluate the importance of the V0a isoforms in the biogenesis of WPBs, we examined WPBs in V0a-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The WPBs were visualized using an anti-VWF antibody. Depletion of V0a2, which is found in the nascent WPBs, resulted in the formation of irregular, twisted WPBs compared to those found in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To clarify the morphological change of WPBs, we determined the longest Feret’s diameter (F<sub>max</sub>) of individual WPBs and the aspect ratio (F<sub>max</sub>/F<sub>min</sub>) calculated from the longest and shortest Feret’s diameters. Both values are expected to be smaller if WPBs are twisted or in irregular shape compared with relatively straight structure observed in the control. Accordingly, Feret’s diameters of WPBs, particularly F<sub>max</sub>/F<sub>min</sub> in the V0a2-depleted cells were obviously smaller than those in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). To confirm the shRNA-mediated phenotype, we introduced HA-tagged shRNA-resistant V0a2 in shRNA-expressing cells. The phenotype was specifically rescued in the resistant V0a2 expressing cells; however, this was not observed in the non-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The number of WPBs formed in the V0a2-depleted cells was comparable to that in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that V0a2 is not essential for the separation of WPBs from the TGN at the site of biogenesis. WPBs are storage organelles; that is, once formed, they remain in cells until they are exocytosed or turned over. Efficient reduction of target proteins by shRNAs requires time. Thus, it is likely that immunofluorescence of shRNA-transfected cells using anti-VWF antibody detects not only the WPBs that are formed in the absence of the target protein, but also the pre-formed WPBs before depletion. To further confirm the significance of V0a2 in biogenesis of WPBs, HUVECs were transduced with recombinant lentiviral particles expressing HA-tagged VWF after confirmed the depletion of endogenous V0a2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). VWF<sup>D1-A1</sup>-HA was found in the irregularly shaped WPBs located away from the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The WPBs were decorated with EGFP-Rab27a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These observations indicate that the membrane-bound structure of WPBs can still be formed and transported to the cell periphery, even in the absence of V0a2, although it appears to be important for the formation of properly shaped WPBs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Depletion of V0a2 causes the formation of irregular, twisted Weibel–Palade bodies (WPBs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Irregular WPBs were generated in the V0a2-depleted cells.

The number of WPBs in the V0a1-depleted cells was substantially decreased compared to that in the control, and the formed WPBs were largely accumulated around the TGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). Large decrease in Feret’s diameter in the V0a1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) seemed to represent the appearance of rounded WPBs observed in cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), although the WPBs accumulated around the TGN still retain the characteristic elongated shape. As the rounded WPBs were not often observed when WPBs were visualized by the introduction of VWF<sup>D1-A1</sup>-EGFP and P-selectin-EGFP in the V0a1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), we conclude that they are WPBs formed before the V0a1 deletion was achieved. The perinuclear accumulation of WPBs was rescued by the induction of shRNA-resistant V0a1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The phenotype was further confirmed by the induction of tagged VWF<sup>D1-A1</sup> and P-selectin in V0a1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). P-selectin is a leukocyte-recruiting protein that is packaged into WPBs at the TGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison-Lavoie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larsen et al., 1989</xref>). Both proteins were trapped in the perinuclear buds originating from the TGN in the absence of V0a1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). The accumulated WPB buds were not EGFP-Rab27a-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

These observations suggest that newly forming WPBs cannot be separated from the TGN in the absence of V0a1. Post-budded WPBs from the TGN are transported along the microtubule network to the cell periphery, where they are tethered to actin fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bierings et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nightingale et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rojo Pulido et al., 2011</xref>).

The expression of kinase-dead PKD mutants leads to the formation of tubules originating from the TGN because of the blockage of PKD-mediated membrane fission.

We further investigated whether V0a1 had any effect on the subcellular localization of wild-type PKDs (PKDs<sup>WT</sup>). EGFP-PKD1<sup>WT</sup> was found mainly in the cytosol and certain parts of the TGN in the control cells, as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bard and Malhotra, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malhotra and Campelo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Van Lint et al., 2002</xref>).

The signal was more evident in the accumulated WPB buds formed upon V0a1-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). DAG localization on perinuclear WPBs was further confirmed using two additional DAG reporters, including the C1a domain from PKD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baron and Malhotra, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maeda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). These observations showed that DAG was present on the membrane of newly forming WPBs, and PKDs were recruited through the interaction with DAG. We further investigated whether the PKDs on the WPB buds were enzymatically active. PI4-KIIIβ, a type III phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase localized at the TGN, has been identified as a PKD substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hausser et al., 2005</xref>). Its phosphorylation on the activation loop causes the activation of the enzyme, resulting in the conversion of phosphatidylinositol to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P). We introduced the PH domain from the oxysterol-binding protein (EGFP-PH-OSBP) as a PI4P reporter in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balla et al., 2005</xref>). As observed in the DAG reporters, the signal was detected on the accumulated WPBs in the V0a1-depleted cells and on the perinuclear WPBs in the control to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Two additional PI4P reporters, PH-FAPP1-EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balla et al., 2005</xref>) and EGFP-P4M-SidM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammond et al., 2014</xref>), also showed similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), indicating a presence of PI4P on perinuclear newly forming WPBs. To see if the PI4P on the forming WPBs is provided through the activation of PKDs, we performed western blotting of HUVEC lysate by using an anti-phospho-PKD1 antibody that detects the phosphorylation on the activation loop (pSer<sup>744/748</sup>). V0a1-depletion mediated by two independent shRNAs caused an increase of total PKD1 protein compared with the control, whereas we were unable to see any detectable changes in the level of phosphorylated PKD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). As the substantial amount of PKDs were observed on the accumulated WPBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>), an increase of PKD1 protein might be due to a difference in the protein stability dependent on the subcellular localization. Alternatively, it may be due to an upregulation of PKD1 expression by a cell autonomous compensation or unknown mechanism mediated by the V0a1-depletion. Because of the low endogenous expression of PKDs, it is hard to test whether the PKDs observed on the accumulated WPBs in the V0a1-depleted cells are active/phosphorylated or not. Therefore, although total amount of cellular active PKD1 is unchanged independent from the absence or presence of V0a1, we were unable to clarify the requirement of V0a1 on the PKDs activation/phosphorylation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Diacylglycerol (DAG) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) are present on newly forming Weibel–Palade bodies (WPBs).</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) DAG was present on newly forming perinuclear WPBs.

Although we were unable to determine whether the requirement of V0a1 is associated with the proton pump function because of the pleiotropic effects of V-ATPase in biogenesis or multimerization of WPBs, we believe that the identification of V0a1 as a new membrane fission regulator should facilitate the elucidation of the molecular events that allow membrane fission.

V0a2 appears to be required for the formation of proper, elongated shaped WPBs, whereas it is not essential for bud formation or membrane fission of WPBs despite the specific localization on newly forming WPBs. Nevertheless, the requirement of V0a1, which is mainly found in peripheral WPBs, for membrane fission that occurs at the perinuclear TGN is mystifying. V0a1 is also found on small intracellular vesicles in addition to WPBs; perhaps, these are acidic subcellular compartments such as endosomes and lysosomes. Endosomes are observed to form close contacts with WPBs in electron tomographic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berriman et al., 2009</xref>). The endosomal/lysosomal tetraspanin CD63/LAMP3 is delivered to WPBs during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harrison-Lavoie et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the small vesicle-mediated transfer of V0a1 could drive the membrane fission of nascent WPBs. Relatively large pH increase was observed in some TGN subdomains in the V0a1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>) possibly suggests that the biogenesis of WPBs occurs at particular subdomains of the TGN. Further work is required to elucidate the role of V0a1 in membrane fission.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The biogenesis of Weibel–Palade bodies (WPBs) requires vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase V0a1 and PKD for the membrane fission.</title><p>V0a1 on small vesicles such as endosomes could drive the membrane fission (see <italic>Discussion</italic>). In the absence of V0a1, nascent WPBs could not separate from the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (right). PKD activity was also required for the biogenesis of WPBs. Since the induction of wild-type PKDs did not support the segregation of WPBs from the TGN in the absence of V0a1, V0a1 appeared to be a primary factor in the membrane fission of WPBs.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71526-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We also found that DAG is present on the membrane of newly forming WPBs; however, it was not found in the post-budded WPBs. DAG accumulation on nascent WPBs became more evident in the absence of V0a1. Thus, PKDs appear to be recruited to the WPB through the interaction of the DAG-binding domain. Insertion of the N-terminal hydrophobic stretch of PKDs into the outer leaflet of the TGN is suggested to assist membrane fission by generating membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campelo and Malhotra, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Malhotra and Campelo, 2011</xref>). We believe that the hydrophobic stretch-mediating mechanism is unlikely in the biogenesis of WPBs because we observed essentially equivalent effects on all PKD members, including PKD3, which lacks the hydrophobic stretch in the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Campelo and Malhotra, 2012</xref>). Instead, our observations suggest functional redundancy of PKDs in biogenesis of WPBs. In fact, a single knockdown of either PKD1 or PKD2 does not show any significant effect on WPB formation as well as the secretion in earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ketteler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hao et al., 2009</xref>). DAG is a conical-shaped lipid that is thought to be relatively concentrated in the TGN buds to increase membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bankaitis et al., 2012</xref>). A theoretical model suggests that the presence of DAG on buds can stabilize the structure and prevent membrane fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shemesh et al., 2003</xref>). The disappearance of DAG in the post-budded WPBs may suggest a conversion of DAG into other lipids that destabilize the membrane structure to enable membrane fission. We also observed PI4P, a well-characterized membrane signaling lipid, on perinuclear nascent WPBs similar to DAG. PI4P and phosphatidic acid, a lipid generated from DAG through single-step metabolism, are shown to work as pH biosensors in cells; the pH-dependent interaction with particular proteins regulates cellular processes such as membrane biogenesis and intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Young et al., 2010</xref>). TGN pH measurements suggest that V0a1 appears to regulate luminal pH in particular TGN subdomains in HUVECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, the possible contribution of these lipids and cellular pH, as well as related lipid metabolism enzymes and lipid transporting proteins in WPB biogenesis should be investigated in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that two V0a isoforms of V-ATPase promote the biogenesis of WPBs in endothelial cells. In particular, V0a1 is essential for the membrane fission in nascent WPBs at the TGN. We also found that PKD activity is required for WPB biogenesis. As the induction of wild-type PKDs in V0a1-depleted cells did not support WPB segregation from the TGN, V0a1 appears to be a primary factor in the membrane fission of WPBs, although the molecular link between V0a1 and PKDs is still unclear. Qualitative or quantitative deficiency of plasma VWF multimers causes a bleeding disorder called von Willebrand disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sadler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sadler, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sharma and Haberichter, 2019</xref>). A V0a2 mutation has recently been reported to cause bleeding diathesis in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karacan et al., 2019</xref>). Plasma VWF activity is significantly impaired in patients without any substantial loss of plasma VWF antigen level, thus exhibiting a typical sign of von Willebrand disease, although no associating mutation was found in the <italic>VWF</italic> gene. We believe that our findings will facilitate further understanding of the pathology associated with VWF, such as von Willebrand disease, as well as the mechanism of membrane fission.</p></sec><sec

Coverslips were mounted using Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, AL, USA) and imaged using LSM880 (Plan Apochromat ×63 objective, NA 1.4, ZEISS, Oberkochen, Germany), FV3000 (UPSAPO60XO × 60 60 objective, NA 1.35, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and FV1000 (UPlanSApo ×60 objective, NA 1.35, Olympus) microscopes. For the super-resolution analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), images were acquired with LSM880 with AiryScan (estimated lateral resolution: 180 nm). EGFP was excited with 488 nm line from an argon laser and collected with MBS 488/561/633 (acquisition band: 500–540 nm). Cy3 was excited with 561 nm line from a DPSS laser and collected with MBS 488/561/633 (acquisition band: 590–630 nm). AlexaFluor647 was excited with 633 nm line from a HeNe laser and collected with MBS 488/561/633 (acquisition band: 645–755 nm). The acquired images were processed with Zen Black software by performing filtering, deconvolution and pixel reassignment to enhance spatial resolution. Images were analyzed using Fiji to count the number and size (Feret’s diameter) of WPBs and co-localization analysis Colocalization Finder for the generation of channel overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">4</xref>); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/plugin/analysis/colocalizationfinder/start">https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/plugin/analysis/colocalizationfinder/start</ext-link>, and EzColocalization for the calculation of Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/DrHanLim/EzColocalization/releases/tag/1.1.4">https://github.com/DrHanLim/EzColocalization/releases/tag/1.1.4</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sheng, 2020</xref>) was performed. For the ratiometric pH measurement, GalT-pHluorin was consecutively excited at 405 and 488 nm and the emitted fluorescence was acquired through a spectral slit of 510–550 nm. Mean emission intensities obtained from the identical ROI were used to calculate 405/488 ratio. pH calibration standard was obtained by using monensin-containing calibration buffers adjusted to the indicated pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grillo-Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2017</xref>). The ratiometric images were generated by the image calculator function on Fiji and the pH calibration data was applied to convert the ratio to pH.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>VWF multimer analysis</title><p>HUVECs were seeded and transduced using the same protocol used for immunofluorescence assay, except for the use of coverslips. On the day of analysis, cells were rinsed twice with endothelial basal medium (EBM)–2 without growth supplements or fetal bovine serum. After 2 hr of resting in EBM-2 containing 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, conditioned media was collected for 1 hr to obtain basally/constitutively secreted VWF. The collected media was mixed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer without reducing reagent and then loaded onto a ‘SDS–agarose’ gel. After separation, proteins on the gel were capillary blotted onto PVDF membranes and labeled with rabbit anti-VWF antibody (Dako/Agilent Technologies), followed by IRDye 800CW-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). The signal was visualized using the Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Normal human plasma (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany) was used as a VWF multimer control for each gel. Although we attempted to perform multimer analysis of the conditioned media collected on day six from shRNA-transfected cells, similar to the immunofluorescence (see above), we found that a considerable number of cells were detached from plates during 2 hr of rest. We believe that the depletion of the V0a isoform disturbs the adherence of HUVECs; thus, we used conditioned media collected from day 5 culture for the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We performed CBB staining of cell lysate to confirm equal loading of the samples in each experiment.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional

The claim that PKD is active in the shV0a1 cells is not supported by the data. Please measure PKD activity using more adequate assays (phospho-specific proteins etc) in the absence of V0a1. it seems that PKD in V0a1-depleted cells is predominantly at the Golgi. Therefore, detection of PKD activity by WB using the commercially available activation-loop Ab or an IVK should reflect Golgi activity. Alternatively, you could also use a genetically encoded reporter to measure PKD activity.</p><p>4. Provide a more thorough discussion including how pH and lipid metabolism (DAG, PI4P) might be related.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this work, the authors used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC cells) to investigate the biogenesis of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs). Since it is well known that an acidic pH in this compartment is crucial for the hemostatic function of its most important component – the protein von Willebrand factor (VWF) -, the authors investigated the role of a particular set of V-ATPase subunits in WPB biogenesis.</p><p>They reported that both the endogenous and the exogenously-expressed GFP-tagged V-ATPase subunits V0a1 and V0a2 localize to WPBs. Particularly, V0a1 appears to be found in peripheral (probably mature) WPBs, whereas V0a2 localized to perinuclear regions containing VWF (TGN/nascent WPBs). The authors then found that these proteins are required for the proper morphology of WPBs: when V0a2 is absent, WPBs formed at normal rates but present twisted shapes; whereas when V0a1 is absent, less WPBs are found in cells, and those that form are located at close apposition (maybe still connected to) of the TGN. The authors therefore suggested that V0a1 is a component required for the fission from the TGN of nascent WPBs.</p><p>Next, they investigated known TGN fission factors, and found the involvement of protein kinase D (PKD) in WPB formation. Specifically, when expressing kinase-dead (KD) mutants of PKD – which form long tubes connected to the TGN and enriched with cargo proteins (because of defective carrier fission) -, they found that VWF was included in those PKD-KD tubes, suggesting that VWF is a PKD-dependent cargo protein. It is not clear how PKD is required for WPB biogenesis, and what, if any, is the connection between V0a1 and PKD in this process. Interestingly, there's reports in the literature (e.g. doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00504.2008) that show that in the absence of PKD1, endothelial cells can still secrete normal levels of VWF. Finally, the authors suggested that PKDs present in nascent WPBs are enzymatically active because they reported that DAG and PI4P sensors are present on those membranes. However, normal levels of PI4P do not necessarily need to report an enzymatically active PKD, since, for instance, active PKD has been shown to reduce PI4P levels at TGN membranes (by phosphorylation of its substrate OSBP). Hence, it is not clear how V0a1 promotes WPB biogenesis in a PKD-dependent manner.</p><p>In summary, this article presents new data showing the involvement of V0a1 in WPB biogenesis, and reported the presence of VWF proteins in PKD-KD tubules. These results open new questions in the field, especially on the mechanism by which these two proteins control WPB fission, and if there is some interplay between them in doing so.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>As I stated above, I think the results are potentially interesting, but it is not clear to me what is the molecular mechanism by which V0a1 controls WPB biogenesis. The link with PKD is mild (as said earlier, there are reports indicating that PKD1 is dispensable for VWF secretion, which need to be cited and put in context of the present findings). Some ideas:</p><p>– V-ATPases regulate luminel pH. In the absence of V0a1 (or V0a2), is there any changes in WPBs pH? The authors reported that VWF still form multimers, but this only quite indirectly reports on the pH at the TGN/WPBs.</p><p>– About the involvement of PKDs: for the quantitation shown in Figure 5A (and related supps), it would help to count the number of WPBs in the cells expressing the PKD-KD mutants, similarly to what has been done in Figure 4B for the knockdowns of the V0as. And as said, put that in the context of the existing literature on the topic.</p><p>– Line 240-41: according to the data, both V0a1 knockdown and PKD-KD expression show a similar phenotype (fission defect). What is the connection (if any) between these two processes?</p><p>– Figure 6: PKD activity is assessed by the presence of PI4P on the TGN-associated VWF-positive buds. However, PKD is also phosphorylating OSBP, which reduces PI4P levels (actually, acute activation of PKD leads to less PI4P in the Golgi). There are other means to establish PKD activity (use of phospho-substrate antibodies, etc.)</p><p>– Lack of mechanisms or upstream/downstream organisation of the V0as/PKD in fission. Do V0a localize to PKD-KD tubes? Is V0a1 a substrate of PKD?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a nice story that merits publication because it addresses a long standing issue on the export of bulky WPBs from the Golgi. The involvement of VO-ATPase subunits and PKD pathway makes this process amenable to molecular analysis. My gut feeling is that trafficking of WPBs is likely related to the export of other bulky cargoes like the collagens.</p><p>The migration or trafficking of WPB's remains a fascinating challenge. The data on different location of VOa1 and VOa2 are very interesting. The question I have is whether there are different pools of VO-ATPases? Can the authors isolate ( immuno precipitate) two different pools of VO-ATPase; one enriched in VOa1 and another in VOa2? Or did I get this wrong and these subunits are not in complex with other parts of VO-ATPase.</p><p>The data on the PKD-DAG are very interesting, but I am a bit confused about the involvement of clathrin. My understanding is that DAG-PKD pathway is independent of the clathrin mediated cargo export from the TGN. Is clathrin found on PKD-Kinase dead containing tubules that are enriched in WBPs?</p><p>Finally, is this a budding event or is it that PKD-DAG sequester a part of TGN enriched in WBPs , while the unoccupied part concentrates cargoes exported by the clathrin pathway? The authors should explain this. It would be terrific to test whether a cargo destined to the endosomes/lyososomes is segregated from WPBs in the TGN.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The formation of Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), the secretory granules of endothelial cells, is driven by von Willebrand factor (VWF), their most abundant cargo protein. VWF is a large multidomain and multimeric protein that further multimerises in the Golgi complex after dimerisation in the ER, leading to the formation of VWF tubules that are packed into nascent WPBs in the TGN. The number and size of WBPs formed is ultimately controlled by the number of VWF quanta (VWF dimers fused together) formed in the Golgi complex. Importantly, the acidic luminal environment of the Golgi complex and transport vesicles is required for conformational rearrangements of VWF dimers, their tubulation and packing of multimers, respectively, and thus determines the WPB size. Since WPB size determines endothelial function, it is important to understand the mechanism underlying VWF tubulation and multimerisation. The multivacuolar (V)-ATPase-mediated proton pump consists of two large domains, V0 and V1, and continuously pumps H<sup>+</sup> ions into the Golgi lumen, contributing to the acidic pH of the organelle. While the contribution of V-ATPase activity to membrane trafficking is known, the V0a isoform involved in the formation of WPBs at the TGN has not yet been identified.</p><p>In this paper, the authors have identified two V0 isoforms, V0a1 and V0a2, to be associated with mature WPBs and nascent WPBs, respectively. By using confocal microscopy and biochemical analysis, they show that the two isoforms do not contribute to multimerisation of VWF but are instead required for biogenesis of WPBs at the TGN. Furthermore, they propose that downstream of V0a1 protein kinase D (PKD) is required for WPB membrane fission at the TGN. The paper thus sheds light on a potential function of V-ATPase V0a1 in WPB formation and adds important information on isoform-specific functions of this member of the V-ATPase family. However, while the data showing the localization to and involvement of V0a1 in the biogenesis of WPBs are convincing, the experiments on the molecular mechanisms, especially the link to PKD-dependent membrane fission, fall short and are insufficient to support the conclusions.</p><p>Figure 1, Supplement 3F: V0a4-EGFP shows considerable co-localization with peripheral VWF-positive structures, however, the authors do not pursue this finding further claiming that V0a1 and V0a2 are the pre-dominant isoforms located on WPBs. The authors should have investigated a potential effect of V0a4 to rule out that this isoform is involved in WPB biogenesis/transport.</p><p>Figure 4: The finding that V0a1 is found on mature WPBs but its depletion affects WPB formation at the TGN is exciting. To make their data more solid the authors should have investigated if and how the pH in the Golgi/TGN changes upon depletion of V0a1. For example, they could have used a pH biosensor.</p><p>Figure 5: The authors find that PKD family is involved in the biogenesis of WPBs. While these data are convincing the link to V0a1 is insufficient. Upon V0a1 knockdown more PKD is found on the TGN, which might indicate that more DAG is present. This is an interesting finding, however, not further pursued by the authors. The authors use several PI4P biosensors to show that PKD is enzymatically active. It is clear that there is increased binding of these biosensors to the TGN when V0a1 is depleted, however, many pathways besides PKD contribute to PI4P production and therefore additional evidence should have been provided.</p><p>Additionally, PI4P has been shown to sense the cytosolic pH and this impacts cargo sorting and trafficking. Acidification of cytosolic pH displaces PH domains from PI4P (Shin et al., Dev Cell, 2020). Given these results, the authors should have investigated whether silencing of V0a1 could also affect intracellular pH and thus the binding of PH domains to PI4P.</p><p>General comment: The authors make several references to morphological changes in WPB size and shape upon perturbation (e.g. Figure 3C). However, it is difficult to see these changes when looking at the images. In particular, in Figure 3A, the difference in VWF-positive structures between shControl and shV0a2 is not clear. Given the findings that number and size of WPBs might be affected by V0a1 and V0a2 depletion but mulitmerization and secretion are not impacted or even increased (Figure 3 – supplement 1) the authors should have considered to investigate VWF string formation as this is dependent on size of WPBs and VWF tubulation.</p><p>Figure 1: The authors use Bafilomycin A1, a specific vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor, to investigate the contribution of V-ATPase to WPB formation. They show that BafA1 treatment does not affect the amount basal and regulated VWF secretion in general but disrupts VWF multimerization. While the data shown are convincing they are in conflict with data published by Torisu et al., (2013) who showed that inhibition of autophagy by BafA1 treatment reduces the secretion of VWF from endothelial cells. Some discussion would be needed to clarify the discrepancy.</p><p>Figure 5: The authors could use published PKD activity reporters, perform an in vitro kinase assay, or measure activation loop phosphorylation of PKD via Western Blot analysis to infer on PKD activity in V0a1 depleted cells. Also, some discussion on how V0a1 depletion might affect DAG levels at the TGN would be needed.</p><p>General:</p><p>The authors should assess changes in WPB size and morphology using quantitative morphometric analysis of the VWF-positive structures (see Lopes da Silva et al., JCellSci, 2016).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;V-ATPase V0a1 promotes Weibel-Palade body biogenesis through protein kinase D-dependent membrane fission&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

From my side, although I very much value the new data provided by the authors, I am still not fully convinced that all the conclusions that the authors claim in this manuscript are well sustained by the data. In particular, in terms of the statement that V0a1 promotes WPB formation through a PKD-dependent membrane fission. I am still quite positive on this manuscript, but I still have the following comments regarding the new data provided by the authors:</p><p>– Main point #1: While I do appreciate that the authors have presented quantitative information of WPB size in their revised manuscript, I'm not fully convinced that presenting a only the measurement of the large Feret's is the best way to quantitate shape of the WPB. E.g. in pg 9 they say that for a twisted WPB, one would expect a shorter Feret's diameter, which is true if the WPB have the same size, but it is not a direct measure of &quot;twist&quot; (different Feret's could be caused by other shape changes as compared to twisting). Also, the authors do not present the total distribution of Feret's but otherwise the rather arbitrary % of WPBs larger than 2um. I think that the phentype based on the few images provided is clear, but I think a better quantitative analysis could have been performed.</p><p>– Main point #3: Pg. 10 the authors say &quot;In the absence of V0a1, WPBs 238 were unable to separate from the TGN, although the buds were formed (Figure 4).&quot;. I still am not convinced that this claim is sustained by the experimental data. Also, the new data on PKD1 overexpression is quite interesting. What about PKD2 and 3, have't the authors tested that? Is the high PKD1 expression an off.target effect (could the authors test it in the rescue experiments)? Also I'm puzzled on why the authors used an anti-PKD2 antibody in Figure 5supp4 and not an anti-PKD1, since they shown that PKD1 is upregulated in shV0a1 cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have put a lot of effort into revising the manuscript and have addressed the major criticisms. Particularly valuable in this regard are the experiments on intraluminal pH in the Golgi that support the hypothesis that WPB formation occurs at specific subdomains of the TGN. The experiments also revealed that PKD activity is not dependend on V0a1 and therefore the relationship between V0a1 and PKD activity remains unresolved. However, in my opinion, this does not prevent publication of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71526.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewer’s request:</p><p>1. Quantitative assessment of changes in WPB size and shape in V0a2/V0a1 depleted cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. To clarify the difference of WPB size and shape generated in the absence of V0a subunits, we have measured Feret’s diameter, the longest distance between any two points along individual WPB particles. Feret’s diameter is expected to be smaller if WPBs are twisted or in irregular shapes compared with relatively straight structures observed in the control. The data is shown as a percentage of WPBs of which Feret’s diameter is larger than 2 µm long (Figure 4B right). As expected from the confocal images, Feret’s diameter of WPBs in the V0a2-depleted cells was significantly smaller than those in the control. We also found that Feret’s diameter of WPBs in the V0a1-depleted cells were even smaller than those in the V0a2-depleted cells. We think that this represents the appearance of the rounded WPBs found in cell periphery in the V0a1-depleted cells (Figure 4A), although the WPBs accumulated around the TGN still retain the characteristic elongated shape. As the rounded WPBs were not that much observed when WPBs were visualized by the introduction of VWF<sup>D1-A1</sup>-EGFP and P-selectin-EGFP in the V0a1-depletion confirmed cells (Figure 4D,E), we concluded that they are WPBs formed before the V0a1 deletion is achieved. In regards to this, we have amend the text (Lines 195 to 199) and the corresponding figure legends (Lines 691 to 701).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Measure lumenal Golgi/TGN pH in WT and a1/a2 KD cells.</p></disp-quote><p>To respond to this comment, we have added new data introducing β-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1 (GalT), a well-characterized luminal TGN resident protein coupled with pHluorin, a pH-sensitive GFP derivative (GalT-pHluorin). This data has been included as Figure 3—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript. Bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A exposure caused almost total neutralization of the luminal TGN pH, while the depletion of the V0a isoforms resulted in modest effects. These observations are consistent with our data showing that V-ATPase inhibition resulted in the blockage of VWF multimerization, but the depletion of V0a isoforms did not (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), because the multimerization requires acidic pH. The V0a2-depletion resulted in a slight but homogenous pH increase over the TGN (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B). In contrast, we have found relatively high pH increase in some, but not all of the TGN subdomains in the V0a1-deplted cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B), although no statistical difference was observed when the whole TGN pH was compared (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). We think the impacts of V0a1-depletion in the pH regulation of particular TGN subdomains is interesting, because the main cellular pool was found in peripheral WPBs (Figure 1). WPBs were found to form a close contact with endosomes by electron tomography analyses. We think that this suggest a way how V0a1 is delivered to WPBs during the biogenesis, and the specific effects on some TGN subdomains suggest that WPB biogenesis occurs in particular subdomain of the TGN. In regards to the above results and discussion, we have amended the text in the results and Discussion sections (Lines 171 to 186, 320 to 322) as well as in the corresponding figure legend (Lines 844 to 853) and the Materials and methods section (Lines 446 to 452).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The claim that PKD is active in the shV0a1 cells is not supported by the data. Please measure PKD activity using more adequate assays (phospho-specific proteins etc) in the absence of V0a1. it seems that PKD in V0a1-depleted cells is predominantly at the Golgi. Therefore, detection of PKD activity by WB using the commercially available activation-loop Ab or an IVK should reflect Golgi activity. Alternatively, you could also use a genetically encoded reporter to measure PKD activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comments. As the reviewers pointed, there are several routes to supply PI4P to the Golgi/TGN other than the PKD-mediating pathway. So we agree that PKD activity should be evaluated by a more relevant assay in addition to the data using PI4P reporters (Figure 6C, Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,C). To see the PKD activity in the absence of V0a1, we performed western blotting using anti-phospho-PKD1(Ser744/748) and anti-total PKD1 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology) as the reviewers suggested. These data have been included as Figure 6–supplement 2 in the revised manuscript. The depletion of V0a1 unexpectedly caused an increase of total PKD1 protein, whereas we were unable to see any detectable changes of the phospho-PKD1 level compared to the control. As the substantial amount of PKDs was observed on the nascent WPB in the absence of V0a1 compared with the cytosolic distribution in the control (Figure 5B-E, Figure 5—figure supplement 3D,E), an increase of PKD1 protein in the V0a1-depleted cells may be explained by a difference in the protein stability dependent on the subcellular localization. Alternatively, it might be an upregulation of PKD1 expression by a cell autonomous compensation or unknown mechanism mediated by the V0a1-depletion. Because of the low endogenous expression of PKDs, it is hard to test whether the PKDs observed on the accumulated WPBs in the V0a1-depleted cells are active/phosphorylated or not. Therefore, although total amount of cellular active PKD1 is unchanged independent from the absence or presence of V0a1, we were unable to clarify the requirement of V0a1 on the PKDs’ activation/phosphorylation. Regarding the above results and discussion, we have included appropriate text in the result section (Lines 275 to 297) and the corresponding figure legend (Lines 914 to 918).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Provide a more thorough discussion including how pH and lipid metabolism (DAG, PI4P) might be related.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, V0a1 appears to be involved in the regulation of TGN pH. Although it is unclear yet if V0a1-mediating pH change triggers membrane fission of WPBs, we think that pH-dependent biogenesis of membrane-bound structures is feasible. We have shown that PI4P and DAG are observed in newly forming WPB buds; it is particularly prominent in the V0a1-depleted cells (Figure 6, Figure 6—figure supplement 1). As these lipids were not found in peripheral WPBs, they must be removed or converted into other lipids during the biogenesis, suggesting a dynamic lipid metabolism in WPB membrane. PI4P and phosphatidic acid, a lipid generated through single-step metabolism from DAG, are shown to work as pH biosensors in cells, and the pH-dependent interaction with particular proteins regulates cellular processes such as biogenesis of membrane-bound structures and intracellular trafficking (Shin <italic>et al., Dev Cell</italic> 2020, Young <italic>et al., Science</italic> 2010). Thus, we think that possible involvement of lipids and TGN luminal pH in the biogenesis of WPBs should be tested in the future. Regarding this, we have added a discussion (Lines 338 to 345).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:Major comments:</p><p>As I stated above, I think the results are potentially interesting, but it is not clear to me what is the molecular mechanism by which V0a1 controls WPB biogenesis. The link with PKD is mild (as said earlier, there are reports indicating that PKD1 is dispensable for VWF secretion, which need to be cited and put in context of the present findings). Some ideas:</p><p>– V-ATPases regulate luminel pH. In the absence of V0a1 (or V0a2), is there any changes in WPBs pH? The authors reported that VWF still form multimers, but this only quite indirectly reports on the pH at the TGN/WPBs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. We have measured intraluminal pH of the TGN where WPBs are generated. Please refer our response to Essential revision #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– About the involvement of PKDs: for the quantitation shown in Figure 5A (and related supps), it would help to count the number of WPBs in the cells expressing the PKD-KD mutants, similarly to what has been done in Figure 4B for the knockdowns of the V0as. And as said, put that in the context of the existing literature on the topic.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the WPB counts of PKD-KD expressing cells as Figure 5—figure supplement 3C in the revised manuscript. Thank you very much for the pointing the paper that was missed in the original manuscript. It has been cited in the discussion in the revised manuscript (Line 333-334, Reference #74). As we observed essentially same effects in all PKDs, we consider that PKDs are redundant each other in the context of WPB biogenesis as described in the discussion (Lines 327 to 334).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 240-41: according to the data, both V0a1 knockdown and PKD-KD expression show a similar phenotype (fission defect). What is the connection (if any) between these two processes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. As the fission defect phenotype observed in the absence of V0a1 was not rescued even by the induction of wild-type PKDs (Figure 5B-E, Figure 5—figure supplement 3D,E), we believe that V0a1 must be a primary factor required for the fission, although the connection between V0a1 and PKDs is uncertain yet. We would like to address on this in our future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6: PKD activity is assessed by the presence of PI4P on the TGN-associated VWF-positive buds. However, PKD is also phosphorylating OSBP, which reduces PI4P levels (actually, acute activation of PKD leads to less PI4P in the Golgi). There are other means to establish PKD activity (use of phospho-substrate antibodies, etc.)</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer our response to Essential Revision #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lack of mechanisms or upstream/downstream organisation of the V0as/PKD in fission. Do V0a localize to PKD-KD tubes? Is V0a1 a substrate of PKD?</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to see if endogenous V0a1 protein is localized to PKD-KD tubes; however, we were unable to obtain adequate resolution data that allows us to draw a conclusion, because of the broad punctate distribution of endogenous V0a1 protein in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:This is a nice story that merits publication because it addresses a long standing issue on the export of bulky WPBs from the Golgi. The involvement of VO-ATPase subunits and PKD pathway makes this process amenable to molecular analysis. My gut feeling is that trafficking of WPBs is likely related to the export of other bulky cargoes like the collagens.</p><p>The migration or trafficking of WPB's remains a fascinating challenge. The data on different location of VOa1 and VOa2 are very interesting. The question I have is whether there are different pools of VO-ATPases? Can the authors isolate ( immuno precipitate) two different pools of VO-ATPase; one enriched in VOa1 and another in VOa2? Or did I get this wrong and these subunits are not in complex with other parts of VO-ATPase.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. V0 and V1 sectors of V-ATPase are shown to associate reversibly dependent on cellular condition such as nutrient status; suggesting that V0a isoforms found in cells are not always in &quot;complete&quot; V-ATPase complex. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B, we found that V1c and V1A, common subunits in the V0 and the V1 sectors, are predominantly observed in WPBs in HUVECs. Thus, it is likely that V0a isoforms found on WPBs are in complete V-ATPase complex. Thus, we believe that there are two distinct pools of V-ATPase complex in HUVECs; however, because of the lack of specific tools/antibodies, currently it is hard for us to test the hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data on the PKD-DAG are very interesting, but I am a bit confused about the involvement of clathrin. My understanding is that DAG-PKD pathway is independent of the clathrin mediated cargo export from the TGN. Is clathrin found on PKD-Kinase dead containing tubules that are enriched in WBPs?</p></disp-quote><p>As PKDs are shown to be involved in transport carrier biogenesis of various cargos, we believe that careful approaches are required to respond to the comments. We would like to address on this in our future study. Thank you very much for your constructive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, is this a budding event or is it that PKD-DAG sequester a part of TGN enriched in WBPs , while the unoccupied part concentrates cargoes exported by the clathrin pathway? The authors should explain this. It would be terrific to test whether a cargo destined to the endosomes/lyososomes is segregated from WPBs in the TGN.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. We also believe that cargos destinated to endosomes/lysosomes are segregated from WPBs in the TGN. In the revised manuscript, we have included a data showing that V0a1 appears to be involved in the pH regulation of some TGN subdomains. We think that it suggests WPB formation in particular subdomains of the TGN. We would like to address on this carefully together with #2-2 in our future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Figure 1, Supplement 3F: V0a4-EGFP shows considerable co-localization with peripheral VWF-positive structures, however, the authors do not pursue this finding further claiming that V0a1 and V0a2 are the pre-dominant isoforms located on WPBs. The authors should have investigated a potential effect of V0a4 to rule out that this isoform is involved in WPB biogenesis/transport.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. As no suitable antibodies to V0a4 were available, we were unable to confirm whether endogenous V0a4 protein is localized on WPBs. Because of the specific phenotypes upon V0a1/V0a2-depeltion, we believe that V0a4 must have a distinct role other than the roles described in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: The finding that V0a1 is found on mature WPBs but its depletion affects WPB formation at the TGN is exciting. To make their data more solid the authors should have investigated if and how the pH in the Golgi/TGN changes upon depletion of V0a1. For example, they could have used a pH biosensor.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer our response to Essential Revision #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: The authors find that PKD family is involved in the biogenesis of WPBs. While these data are convincing the link to V0a1 is insufficient. Upon V0a1 knockdown more PKD is found on the TGN, which might indicate that more DAG is present. This is an interesting finding, however, not further pursued by the authors. The authors use several PI4P biosensors to show that PKD is enzymatically active. It is clear that there is increased binding of these biosensors to the TGN when V0a1 is depleted, however, many pathways besides PKD contribute to PI4P production and therefore additional evidence should have been provided.</p><p>Additionally, PI4P has been shown to sense the cytosolic pH and this impacts cargo sorting and trafficking. Acidification of cytosolic pH displaces PH domains from PI4P (Shin et al., Dev Cell, 2020). Given these results, the authors should have investigated whether silencing of V0a1 could also affect intracellular pH and thus the binding of PH domains to PI4P.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer our responses to Essential Revision #2 and #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General comment: The authors make several references to morphological changes in WPB size and shape upon perturbation (e.g. Figure 3C). However, it is difficult to see these changes when looking at the images. In particular, in Figure 3A, the difference in VWF-positive structures between shControl and shV0a2 is not clear. Given the findings that number and size of WPBs might be affected by V0a1 and V0a2 depletion but mulitmerization and secretion are not impacted or even increased (Figure 3 – supplement 1) the authors should have considered to investigate VWF string formation as this is dependent on size of WPBs and VWF tubulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the WPB size and shape in the absence of V0a2, please refer our response to Essential Revision #1. We did not perform any analysis of the regulated secretion of VWF including VWF string formation using shRNA-introduced cells, because we think that use of those cells makes data interpretation difficult. As discussed in the manuscript (Lines 204 to 208), WPBs are storage organelles; that is, once formed, they remain in cell until they are being exocytosed or turned over. Efficient reduction of target proteins by shRNAs requires time. Thus, it is likely that shRNA-introduced cells contain not only the WPBs that are formed in the absence of the target protein, but also the pre-formed WPBs before the depletion is achieved. Therefore, the regulated secretion from shRNA-introduced cells must include sum of VWF from heterogenous populations of WPBs. And also, there is a possibility that their response to exocytic stimulants might be different. From the above reasons, we do not think we can find anything relevant from the experiments using shRNA-introduced cells in terms of the regulated secretion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: The authors use Bafilomycin A1, a specific vacuolar H<sup>+</sup> ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor, to investigate the contribution of V-ATPase to WPB formation. They show that BafA1 treatment does not affect the amount basal and regulated VWF secretion in general but disrupts VWF multimerization. While the data shown are convincing they are in conflict with data published by Torisu et al., (2013) who showed that inhibition of autophagy by BafA1 treatment reduces the secretion of VWF from endothelial cells. Some discussion would be needed to clarify the discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your comments. To see the effects of V-ATPase blockage, we used HUVECs exposed to the V-ATPase inhibitors for up to 4 hours, because we found that relatively short exposure was enough to see the effects and that the prolonged exposure (16 hours) induces a formation of large vesicles/vacuoles that can be observed even under phase-contrast microscopy. In the paper, they used HUVECs exposed to bafilomycin A1 for 16 hours. So we think that the discrepancy is due to the difference in the conditions. In regards to this, we have added a note in the legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 2B (Lines 774-775).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: The authors could use published PKD activity reporters, perform an in vitro kinase assay, or measure activation loop phosphorylation of PKD via Western Blot analysis to infer on PKD activity in V0a1 depleted cells.

For that they can measure the two Feret's diameters (short and long) for each granule, and from there the aspect ratio (in this case, higher aspect ratio means straighter WPB, lower aspect ratio means more twisted).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comments. We have measured the longest (F<sub>max</sub>) and shortest (F<sub>min</sub>) Feret’s diameters of individual WPB particles to calculate F<sub>max</sub>/F<sub>min</sub> ratio as suggested. Frequency distribution of the ratio (F<sub>max</sub>/F<sub>min</sub>) as well as the longest Feret’s diameter (F<sub>max</sub>) has been shown as histograms in Figure 3—figure supplement 3 to present total WPB distribution. Obvious decrease in F<sub>max</sub>/F<sub>min</sub> is observed in WPBs formed in the absence of V0a2; indicating the irregular, twisted shape as seen in the images (Figure 3). Regarding this, we have amended text in the result section (Lines 201-206) and the corresponding figure legend (Lines 880-889). And we have removed a figure panel in Figure 4B showing a comparison of WPB proportions larger than 2 µm and the corresponding text (Lines 706-714).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Revise the text to be careful when claiming a specific role of PKD in this process.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comments. Because we observed that the induction of wild-type PKDs does not support the segregation of WPBs in the absence of V0a1 (Figure 5B, Figure 5—figure supplement 3D,E), we think it indicates a primary role of V0a1 in the membrane fission of WPBs, although the molecular link between V0a1 and PKD in WPB biogenesis is still unclear. To respond to this comment, we have carefully amended the text throughout the manuscript including the title (Lines 2-3, 29-32, 275-276, 316, 362-366, 728-729, and 765-771).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– provide a rescue experiment on the effect of V0a1 depletion on PKD1 expression levels because the authors do not use a second, independent shRNA for V0a1 depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comments. To respond to this, we have included new data in Figure 6—figure supplement 2B showing that a second, independent shRNA against V0a1 also caused an increase of PKD1 protein as similarly observed in the other shRNA. We also performed a rescue experiment by the induction of HA-Va01 as suggested, however, we were unable to observe any rescue effects on the PKD1 protein level. Because we observed the obvious rescue effects in the fission defect phenotype (Figure 4C), we believe HA-V0a1 must be functional in this context. We assume that HA-V0a1 might not be functional enough regarding the regulatory function of PKD1 protein level or alternatively the overexpression may cause something unexpected. In conclusion, as two independent shRNAs targeting distinct region of V0a1 mRNA (UTR and Tyr<sup>620</sup>-Met<sup>627</sup>) resulted in the similar induction, it is likely that V0a1 depletion itself causes an induction of PKD1 protein in HUVECs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors have revised the manuscript and presented a detailed response to the reviewers' questions and comments.

E.g. in pg 9 they say that for a twisted WPB, one would expect a shorter Feret's diameter, which is true if the WPB have the same size, but it is not a direct measure of &quot;twist&quot; (different Feret's could be caused by other shape changes as compared to twisting). Also, the authors do not present the total distribution of Feret's but otherwise the rather arbitrary % of WPBs larger than 2um.

Is the high PKD1 expression an off.target effect (could the authors test it in the rescue experiments)?
