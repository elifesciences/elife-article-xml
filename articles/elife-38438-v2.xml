Retroviral genomic RNAs contain a ‘packaging signal’ (‘Ψ') and are packaged in virus particles with very high selectivity. However, if no genomic RNA is present, Gag assembles into particles containing cellular mRNA molecules. The mechanism by which genomic RNA is normally selected during virus assembly is not understood. We previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comas-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>) that at physiological ionic strength, recombinant HIV-1 Gag binds with similar affinities to RNAs with or without Ψ, and proposed that genomic RNA is selectively packaged because binding to Ψ initiates particle assembly more efficiently than other RNAs. We now present data directly supporting this hypothesis. We also show that one or more short stretches of unpaired G residues are important elements of Ψ; Ψ may not be localized to a single structural element, but is probably distributed over &gt;100 bases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>virus assembly</kwd><kwd>RNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Comas-Garcia</surname><given-names>Mauricio</given-names></name><name><surname>Kroupa</surname><given-names>Tomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Datta</surname><given-names>Siddhartha AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Harvin</surname><given-names>Demetria P</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wei-Shau</given-names></name><name><surname>Rein</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural AIDS Targeted Antiviral Therapy Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Comas-Garcia</surname><given-names>Mauricio</given-names></name><name><surname>Rein</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The packaging signal in HIV-1 genomic RNA supports in vitro particle assembly more efficiently than control RNAs, probably explaining its selective packaging during virus assembly in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A retrovirus particle is assembled from ~1500–3000 molecules of the Gag protein, together with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Vogt and Simon, 1999</xref>), as well as smaller amounts of other viral and cellular proteins and a surrounding lipid bilayer. In a cell infected with wild-type virus, the vast majority of the released particles contain the genomic RNA (gRNA) of the virus, despite the fact that this RNA is only a minor species in the virus-producing cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). The selection of the gRNA for encapsidation depends upon the presence in this RNA of the ‘packaging signal’ or ‘Ψ', a region of ~200 or more bases near the 5’ end of the viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldovini and Young, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkowitz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comas-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Souza and Summers, 2005</xref>). However, the nature of Ψ and the mechanism of selective packaging of gRNA are not well understood as yet.</p><p>In mammalian cells expressing Gag in the absence of Ψ-containing RNA, the protein assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs) structurally indistinguishable from immature virions; these particles contain roughly the same amount of RNA as wild-type particles, but this RNA is a nearly random sample of cellular mRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rulli et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, recombinant Gag protein can assemble into VLPs in a defined system in vitro; while this assembly requires the presence of RNA (or DNA), virtually any single-stranded nucleic acid can support assembly under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Rein, 1999</xref>).</p><p>In an effort to understand the selective packaging of Ψ-containing RNA, we recently measured the affinity of recombinant HIV-1 Gag protein (lacking the p6 domain at its C-terminus) for different RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comas-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). We found that the protein has similar, very high affinities for all the RNAs tested when assayed at near-physiological ionic strengths. However, further examination showed that this affinity is the sum of both specific and non-specific interactions. Non-specific binding could be selectively reduced by mutating specific residues in the protein; or by adding a vast excess of an irrelevant competitor RNA; or simply by raising the ionic strength in the assay. When the binding measurements were modified in any of these ways, a strong specific interaction with Ψ could be detected. The salt-resistance of the binding of Gag to Ψ had previously been observed, using somewhat different techniques, by Webb et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Webb et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To explain how Ψ-containing RNAs are selectively packaged, despite the fact that Gag binds any RNA tightly at physiological ionic strength and any RNA can support assembly, we proposed that binding to Ψ leads to initiation of assembly more efficiently than binding to other RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comas-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nikolaitchik et al., 2013</xref>). We now present in vitro data that lend strong support to this hypothesis. This work also includes a preliminary characterization of the RNA sequences that are specifically bound by Gag under the modified assay conditions described above.</p><p>Gag has been suggested to bind specifically to several distinct sites in the 5’ region of HIV-1 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lever, 2007</xref>). These include an internal loop and surrounding bases in stem-loop 1, the locus of the ‘kissing interaction’ where dimerization of gRNA is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd El-Wahab et al., 2014</xref>); stem-loop 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amarasinghe et al., 2000</xref>); stem-loop 3 (sometimes called ‘Ψ') (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Guzman et al., 1998</xref>); and a series of very short unpaired stretches, each with one or more unpaired G residues, collectively termed the ‘Nucleocapsid Interaction Domain’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wilkinson et al., 2008</xref>). We tested several of these possibilities by introducing mutations into a ‘Ψ' construct and testing the binding of Gag under different conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>One important unresolved question is the exact sequence(s) which define Ψ. We measured binding affinities using, where not specified otherwise, the methodologies described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comas-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>), except that the RNAs were 401 bases in length rather than 190 nts. These RNAs begin at either nt 150 or nt 200 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and were labeled at their 3’ ends with Cy5. As indicated in the Figure, the mutants included individual deletions spanning either stem-loop 1 or stem-loop 3, and the ‘Multiple Binding Site Mutant’ (MBSM), in which all of the G’s in the stretches identified by Wilkinson et al. as the Nucleocapsid Interaction Domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wilkinson et al., 2008</xref>) were replaced with A’s. We also noted that these RNAs contain a run of unpaired G and C residues (nt 442–459) that may well be paired in full-length RNA, but not in our 401-base RNAs. To test the possibility that these bases contribute to specific binding of Gag to the transcripts, we also mutated these residues to A’s, both in the otherwise wild-type construct beginning at nt 200 (creating the ‘GC loop mutant’) and in the MBSM; this construct is designated ‘MBSM second generation’. In all cases, removal of bases by deletion was compensated by extending the 3’ end of the RNA, so that all the RNAs were 401 bases long. As a negative control RNA, we produced the reverse complement of Ψ, that is RNA complementary to nt 200–600.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38438.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the tested RNAs and their binding profiles to Gag measured by Cy5 quenching.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the expected secondary structure of the RNAs used in these experiments.

Results of these assays are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C and D</xref>, respectively. It is evident that Gag binds all the tested RNAs well in binding buffer. However, addition of yeast tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or raising the ionic strength in the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) strongly depressed binding to both iterations of the MBSM RNA, while deleting either SL1 or SL3 did not. Binding to the reverse complement RNA was drastically reduced under both of these conditions. These results show that the specific binding of Gag to Ψ, detected in these assays, depends upon some or all of the clusters of unpaired G residues called the Nucleocapsid Interaction Domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wilkinson et al., 2008</xref>), but neither stem-loop one nor stem-loop three is crucial for this binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). A similar mutant has been reported to be deficient in selective packaging in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keane et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As discussed above, we have proposed that genomic RNA is selectively packaged because binding to Ψ is particularly efficient at initiating VLP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comas-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, it was of interest to assess the abilities of the different RNAs to support VLP assembly. For these experiments we focused on the Ψ that starts at nt 200, the MBSM second generation and the Reverse complement RNA. Also, for these experiments on particle assembly, we used Gag protein lacking most of the matrix (MA) domain, as well as p6: we have previously reported that Δp6 assembles into VLPs with radii of curvature drastically different from those of authentic virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell and Rein, 1999</xref>), indicating that they are quite different in overall structure from authentic immature particles. In contrast, the deleted protein (‘Δ16–99 Gag’, also frequently called ‘ΔMA’) assembles into VLPs in which the lattice of proteins closely mimics that in immature HIV-1 virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briggs et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fäcke et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gross et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wilk et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We first compared the binding to RNA of Δ16–99 Gag with that of Gag. Our previous measurements monitored RNA-binding using the ability of Gag to quench the Cy5 fluorophore on the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comas-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). However, we found that Δ16–99 Gag does not quench the fluorophore; evidently, the quenching involves the MA domain. Therefore, we used microscale thermophoresis (MST) for monitoring binding by this protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, MST and quenching measurements give very similar results for the binding of Δp6 Gag to the Ψ RNA that starts at nt 200; at 0.15 M NaCl the K<sub>D</sub>s for MST and FCS were 14 and 17 nM, respectively, while at 0.45 M NaCl they were 256 and 302 nM. In all cases the Hill coefficient was greater than 1.0. These data show that MST is able to recapitulate our original FCS results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comas-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). MST data are presented in more detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. Interestingly, Δ16–99 Gag bound relatively weakly to all 3 RNAs at 0.5M NaCl (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

For example, at 11.25 μM Δ16–99 Gag, approximately ⅘ of the Ψ RNA has been shifted into the bottom half of the gradient, while only about half of the MBSM second Gen or Rev Comp RNA has undergone a similar shift.</p><p>These results are in complete concordance with our hypothesis that binding to a packaging signal nucleates assembly with particularly high efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comas-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nikolaitchik et al., 2013</xref>). Simulations by Perlmutter and Hagan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Perlmutter and Hagan, 2015</xref>) also demonstrate the quantitative plausibility of this hypothesis. The fact that when Gag is limiting, there is more assembly on Ψ than on other RNAs (shown here in a defined system in vitro), has also been demonstrated in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dilley et al., 2017</xref>); our finding that the same result is obtained in a defined in vitro system shows that this is a direct reflection of the interactions between Gag and the RNAs, and that other cellular components do not drive this phenomenon to any significant degree. The second important finding presented here is that the unpaired guanines within the first few hundred bases of HIV-1 RNA make a major contribution to the specific interactions between Gag and Ψ, as manifested in direct binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In fact, the contribution of these clusters of unpaired bases is far more important than that of either SL1 or SL3. Somewhat similar data have been reported by Webb et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Webb et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, these unpaired bases are critical for efficient VLP assembly, under conditions in which the protein binds equally well to all the RNAs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Altogether, these results support our hypothesis that Ψ promotes selective packaging of the HIV-1 genomic RNA by virtue of its distinctive efficiency in promoting particle assembly. The data suggest that binding to Ψ reduces the activation energy of the assembly process. We believe that this phenomenon explains the selective packaging of gRNA, in preference to other, cellular RNAs, into virions in infected cells. Experiments to identify a hypothetical nucleating complex are now under way.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Δp6 Gag <break/>expression plasmid</td><td>PMID 9971810</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Δ16–99 <break/>Gag expression plasmid</td><td>PMID 10619849</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Ψ150 RNA</td><td>GenBank: AF324493.2</td><td/><td>nt 150–550</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Ψ200 RNA</td><td>GenBank: AF324493.2</td><td/><td>nt 200–600</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>ΔSL1 RNA</td><td>GenBank: AF324493.2</td><td/><td>nt 150–180 joined to nt 280–650</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>ΔSL3 RNA</td><td>GenBank: AF324493.2</td><td/><td>nt 150–305 joined to nt 405–650</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>MBSM first <break/>generation RNA</td><td>GenBank: AF324493.2</td><td/><td>G224, G226, G240, G241, C243, G270, <break/>G272, G273, C274, G275, G289, G290, <break/>G292, G310, C312, G318, G320, G328, <break/>G239 of Ψ200 replaced with A's</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>MBSM second <break/>generation RNA</td><td>GenBank: AF324493.2</td><td/><td>G442, G443, G444, C445, G448, C449, <break/>G451, G452, G453, G455, C456, G459 <break/>of MBSM 1 st generation replaced <break/>with A's</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>GC loop mutant RNA</td><td>GenBank: AF324493.2</td><td/><td>G442, G443, G444, C445, G448, C449, <break/>G451, G452, G453, G455, C456, G459 <break/>of Ψ200 replaced with A's</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Reverse <break/>Complement RNA</td><td>GenBank: AF324493.2</td><td/><td>RNA is complementary to Ψ150</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Except where otherwise specified, all procedures were as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Comas-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). RNAs were produced by in vitro transcription of linearized plasmids containing the T7 promoter. All transcripts were 401 nucleotides long unless indicated otherwise and were ultimately derived from the pNL4-3 molecular clone of HIV-1. Numbering begins with the first nucleotide in the R region, equivalent to nt 454 in the DNA sequence. Specifically, HIV-1 Ψ 150 represents nucleotides 150–550; HIV-1 Ψ 200 contains nt 200–600; ΔSL1 contains nt 150–180 and 280–650; ΔSL3 contains nt 150–305 and 405–650; 1<sup>st</sup>-generation MBSM was derived from HIV-1 Ψ 200 by replacement of G224, G226, G240, C243, G241, G270, G272, G273, C274, G275, G289, G290, G292, G310, C312, G318, G320, G328, and G329 with adenines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wilkinson et al., 2008</xref>). The RNA transcribed from this HIV Ψ 200-derived plasmid would still contain a highly GC-rich sequence which would quite possibly be unpaired. To eliminate this potential source of unpaired G residues, we also generated the MBSM second-generation, in which the first-generation MBSM was modified by replacing G442, G443, G444, C445, G448, C449, G451, G452, G453, G455, C456, and G459 with adenines. This latter series of changes was also produced in HIV-1 Ψ 200, yielding the ‘HIV-1 GC loop’ plasmid. In some experiments, the negative strand complementary to the HIV-1 Ψ 150 RNA (‘Reverse Complement’) was produced by transcribing a plasmid in which the T7 promoter was at the 3’ end, rather than the 5’ end, of the HIV-1 ψ 200 insert. The inserts in all plasmids were completely verified by sequencing.</p><p>MST measurements were performed in premium coated capillaries on a Monolith NT.115 instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Nanotemper Technologies GmbH). Samples were incubated 20 min at 22°C after loading into measuring capillaries. All experiments were done with temperature control set to 22°C. LED power was 90% for Ψ and second generation MBSM RNAs and 50% for Reverse complement RNA. MST power was 20% for all measurements with 5 s fluorescence read before MST laser on, 20 s MST laser switched on and 5 s fluorescence read after MST laser off.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH, National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research, and in part with funds from the Intramural AIDS Targeted Antiviral Therapy Program.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.

The work extends the earlier results demonstrating both specific and nonspecific RNA binding activity by Gag, and the need for either high salt or high competitor RNA concentrations to reveal the specific binding. (The earlier paper includes much more theoretical analysis of the binding, and modeling of the electrostatics involved.) Based on the earlier work, most readers might have come to the conclusion that in vivo, high competitor RNA levels were present and could have explained the high efficiency of viral RNA packaging. However, the authors here provide additional support for their proposal that the HIV-1 RNA triggers virion assembly more efficiently than other RNAs and that this explains the higher abundance of viral RNA in the final virion preps. Here the binding curves are similar to before (Figure 2). The newer part is the sedimentation of assembled Gag constructs in the presence of RNA, measuring the rapid sedimentation resulting from coassembly (Figure 3). The specific packageable RNA is shown to induce particles at lower concentration than the nonspecific RNAs, and analysis of the Hill equation for binding suggests about a three-fold lower K value. While the electron micrographs of particles are underwhelming, the RNA results (Figure 4 and Table 1) seem to confirm the claim of selective assembly. The punch line should be of interest to the community. The new RNA mutants also provide some new information about what is required for the enhanced assembly.</p><p>One reviewer had some specific issues that need to be addressed. Their review is included in its entirety below. Their points are valid and deserve as detailed a response as possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript by Comas-Garcia et al. is a Research Advance submission based on the previous publication of Comas-Garcia et al., entitled &quot;Dissection of specific binding of HIV-1 Gag to the 'packaging signal' in viral RNA.&quot; The stated advances of the current manuscript are support for the hypothesis that encapsidation signal positive (Ψ+) RNAs initiate particle assembly more efficiently than other RNAs, and that unpaired G residues are important elements of the Ψ signal. The degree to which these observations are novel enough to support <italic>eLife</italic> publication, rather than publication in a more specialized journal, is a matter of question. The certainty of the results, especially as regards particle assembly initiation, also is a concern. Specific comments are as follows:</p><p>1) Figures 1 and 2A: The results concerning the potential importance of unpaired G residues to RNA binding appear reasonably solid, but have been reported in other experimental systems already (Keane et al., 2015; Rye-McCurdy et al., 2016). I also am troubled by the statement in the legend to Figure 1 that results are the means of only two independent experiments, and that &quot;experiments giving K<sub>d</sub> values differing by &gt;10% from the consensus values were discarded.&quot; It would be nice to know how many such experiments were discarded, and why they were deemed inaccurate.</p><p>2) MST experiments: My understanding is that MST experiments were not performed in the initial studies.

The degree to which these observations are novel enough to support eLife publication, rather than publication in a more specialized journal, is a matter of question. The certainty of the results, especially as regards particle assembly initiation, also is a concern. Specific comments are as follows:</p><p>1) Figures 1 and 2A: The results concerning the potential importance of unpaired G residues to RNA binding appear reasonably solid, but have been reported in other experimental systems already (Keane et al., 2015; Rye-McCurdy et al., 2016).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer notes that previous publications have also highlighted the importance of unpaired G residues to RNA binding, as we mentioned in the original manuscript. However, we would point out that the previous studies involved binding of free NC protein (not Gag) to RNA (Keane et al., 2015) and RNA packaging in vivo (also Keane et al., 2015). We previously showed that both MA and CA domains make important contributions to RNA-binding (Comas-Garcia et al., 2017), so that binding by Gag is not equivalent to binding by NC protein. Effects on packaging in vivo could, of course, be mediated or influenced by any cellular constituent; in contrast, our results show directly that the G’s are important in the salt-resistance of the binding of Gag to Ψ and in the efficiency with which Ψ supports in vitro assembly, in the absence of any other reactants. In addition, Webb et al., 2013(this would have been a more appropriate citation than Rye-McCurdy et al., 2016 and we have now replaced that reference with Webb et al., 2013 in the revised manuscript) did report that the binding of Δp6 Gag to a Ψ construct was less salt-resistant if 12 bases, mainly G’s, were changed to A’s; this “Psi-12M” is similar to our “MBSM” RNA. While the general conclusions about binding in Webb et al. are similar to those in our Figure 1D, we would also note that Webb et al. used a different experimental approach from ours: rather than assaying binding directly at different ionic strengths, they monitored dissociation of preformed protein-RNA complexes as the ionic strength was raised. As we discussed briefly in our 2017 paper, this approach assumes a linear relationship between [Na<sup>+</sup>] and K<sub>D</sub>, and could not have detected the change in the proteins’ binding properties as the salt concentration is raised. We have now pointed out their prior results in the revised manuscript (Introduction, fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also am troubled by the statement in the legend to Figure 1 that results are the means of only two independent experiments, and that &quot;experiments giving K<sub>d</sub> values differing by &gt;10% from the consensus values were discarded.&quot; It would be nice to know how many such experiments were discarded, and why they were deemed inaccurate.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer also asks about experiments that were discarded, as mentioned in the legend to Figure 1. Only two experiments were discarded. In one, an attempt to measure binding of GagΔp6 to 2<sup>nd</sup> generation MBSM RNA at 0.4M NaCl, no binding was detected, in stark contrast to other experiments. We suspect that the target RNA had been degraded. The other was a competition experiment attempting to measure binding to RevComp RNA in the presence of tRNA. This experiment was discarded because the binding curve failed to reach a plateau.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) MST experiments: My understanding is that MST experiments were not performed in the initial studies. Because of this, presenting some of the raw data on controls is of interest, as would be showing results with additional RNA substrates, and giving the actual Hill coefficients.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks that more data be included on MST, which was used in the present manuscript to measure binding of protein to RNAs but was not used previously. We have added Figure 2—figure supplement 1, which presents in panels A and B, the raw MST time-trace data for binding of Δ16-99 Gag to ψ RNA in 0.15 and 0.5M NaCl; in panel C, the superimposed cross-sectional profiles of the fluorescence in the MST capillaries, where the symmetrical curves indicate that nothing is sticking to the walls of the capillaries; and in panel D, the profiles of the individual capillaries (containing RNA + different amounts of protein); the near-identity of these profiles shows that the capillaries all contained same amount of fluorescent RNA. The results of the MST measurements are now summarized in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Ψ + RNA effects on assembly: The hypothesis that Ψ + RNA triggers particle assembly is a logical one, and has received support elsewhere. With respect to the current manuscript, the proof for the hypothesis has not been explained clearly. As I understand it, the crux of the proof here is that the Ψ 2 200 RNA binds Δ16-99 Gag in assembly buffer with the same affinity as the other RNAs (Figure 2B), but partitions more efficiently into higher S value fractions when assembled with higher concentrations of Δ16-99 Gag (Figure 3). The approach and results raise some questions and concerns:</p><p>a) Why did the authors have to use Δ16-99 Gag rather than the otherwise wild type Δp6 Gag?</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry that we did not explain this in the original submission. We found many years ago (Campbell and Rein, 1999) that the VLPs formed when nucleic acid is added to GagΔp6 are far smaller than authentic HIV-1 virions, and thus cannot have the same architecture as authentic immature particles. In contrast, Δ16-99 Gag forms particles of the correct size in the presence of nucleic acid, and extensive studies from several labs have shown that the overall architecture of these VLPs is an excellent facsimile of that in immature particles (Campbell et al., 2001; Briggs et al., 1993; Gross et al., 2001; Wilk et al., 2001). We have added a brief explanation to the revised manuscript (Results and Discussion, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Why doesn't Δ16-99 Gag quench the fluorophore in FCS experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not know. As we discussed in the original 2017 manuscript, the quenching of Cy5 by GagΔp6 represents stabilization of a non-fluorescent isomer of Cy5. We have also observed that free NC protein does not quench Cy5-labeled RNAs. These observations suggest that the quenching involves the MA domain in GagΔp6, but we have no further information on this. We have noted this in the fourth paragraph of the Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The Δ16-99 Gag protein binds significantly less well to RNAs at 150 mM NaCl than the Δp6 Gag protein (Figure 2). What happens when the ionic strength is raised, or yeast RNA is added?</p></disp-quote><p>We are now investigating the role of the MA domain in specific and non-specific RNA-binding. We have found that the binding of Δ16-99 Gag to Ψ RNA, as well as to the control RNAs, is strongly depressed at high ionic strengths. We have not yet tested the effect of competitor tRNA. As mentioned above, we have added a supplementary figure and a Table with the MST data for binding of Δ16-99 Gag to the RNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Figure 3: Please show deviations on the graphs. Please also state how many experiments were excluded because the positions of the peaks were different from the consensus profiles.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the deviations to Figure 3 (now Figure 4) as requested by the reviewer. Two experiments were discarded because the labeled RNA barely moved from the top of the gradient. We assume that the RNA in these samples was degraded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) Figure 3—figure supplement 1: This should be in the paper. I also see lots of spots in A, things that look like tiny rods in B, and a clean background in C. The particles in C also look smaller than in A and B. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks that the electron micrographs, which were Figure 3—figure supplement 1 in the original manuscript, be moved to the body of the paper. We have now made them Figure 3. The reviewer also asks for a little more information about what is seen in the electron micrographs. Our intention was just to demonstrate that the protein successfully assembles into VLPs under the conditions of these experiments. We have also added an inset to each of the 3 panels, presenting a VLP at higher magnification for greater clarity. Finally, the reviewer asks about the miscellaneous structures in these images which are not spherical VLPs. It is obvious that a wide variety of structures are formed and we have noted that in the revised manuscript (Results and Discussion, sixth paragraph). Finally, the reviewer mentions a “clean background” in C. We have not investigated this systematically as yet, but the reviewer may well be correct that fewer structures other than intact VLPs are formed on Reverse Complement RNA. We have noted this possibility in the aforementioned paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Figure 3—figure supplement 2: This should be in the paper. It also would be useful to see the Gag profiles for the incubations with all the higher concentrations of Gag. It would have been nice to have seen a shift in Gag.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks that Figure 3—figure supplement 2, the profile of Gag in the sucrose gradients, be included in the paper. We have now made it Figure 5. The reviewer also asks about the profiles obtained with higher Gag concentrations, where Gag is in even greater excess over the RNA. In fact the amounts of Gag here were so high that it is not trivial to obtain quantitative data on Gag in these gradients. The vast majority of Gag remains at the top of the gradient; this does not seem like useful information to us and we would prefer to omit these profiles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) Figure 3: What happens when an excess of yeast tRNA is added?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks about adding competitor RNA, such as yeast tRNA, in the assembly experiments. We agree that this is an interesting suggestion but have not tried it as yet.</p></body></sub-article></article>
