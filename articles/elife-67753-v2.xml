role in controlling cell fate. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the inactivation of E2F in either muscle or fat body results in lethality, suggesting an essential function for E2F in these tissues. However, the cellular and organismal consequences of inactivating E2F in these tissues are not fully understood. Here, we show that the E2F loss exerts both tissue-intrinsic and systemic effects. The proteomic profiling of E2F-deficient muscle and fat body revealed that E2F regulates carbohydrate metabolism, a conclusion further supported by metabolomic profiling. Intriguingly, animals with E2F-deficient fat body had a lower level of circulating trehalose and reduced storage of fat. Strikingly, a sugar supplement was sufficient to restore both trehalose and fat levels, and subsequently rescued animal lethality. Collectively, our data highlight the unexpected complexity of <italic>E2F</italic> mutant phenotype, which is a result of combining both tissue-specific and systemic changes that contribute to animal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>e2f/rb pathway</kwd><kwd>sugar metabolism</kwd><kwd>trehalose</kwd><kwd>triglycerides</kwd><kwd>proteome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM131707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frolov</surname><given-names>Maxim V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM117413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dyson</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The E2F/Dp transcription factors, which are key cell cycle regulators, can also mediate the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in larva by controlling both systemic trehalose homeostasis and fat storage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanisms by which E2F transcription factors regulate cell cycle progression have been studied in detail. The activity of E2F1 is restrained by the retinoblastoma protein pRB, a tumor suppressor that is either mutated or functionally inactivated in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyson, 2016</xref>). In the textbook description of E2F regulation, the cyclin-dependent kinases phosphorylate pRB, releasing E2F1 to activate the expression of genes that regulate DNA synthesis, S-phase entry, and mitosis.</p><p>This textbook model, however, is incomplete. Several studies have shown that E2Fs have additional roles that extend beyond the cell cycle. Notably, E2F can also act as a regulator of cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denechaud et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicolay and Dyson, 2013</xref>). E2F1 was implicated in global glucose homeostasis by controlling insulin secretion in the pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Annicotte et al., 2009</xref>) and it is needed to promote adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fajas et al., 2002</xref>). E2F1 and pRB have been shown to form repressor complexes on the promoters of genes involved in oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanchet et al., 2011</xref>), and E2F1 has been found to activate the expression of glycolytic and lipogenic genes in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denechaud et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, the inactivation of the RB pathway results in profound metabolic alterations, including changes in central carbon metabolism that confer sensitivity to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nicolay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reynolds et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The model organism <italic>Drosophila</italic> has provided important insights into our current understanding of E2F control. The mechanisms of action of pRB and E2F orthologues are highly conserved from flies to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van den Heuvel and Dyson, 2008</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2F family contains two E2F genes, <italic>E2f1</italic> and <italic>E2f2</italic>. Each E2F forms a heterodimer with the binding partner Dp, which is required for high-affinity DNA binding. An important feature of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> E2F/RB network is that Dp is encoded by a single gene. As a result, the entire program of E2F regulation can be abolished by the inactivation of Dp, either through a <italic>Dp</italic> mutation or in a tissue-specific manner by RNA interference (RNAi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frolov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guarner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Royzman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zappia and Frolov, 2016</xref>). Studies of <italic>Dp</italic> loss of function provide a glimpse of the overall function of E2F, a perspective that has not yet been possible in studies in mammalian cells that have far larger families of E2F, DP, and RB proteins.</p><p>The loss of E2F function, as seen in <italic>Dp</italic> mutants, is permissive for development until pupation when lethality occurs. This confirmed the general expectation that E2F/DP will be absolutely essential for animal viability. Surprisingly, hallmarks of E2F regulation, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis, were largely unaffected in <italic>Dp</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frolov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Royzman et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, the inactivation of E2F in either the fat body, which serves the roles of liver and adipose tissue, or muscles phenocopied the lethal phenotype of <italic>Dp</italic> mutants pointing to the requirement of E2F for animal viability in both tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guarner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zappia and Frolov, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The lethality of <italic>Dp</italic> mutants can be rescued by tissue-specific expression of <italic>Dp</italic> in either the muscles or fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guarner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zappia and Frolov, 2016</xref>). These findings confirm the importance of Dp in these tissues but, taken together, the results are puzzling: it is not known why <italic>Dp</italic> expression in one of these tissues can rescue an essential function provided in the other. Answering this question is complicated by the fact that the cellular consequences of <italic>Dp</italic> loss in the muscles or fat body are not understood in detail. Given the inter-communication between muscle and fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demontis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demontis and Perrimon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao and Karpac, 2017</xref>), it was possible that E2F inactivation in muscle might affect the fat body and/or vice versa. A further possibility was that defects resulting from tissue-specific <italic>Dp</italic> depletion might generate systemic changes.</p><p>To address these questions, and to ask whether the roles of E2F in muscle and fat body are the same or different, we examined the changes that occur when <italic>Dp</italic> is specifically removed from each of these tissues. Quantitative proteomics and metabolomic profiling of both <italic>Dp</italic>-deficient tissues revealed changes in carbohydrate metabolism. <italic>Dp</italic> deficiency in the fat body resulted in low levels of trehalose, the main circulating sugar in hemolymph, and abnormal triglycerides storage. Strikingly, these defects were suppressed on high sugar diet that also rescued the lethality of <italic>Dp</italic>-deficient fat body animals. Despite finding that <italic>Dp-</italic>deficient fat bodies and muscles share similar proteomic changes in carbohydrate metabolism, rearing larvae on high sugar diet had no beneficial effect on animals that lacked Dp function in muscles. Taken together, these findings show that E2F has important metabolic functions in both muscles and fat body and that the loss of this regulation, at least in the fat body, leads to systemic changes that can be suppressed by a high sugar diet. These observations show that E2F regulation is needed to prevent both tissue specific and systemic phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The loss of E2F/DP in the fat body does not impact muscle development</title><p>The expression of <italic>UAS-Dp</italic> RNAi transgene driven by the muscle (<italic>Mef2-GAL4</italic>) or fat body (<italic>cg-GAL4</italic>) GAL4 drivers specifically depletes Dp protein in the corresponding tissue, which results in two readily observed phenotypes. First, the inactivation of Dp in muscle is accompanied by severely reduced muscle growth in both larval and thoracic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zappia and Frolov, 2016</xref>). Second, fat body-specific Dp depletion triggers a reduction in fat storage and an increase in DNA damage response that promotes uncontrolled DNA replication and, ultimately, leads to the occurrence of binucleated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guarner et al., 2017</xref>). Given that the inactivation of Dp in either tissue had a similar impact on viability and caused pupal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guarner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zappia and Frolov, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), we asked whether Dp depletion in muscle may also affect fat body development and, conversely, if Dp deficiency in fat body may cause muscle abnormalities.</p><p>We began by comparing muscle structure between <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> and <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals. The ventral longitudinal 3 (VL3) muscles in wandering third instar larva were visualized by staining the body walls with phalloidin and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). As previously reported, the area of the VL3 muscles in <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals were significantly smaller than control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zappia and Frolov, 2016</xref>). In contrast, no differences were detected in the VL3 muscle area between <italic>cg&gt;RFP</italic> and <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> larval muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). To confirm efficiency of Dp depletion in <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic>, the expression of Dp was monitored with the transgene <italic>Dp<sup>GFP</sup></italic>, which expresses the fusion protein <italic>Dp::GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zappia and Frolov, 2016</xref>). Thus, we concluded that the loss of E2F/DP in fat body does not cause the phenotype observed in Dp-depleted muscles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The loss of E2F in fat body does not impair muscle formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal Z-stack-projected images of third instar larval body wall muscles ventral longitudinal 3 (VL3) (marked with white arrowhead) and ventral longitudinal 4 (VL4) from the segment A4 stained with Phalloidin, Dp::GFP, and DAPI. Anterior is to the left.

Since diet is known to impact metabolic phenotypes, we asked whether varying the levels of carbohydrates, protein, and fat in fly food could alter the lethal stage of these animals.</p><p>To properly control the food composition and the effect of nutrients, we switched to a semi-defined food, made of sucrose, lecithin, and yeast, as major sources of carbohydrates, fat, and protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Micchelli, 2013</xref>).

Interestingly, while the survival of <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals was unaffected by different nutrient composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> were highly sensitive to dietary changes. The increase in protein content had a negative impact on the survival of <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> and resulted in significant developmental delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left panel). About 83% of animals showed melanotic masses at larval stages when reared on high protein diet, and only 35% of third instar larva progressed onto pupa stages and eventually died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

However, reducing the content of protein suppressed the occurrence of melanotic masses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>) and consequently increased their survival rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The synthesis of trehalose occurs in fat body from glucose-6P and is regulated by trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (Tps1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elbein et al., 2003</xref>). We noted that the levels of Tps1 proteins were significantly reduced in <italic>Dp</italic> mutant fat body, along with other enzymes that generate glucose-6P including phosphoglucomutase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, and hexokinase_A in the proteomic datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Additionally, trehalase, an enzyme that converts trehalose back to glucose, was significantly increased in <italic>Dp</italic>-deficient fat body. This suggested that animals lacking Dp in the fat body may be defective in the regulation of trehalose synthesis.</p><p>To test this idea directly, trehalose was measured in hemolymph of <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> and control, <italic>cg&gt;mCherry-RNAi</italic>, third instar larvae fed either a control diet or a high sugar diet containing 16% sugar. Notably, trehalose was significantly reduced in hemolymph of <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> larva compared to matching control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) when animals were reared on control diet. Switching to high sugar diet significantly improved the levels of trehalose in <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> to levels comparable to <italic>cg&gt;mCherry-RNAi</italic> larva that were fed a control diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, the levels of circulating trehalose were largely unchanged in <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>The fat body is the principal site of stored fat in <italic>Drosophila. Dp</italic> mutants were previously shown to have lipid droplets of reduced and irregular size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guarner et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we examined the impact of high sugar diet on fat body in <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic>. Fat bodies of <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> and control larva were dissected and stained with BODIPY to visualize lipid droplets. In control diet, Dp-depleted fat bodies displayed smaller lipid droplet size compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, quantification in bottom panel), which is indicative of defects in fatty acid synthesis. Concordantly, the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, was significantly reduced in fat body of <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> compared to control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Musselman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pasco and Léopold, 2012</xref>), feeding control larva a high sugar diet resulted in significantly larger lipid storage droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). A similar trend was observed in <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> although the increase in droplet size was not as robust as in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, quantification in bottom panel). Nevertheless, feeding <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals on high sugar diet dramatically improved the lipid droplet size in comparison to control diet. This was further corroborated by measuring total triglycerides content at third instar larval development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The levels of triglycerides normalized to total protein content were significantly reduced in <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals reared on control diet compared to <italic>cg&gt;mCherry-RNAi</italic>. Moreover, the normalized levels of triglycerides were fully restored in <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals fed on high sugar diet. Thus, feeding animals with high content of sugar increased their lipid storage, as evidenced by examining both the lipid droplet size in fat body and the total content of triglycerides, and could, subsequently, contribute to rescue animal viability upon <italic>Dp</italic> knockdown in fat body.</p><p>In contrast, muscle-specific Dp depletion did not affect either the size of lipid droplets in the fat body or the total content of triglycerides in <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, respectively). The <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals reared on high sugar showed subtle changes although not statistically different from control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>, quantification in bottom panel). This suggests that the loss of Dp in muscle does not severely impair the ability of fat body to regulate fat storage.</p><p>Dp-depleted fat body failed to maintain the proper level of circulating sugar in hemolymph. Since glucose is converted into glycogen in both fat body and muscle for storage, we measured the level of glycogen in <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> and in <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>, there were no major defects in glycogen storage normalized to protein content in <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> and <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> compared to control animals fed either a control or a high sugar diet.</p><p>As mentioned above, Dp depletion in fat body leads to the appearance of binucleated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guarner et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether this phenotype can be suppressed by food composition. Binucleated cells were readily found in both <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> and <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> larvae fed a control diet, but the phenotype was not modified by rearing larvae on high sugar diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H–I</xref>). Since dietary changes suppress the defects and fully rescue animal lethality, we infer that the essential function of Dp in fat body is to maintain homeostasis of the circulating sugar trehalose and to regulate fat storage. The fact that binucleated cells persisted in the fat body of rescued animals suggests that the binucleated phenotype is most likely distinct from the metabolic defects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The experiments described here were prompted by a paradox: if Dp has tissue-specific functions in both the muscle and fat body that are essential for viability, how is it that restoring expression in just one of these tissues can be sufficient to rescue <italic>Dp</italic>-null mutants to viability? We anticipated that <italic>Dp</italic> loss in one of these tissues might cause changes in the other tissue, and/or that the tissue-specific changes might converge through systemic changes. Our data provide important new insights into the consequences of eliminating E2F/Dp regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Proteomic and metabolomic profiles reveal extensive changes in <italic>Dp</italic>-depleted tissues and show that the loss of E2F/Dp regulation causes a complex combination of tissue-intrinsic changes and systemic changes. The results described here show that E2F/Dp contributes to animal development and viability by preventing both types of defects.</p><p>It is clear from the molecular profiles that <italic>Dp</italic> loss causes extensive metabolic changes in both muscle and fat body. The profiles indicate that E2F/Dp participates, in particular, in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism in both tissues. Such extensive changes to cellular metabolism likely have biological significance in both contexts, but we know that this is certainly true when <italic>Dp</italic> is depleted in the fat body because the lethality of <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> could be rescued by increasing dietary sugar. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the fat body functions as a key sensor of the nutritional status and it couples systemic growth and metabolism with nutritional availability. The lethality associated with <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> may, therefore, stem from an imbalance between energy production and systemic growth.</p><p>Carbohydrate metabolism defects in <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> larvae are consistent with studies of mammalian E2F1 in liver and adipose tissue, tissues that metabolize nutrients and stores reserves of lipid and glycogen. E2F1 was shown to be required for the regulation of glycolysis and lipid synthesis in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denechaud et al., 2016</xref>). In﻿ adipose tissue, E2F1 was implicated in the regulation of PPARγ, the master adipogenic factor, during early stages of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fajas et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, ﻿the gene encoding for the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4, a key nutrient sensor and modulator of glucose oxidation, and ﻿6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase, a glycolytic enzyme, are directly regulated by E2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernández de Mattos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsieh et al., 2008</xref>). Our results highlight the conserved role of E2F/DP in regulating metabolism. A major function for the fat body is to control whole-animal sugar homeostasis. Interestingly, trehalose and glucose metabolism plays a key role in regulating systemic energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yasugi et al., 2017</xref>). Proper trehalose homeostasis is required for adapting animals to various dietary conditions, as evidenced by <italic>Tps1</italic> mutants, which do not survive in low sugar diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuda et al., 2015</xref>). The fact that the lethality associated with <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> can be suppressed by a sugar supplement that results in a trehalose increase, underscores the importance of E2F function for animal development, which was not previously appreciated.</p><p>In contrast with <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi,</italic> the lethality associated with <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> was not rescued by altering the diet. However, the appearance of binucleated cells in the fat bodies of <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> larvae demonstrates that the muscle-specific knockdown of <italic>Dp</italic> does have systemic effects. These binucleated cells resemble defects triggered by the loss of E2F in the fat body and are also seen in <italic>Dp</italic> mutant larvae. We note that the mechanisms leading to the formation of binucleates in <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals may differ from <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> and <italic>Dp</italic>-/- mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guarner et al., 2017</xref>) since they are not associated with a DNA damage response. Indeed, the binucleated cells in the fat body of <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals may be a symptom of stress; evidence for paracrine signals from muscle support this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demontis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demontis and Perrimon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao and Karpac, 2017</xref>). We infer that the tissue-specific depletion of <italic>Dp</italic> causes systemic effects in both <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> and <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> larvae, but it is particularly evident in <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals, which have a low level of circulating trehalose in hemolymph.</p><p>The level of circulating trehalose is a net result of the amount of trehalose released to hemolymph by fat body and its consumption by other organs, including rapidly growing muscles. The trehalose requirement of wild-type organs in <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals may provide an additional challenge to the <italic>Dp</italic>-deficient fat body to maintain trehalose homeostasis. Conversely, the reduced demand for trehalose by <italic>Dp</italic>-deficient organs in the <italic>Dp-/-</italic> mutants may shift the balance toward increased levels of circulating trehalose. Thus, one implication of our work is that the severity of the phenotype may differ between the whole-body <italic>Dp-/-</italic> mutant and the tissue-specific <italic>Dp</italic> inactivation.</p><p>There is growing evidence of the systemic effects that muscles exert in different settings, including development and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demontis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demontis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demontis and Perrimon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao and Karpac, 2017</xref>). Myokines are thought to be the main mediators of the inter-tissue communication between muscles and fat body, and other distant tissues. Here, we report that <italic>Dp</italic>-deficient muscle causes the appearance of binucleated cells in the distant fat body of <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> larvae. Our data strongly argue that the fat body phenotype is due to the tissue-specific loss of <italic>Dp</italic> in muscles as the levels of Dp remain unchanged in <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> fat body compared to control animals. This is further validated by lineage tracing, thus confirming the muscle-specific expression of the <italic>Mef2-GAL4</italic> driver. ﻿The <italic>Mef2&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals raised on high sugar diet may have a very mild defect, yet not statistically significant, in the formation of lipid droplets in fat body without an effect on global body triglyceride content. Maintaining proper homeostasis of triglyceride metabolism at an organismal level requires the orchestration of elaborated endocrine mechanism for inter-tissue communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heier and Kühnlein, 2018</xref>). ﻿Myokines and other cytokines communicate systemic changes in nutrient sensing status and energy substrate storage via cross talk with insulin and Akt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Demontis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Géminard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhao and Karpac, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Since E2F/DP proteins are master regulators of cell proliferation, the finding that <italic>Dp</italic> mutant animals develop to the late pupal stages and largely without defects was surprising. It also gave the impression that E2F/DP could be eliminated without major consequences. The results described here paint a different picture. The molecular profiles show extensive changes in <italic>Dp</italic>-deficient tissues. Indeed, 20% and 51% of the proteins that we quantified in fat bodies and muscles, respectively, were expressed at statistically different levels following tissue-specific <italic>Dp</italic> knockdown. The second conclusion of our work is that Dp inactivation exerts a systemic effect and may impact distant wild-type tissues, which was completely missed in previous analysis of whole-body <italic>Dp</italic> mutants and became only evident when <italic>Dp</italic> was inactivated in a tissue-specific manner. We report that <italic>Dp</italic>-deficient muscles induce mild defects in distant fat body, while downregulation of Dp in fat body results in low level of circulating trehalose, which is likely the main cause of lethality of <italic>cg&gt;Dp-RNAi</italic> animals. Thus, the <italic>Dp</italic> mutant phenotype is a complex combination of both tissue-intrinsic and systemic effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>DP transcription factor;

We extracted TMT reporter ion intensities as those of the most intense ions within a 0.03 Th window around the predicted reporter ion intensities in the collected MS3 spectra. Only MS3 with an average signal-to-noise value of larger than 20 per reporter ion as well as with an isolation specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ting et al., 2011</xref>) of larger than 0.75 were considered for quantification. A two-step normalization of the protein TMT intensities was performed by first normalizing the protein intensities over all acquired TMT channels for each protein based on the median average protein intensity calculated for all proteins. To correct for slight mixing errors of the peptide mixture from each sample, a median of the normalized intensities was calculated from all protein intensities in each TMT channel and the protein intensities were normalized to the median value of these median intensities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-3"><title>Proteomics analysis</title><p>A total of 6578 and 5730 proteins in fat body and muscles, respectively, were quantified across all experimental conditions.

From each of the vials that contained ~30 larvae, animals were isolated and washed twice in ddH<sub>2</sub>O to remove any excess foodstuff, outside unlabeled metabolites, or excess <sup>13</sup>C labeled glutamine. Then animals were collected in 1.5 ml tubes and the total weight of each collection of starting material was ~10 mg to achieve detection of unstable metabolites. Approximately 3 mg of starting material was sufficient for most metabolites. For each condition tested, metabolites were extracted from six to eight biological replicates of pooled animals from each genotype. Samples were then snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and either stored at −80°C for further processing or processed immediately.</p><p>Snap-frozen samples were kept on dry ice during extraction; 500 µl of −80°C MeOH:H<sub>2</sub>O (80:20) was added to each pellet. Pellets were homogenized by hand with a pestle using three to five strokes. Samples were vortexed at 4°C for 1 min and left at −80°C for 4 hr. After 4 hr, samples were vortexed at 4°C for 30 s. Samples were clarified at 20 K × <italic>g</italic>, for 0.25 hr at 4°C. Clarified supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 ml tube and stored at −80°C. Each pellet was re-extracted with −80°C MeOH:H<sub>2</sub>O (80:20), vortexed for 30 s at 4°C, and stored at −80°C for 0.5 hr. Re-extracted material was vortexed for 30 s at 4°C and then clarified at 20 K × <italic>g</italic>, for 0.25 hr at 4°C. Clarified supernatants were combined and clarified one more time. Combined supernatants were then evaporated by SpeedVac, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. Prior to mass spectrometry analysis, samples were resuspended using 20 µl HPLC grade water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>LC-MS/MS</title><p>LC-MS methodology was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nicolay et al., 2015</xref>. In brief, nanospray HPLC-MS was carried out with an Agilent 1260 Infinity pump coupled to a FAMOS+ autosampler and an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ionization source operated in negative mode. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using a negative ion calibration solution (Pierce 88324) and the optimized conditions were spray voltage 1.8 kV, spray current 2.1 µA, capillary temperature 301°C, capillary voltage −52.5, tube lens voltage −150, skimmer voltage −42. The mass spectrometer was run in full scan mode (80–1000 m/z range) with an R = 100,000 at 1 Hz (1 scan/s) with the use of the ion pairing reagent, Tributylamine (Sigma 471313). The stationary phase was a C18 medium (3 µm, 200 A) from Maccel. The LC method used was as follows: 0 min, 0% B; 11 min, 5% B; 24 min, 100% B; 30 min, 100% B; 31 min, 0% B, 40 min, 0% B. Injection volume was 1 µl. Flow rate at column bed was 400 nl/min. Buffer A: 5% methanol, 10 mM TBA, 10 mM acetic acid. Buffer B: Methanol. Raw data files were transformed and analyzed in MAVEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clasquin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Melamud et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-3"><title>Metabolomics analysis</title><p>For analyses of metabolite pools, the free portal Metaboanalyst (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.metaboanalyst.ca">http://www.metaboanalyst.ca</ext-link>) was used. Raw metabolite measurement data were converted to achieve a normal distribution of the data. For each metabolite, data were median-centered, then log<sub>2</sub>-transformed across the genotypes followed by autoscaling. Among the 258 metabolites, only 210 had at least three strong peaks (out of the 6–8 per group) in each of the genotypes. Analysis was done using data from the 210 metabolites that gave reproducible peaks above noise. Standard compound names were used and the compound pathway library was <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Following normalization, altered metabolite levels were functionally compared across all three genotypes. Only metabolites that were significantly altered in the <italic>Dp-/-</italic> mutant when compared to both the Canton S and <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> control genotypes were considered in the analysis to account for the variation on genetic background. KEGG enrichment analysis was done using metabolites changed up and down in <italic>Dp-/-</italic> mutant to determine what metabolic pathways were altered. Direct comparisons between normalized values of specific metabolites were done using Excel and significance was tested using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>﻿Image analysis</title><p>Muscle area in body wall muscles VL3 was measured for each animal using ImageJ.

The findings are significant in that they broaden our understanding of this important growth-regulatory transcription factor.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;E2F/Dp inactivation in fat body cells triggers systemic metabolic changes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce A Edgar (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The 4 points raised by reviewer 2 in their public review should be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although I found this paper ingenious and rather interesting, the mechanistic basis of the carbohydrate defects presented is not really addressed directly, and so the defects remain a phenotype of undefined origin. We can only assume that, somehow, E2F/Dp complexes are re-targeted away from cell cycle genes and towards carbohydrate metabolism genes in late-stage (pupal) fat body. Knowing whether this was the case, and what the mechanism of retargeting is, could be quite interesting. RNAseq experiments, combined with ATACseq, ChIP, or DamID experiments to map Dp binding sites on chromatin, could address this. Given that E2F/Dp complexes are transcription factors, it is surprising that such experiments are not presented here. It is also surprising that the probably earlier role of E2F in fat body and muscle cell division and DNA endoreplication is not discussed. Clearly, the decision to use proteomics was effective for understanding the Dp mutant phenotype and identifying the root cause of pupal lethality. Nevertheless, I'd like to encourage the authors to provide some data that would illuminate how and why Dp controls this carbohydrate metabolism program in the fat body, at the level of gene transcription. Is there a temporal switch that alters E2F/Dp target genes (from cell cycle control to metabolic control) at some time in development? What gives Dp this unusual spectrum of gene targets in the fat body?</p><p>A second question I had is whether Dp loss, in either fat body or muscle, impairs DNA endoreplication, and whether this might be the cause of the poor development and reduced size of these tissues (reduced muscle fiber size is shown). Perhaps these effects are detailed in earlier papers, but if they are, the data are not cited here. If data on DNA ploidy and cell size have not been presented before, they probably should be presented here.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study might benefit from authors reconsidering and rephrasing the interpretation or presenting evidence to deepen the current interpretation.</p><p>1.

Rad50 panel in Figure 2C under <italic>Mef2</italic>&gt;Dp-RNAi column is completely black, whereas there is back ground level staining observed in controls. Is this a representative image?

Figure 3, where they are using GRACE to confirm that developmentally the <italic>Mef2</italic> and cg drivers don't show over lapping expression is an important point. However it adds no new value to the storyline and is largely a well-executed control experiment. I feel it belongs in Supplemental figures. In Figure 3D-H, the color coding is difficult to keep track of amongst the figures and would recommend labeling the x-axis of these figures. This is also an issue in Figure S3B/E/G, where adding the genotype label instead of a color code would make the figures easier to follow.</p><p>4.

We don’t have any data on fat body tissue-specific data for E2F/Dp target genes, but muscle-specific data for both E2F/Dp and Rbf chromatin occupancy were published in Zappia et al. 2019, Cell Reports 26, 702–719. Our hypothesis is that there is no temporal switch since the complex can be found on both group of genes, cell cycle and metabolic genes. We are currently thoroughly investigating how E2F/Dp regulates the expression of some carbohydrate target genes. This is still work in progress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second question I had is whether Dp loss, in either fat body or muscle, impairs DNA endoreplication, and whether this might be the cause of the poor development and reduced size of these tissues (reduced muscle fiber size is shown).

There have been several attempts to quantify DNA ploidy in Dp-depleted fat body, but the results were inconclusive. However, in previous work it was shown that the DNA copy number of the under-replicated (UR) regions in the WT fat body were increased in the <italic>Dp-/-</italic> mutant fat body by analyzing the copy number variation using next generation DNA sequencing. Thus, loss of Dp in fat body increases replication within regions of the genome that are normally under-replicated (Figure 5F, Guarner et al. Dev Cell 2017).</p><p>Reference was added to manuscript on page 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study might benefit from authors reconsidering and rephrasing the interpretation or presenting evidence to deepen the current interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments of the reviewer.
