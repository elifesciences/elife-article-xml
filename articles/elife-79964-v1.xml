of fine appendages called branchial rays projecting from the posterior margin of the gill arch cartilages. We previously demonstrated in the skate (<italic>Leucoraja erinacea</italic>) that branchial rays derive from a posterior domain of pharyngeal arch mesenchyme that is responsive to Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling from a distal gill arch epithelial ridge (GAER) signaling centre. However, how branchial ray progenitors are specified exclusively within posterior gill arch mesenchyme is not known. Here, we show that genes encoding several Wnt ligands are expressed in the ectoderm immediately adjacent to the skate GAER, and that these Wnt signals are transduced largely in the anterior arch environment. Using pharmacological manipulation, we show that inhibition of Wnt signalling results in an anterior expansion of Shh signal transduction in developing skate gill arches, and in the formation of ectopic anterior branchial ray cartilages. Our findings demonstrate that ectodermal Wnt signalling contributes to gill arch skeletal polarity in skate by restricting Shh signal transduction and chondrogenesis to the posterior arch environment and highlights the importance of signalling interactions at embryonic tissue boundaries for cell fate determination in vertebrate pharyngeal arches.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>skate <italic>leucoraja erinacea</italic></kwd><kwd>pharyngeal arch</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>Shh</kwd><kwd>gill arch</kwd><kwd>skeleton</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>214953/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rees</surname><given-names>Jenaid M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UF130182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillis</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>URF\R\191007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillis</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG140377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillis</surname><given-names>J Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Pharyngeal arches form as iterative outpockets of foregut endoderm contact the overlying surface ectoderm, and this meeting of endoderm and ectoderm generates columns lined laterally by ectoderm, medially by endoderm, and containing a core of mesoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Graham and Smith, 2001</xref>). In fishes, endodermal outpockets fuse with the overlying surface ectoderm, giving rise to the gill slits and the respiratory surfaces of the gills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gillis and Tidswell, 2017</xref>). In amniotes, endodermal outpockets give rise to glandular tissues, such as the tonsils, parathyroid, and ultimobranchial glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grevellec and Tucker, 2010</xref>). The largely neural crest-derived mesenchyme of the pharyngeal arches gives rise to the pharyngeal skeleton – i.e., the skeleton of the jaws and gills in fishes, and of the jaw, auditory ossicles, and larynx in amniotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kague et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sleight and Gillis, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Couly and Le Douarin, 1990</xref>) – with mesenchymal derivatives of each arch receiving patterning and polarity information via signals from adjacent epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Veitch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillis et al., 2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couly et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brito et al., 2006</xref>). Pharyngeal arches are named according to their ancestral skeletal derivatives: the 1<sup>st</sup> pharyngeal arch is termed the mandibular arch, the 2<sup>nd</sup> pharyngeal arch is the hyoid arch, while the caudal pharyngeal arches are collectively termed the gill arches. In fishes, the gill arches give rise to a series of skeletal ‘arches’ that support the lamellae of the gills.</p><p>All jawed vertebrates belong to one of two lineages: cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, rays, and holocephalans) or bony vertebrates (ray- and lobe-fined fishes, with the latter including tetrapods). While the gill arch skeleton of both cartilaginous and bony fishes ancestrally consisted proximally of two principal gill arch cartilages (the epi- and ceratobranchials), the gill arch skeleton of cartilaginous fishes additionally includes a distal series of fine cartilaginous rods called branchial rays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). These rays reflect the clear anteroposterior polarity of the gill arch skeleton of cartilaginous fishes, originating along the posterior margin of the epi- and ceratobranchial cartilage, and curving posteriorly as they project into the interbranchial septum of each arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gillis et al., 2009b</xref>). Elasmobranch cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, and rays) possess five sets of branchial rays, associated with their hyoid and first four gill arches. Holocephalans, on the other hand, possess a single set of branchial rays supporting their hyoid arch-derived operculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillis et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of skate gill arch skeletal anatomy.</title><p>Skeletal preparation of an S33 skate embryo in (<bold>A</bold>) ventral and (<bold>B</bold>) lateral view.

As the gill arches undergo a prolonged phase of lateral expansion, Shh signaling from the GAER is asymmetrically transduced within the posterior arch environment, as evidenced by posterior expression of <italic>Ptc2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gillis and Hall, 2016</xref>) – a Shh co-receptor and transcriptional readout of Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pearse et al., 2001</xref>). This posterior transduction of Shh signaling, in turn, appears to underlie the anteroposterior polarity of the gill arch skeleton: in skate, branchial rays derive exclusively from posterior–distal (Shh-responsive/GAER-adjacent) gill arch mesenchyme, application of exogenous Shh protein within gill arches is sufficient to induce ectopic branchial ray formation, and targeted or systemic inhibition of hedgehog signaling using cyclopamine results in branchial ray deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gillis et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gillis and Hall, 2016</xref>). However, whether other signaling mechanisms function alongside or in conjunction with GAER Shh signaling to establish and maintain gill arch skeletal polarity remains unexplored.</p><p>Here, we show in the little skate (<italic>L. erinacea</italic>) that the ectoderm immediately adjacent to the GAER expresses several genes encoding Wnt ligands. These Wnt signals are transduced in the anterior arch environment in a pattern that is broadly complementary to the posterior transduction of GAER Shh signaling. Inhibition of Wnt signaling in developing skate embryos results in an anterior expansion of Shh signaling transduction, and in the formation of ectopic branchial rays in the anterior gill arch. We propose that Wnt signaling from the pharyngeal arch ectoderm contributes to the maintenance of anterior–posterior polarity of the skate gill arch skeleton by repressing Shh signaling and chondrogenesis to the posterior gill arch territory.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Wnt</italic> gene expression in the skate GAER and GAER-adjacent epithelium</title><p>In developing skate gill arches, <italic>Shh</italic> is expressed in the GAER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and branchial rays develop from a GAER-responsive domain of posterior arch mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gillis and Hall, 2016</xref>). To further explore the transcriptional environment of the GAER and to discover additional gene expression features that may contribute to gill arch polarity, we conducted a comparative transcriptomic and differential gene expression analysis of GAER and non-GAER regions of the first gill arch of the embryonic skate. Briefly, we manually dissected the (<bold>1</bold>) GAER and (<bold>2</bold>) non-GAER (control) regions from the first gill arch of stage (S)26 skate embryos (n=5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–Bi</xref>), and we performed RNA extraction, library preparation, and RNAseq analysis on these samples. For the GAER region of the first gill arch, we included the whole distal tip of the arch in our dissection to ensure that the <italic>Shh</italic>-expressing GAER and adjacent Shh-responsive (i.e. <italic>Ptc2</italic>+) tissues were captured for this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). Following <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assembly, we tested for differential gene expression between GAER and non-GAER tissues (after first testing for differential expression of <italic>Shh</italic> in the GAER region, to confirm dissection accuracy). We used a false discovery rate of 5% and no log fold-change (LogFC) cut-off to generate a list of 401 genes that were upregulated in the GAER region. We sorted this list for genes encoding signaling pathway components and transcription factors with a log-fold change &gt;2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Differentially expressed genes were subjected to functional enrichment analysis, and this analysis indicated enrichment of Wnt signaling pathway components in the GAER region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for enrichment analysis). Differentially expressed genes in the GAER region included those encoding the Wnt ligands Wnt2b, Wnt3, Wnt4, Wnt7b, and Wnt9b, the transmembrane Wnt inhibitors Kremen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mao et al., 2002</xref>) and APCDD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shimomura et al., 2010</xref>), and the secreted Wnt antagonist Notum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). We, therefore, chose to further investigate the involvement of the Wnt pathway in GAER signaling by spatially validating the expression of these genes, using the most highly expressed isoforms for mRNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization by chain reaction (HCR) probe design.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Differential gene expression analysis of gill arch epithelial ridge (GAER) and non-GAER gill arch tissues in S26 skate embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Sonic hedgehog</italic> (<italic>Shh)</italic> is expressed in the GAER of the hyoid and first four gill arches of skate embryos.

We further show that the ectoderm immediately anterior and adjacent to the GAER is a signaling centre that expresses several Wnt family genes and that Wnt signals from this centre are transduced preferentially in the anterior arch environment.

While β-catenin-independent (i.e. non-canonical) Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in epithelial remodeling during the early formation of pharyngeal endodermal pouches in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choe et al., 2013</xref>) and in maturation and morphogenesis of the zebrafish oropharyngeal skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rochard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ling et al., 2017</xref>), canonical Wnt signaling has been implicated in patterning of the pharyngeal arch-derived skeleton in multiple taxa. Blocking canonical Wnt signaling causes disrupted facial cartilage formation, including reductions of Meckel’s and ceratohyal cartilages in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2014</xref>) and loss of ectodermal canonical Wnt signaling in mouse causes loss of facial bones with hypoplasia of all facial prominences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Reid et al., 2011</xref>).

Our finding of a role for canonical Wnt signaling in patterning the gill arch skeleton of skate may, therefore, reflect broadly conserved roles for this pathway in pharyngeal skeletal development across jawed vertebrates, though with the skate’s possession of branchial rays offering a unique anatomical readout of anterior–posterior polarity defects that arise within the pharyngeal arch-derived skeleton in response to perturbations.</p><p>Our findings are also consistent with previously reported complex and context-dependent roles for Wnt signaling in the regulation of cell fate determination events during vertebrate skeletogenesis. In some instances, Wnt signaling functions to promote skeletogenesis: for example, in chick, misexpression of <italic>WNT5A</italic>/<italic>5B</italic> promotes early chondrogenesis of limb bud mesenchyme <italic>in vitro</italic> and delays the terminal differentiation of growth plate chondrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Church et al., 2002</xref>), and in mouse, canonical WNT signaling from cranial ectoderm induces specification of osteoblast progenitors of cranial dermal bone within underlying mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goodnough et al., 2016</xref>). However, in other contexts, Wnt signaling functions to inhibit chondrogenic differentiation or homeostasis. In chick, signaling through WNT3, 4, 7 A, 14 or FZ7 have all been shown to inhibit chondrogenesis <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rudnicki and Brown, 1997</xref>), while in mouse conditionally induced haploinsufficiency of the gene encoding the β-catenin degradation complex component APC (i.e. activation of canonical Wnt signaling) results in loss of resting zone chondrocytes and their clonal progeny in developing growth plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hallett et al., 2021</xref>). In the limb bud, genes encoding WNT ligands are expressed in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kengaku et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parr et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geetha-Loganathan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Summerhurst et al., 2008</xref>), where they function synergistically with fibroblast growth factor signaling from the apical ectodermal ridge to inhibit chondrogenesis of limb bud mesenchyme and to promote soft connective tissue fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">ten Berge et al., 2008</xref>). Downstream effectors of Wnt signaling are expressed out-of-phase with <italic>Sox9+</italic> digit progenitors in the mouse limb bud, with Wnt signaling functioning to repress digit chondrogenesis as part of a Turing-like mechanism that underlies periodic patterning of the distal limb endoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raspopovic et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings, therefore, demonstrate a striking parallel between developing skate gill arches and tetrapod limb buds, with Wnt signals emanating from ridge-adjacent epithelia functioning to inhibit chondrogenic differentiation, thereby ensuring differentiation of cartilaginous appendages in a spatially controlled manner.</p><p>We have previously shown that Shh signaling from the GAER is required for branchial ray chondrogenesis in skate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gillis and Hall, 2016</xref>), and that the application of exogenous Shh protein to the anterior gill arch is sufficient to induce ectopic branchial rays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gillis et al., 2009b</xref>). However, it is unclear whether Shh from the GAER is a direct inducer of chondrogenesis in the posterior arch mesenchyme, or rather induces chondrogenesis indirectly, via a secondary signal (i.e. emanating from the Shh-responsive epithelium or mesenchyme). We have observed that inhibition of Wnt signaling in skate embryos has no effect on the expression of <italic>Shh</italic> in the GAER, but rather results in an anterior expansion of Shh signal transduction in the gill arch ectoderm, which in turn, correlates with ectopic chondrogenesis in the anterior gill arch. This observation indicates that the pro-chondrogenic influence of GAER Shh signaling may be indirect, occurring via a secondary Shh-depending epithelial signal whose expression is typically posteriorly restricted by Wnt signaling from GAER-adjacent ectoderm. The Shh and Wnt signaling pathways share multiple downstream components (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ding and Wang, 2017</xref>). For example, components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway can positively regulate Shh signaling via GSK3β, by phosphorylating the downstream component SUFU and promoting the release of SUFU from Gli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takenaka et al., 2007</xref>), and by β-catenin affecting Gli1 transcriptional activity via TCF/LEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maeda et al., 2006</xref>). It has also been found that Gli3 may function as a downstream effector of the Wnt pathway and that Wnt signaling represses Shh activity in the dorsal neural tube through the regulation of <italic>Gli3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Medina et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, the Shh signaling pathway may regulate Wnt signaling through Gli1 and Gli2, with these factors positively regulating the expression of the secreted Wnt inhibitor <italic>frizzled-related protein-1</italic> (<italic>sFRP-1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2006</xref>). These mechanisms, or others, could account for the apparent cross-regulation between Wnt and Shh signaling that we have observed during the growth and patterning of skate pharyngeal arches.</p><p>Finally, it remains to be determined whether antagonistic ectodermal Wnt and endodermal Shh signaling is a derived mechanism of cell fate determination and pharyngeal skeletal patterning in cartilaginous fishes or a conserved feature of the pharyngeal arches of jawed vertebrates. In bony vertebrates, a Shh-expressing posterior endodermal margin (PEM) promotes the proliferative expansion of the second (hyoid) pharyngeal arch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wall and Hogan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rees and Gillis, 2022</xref>). In bony fishes, the hyoid arch gives rise to an operculum that is supported by a series of dermal bones, and this operculum functions as a protective cover for the gills that arise from the posterior pharyngeal arches, whereas in amniotes, the hyoid arch expands caudally and ultimately fuses with the cardiac eminence to enclose the cervical sinus and close the surface of the neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). Amniotes lack homologs of the opercular series of bony fishes or the branchial rays of cartilaginous fishes, respectively, but fossil evidence points to the operculate condition of bony fishes as ancestral for jawed vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dearden et al., 2019</xref>). Whether juxtaposed Wnt- and Shh-expressing epithelia influence fate determination (e.g. dermal bone vs. connective tissue) and patterning within the opercular series of bony fishes is not known. Further comparative work between bony and cartilaginous fishes with disparate pharyngeal skeletal architectures and tissue compositions will permit the inference of ancestral functions and interactions of epithelial signals during vertebrate pharyngeal arch skeletal development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Embryo harvesting</title><p>Skate (<italic>L. erinacea</italic>) embryos were obtained from the Marine Resources Center at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, U.S.A., were reared as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gillis et al., 2012</xref> and staged according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballard et al., 1993</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maxwell et al., 2008</xref>.

Third-generation mRNA ISH by chain reaction (HCR) was performed as per the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2018</xref> protocol for formaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, with modifications as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Criswell and Gillis, 2020</xref>. Probes, buffers, and hairpins were purchased from Molecular Instruments (Los Angeles, California, USA). HCR probe set lot numbers are as follows: skate <italic>Shh</italic> (Lot PRA753), <italic>Ptc2</italic> (Lot PRA754), <italic>Wnt2b</italic> (Lot PRE300), <italic>Wnt3</italic> (Lot PRG814), <italic>Wnt4</italic> (Lot PRE301), <italic>Wnt7b</italic> (Lot PRE302), <italic>Wnt9b</italic> (Lot PRE303), <italic>Notum</italic> (Lot PRG817), <italic>Kremen1</italic> (Lot PRG816), <italic>Axin2</italic> (Lot PRG818), <italic>Apcdd1</italic> (Lot PRG815), <italic>Col2a1</italic> (Lot PRB574), and <italic>Sox9</italic> (Lot PRB571). All mRNA ISH experiments were replicated, at minimum, in biological triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pharmacological manipulations</title><p>For systemic inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling, experimental and control skate embryos were reared at 15 °C in Petri dishes containing 50 μM IWR1 (Selleck chemicals) in artificial seawater or artificial seawater containing an equivalent volume of vehicle (DMSO) only, respectively. IWR1 has been used previously to inhibit canonical Wnt signaling in skate embryos by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref> and in shark embryos by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thiery et al., 2022</xref>. For these experiments, IWR1 was diluted to a working concentration from a 25 mM stock solution in DMSO. Skate embryos were reared in IWR1- or vehicle-containing seawater from S25 until S31/32, with drug or control seawater changes every 48 hr. Once embryos reached the desired stage, they were euthanized, fixed, and processed for whole mount skeletal preparation according to the protocol of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillis et al., 2009a</xref> or paraffin histology as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA-Seq analysis of differentially expressed genes in the GAER region</title><p>GAER or non-GAER (‘control’) regions of gill arch 1 were manually dissected from skate embryos at S26 using tungsten needles and flash frozen in lysis buffer using liquid nitrogen. In all cases, GAER and control sample pairs were collected from the same arch within the same embryos, or from opposite arches within the same embryo. RNA was extracted from each sample using the RNAaqueous-Micro Kit. cDNA was synthesized from extracted RNA according to the Smart-seq2 protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>) and libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina). Prior to sequencing, barcoded libraries were pooled in equal proportions and checked for quality, insert size, and quantity using Qubit 2.0, and Agilent2100. Sequencing of the 20 libraries generated was conducted by Novogene on an Illumina Hi-Seq-XTen generating 150 bp paired-end reads. The Cambridge Service for Data-Driven Discovery (CSD3) high performance computer was used for cleaning, normalization, quality assessment, assembly, abundance quantification, and annotation, as per <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirschberger et al., 2021</xref>. Raw reads were cleaned to remove adapter contamination using Trim Galore v0.4.0 (parameters: <monospace>--paired</monospace> -q 20 –nextera), for quality (Phred score 20) and minimum read length (149 bp) using ea-utils tool fastq-mcf (parameters: -q 20 l 100) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aronesty, 2011</xref>). Prior to assembly, all libraries were normalized using Trinity v2.6.6 in silico read normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haas et al., 2013</xref>) (parameters: --JM 100 G <monospace>--max_cov</monospace> 75). Trinity v2.6.6 was used to assemble the normalized reads (parameters: <monospace>--seqType</monospace> fq <monospace>--max_memory</monospace> 250 G <monospace>--CPU</monospace> 50 min_contig_length 450) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marçais and Kingsford, 2011</xref>). Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) was used to compare the assembly to the Uniprot protein database with an e-value cut-off of e-20 to search for sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>). Transcript abundance was estimated using Salmon, an alignment-free quantification method, via Trinity v2.6.6 utilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patro et al., 2017</xref>). A matrix was built for each of the libraries of gene-level abundance estimates (raw counts) using the Trinity abundance_estimates_to_matrix.pl script. MDS principal component analysis was used to check for batch effects and outliers. Individual embryo origin was a batch effect and so was accordingly accounted for in the additive general linear model. Differentially expressed genes between control and GAER tissue samples were identified using the edgeR_3.28.0 package in R version 3.6.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) using a generalized linear model likelihood ratio test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen, 2008</xref>) using a false discovery rate of 5% and no log fold-change (LogFC) cut-off. See supplementary information for assembly statistics, differential expression analysis, and all R scripts used.</p><p>Significantly upregulated genes in the S26 GAER tissue (logFC &gt;2, FDR &lt;0.05) were extracted and annotated using blastx sequence similarity searches against the Swissprot/Uniprot database (taxid: <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>). Annotation IDs were inputted into the STRING (v11.5) webserver and tested for predicted protein-protein interactions. In the protein-protein interaction analysis, line thickness was set to show confidence, and a medium confidence threshold was set. The interaction network was then tested for functional enrichment against a series of databases (Gene Ontology Biological Process, KEGG Pathways, WikiPathways, Pfam Domains, and InterPro Domains) using the default whole genome as the background. Results from the functional enrichment were downloaded and Rstudio (GGplot2) was used to generate dot plots to visualize the most significantly enriched terms.</p><p>Differentially upregulated genes with a log-fold change over two were manually screened for genes involved in known signaling pathways and transcription factors to generate a list for candidate gene validation by ISH. Wnt family members were highly upregulated in the GAER region so were validated as candidate markers for this region through third-generation ISH. Transcripts for probes in skate were based on the most highly expressed isoforms.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Imaging and figure preparation</title><p>Images were taken on a Zeiss Axioscope.A1 compound microscope with a Zeiss colibri 7 fluorescence LED light source using a Zeiss Axiocam 305 color or 503 mono camera and ZenPro software or a Leica M165FC stereomicroscope, a Leica DFC7000 T camera and LAS X software.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Wnt signalling, cell fate determination and anteroposterior polarity of the skate gill arch skeleton&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Megan G Davey as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ruth Williams (Reviewer #2); Shawn A. Hallett (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper requires significant re–writing in order to improve its accessibility, including combining figures and reducing the number of figures; shortening and improving the introduction; improving figure annotation (scale bars, labelling, etc) and improving summary figures; addition of key missing references i.e. Wnt signaling in the developing zebrafish craniofacial complex (10.1038/s41598–021–85415–y, 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.11.016, 10.1242/dev.137000); justification of the selection of Ptch2 and Dusp6 as downstream markers of Shh and Fgf8; improved recording of statistical methods and acknowledgment of how tissues were correctly dissected. Please reference the extensive suggestions from all the reviewers.</p><p>2) While I do not think that additional wet experimental work beyond that supporting the current data is required, there is wet work that should be undertaken to support current data and which may benefit the authors and allow them to reduce the complexity of the figures. Including–</p><p>– Expression data validating the molecular profile of &quot;mesoderm&quot; cells should be included.</p><p>– Histologic evidence that the tissues they are isolating are truly what they appear to be. For example, following manual dissection of similarly staged samples, remaining tissue should be stained with markers for the GAER versus non–GAER.</p><p>– Multiplexed HCR RNA in situ hybridisation, in order to fully explore co–localisation of genes expressed in the GAER and non–GAER tissues i.e. SHH and FGF8.</p><p>– In addition, to support the transcriptomic approach, it would be an improvement to see the expression of other components of the FGF and WNT signalling pathways, such as Wnt2b, Wnt3, Wnt4, and Wnt9b, FGF receptors, 1/2/3.</p><p>– Multiplexed HCR RNA in situ hybridisation to underpin findings from the transcriptomics, for example, gene expression of tissue–specific transcription factors would also significantly lift the paper, but it is acknowledged that tissues, time, and expense may prevent this.</p><p>3) If available for the little skate, the authors should perform KEGG analysis and gene ontology of data from the transcriptomic data set.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I like your paper but it was overly complex. Not many people understand the branchial arch formation and even less the nuances of gill arch anatomy and the difference between cartilaginous and non–cartilaginous fishes. I feel your Intro is really bogged down in the complexities of cartilaginous and non–cartilaginous fishes and gill arches – whereas your premise is really pretty simple. &quot;These signalling pathways work together to make a conserved patterned structure&quot;. Basically, spell out what the interesting point of the paper is, and frame the question. And why skate? At present, it is overly complex.</p><p>To improve the paper I think an intro with some back–to–basics would help considerably. If you need the reader to understand the differences between the ancestral condition, cartilaginous Vs bony fish gill arches, then perhaps consider an intro drawing showing this, highlighting the pattern you are interested in. I would also add an intro figure outlining your hypothesis – perhaps something like Figure 5Bi or Fig10, showing the signalling centres, rather than the factors they express. Do you actually need a drawn figure which compares chicken and skate tissues and signalling centres?</p><p>Also, I think there are some incorrect sentences in places, which make the paper confusing, I assume they are just editing mistakes but do make the paper tricky to read e.g.</p><p>&quot;All jawed vertebrates belong to one of two lineages: cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, rays, and holocephalans) or bony fishes (ray– and lobe–fined fishes…)&quot; But not all jawed vertebrates are fish (?)</p><p>250 The epithelium of vertebrate pharyngeal arches derives from both ectoderm and endoderm, and the specific tissue origin of the GAER of cartilaginous fishes is not known.&quot;</p><p>But isn't a cartilaginous fish a vertebrate? And the GAER is the epithelium of a branchial arch–derived structure– so should be from ectoderm and endoderm? I appreciate this might not have been shown but your sentence is confusing. Should it be &quot;The epithelium of vertebrate pharyngeal arches derives from both ectoderm and endoderm? While this suggests the specific tissue origin of the GAER of cartilaginous fishes is probably ectoderm and endoderm this has not been shown.&quot;?</p><p>Figure1 is beautiful – but really needs annotation. In A', I presume we are looking at the gill arch? In B' Would be better to annotate which are the branchial rays, the epibranchial cartilage, and the ceratobranchial cartilages. And how the branchial arches are polarised. Obvious to you, I'm sure. But not so much to the rest of us.</p><p>Figure3 – label the endoderm for clarity.</p><p>I think the fate mapping data and gene expression data for the chick PEM would be better in the main text to better support your conclusion that &quot;These findings demonstrate that the skate GAER and chick PEM share embryonic tissue origins and expression patterns of signalling molecules through development and are therefore homologous and an ancestral feature of the pharyngeal arche(s) of jawed vertebrates.&quot;, although it does make me wonder why, if the structures are homologous that you didn't use the chick more…or at least test your Wnt hypothesis in the chick with IWR1 treatment.</p><p>I would recommend publication but I think you should re–write in a style that is easier to understand and perhaps reorganise your data to show chicken and ray side by side.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Very nice work. An interesting read. I just have a few specific comments about the presentation of the figures below. If feasible, it would be very nice to see HCR used to its potential for multiplexing, this would condense the figures and therefore improve flow, and indeed the overall length – which at 10 figures is off–putting from the outset.</p><p>I've also commented that RNA–seq on treated embryos, more specific Wnt modulation, and equivalent experiments in chicks would be nice. I understand these are expensive, and in the case of the treatment regime, time–consuming, so perhaps something for a 'research advance' on this work.</p><p>And just a general comment/thought, going forward, it would be interesting to find out if there is a tissue–specific enhancer for Shh in the GAER, similar to that in the limb bud and pectoral fin. This would provide a valuable tool to drive tissue–specific gene manipulation and also isolate this specific cell population.</p><p>Figure 1: Please help the reader by orientating what is shown in B. Where is this in A? Please provide a scale bar here too. In panel C, the legend is not clear, do the asterisks label the hyoid and gill arches, or just gill arches – but 5 asterisks are present and only 4–gill arches are mentioned in the legend? Maybe label the hyoid differently to be clear. Also, is Shh expressed in a lower jaw structure? In panel D, please annotate A/P and D/V orientation. Ideally, an additional gill arch marker should be shown to demonstrate the posterior regionalisation of Shh. HCR would also give a better resolution.</p><p>Figure 2: Please label the A–P axis on the figures, as mentioned in the legend. This is actually lacking throughout the figures and would be very helpful to include.</p><p>Figure 3/4: It would look much nicer if Shh and Fgf8 co–expression at S22 and S29 were also shown by HCR in figure 4, making one concise in situ figure instead of two. Also, co–expression of all 4 markers Shh, Fgf8, Ptc2, and Dusp6 could be shown in one HCR experiment. On the HCR images, please show the outline of the gill arches with a white dotted line, as figure 2C.</p><p>Figure 2 supplement 1: I think it would read better if the chick lineage tracing section came immediately after the skate lineage tracing. In panel A, it would be useful to indicate the location of a whole embryo in this section is taken at. Ideally, Shh HCR should be shown on the same embryo with CCFSE staining, or is this not possible of CCFSE–treated embryos? I think this figure could be merged with the main figure 2. For example, panel E can be removed and only E' is needed. E&quot;, Ei, and Ei' are not necessary, this labelling is not logical and they are not referred to in the legend. In main figure 2, panel C is not necessary, so I think these can be easily combined.</p><p>It seems only 24–31% of embryos injected with DiI had the same labelling in the GAER, is this proportion expected with DiI labelling?</p><p>Figure 3 supplement 1: It seems this is more a supplemental figure for figure 2 since it pertains more to the lineage tracing. I think the U panel of HCRs could join a new combined figure of Figure 2 and Figure 2 supplement 1.</p><p>In figure 3 supplement 1, panels B, G, L, and Q need to have more structures labelled, as described in the legend. These in situs would be so much clearer by multiplexed HCR.</p><p>Figure 5: Did you do gene ontology analysis for the upregulated genes? What were the general pathways that were potentially perturbed, do you see Wnt signalling for example? Also, can you tie this in better with the in situs shown in previous figures, eg do you see Shh, Dusp6, Ptc2, and Fgf8 upregulated in the GAER?</p><p>Figure 6: Did you observe any general phenotype on the IWR1 and DMSO treated embryos? I see now in figure 8, that the embryos are very deformed. Perhaps you can comment on the general phenotype and broad range effects of the IWR1 treatment.</p><p>Please show the Shh expression in green, not just the green dotted line. If this clouds the magenta signal of the Wnt molecules please show separate colours in different panels.</p><p>Did you use HCR to validate any of the transcription factors?</p><p>It would be most useful to conduct RNA–seq on GAER dissections from IWR1 treated embryos. But not essential for revision.</p><p>Did you attempt a more specific disruption of Wnt signalling by way of CRISPR mutation? Also, did you examine the effects of disrupted Wnt signalling on the chick PEM?</p><p>Figure 7: Please label A–P. How many sections were examined from each embryo? How were Ptc+ cells counted, how did you define a cell, and did you use a membrane stain or Dapi? In the figure legend, please quote the t–test result correctly, eg what are the degrees of freedom and t statistics.</p><p>Figure 9: This is a very interesting specific phenotype in an otherwise broadly affected 'mutant'. Were <italic>Sox9</italic> and Col2a1 expression examined at earlier stages? Please quote the embryo stage in the legend.</p><p>Figure 10: This is a very nice schematic summary of the key findings presented here, but please annotate further eg A/P, D/V, label GAER, and surrounding tissues. It would be very useful to include this schematic in figure 1 to give the reader better orientation of the tissues from the outset, then use the same schematic in figure 10 to show your findings. A similar schematic of the chick PEM would also help to demonstrate the similarities between these tissues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Although it may be useful to orient the reader, Figure 1 is largely extraneous and unnecessary as there have been several studies cited that provide the same expression data.</p><p>– Figure 3. Although histologically one can discern between the epidermal–mesodermal boundary, some expression data validating the molecular profile of &quot;mesoderm&quot; cells should be included.</p><p>– Figure 4. Additional justification in the text should be included to inform the reader of the selection of Ptch2 and Dusp6 as downstream markers of Shh and Fgf8, respectively.</p><p>– Figure 4. The authors should assess expression domains of the FGF receptors, 1/2/3, as they have been shown to be critically important in chondrogenesis in other models and to discern the target of Fgf8.</p><p>– Figure 4. Additional literature review highlighting the potential differential roles of other FGF ligands in brachial arch formation should be included in the text and potentially assessed on an mRNA level histologically.</p><p>– Figure 5. How do the authors differentiate cell types during their isolation method in preparation for transcriptomic analysis? To be sure of the accuracy of their methods, the authors should provide histologic evidence that the tissues they are isolating are truly what they appear to be. For example, following manual dissection of similarly staged samples, remaining tissue should be stained with markers for the GAER versus non–GAER.</p><p>– Figure 5. If available for the little skate, the authors should perform KEGG analysis on transcriptomes of their data set.</p><p>– Figure 6. If mRNA transcripts of Wnt2b, Wnt3, Wnt4, and Wnt9b are truly restricted to non–GAER regions, the authors should provide more conclusive evidence, for example by co–staining these sections with Shh. The current diagram seems slightly arbitrary, as the GAER location may vary across tissue sections.</p><p>– Figure 9. It would be interesting to further elucidate the state of the <italic>Sox9</italic>/Col2a1–expressing. A more extensive analysis of gene expression profiles would be important to further explain the ectopic brachial arch phenotype (e.g. Pthrp, Ihh, Col10).</p><p>– Discussion. Several papers have explored the role of Wnt signaling in the developing zebrafish craniofacial complex (10.1038/s41598-021-85415-y, 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.11.016, 10.1242/dev.137000). These should be considered and included.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your study entitled &quot;Ectodermal Wnt signalling, cell fate determination and polarity of the skate gill arch skeleton&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The reviewers are all in agreement that the manuscript has been improved and merits acceptance based on scientific merit but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. These are primarily to make the paper accessible. My feeling is that Figure 1 is overly complex and, as it is primarily an introduction figure, could be improved and/or reduced and combined with Figure 2.</p><p>Figure1 problems–</p><p>The panels are not in the same orientation, which makes it confusing to the reader.</p><p>– Figure 1A is a very stunning picture– but it does not explain the gill arch anatomy in relation to the brachial ray anatomy. It would be better to have a drawn picture I think.</p><p>– Figure 1A'. Not mentioned in the figure legend.</p><p>– Figure 1B– this is the Anterior–posterior polarity the paper is focused on, but to the uninitiated, what the polarity is in the figure, is unclear and isn't easy to associate with the text. There is no A–P marked in this panel. Is this figure really the same orientation as A and A'? I don't understand the orientation of these samples at all, doesn't the axis of the gill arch run medial–lateral?</p><p>– Figure1C. Again a different orientation. what is lateral and what is medial?</p><p>– Figure 1D – the asterisk is not defined in the figure legend (it is in the body of the text). But if the asterisk marks the SHH domain in the lateral part of the gill arch, what is purple in the medial part of the gill arch? Why is the GAER not annotated here? Why is M–L not annotated? What about the HA?</p><p>Figure F – Is this a summary of the gill arch? This is not stated in the figure or the text. 'distal' is added as a term. Does distal=lateral? The text for F is incomplete &quot;…where is promotes differentiation of cartilaginous branchial'…branchial what?</p><p>Figure 2 is a much better figure. I think that Figures 1 and 2 should be combined, keeping Figure 1B, C, E–E' and all of figure2. For example, Figure 2C. is a (better) version of 1D. My main confusion now is that in Figure 2, M–L seems to be reversed from Figure 1. Is this correct?</p><p>These comments also relate to Fig7 and 9 which either do not annotate A–P or have M–L in a different orientation.</p><p>Reviewer 2 also comments that they are unsure about Figure 5A– the DiI labelling. I think this is Figure 7? But as the figures are not numbered we cannot be sure. please check and revise if incorrect.</p><p>Other confusing points in the paper– is the gill arch the same as the pharyngeal arch? These terms are used interchangeably in the paper, for example in the first two sentences. But I am not sure if they are equivalent.</p><p>Other confusing points in the paper- is the gill arch the same as the pharyngeal arch?

The figures flow better and the annotation is also much improved (although they were not numbered in the document provided here, and I think the Dil labelling figure is not in the correct position).</p><p>The data provides a good characterization of gene expression in the GAER region and non-GAER tissue which, at least for Wnt factors has been beautifully validated by multiplexed HCR.</p><p>Lineage tracing provides novel insight into the embryonic origin of these tissues.</p><p>Overall, I think the manuscript is significantly improved and the data offers a useful resource for other researchers as well as providing a platform for further, more extensive analysis of signaling events from the GAER underlying gill development, which I look forward to reading about!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have significantly improved the clarity and quality of the writing and data, respectively, included herein, by highlighting key references and further expanding on their transcriptomic analyses in the introduction and discussion sections.

I have no further suggestions at this time.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79964.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper requires significant re–writing in order to improve its accessibility, including combining figures and reducing the number of figures; shortening and improving the introduction; improving figure annotation (scale bars, labelling, etc) and improving summary figures; addition of key missing references i.e. Wnt signaling in the developing zebrafish craniofacial complex (10.1038/s41598–021–85415–y, 10.1016/j.ydbio.2016.11.016, 10.1242/dev.137000); justification of the selection of Ptch2 and Dusp6 as downstream markers of Shh and Fgf8; improved recording of statistical methods and acknowledgment of how tissues were correctly dissected.

All three reviewers made suggestions of different ways in which the manuscript could be improved. We’ve taken guidance from all three reviews, but in some instances, changes requested by one reviewer were at odds with suggestions from another (cutting vs combining and expanding figures, sections of text to expand/reduce, etc). Rather than going through a point-by-point list of the many individual edits that we’ve made (and given the scale of the revision), we hope that you will consider this revised submission in total and will recognised the many places in which reviewers’ comments greatly helped to improve the clarity of the text, figures and message.</p><p>In our revised discussion, we have included additional references (Lines 403-414), including some of the ones recommended by Shawn Hallett in his review. There are hundreds of papers dealing with Wnt signalling and skeletal development, and we can’t really review them all in this paper. We have opted to focus largely on discussing the role of Wnt signalling in cell fate determination (rather than the role of non-canonical Wnt signalling in morphogenesis and convergent extension). We have been selective about which new references to include to keep with the focus of our paper. But we have also taken your suggestion and included additional new references relating to the <italic>Sox9</italic>-Wnt-BMP Turing-like mechanism that underlies amniote digit patterning, and we discuss parallels with the anti-chondrogenic role for Wnt signalling in skate branchial rays that we report here (Lines 449-456).</p><p>We have added a reference to Pearse et al.

This mesoderm-derived muscular sheet is readily identifiable histologically and also exhibits distinct gene expression features that have been reported elsewhere (most recently, in skate, by us in Hirschberger <italic>et al.,</italic> 2021, Mol. Biol. Evol. 38: 4187). In our figures, these muscle fibres are clearly recognisable with regular histochemical staining (in revised Figure 8), and we don’t really think that we could easily include additional panels to illustrate gene expression features of this muscle sheet into that plate. But we have added new citations of a classic anatomical text, a review article on pharyngeal arch tissue structure and our study on gene expression in pharyngeal arch tissues in skate to further support and clarify the nature and location of this tissue within the arch (Lines 347-350).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Histologic evidence that the tissues they are isolating are truly what they appear to be. For example, following manual dissection of similarly staged samples, remaining tissue should be stained with markers for the GAER versus non–GAER.</p></disp-quote><p>Our manual microdissection of embryonic skate gill arches was guided by arch morphology, and by our extensive experience working with this tissue. We first used sharpened tungsten needles to dissect the posterodistal GAER region (which appears as a morphologically distinct pseudostratified epithelial ridge along the leading edge of the expanding arch), and then removed a region of non-GAER tissue from the anterior face of the same arch. By the time these dissections were finished, the arch had been heavily dissected, and so we did not save or fix the remaining tissue. But to confirm that we did effectively capture the GAER region, we did check that the GAER tissue did significantly differentially express <italic>Shh</italic>, relative to the non-GAER tissue (admittedly, <italic>Shh</italic> was not among the top hits, likely because the GAER is only ~5 cells wide, and so makes up a relatively small proportion of the total cells of our sample – but it was still differentially expressed in the GAER region). We add a new statement to this effect from Lines 238-242.</p><p>But more importantly, in the manuscript we have spatially validated several additional factors that emerged from our analysis as differentially expressed in the GAER region of the gill arch, and we confirmed that all of these genes are, indeed, expressed in the vicinity of the GAER (as predicted by our differential expression analysis). We feel that these observations quite strongly support the accuracy of our dissections. In this study, we used our differential gene expression analysis to guide us to signalling pathways that might be interacting with GAER Shh signalling to polarise skate gill arch appendages – this led us to the Wnt signalling pathway, and we then opted to focus the result of our spatial and experimental work that pathway. And everything that we observed is consistent with activity of this pathway within the GAER region of tissue indicated in our dissection schematic in revised Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Multiplexed HCR RNA in situ hybridisation, in order to fully explore co–localisation of genes expressed in the GAER and non–GAER tissues i.e. SHH and FGF8.</p></disp-quote><p>We no longer deal with FGF signalling in this revised manuscript. In our initial figures, we had originally performed HCR for Wnt ligands and Wnt signalling readouts with a GAER marker (either <italic>Shh</italic> or <italic>Wnt7a</italic>). We opted not to show the GAER marker, so as not to obscure the signal of the other markers. But our dashed lines in the original figures were based on actual expression of a GAER marker (i.e., they were not just approximations of the location of the GAER).

In this case, we used our differential gene expression analysis to guide us to signalling pathways that might be interacting with GAER Shh signalling to polarise skate gill arch appendages – again, this analysis led us to the Wnt signalling pathway, and we opted to specifically focus the result of our spatial and experimental work on genes encoding Wnt ligands and downstream effectors.

We would like to provide the readers with an anatomical overview of skate gill skeletal anatomy, so that this is not being encountered for the first time in Figure 7. But we recognise that our original Figure 1 was overly complex. We have replaced our original Figure 1 with a new and simpler figure. The revised Figure 1 shows the skate gill skeleton in ventral and lateral view, as well as a dissected gill arch. The focus of this simpler figure is the distribution of branchial rays, and how these rays relate to the proximal gill arches. We have also oriented panels A and B so that the AP axis is consistent in both. We have attached the revised figure and legend below for your review.</p><p>2. As recommended, we have incorporated the original Figure 1C and E-E’' into Figure 2. We also now consistently indicate AP and PD axes (here, and in all subsequent figures). Branchial rays and gill arches are analogous to the tetrapod limb and girdle, and so we have opted to discuss and label the axes of these appendages in a similar way. We have attached the revised figure and legend below for your review:</p><p>We also revised the first paragraph of our Results section to accommodate these new figure panels:</p><p>“In developing skate gill arches, Shh is expressed in the GAER (Figure 2A), and branchial rays develop from a GAER-responsive domain of posterior arch mesenchyme (Gillis and Hall, 2016). To further explore the transcriptional environment of the GAER and to discover additional gene expression features that may contribute to gill arch polarity, we conducted a comparative transcriptomic and differential gene expression analysis of GAER and non-GAER regions of the first gill arch of the embryonic skate. Briefly, we manually dissected the (1) GAER and (2) non-GAER (control) regions from the first gill arch of stage (S)26 skate embryos (n=5; Figure 2B–Bi), and we performed RNA extraction, library preparation, and RNAseq analysis on these samples. For the GAER region of the first gill arch, we included the whole distal tip of the arch in our dissection to ensure that the <italic>Shh</italic>-expressing GAER and adjacent Shh-responsive (i.e., <italic>Ptc2</italic>+) tissues were captured for this analysis (Figure 2C-D). Following de novo transcriptome assembly, we tested for differential gene expression between GAER and non-GAER tissues (after first testing for differential expression of <italic>Shh</italic> in the GAER region, to confirm dissection accuracy). We used a false discovery rate of 5% and no log fold-change (LogFC) cut-off to generate a list of 401 genes that were upregulated in the GAER region. We sorted this list for genes encoding signalling pathway components and transcription factors with a log-fold change &gt;2. (Figure 2E). Differentially expressed genes were subjected to functional enrichment analysis, and this analysis indicated enrichment of Wnt signalling pathway components in GAER region (Figure 2 Supplement 1 for enrichment analysis). Differentially expressed genes in the GAER region included those encoding the Wnt ligands Wnt2b, Wnt3, Wnt4, Wnt7b and Wnt9, the transmembrane Wnt inhibitors Kremen1 (Mao et al., 2002) and APCDD1 (Shimomura et al., 2010), and the secreted Wnt antagonist Notum (Zhang et al., 2015). We therefore chose to further investigate involvement of the Wnt pathway in GAER signalling by spatially validating the expression of these genes, using the most highly expressed isoforms for mRNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization by chain reaction (HCR) probe set design.”</p><p>3. We have reoriented the panels in Figures 7 and 8 so that anterior is always to the left, and (where relevant) we have indicated the AP and PD axes with labels in Figures 7, 8 and 9.</p><p>4. There were a few incorrect figure references in the text (a holdover from the figure numbering in our original submission).</p><p>We have gone through the text and corrected these.</p><p>5. “Other confusing points in the paper- is the gill arch the same as the pharyngeal arch? These terms are used interchangeably in the paper, for example in the first two sentences. But I am not sure if they are equivalent.”</p><p>Vertebrate pharyngeal arches are a series of paired structures that form on either side of the embryonic head. These arches are named according to their ancestral skeletal derivatives: The first of these arches is called the mandibular arch, the second is called the hyoid arch, and the caudal pharyngeal arches are collectively called the gill arches. Unfortunately, these skeletal derivatives of pharyngeal arches are also generally referred to as “arches”, and this can lead to some confusion when referring to embryonic precursors and their derivatives. To try and clarify this, we have revised the first paragraph of our introduction as follows:</p><p>“The pharyngeal arches of vertebrates are a series of paired columns of tissue that form on either side of the embryonic head. Pharyngeal arches form as iterative outpockets of foregut endoderm contact the overlying surface ectoderm, and this meeting of endoderm and ectoderm generates columns lined laterally by ectoderm, medially by endoderm, and containing a core of mesoderm and neural crest-derived mesenchyme (Graham and Smith, 2001). In fishes, endodermal outpockets fuse with the overlying surface ectoderm, giving rise to the gill slits and the respiratory surfaces of the gills (Gillis and Tidswell, 2017). In amniotes, endodermal outpockets give rise to glandular tissues, such as the tonsils, parathyroid and ultimobranchial glands (Grevellec and Tucker, 2010). The largely neural crest-derived mesenchyme of the pharyngeal arches gives rise to the pharyngeal skeleton – i.e., the skeleton of the jaws and gills in fishes, and of the jaw, auditory ossicles, and larynx in amniotes (Jiang et al., 2002, Kague et al., 2012, Sleight and Gillis, 2020, Couly and Le Douarin, 1990) – with mesenchymal derivatives of each arch receiving patterning and polarity information via signals from adjacent epithelia (Veitch et al., 1999, Gillis et al., 2009a, Couly et al., 2002, Brito et al., 2006). Pharyngeal arches are named according to their ancestral skeletal derivatives: the 1<sup>st</sup> pharyngeal arch is termed the mandibular arch, the 2<sup>nd</sup> pharyngeal arch is the hyoid arch, while the caudal pharyngeal arches are collectively termed the gill arches. In fishes, the gill arches give rise to a series of skeletal “arches” that support the respiratory lamellae of the gills.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
