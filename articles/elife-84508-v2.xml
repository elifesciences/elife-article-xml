Accordingly, several CD73 inhibitors are currently being evaluated in the clinic, including in large randomized clinical trials. Yet, the tumor cell-intrinsic impact of CD73 remain largely uncharacterized. Using metabolomics, we discovered that CD73 significantly enhances tumor cell mitochondrial respiration and aspartate biosynthesis. Importantly, rescuing aspartate biosynthesis was sufficient to restore proliferation of CD73-deficient tumors in immune deficient mice. Seahorse analysis of a large panel of mouse and human tumor cells demonstrated that CD73 enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolytic reserve. Targeting CD73 decreased tumor cell metabolic fitness, increased genomic instability and suppressed poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) activity. Our study thus uncovered an important immune-independent function for CD73 in promoting tumor cell metabolism, and provides the rationale for previously unforeseen combination therapies incorporating CD73 inhibition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adenosine</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stagg</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds de recherche du Québec</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stagg</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting CD73 not only enhances anti-tumor immunity but also disrupts tumor cell metabolism and hinders poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) activity, thus unveiling novel opportunities for combination cancer treatments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD73 is an ectonucleotidase that catalyzes the phosphohydrolysis of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), thus contributing to the breakdown of pro-inflammatory adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into immunosuppressive ADO. Accumulation of extracellular ADO in the tumor microenvironment favors cancer progression by activating ADO specific G-coupled protein receptors (GPCRs) expressed on immune cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and tumor cells. Of the four ADO receptors, high affinity A2A and low affinity A2B receptors elevate intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels and contribute to suppress immune cell function. In human cancers, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and ovarian cancer, CD73 expression is generally associated with poor clinical outcomes, impaired tumor immune surveillance and resistance to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bareche et al., 2021</xref>). Potent and selective CD73 inhibitors have recently been developed and are now being evaluated in randomized clinical trials with encouraging preliminary results reported in lung cancer and pancreatic cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Augustin et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>While CD73 inhibitors can stimulate anti-tumor immunity, early studies reported that targeting CD73 can also inhibit human tumor xenografts in severely immunocompromised mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rust et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, pharmacological inhibition or gene-deletion of CD73 has also been observed to increase the sensitivity of CD73-expressing tumor cells to cytotoxic drugs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ujházy et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Although activation of pro-survival pathways downstream of A2B receptors has been proposed to explain immune-independent effects of CD73, alternative hypotheses have not been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mittal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Rewiring of cancer cells’ metabolism is central to their adaptation to hostile tumor microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhi et al., 2010</xref>). While cancer cells can shift their metabolism from highly efficient ATP-producing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to low ATP-yielding glycolysis despite presence of oxygen (e.g. Warburg effect), mitochondrial respiration has been shown to be critical for proliferating cells and for maintaining tumor cells invasiveness, metabolic adaptation, chemoresistance and stemness. Accordingly, tumor cells are not only capable of respiration but often require respiration for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashton et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In proliferating cells, mitochondrial respiration provides electron acceptors to support biosynthesis of aspartate, an indispensable amino acid for nucleotide and protein synthesis. Mitochondrial respiration requires nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in its oxidized and reduced forms to allow movement of electrons through the electron transport chain (ETC). In addition of supporting respiration, NAD is also an important co-substrate for many enzymes, notably poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) that play a central role in genomic stability by catalyzing the addition of poly-ADP-ribose to proteins (also known as PARylation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wei and Yu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pommier et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Intracellular NAD levels are maintained either by de novo synthesis from L-tryptophan (Trp), or by more effective salvage pathways that recycle NAD from nicotinamide (NAM), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), or nicotinamide riboside (NR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Verdin, 2015</xref>). Extracellular NMN is dephosphorylated to NR before cellular internalization by equilibrative nucleotide transporters (ENTs). Intracellular NR is then re-phosphorylated by NRK1 into NMN, a substrate for adenylyl transferases (NMNATs) to generate NAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ratajczak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katsyuba et al., 2020</xref>). NMN can also be generated from intracellular or extracellular NAM via the rate-limiting enzyme NAMPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katsyuba et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, some studies have suggested a role for CD73 in NAD synthesis from extracellular NR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garavaglia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mateuszuk et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, the impact of CD73 on tumor cell metabolic pathways remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grozio et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We here investigated metabolic consequences of targeting CD73 in a panel of human and murine cancer cells. We observed that CD73 deficiency or pharmacological inhibition induces an important aspartate-dependent metabolic vulnerability in tumor cells characterized by suppressed mitochondrial respiration and increased genomic instability. Our study thus provides a rationale for exploring novel combination strategies with anti-CD73 therapies, such as PARP inhibition and mitochondria targeting agents.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD73 favors tumor growth independently of its immunosuppressive function</title><p>We evaluated the impact of tumor cell-associated CD73 by transiently transfecting a CRISPR-Cas9 construct into human and mouse tumor cell lines followed by flow cytometry-based sorting of polyclonal CD73-negative (CD73neg) and CD73-positive (CD73pos) fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>).

Surprisingly, these metabolic functions of CD73 were independent of ADO signaling, instead relying on the hydrolysis of extracellular NMN to NR and its metabolism by NRK1.</p><p>The importance of CD73 for intracellular NAD synthesis has been controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilk et al., 2020</xref>). Using a colorimetric assay, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>) observed no significant effect of inhibiting or deleting CD73 on intracellular NAD concentrations. These discrepancies from our own data may stem from the different sensitivity of the assays (colorimetric versus LC-MS), the different nature of the inhibitors and the different cell lines studied. Notably, Wilk et al. studied MCF-7 cells that express &gt;10-fold lower levels of CD73 compared to the cell lines we analyzed. Importantly, we validated the impact of CD73 on mitochondrial respiration in a large panel of human and mouse tumor cell lines, as well as in primary fibroblasts derived from CD73 gene-targeted mice. Moreover, the fact that NR supplementation restored intracellular NAD +content in CD73-deficient tumor cells, and that CD73 failed to increase NAD +levels in the absence of NRK1 (since NRK1 is necessary and rate-limiting for the generation of NAD +from exogenous NR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ratajczak et al., 2016</xref>), further support the notion that tumor cell-associated CD73 contributes to maintain intracellular NAD pools.</p><p>Intriguingly, we observed that NMN accumulates in the extracellular milieu of proliferating MDA-MB-231 tumor cells. The mechanism leading to such extracellular NMN accumulation remains unclear. We ruled out the culture media as a potential source of NMN. Extracellular NMN may come from NAMPT activity (intracellular or extracellular) on nicotinamide (NAM) that reaches the extracellular milieu as a result of cell death or stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katsyuba et al., 2020</xref>). NAD release may be another source of extracellular NMN via active or passive release mechanisms followed by consumption by glycohydrolases to generate extracellular NAM. Finally, although MDA-MB-231 and 4T1.2 cells do not express CD38, we cannot exclude the involvement of other ecto-NADases.</p><p>In the tumor microenvironment, CD38 expression on immune cells may also contribute to consume extracellular NAD+. Production of NAM from NAD-consuming enzymes and NAMPT may thus lead to CD73-mediated NR production. Considering that CD38 can cooperate with CD73 for extracellular ADO production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morandi et al., 2018</xref>), it would be of interest to assess the impact of host CD38 on CD73-mediated tumor cell metabolic fitness. Of note, while some studies suggested that CD73 may hydrolyze extracellular NAD+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garavaglia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jablonska et al., 2021</xref>), we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilk et al., 2020</xref>) did not observe this.</p><p>Consistent with the observed decrease in intracellular NAD pools, and the importance of NAD for glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hopp, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luengo et al., 2021</xref>), we found that CD73-deficient tumor cells also displayed impaired maximal glycolytic capacity following oligomycin treatment, which inhibits ATP synthase and forces cells to redirect pyruvate to lactate conversion via glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luengo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We also demonstrated that CD73-deficient tumor cells had significantly reduced PARP activity, which rely on NAD + as cofactor. Accordingly, targeting CD73 sensitized tumor cells to chemotherapy and PARP inhibition. Other DNA repairing enzymes besides PARPs also require NAD+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ruszkiewicz et al., 2022</xref>), including the sirtuins SIRT1 and SIRT6 that play critical roles in promoting homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repairs. It would therefore be of interest to further evaluate the impact of CD73 on sirtuin-mediated HR and NHEJ. A broad impact of CD73 on DNA repair mechanisms might explain the observation that CD73-deficient tumor cells become sensitive to PARP inhibition despite expressing BRCA. Other studies have shown that targeting NAD +synthesis (by blocking NAMPT) enhances the activity of olaparib in BRCA1-competent TNBC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bajrami et al., 2012</xref>). Alternatively, targeting NAD + synthesis may decrease BRCA1 expression or activity, as was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, CD73 deficiency in mice was found associated with reduced serum arginine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mierzejewska et al., 2019</xref>). In addition of diet, another source of arginine is through the metabolism of intracellular aspartate via cytosolic argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garcia-Bermudez et al., 2020</xref>). Our study highlighted the importance of CD73 in promoting intracellular aspartate synthesis. It is therefore possible that the systemic reduction in arginine levels observed in CD73-deficient mice may stem from dysfunctional aspartate biosynthesis.</p><p>In conclusion, our study sheds new light on the immune-independent functions of CD73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We demonstrated that CD73 promote tumor growth in a cancer-cell autonomous manner by increasing metabolic fitness. This in turn favors cancer cell adaptation to nutrient-deprived microenvironments and cytotoxic stress by increasing OXPHOS, aspartate biosynthesis and DNA repair. Our study highlights new therapeutic opportunities that may be exploited in novel combination anti-cancer strategies.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the role of CD73 in NAD + biosynthesis, metabolic function, and genomic stability in cancer cells.</title><p>We propose that CD73 regulates to NAD + biosynthesis intracellularly in a NRK1-dependent manner by hydrolyzing extracellular NMN into NR, which in turn favors DNA-damage response, mitochondrial respiration, aspartate synthesis and tumor growth intrinsically.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bassam Janji (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As outlined in the reviewers' reports, a number of validation-type experiments are needed. The authors should:</p><p>a. Measure the level of ADO released by CD73+, CD73- and CD73- gpASNase1 to support the functionality of CD73 in these cells and to fully endorse the results reported in Figure 2;</p><p>b. Directly test whether restoration of NAD+ levels restores aspartate synthesis;</p><p>c. Measure the rates of glutamine uptake in cells (e.g., consumption of glutamine from the media) in CD73+ vs CD73- cells over a time course;</p><p>d. Include the expression level of CD73 in wt MDA-MB-231 in Figure S1;</p><p>e. Measure OCR and ECAR levels of CD73+/- cells in nutrient-limited conditions to better correspond with functional assays;</p><p>f. Validate that exogenous NR used to restore mitochondria respiration is actually internalized;</p><p>g. Measure cell death versus proliferation occurring in the conditions used for the proliferation assays (e.g., Figure 1B, 1I, etc).</p><p>2) Additional experiments are needed to better establish the cause-effect type conclusions made in the manuscript:</p><p>a. To better evaluate the contribution of CD73 in the conversion of NMN to NR in MDA-MB-231, the effects of a CD73 blocking strategy (i.e. an anti-CD73 mAb) should be determined;</p><p>b. CD73+ or wt MDA-MB-231 should also be added in Figure 3D to see whether NR supplementation is sufficient to restore ECAR and OCR levels;</p><p>c. If the aim is to analyze the impact of NRK1 deletion on intracellular NAD synthesis, shGFP cells should be compared with shNRK1 cells, in both MDA-MB-231 CD73 pos and CD73 neg cells;</p><p>d. In addition to CD73, CD39 contributes to immune regulation through the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP which is a limiting step for extracellular adenosine production. Since CD73 catalyzes the final hydrolysis of AMP to adenosine following CD39 activity, the authors should evaluate whether the deletion of CD73 would also influence the expression of CD39 and A2AR.</p><p>3) The authors should edit the document in order to refine claims and/or increase the clarity of the results.</p><p>a. Change the text to &quot;delay tumor growth&quot; in Figure 1A</p><p>b. Add better descriptions of the nomenclature of isotopologues (M+1, M+2, etc) and the abbreviations for several of the seahorse assays</p><p>c. Tone down or adjust comments suggesting the role of CD73 in chemoresistance is elusive given the existence of extant literature, some from the authors' lab</p><p>d. Edit the results title &quot;CD73 enhances aspartate biosynthesis to promote growth&quot;. As the loss of CD73 impairs aspartate biosynthesis, but it's unclear if CD73 enhances this process.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, &quot;The CD73 immune checkpoint promotes tumor metabolic fitness&quot; Allard et al. explore an immune-independent function of CD73 in cancer cells. Here, the authors demonstrate the cancer cell-intrinsic effects of CD73 to support cell growth and proliferation. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of CD73 impairs aspartate biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and impairs cell growth under nutrient-limiting conditions. CD73 converts extracellular nicotinamide mononucleotide to nicotinamide riboside, which generates intracellular NAD+. Lastly, the authors demonstrate that CD73 loss depletes intracellular NAD+, sensitizing these cells to DNA-damaging agents through decreased PARP activity.</p><p>Overall, the authors present a compelling case for the immune-independent roles of CD73 activity promoting cancer cell growth. The strengths of the paper are a thorough examination of CD73 inhibition in a series of cancer cell lines, including detailed metabolic studies and rescue experiments. However, several experimental points can be strengthened and clarified.</p><p>Comments</p><p>1) A key conclusion of this manuscript is that loss of CD73 leads to both decreased aspartate synthesis and decreased NAD+ levels. The authors state that restoration of NAD+ levels also rescues aspartate biosynthesis (Line 188), but no data is presented to support this claim- does restoration of NAD+ levels restore aspartate synthesis? If so, this would emphasize that CD73 generation of NAD+ is a key factor of metabolic regulation in this system.</p><p>2) Figure 1C, D. The authors state that there are no differences in cellular uptake of glucose or glutamine, but the evidence underlying this claim should be strengthened. In 1C, the authors should report the mean fluorescence intensity for 2-NBDG uptake in CD73- and + cells, as there does appear to be a shift between the two populations. In D, the authors compare relative levels of 13C-labelled glutamine. However, these values could be influenced by both uptake and intracellular metabolism (e.g., glutaminolysis) which cannot readily be distinguished by only measuring glutamine m+5. More evidence would be to measure the rates of glutamine uptake in cells (e.g., consumption of glutamine from the media) in CD73+ vs CD73- cells over a time course.</p><p>3) Several of the proliferation assays (e.g., Figure 1B, 1I, etc) culture cells in limiting nutrient levels for multiple days. Can the authors comment on the amount of cell death occurring across these conditions? Are some of these phenotypes due to differences in proliferation, or due to differences in cell death?</p><p>4) In Figure 1B, the authors demonstrate that impaired proliferation of CD73- cells occurs in nutrient-limiting conditions. Yet, the stable isotope tracing (Figure 1E, F) and oxygen consumption/ECAR assays (Figure 2) are all performed in nutrient-replete conditions. What are the OCR and ECAR levels of CD73+/- cells in nutrient-limited conditions? Is the decrease in aspartate biosynthesis exacerbated in nutrient-limiting conditions?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the authors showed that the metabolic function of CD73 is ADO/A2AR signaling independent, it is still important to measure the level of ADO released by CD73+, CD73- and CD73- gpASNase1 to support the functionality of CD73 in these cells and to fully endorse the results reported in Figure 2J.</p><p>To my best knowledge, MDA-MB-231 wt cells express high levels of CD73 (~ 90%). To evaluate whether the isolated CD73+ cells reflect the high level of CD73 expressed by their wt counterpart, it is important to include the expression level of CD73 in wt MDA-MB-231 in Figure S1.</p><p>In addition to CD73, CD39 contributes to immune regulation through the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP which is a limiting step for extracellular adenosine production. Since CD73 catalyzes the final hydrolysis of AMP to adenosine following CD39 activity, it would be interesting to evaluate whether the deletion of CD73 would also influence the expression of CD39 and A2AR.</p><p>In Figure 1A, there is a significant difference in the growth curves between CD73+ and CD73- tumors. However, we cannot appreciate on which day this significant difference appeared. Statistics should be done for each time point. The authors claim (line 92) that &quot;CD73 deletion in MDA-MB-231 significantly suppressed tumor growth&quot;. This statement is not accurate, there is a significant delay in the tumor growth but not &quot;suppression&quot;.</p><p>The authors should also describe what is the meaning of M, M+1, CR, SRC, etc in different figures.</p><p>Furthermore, it is important to determine whether the reduced ratios of ATP/ADP and ATP/AMP is in favor of an increase of ADP and AMP. Despite that the individual ADO receptor blockade and collective ADO receptor activation seem to show no involvement of ADO receptor activation in cell metabolism, the use of rhADA may not be a good strategy to avoid adenosine receptor activation since inosine is still able to bind adenosine receptors according to the literature (PMID: 26903141, 12947007).</p><p>To better evaluate the contribution of CD73 in the conversion of NMN to NR in MDA-MB-231, the use of anti-CD73 mAb should be performed (Figure 3B). In addition, if NR is a precursor of NAD, why the increase of extracellular NR is not associated with an increase in extra-cellular NAD?</p><p>The authors target intracellular NRK1 to inhibit intracellular NAD synthesis from NR, but what is the link between the levels of extracellular NMN and NR? This is not clear in the manuscript. Moreover, if the aim is to analyze the impact of NRK1 deletion on intracellular NAD synthesis, why not compare shGFP cells with shNRK1 cells, either for MDA-MB-231 CD73 pos or CD73 neg cells?</p><p>Figure 3A shows that NR supplementation restores normal intracellular NAD levels. This point needs to be discussed. CD73+ or wt MDA-MB-231 should also be added in Figure 3D to see whether NR supplementation is sufficient to restore ECAR and OCR to CD73+ or wt levels.</p><p>The authors claim that exogenous NR is used to restore mitochondria respiration, so they suppose that it is internalized but there is no data supporting that. Why NR should be used but not NMN?</p><p>Line 194: It is surprising that the authors consider that the mechanisms of CD73-mediated chemoresistance are elusive since the corresponding author of this manuscript published a PNAS paper describing that &quot; CD73 overexpression in tumor cells conferred chemoresistance to doxorubicin by suppressing adaptive antitumor immune responses via activation of A2A adenosine receptors&quot;</p><p>It would be interesting to comment on whether it is better to have CD73 and genomic stability or to delete CD73 and increase genomic instability, which may lead to more aggressive tumors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84508.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As outlined in the reviewers' reports, a number of validation-type experiments are needed.

We had shown that NR supplementation significantly restored intracellular NAD+ levels in CD73-deficient cells (see Figure 3A). To address the reviewers’ comment, we thus tested whether NR supplementation could effectively rescue aspartate synthesis in CD73-negative cells.

ECAR measurements were unaffected by glutamine concentrations. These new results suggest that CD73-proficient cells retain enhanced metabolic flexibility compared to CD73-deficient cells in glutamine-limiting conditions.

The text now reads as follow: “Strikingly, CD73neg MDA-MB-231 cells displayed significantly reduced OXPHOS (Figure 2B) and reduced glycolytic reserve compared to CD73pos cells in both glutamine replete and glutamine limiting conditions (Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f.

We discussed these new results (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2D-E) in our revised manuscript. Text now reads as follow: “While NT5E (gene encoding for CD73) gene deletion had no impact in standard cell culture conditions (i.e. 25 mM glucose and 2 mM glutamine), it significantly suppressed cell proliferation and viability in nutrients-limiting conditions (Figure 1B, Figure 1—figure supplement 2), despite no difference in cellular uptake of glucose or glutamine, as shown using a fluorescent glucose analog (i.e. 2-NDBG; Figure 1C) and by measurements of glutamine depletion in media (Figure 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional experiments are needed to better establish the cause-effect type conclusions made in the manuscript:</p><p>a.

If the aim is to analyze the impact of NRK1 deletion on intracellular NAD synthesis, shGFP cells should be compared with shNRK1 cells, in both MDA-MB-231 CD73 pos and CD73 neg cells;</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the statistical analysis and observed that NRK1-deficiency significantly impairs NAD+ biosynthesis in both CD73-proficient and deficient cells, albeit more importantly in CD73-proficient cells.

As such, a side-by-side comparison between CD73-proficient and deficient cells is more appropriate to conclude that CD73 contributes to NAD+ biosynthesis in a NRK1-dependent manner. Altogether, our data indicate that CD73 indeed contributes to NAD+ biosynthesis in NR-dependent and NRK1- dependent manner. Our New Figure 3 now includes statistical analyses comparing shGFP to shNRK1 for both CD73-proficient and CD73-deficient cells (New Figure 3C).

Here, the authors demonstrate the cancer cell-intrinsic effects of CD73 to support cell growth and proliferation. Genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition of CD73 impairs aspartate biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and impairs cell growth under nutrient-limiting conditions. CD73 converts extracellular nicotinamide mononucleotide to nicotinamide riboside, which generates intracellular NAD+. Lastly, the authors demonstrate that CD73 loss depletes intracellular NAD+, sensitizing these cells to DNA-damaging agents through decreased PARP activity.</p><p>Overall, the authors present a compelling case for the immune-independent roles of CD73 activity promoting cancer cell growth. The strengths of the paper are a thorough examination of CD73 inhibition in a series of cancer cell lines, including detailed metabolic studies and rescue experiments. However, several experimental points can be strengthened and clarified.</p><p>Comments</p><p>1) A key conclusion of this manuscript is that loss of CD73 leads to both decreased aspartate synthesis and decreased NAD+ levels. The authors state that restoration of NAD+ levels also rescues aspartate biosynthesis (Line 188), but no data is presented to support this claim- does restoration of NAD+ levels restore aspartate synthesis? If so, this would emphasize that CD73 generation of NAD+ is a key factor of metabolic regulation in this system.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for his/her constructive comments. In our original manuscript, we had shown that NR supplementation significantly restored intracellular NAD+ levels in CD73-deficient cells (see Figure 3A). To address the reviewers’ comment, we now tested whether NR supplementation could effectively rescue aspartate synthesis in CD73-negative cells. Restoring NAD+ levels in CD73-negative cells with exogenous NR effectively restored aspartate synthesis to baseline levels.

The authors state that there are no differences in cellular uptake of glucose or glutamine, but the evidence underlying this claim should be strengthened. In 1C, the authors should report the mean fluorescence intensity for 2-NBDG uptake in CD73- and + cells, as there does appear to be a shift between the two populations. In D, the authors compare relative levels of 13C-labelled glutamine. However, these values could be influenced by both uptake and intracellular metabolism (e.g., glutaminolysis) which cannot readily be distinguished by only measuring glutamine m+5. More evidence would be to measure the rates of glutamine uptake in cells (e.g., consumption of glutamine from the media) in CD73+ vs CD73- cells over a time course.</p></disp-quote><p>The fluorescence profiles of 2NBDG uptake overlap.
