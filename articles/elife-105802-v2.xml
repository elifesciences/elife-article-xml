critical role in tendon development and function, influencing cell behavior through mechanotransduction signaling pathways and subsequent extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which tenocytes in developing zebrafish embryos respond to muscle contraction forces during the onset of swimming and cranial muscle activity. Using genome-wide bulk RNA sequencing of FAC-sorted tenocytes we identify novel tenocyte markers and genes involved in tendon mechanotransduction. Embryonic tendons show dramatic changes in expression of <italic>matrix remodeling associated 5b</italic> (<italic>mxra5b</italic>), <italic>matrilin 1</italic> (<italic>matn1</italic>), and the transcription factor <italic>kruppel-like factor 2a</italic> (<italic>klf2a</italic>), as muscles start to contract. Using embryos paralyzed either by loss of muscle contractility or neuromuscular stimulation we confirm that muscle contractile forces influence the spatial and temporal expression patterns of all three genes. Quantification of these gene expression changes across tenocytes at multiple tendon entheses and myotendinous junctions reveals that their responses depend on force intensity, duration, and tissue stiffness. These force-dependent feedback mechanisms in tendons, particularly in the ECM, have important implications for improved treatments of tendon injuries and atrophy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tendon development</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>enthesis</kwd><kwd>myotendinous junction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB2028424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>Thomas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DE13828</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>Thomas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DE30565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>Thomas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AR67797</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>Thomas F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation- Simons Center for Multiscale Cell Fate</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>594598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nayak</surname><given-names>Pavan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Muscle contraction forces shape tenocyte gene expression, with sequencing and spatial analyses revealing unique force-dependent gene regulation patterns, suggesting tenocytes fine-tune tendon matrix in response to varied mechanical cues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All cells experience mechanical forces from their environments, from adhesive interactions between adjacent epithelial cells to structural interactions with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). A key question is how cells adapt and respond to force by modifying their local microenvironment. Force-responsive cellular mechanisms have been implicated in cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Angelo et al., 2011</xref>)<bold>,</bold> morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hamada, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keller et al., 2008</xref>), tissue maintenance and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riley et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). However, these mechanisms remain understudied in vivo, particularly those that involve cell–ECM interactions. Dramatic examples include tendons and ligaments of the musculoskeletal system. Tendons experience a broad range of contractile forces from muscles, such as extreme stretching forces on the human Achilles tendon during exercise, and their constitutive fibroblast populations (called tenocytes) constantly remodel the surrounding ECM to adapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subramanian and Schilling, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang, 2006</xref>). Tendon injuries and atrophy with aging are very common, and a better understanding of the roles of force in tendon development will aid in developing effective treatments.</p><p>Tendons are ECM-rich structures that connect muscles to cartilages and bones as well as to softer tissues. The events leading to the proper formation of their attachments relies largely upon cell–ECM interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schweitzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subramanian and Schilling, 2015</xref>). For example, in the embryonic zebrafish trunk, myotendinous junctions (MTJs) at the vertical myosepta (VMS) of developing somites form via distinct tendon-independent and -dependent stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subramanian and Schilling, 2015</xref>). In the tendon-independent phase, myofibers differentiate and secrete ECM proteins such as Thbs4b that localize to the pre-tendon ECM and mediate initial fiber attachment. This coincides with tendon progenitor cell (TPC) migration into the MTJ. Later, in response to muscle contraction, TPCs differentiate into mature tenocytes and extend long microtubule-rich processes laterally into the surrounding ECM of the VMS, with which they regulate ECM composition locally in response to force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McNeilly et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pingel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>). Contractile forces acting on these MTJs activate transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in TPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berthet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>). Although not necessary for TPC specification, TGF-β induces expression of the transcription factors Scleraxis (Scx) and Mohawk (Mkx), which drive tenocyte fate by directly promoting transcription of collagens (i.e. Col1a1, Col1a2, Col12a1, and Col14) enriched in tendon ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berthet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maeda et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Cell type and ECM composition differ along the length of many tendons to aid in load bearing and force transmission. For example, the enthesis region where a tendon attaches to cartilage or bone is structurally graded in stiffness with fibrocartilage closer to the bone. This helps buffer mechanical stress between the elastic tendon tissue and rigid bony matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu and Thomopoulos, 2013</xref>). Fibrocartilage cells co-express Scx and Sox9, both direct transcriptional regulators of collagens, and muscle activity regulates the ratio of their expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blitz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Subramanian et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zelzer et al., 2014</xref>). This changes collagen levels, fibril size, and organization during injury or repair, as has been shown both in vitro and ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ireland et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pingel et al., 2014</xref>). We have also shown that muscle contraction is required for embryonic tenocyte maturation, morphogenesis and ECM production in zebrafish tendons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Subramanian and Schilling, 2014</xref>).</p><p>To identify genes regulated by muscle contraction in tendons we have performed genome-wide bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on FAC-sorted tenocytes of zebrafish embryos during the onset of muscle contractions and active swimming behavior. In addition to upregulation of known tenocyte markers, we find several other genes up- or downregulated as tendons differentiate that have not been implicated in tenocyte development or mechanotransduction. These include genes encoding two ECM proteins, Matrix Remodeling Associated 5b (<italic>mxra5b</italic>) and Matrilin 1 (<italic>matn1</italic>), as well as the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2a (<italic>klf2a</italic>). We confirm that muscle contraction regulates their transcription in tenocytes at later stages, after the onset of cranial muscle activity, by comparing wild-type and paralyzed embryos. Using genetic and physiological perturbations of muscle contraction in vivo, we show gene expression changes both in whole embryos and sorted tenocytes. Quantitative in situ methods show that their expression is contained within embryonic tendon entheses and MTJs and that their transcriptional responses to force vary depending on the strength and continuity of muscle contraction. These findings provide insights into tendon attachment specific and force-dependent feedback mechanisms in tendons during development in vivo, which have important implications for improved treatments for tendon disease, injury, and atrophy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Onset of active muscle contraction alters tenocyte gene expression</title><p>We previously showed that trunk tenocytes in zebrafish undergo dramatic morphological transformations when muscle contractions begin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Subramanian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Subramanian et al., 2023</xref>). These occur when embryos transition from twitching (36 hr post-fertilization, hpf) to free-swimming behaviors (48 hpf), as well as between sporadic jaw contractions at 60 hpf, and free-feeding behavior at 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). These morphological changes likely reflect force-induced transcriptional changes in tenocytes, in addition to changes driving differentiation. To identify potential force-responsive factors, we conducted RNA-seq with FAC-sorted populations of <italic>Tg(scxa:mCherry)</italic>-positive tenocytes isolated from dissociated twitching (36 hpf) or free-swimming embryos (48 hpf). The <italic>Tg(scxa:mCherry)</italic> line predominantly labels both embryonic trunk and cranial tenocytes. We FACS-sorted mCherry+ cells using WT stage-matched non-fluorescent embryos as negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Three genes of particular interest, <italic>matn1</italic>, <italic>klf2a</italic>, and <italic>mxra5b</italic>, stood out based on their force-dependent regulation in other biological contexts or regulation by TGF-β, a well-known force-responsive signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subramanian and Schilling, 2015</xref>).

The transcription factor <italic>klf2a</italic> was also strongly upregulated; Klf2 and Klf4 have been implicated in enthesis development in mammalian tendons. Klf proteins also repress TGF-β signaling in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2021</xref>) and <italic>klf2a</italic> expression is mechanosensitive during heart valve development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Steed et al., 2016</xref>).

To test this, we used 90 ng/µl of aBTX , a concentration optimized to paralyze embryos only for the first 2 days of embryogenesis after which they gradually recover.

We performed RT-qPCR on cDNA derived from these embryos and compared them to aBTX paralyzed (aBTX-P) and uninjected controls. We separated 48 hpf recovered embryos into two subgroups based on the extent of muscle contraction: (1) partially recovered (Twitching or aBTX-T), in which embryos showed sporadic contractions of the trunk and pectoral fin muscles, similar to twitching 36 hpf embryos and (2) fully recovered (Recovered, or aBTX-R), in which embryos swam freely.

Thus<bold>,</bold> force-dependent <italic>klf2a</italic> expression may be critical for tissue-specific ECM remodeling in many contexts.</p><p>Together, our bulk RNA-seq analysis of embryonic zebrafish tenocytes and their transcriptional responses to muscle contraction: (1) identifies new regulators of tenocyte–ECM, going beyond the better studied collagens, and (2) highlights the importance of considering developmental events that specify the mechanical properties of tendons as they form. Genes such as <italic>matn1</italic>, <italic>mxra5b</italic>, and <italic>klf2a</italic> show unique expression profiles and changes due to perturbation of muscle contraction, both during normal embryonic development and in response to paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). The presence of these genes in embryonic tendons and their responses to force during normal development versus recovery from paralysis raises questions as to whether the mechanisms that initially establish these structures differ from those that control their maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Though cell–ECM feedback mechanisms have been studied in controlled 3D microenvironments in vitro, extrapolating these mechanisms into an understanding of in vivo biological processes like development and tissue homeostasis is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saraswathibhatla et al., 2023</xref>). Given the large variation of cell–ECM feedback mechanisms throughout embryonic development, understanding specific tenocyte–ECM interactions will require novel approaches to measuring the effect of varying (1) ECM microenvironment protein compositions, or local ‘matrisomes’, on tenocyte gene expression and (2) intrinsic gene expression patterns of heterogeneous tenocyte populations spatially and functionally. Single-cell approaches (e.g. scRNA-seq) at different developmental stages and in the presence or absence of force, will provide a clearer understanding of how individual spatially and functionally distinct tenocyte populations respond to force in development. Integrating such knowledge of the basic biology of tenocytes at multiple scales will be essential for developing a better picture of tenocyte–ECM interactions at individual tendons, paving the path to advance personalized translational therapies for tendon injuries.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers who have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that the reviewers have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript has potential but our view is that substantial and possibly repeated revisions would be needed before it could be accepted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors exploit an important transition in zebrafish development to understand force response in tenocytes. They identify over 1000 genes that respond to force (by muscle contraction), providing an extensive list of genes to evaluate for roles in mechanoresponse and tendon maturation. While the experiments presented in this manuscript initiate an exciting research program that will advance our understanding of tendon biology, the limited focus on three genes with distinct expression profiles and responses to force limit the interpretation of the presented data. The observation of discrete expression profiles for tendons across the skeleton is interesting, but more work will be necessary to establish the principles of general and local tenocyte response to force. This work continues an exciting direction of study for the authors that will likely reveal tendon-specific and general mechanisms of force response.</p><p>The basis of the manuscript centers on changes driven by the muscle contraction that initiates between 36 hpf and 48 hpf, an event that the authors have previously demonstrated drives a range of interesting morphological changes in tendon cells. The authors capture several genes that change gene expression as muscle contraction initiates, including three factors (klf2a, matn1, and mxra5b) that they focus on based on previous literature implicating them with known mechano-responsive pathways. However, whether these genes are direct responders to force or further downstream responders that control the morphological changes previously described is unclear. Despite possible issues with redundancy, the authors should provide a characterization of stable mutant lines from the crispants described in the discussion to strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>While the authors discuss possible pathways upstream of candidate genes (ie TGF-β upstream of matn1), the authors do not test the responsiveness of these genes to the predicted pathways in zebrafish, which reduces the impact of relating published studies.</p><p>The discrepancies between the experiments that attempt to validate gene expression changes captured in their RNA-seq experiment make the ultimate conclusions of this paper hard to interpret. While the authors suggest interesting ideas about the reasoning for each specific inconsistency, the discrepancies make it unclear which experiment reflects the biological processes described. For example, although not explicitly stated, Figure 4C suggests mxra5b is down-regulated between 36 and 48 hpf, suggesting it is down-regulated as the muscles contract. This is in contrast with the results from the RT-qPCR experiments and in situ-based experiments, confounding conclusions. The authors' results with klf2a are especially hard to interpret, as each experiment shows a different result. Unless the authors provide additional genes with similar responses, the data weakens the manuscript.</p><p>Given that their experiments are focused on purified tendon cells, the authors should consider removing all whole animal RT-qPCR experiments from the manuscript. In exchange, fluorescent-based experiments using tendon markers should be repeated in cacnb1-/- fish.</p><p>In addition, because the authors only focus on three genes that happen to have different expression patterns with tendons and different responses to force, the hypothesized model for the diverse local responses is poorly supported. Expanding their study to include genes that share similar gene expression profiles and responses to force will strengthen the study.</p><p>The authors should consider including RNA-seq data from cacnb1-/- and aBTX-P treated fish to expand their list of relevant force-responsive genes with the patterns captured from their analysis. Additionally, the authors suggest divergent force-responsive features between the trunk and craniofacial tendons. To support this beyond the description of three genes, the authors should consider performing RNA-seq experiments that compare force response between craniofacial and trunk tendons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript addresses the useful question of how movement impacts tendon development by taking the approach of transcriptomic analysis of tendon precursor cells before and after swimming. The authors claim that they identified novel tendon-associated genes, three of which were investigated further by conducting paralysis/rescue studies to show that expression is force-responsive.</p><p>One weakness of this manuscript is that it is not well grounded in extant literature regarding the development and differentiation of cartilage/tendons, but more importantly with previous deep sequencing of scx-expressing cells (mESC-derived, mammalian, porcine, and meta-analyses have been conducted – for example, PMIDs PMC8270956, PMC5037390, PMC7810463, PMC5751986). The manuscript is quite thin, and one approach to filling the manuscript out could be to significantly increase the integration and analysis of their data that focuses on changes occurring during development.</p><p>The authors rest a lot of the significance of the study on the novelty of the genes identified, but this is also somewhat confusing, &quot;By paralyzing and restoring muscle contractions in embryos in vivo, we show that three of these novel genes….). For example, mxra5b does not appear to be novel (identified in avian development as expressed in tendons/ligaments (PMID 29877573) and in adult pig tendons (PMC5751986). Similarly, kruppel-like factors have been identified in both being force responsive and as regulators of bi-fated tendon-to-bone attachment cells.</p><p>The data methodology/interpretation is either confusing or this reviewer is confused, but the data do not necessarily seem to agree with the stated conclusions. In general, this is a potentially exciting manuscript but, in its current form, is not presented as rigorous or compelling enough.</p><p>Example 1 Figure 3 – sxca ish is a little bit difficult to believe as the red dots look like they could be background as well, could the authors cite previous clear data showing that the unimpressive red dots are real? Also, could the authors discuss the other attachment sites (presumably there are some) where co-expression was not observed, and discuss the implications of these data? This figure is very difficult for the reader to scan – it would be helpful to include more labels/graphics, etc. Also – is this a one-off or was this observed in multiple embryos? And, if swimming has already started by 72hpf, was ish done prior to this to show co-expression? It seems like showing expression after swimming is contrary to the point note the figure says 72hpf the text says 51hpf but the figure looks more like the older fish could look in figure 2 – a bit difficult because orientation seems to be different.</p><p>Also, co-expression by ish of kfl2a and scxa is difficult in this figure because it is not clear what the white outlines correspond to – they don't clearly overlap with dapi, thus how are they drawn? How frequently was this observed – in all somite boundaries? Similar questions abound with mxra5b – this seems to have such low expression, is it all co-localized with scxa, and what happens later in development?</p><p>Example 2 Figure 4 – could the authors please speak to why matn1 is not significantly downregulated at attachment sites in paralyzed embryos versus wild-type in panel I but it is significantly downregulated in whole embryos in panel E? Does this data suggest that matn1 is not force-responsive at attachment sites? Can the authors please explain how the swimming force in the trunk impacts cranial cartilage development? That is one confusing aspect of this manuscript, how head cartilage development relates to swimming. Perhaps showing images of how cartilage and trunk tendons are affected in paralyzed embryos would be helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this work, the authors aim to delineate a model in which mechanical force during embryonic muscle development regulates novel genes in tendon fibroblasts. The role of mechanical forces in regulating gene programs is an exciting area of development and is leading to many unexpected findings across fields.</p><p>There are additional experiments that could significantly strengthen the appended manuscript:</p><p>1) It would help the reader to understand how clean the FACS-sorted cell population used for sequencing analysis is. In brief, it is hard to fully digest the genomics data without having an understanding of this tendon fibroblast population is pure.</p><p>2) Are there phenotypic effects on tendon development from loss of function of any of the identified genes? This remains a large open-ended question of this study.</p><p>3) There are instances where the authors use the word 'specific' for the expression patterns of these genes. This is a bit of a misnomer, as genes such as Klf2 are expressed in the vasculature and mxra5b in the notochord. This expression in alternative tissues speaks to why readers need to fully understand how clean and specific the isolated cell population used for sequencing was.</p><p>4) The downstream qPCR analysis from this study is done globally on whole fish embryos. Given that these genes are not specific, it is difficult to relate changes in gene expression in whole fish to specific cell types.</p><p>5) The authors' use of fluorescent in situ hybridization to increase resolution and assess the overlap of their genes of interest with known genes expressed in tendon fibroblasts is commendable. Unfortunately, most of the expression overlap of interest is on the order of pixel-level resolution and is difficult to interpret for a broad audience.</p><p>The authors should be commended for an attempt to address this critical area of biology, however, the manuscript in its current form is lacking the data and resolution to fully support their conclusions.</p><p>While the concept presented in this manuscript is extremely interesting and could be of high value to the field, as things currently stand, there isn't enough supporting evidence to support the publication of this work.</p><p>Specific suggestions that would need to be addressed:</p><p>1) the isolated cell population used for sequencing needs to be validated. The authors need to confirm that there are no contaminating cells, such as endothelial cells or notochord cells, in their preps. Without this, much of the data could be artifactual. For instance, in Figure 3F, almost the entirety of klf2a expression is in the vasculature. While the authors highlight potential areas of interest, it is impossible to tell from confocal stacks if this is a true overlap of expression or just expression in different planes that appear overlapping because the images are Z-projected. In general, the images are not particularly compelling to hinge on the entirety of the manuscript on.</p><p>2) Given comment 1, the paper could be strengthened by demonstrating the functional effect of these genes in tendon fibroblasts. What happens if they aren't there? Are there consequences for tendon development? Without this, it is hard to fully realize the implications of the authors' data.</p><p>3) While Figure 4 shows that there could be a link between mechanics and expression of these genes, the model used to test this relies on an ion channel loss of function setting. It is nearly impossible to decouple the change in gene expression from the loss of mechanics in this model from the loss of the gating current of the channel. For this reason, additional orthogonal models should be used to bolster and support the authors' claims.</p><p>These points should be addressed before a deeper review of the conclusions from this manuscript could be fully addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105802.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive comments.

All 3 reviewers asked for a better explanation of the changes in <italic>matn1, klf2a,</italic> and <italic>mxra5b</italic> expression in the bulk RNA-seq experiments with <italic>cacnb1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants to clarify if they were due to paralysis or instead to gene expression changes reflecting embryonic tendon maturation. To address this, we conducted an additional bulk RNA-seq experiment at 48 hpf (hours postfertilization) on sorted mCherry+ tenocytes from <italic>α bungarotoxin</italic> (aBTX) injected Tg(<italic>scxa:mCherry</italic>) paralyzed embryos and uninjected controls. Changes in <italic>matn1, klf2a,</italic> and <italic>mxra5b</italic> expression showed a similar trend to our bulk RNA-seq results at 36-48 hpf (Figure 3G), supporting the hypothesis that they are caused by changes muscle contractile forces. We have also added discussion of how these gene expression changes differ from those associated with tenocyte maturation.</p><p>2. All 3 reviewers were concerned about contamination of sorted tenocytes with other cell types, in particular because the RT-qPCR results with sorted cells differed from those found by bulk RNA-seq. To address this we provide data showing the stringency of our FACS gating thresholds for the mCherry+ signal (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). In addition, tenocyte-specific expression profiles of <italic>matn1, klf2a,</italic> and <italic>mxra5b</italic> were quantified using IMARIS 3D imaging software to select individual tenocyte nuclei from HCRish’s at two different tendon attachments for <italic>matn1</italic> and four different attachments for <italic>klf2a</italic>, and <italic>mxra5b,</italic> across four different contractile force conditions (Figures 2, 4, 5, 6 and all supplements for these figures). These data reveal not only temporal but also spatial heterogeneity in expression of <italic>matn1, klf2a,</italic> and <italic>mxra5b</italic> in tenocyte subpopulations in response to force.</p><p>3. Several reviewers criticized figure quality, particularly for our HCRish analyses. Former figures 2 and 3 (current figures 2, 4, 5, 6 and all associated supplements) have now been completely revised to include high resolution images of HCRishs for <italic>matn1</italic>, <italic>mxra5b</italic>, and <italic>klf2a.</italic> These show co-localization with <italic>scxa</italic> using IMARIS software. The original chromogenic ISH images have been moved to the supplements (See Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><p>4. Several reviewers suggested we remove the RT-qPCR results. However, these were used initially to validate genes with mechanosensitive activation in our bulk RNA-seq experiments. Global expression changes occur in tissues other than tenocytes (e.g. <italic>matn1</italic> in cartilage, <italic>klf2a</italic> in vasculature) in these embryos. Going by the concerns of the reviewers, we have decided to move the RT-qPCR figure to supplementary data (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Our HCRish measurements show spatially restricted expression to tenocytes and how they are affected by varying force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors exploit an important transition in zebrafish development to understand force response in tenocytes.

Many of the force-responsive genes identified overlap between the two RNA-seq experiments (See Figure 3E) and we find similar temporal and spatial changes in <italic>matn1</italic>, <italic>mxra5b</italic>, and <italic>klf2a</italic> expression in both datasets (See Figure 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. This manuscript addresses the useful question of how movement impacts tendon development by taking the approach of transcriptomic analysis of tendon precursor cells before and after swimming. The authors claim that they identified novel tendon-associated genes, three of which were investigated further by conducting paralysis/rescue studies to show that expression is force-responsive.</p><p>One weakness of this manuscript is that it is not well grounded in extant literature regarding the development and differentiation of cartilage/tendons, but more importantly with previous deep sequencing of scx-expressing cells (mESC-derived, mammalian, porcine, and meta-analyses have been conducted – for example, PMIDs PMC8270956, PMC5037390, PMC7810463, PMC5751986). The manuscript is quite thin, and one approach to filling the manuscript out could be to significantly increase the integration and analysis of their data that focuses on changes occurring during development.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out these studies, which are largely in vitro using mammalian cells and difficult to compare with our in vivo approaches in zebrafish development. PMC7810463 shows expression of KLF2 during murine enthesis development, but does not investigate effects of force on KLF2 expression. PMC5751986 compares KLF2 expression between tendon and enthesis but again not in the context of force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors rest a lot of the significance of the study on the novelty of the genes identified, but this is also somewhat confusing, &quot;By paralyzsing and restoring muscle contractions in embryos in vivo, we show that three of these novel genes….). For example, mxra5b does not appear to be novel (identified in avian development as expressed in tendons/ligaments (PMID 29877573) and in adult pig tendons (PMC5751986). Similarly, kruppel-like factors have been identified in both being force responsive and as regulators of bi-fated tendon-to-bone attachment cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Our study shows the first evidence of a role for mechanical force from muscle contraction on <italic>mxra5b, klf2a</italic> or <italic>matn1</italic> expression. Since some previous work has implicated these genes in force responses and/or in tendons, we have largely avoided use of “novel” in the manuscript when referring to <italic>matn1, klf2a,</italic> and <italic>mxra5b</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The data methodology/interpretation is either confusing or this reviewer is confused, but the data do not necessarily seem to agree with the stated conclusions. In general, this is a potentially exciting manuscript but, in its current form, is not presented as rigorous or compelling enough.</p><p>Example 1 Figure 3 – sxca ish is a little bit difficult to believe as the red dots look like they could be background as well, could the authors cite previous clear data showing that the unimpressive red dots are real? Also, could the authors discuss the other attachment sites (presumably there are some) where co-expression was not observed, and discuss the implications of these data? This figure is very difficult for the reader to scan – it would be helpful to include more labels/graphics, etc. Also – is this a one-off or was this observed in multiple embryos? And, if swimming has already started by 72hpf, was ish done prior to this to show co-expression? It seems like showing expression after swimming is contrary to the point note the figure says 72hpf the text says 51hpf but the figure looks more like the older fish could look in figure 2 – a bit difficult because orientation seems to be different.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to multiple reviewers #1 and #3. Revised figures show HCRish images of <italic>matn1, klf2a</italic>, and <italic>mxra5b</italic> expression, including close-up views of selected dual <italic>scxa</italic> expressing nuclei, colocalizing voxels with IMARIS software.</p><p>1. Figure 1 now illustrates the embryonic zebrafish axial and cranial musculoskeletal systems including the relevant tendons in this study, also labeled in other figures.</p><p>2. Revised HCRish data were reanalyzed in IMARIS for colocalization with scxa. It is true that some attachment sites lack <italic>scxa</italic> tenocytes, (1) e.g. <italic>matn1</italic> expressing tenocytes in the mandibulohyoid junction (mhj) tendon as this is a muscle-muscle attachment, as well as the sternyhoideus (sh) MTJ since there is no adjacent cartilage. <italic>matn1</italic> is primarily expressed in cartilages and entheses as we show in the new Figure 2, Figure 4, and associated supplements.</p><p>3. Co-localization with <italic>scxa</italic> was performed and quantified for <italic>matn1, klf2a</italic>, and <italic>mxra5b</italic> in HCRish with multiple embryos, but we include one representative image for each (See Figure 2, 4, 5, 6 and all associated supplements). We have also expanded the Methods section describing in detail numbers of embryos imaged and tenocytes quantified for each tendon. Including expression changes after onset of swimming behavior is relevant, especially for <italic>matn1</italic> and <italic>klf2a,</italic> since they are upregulated upon initiation of muscle contraction, as we showed in the original submission with bulk RNA-seq.</p><p>As described in our response to multiple reviewers #1, to confirm roles for force in regulation of <italic>matn1</italic>, <italic>klf2a,</italic> and <italic>mxra5b</italic> expression we have repeated paralysis experiments using aBTX-injection, with similar results. Over 200 genes are shared between the two datasets suggesting that onset of force rather than simply tendon maturation account for these results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Also, co-expression by ish of kfl2a and scxa is difficult in this figure because it is not clear what the white outlines correspond to – they don't clearly overlap with dapi, thus how are they drawn? How frequently was this observed – in all somite boundaries? Similar questions abound with mxra5b – this seems to have such low expression, is it all co-localized with scxa, and what happens later in development?</p></disp-quote><p>We have used IMARIS to improve the HCRish images dramatically. We have revised the images and now present the co-expression of <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>scxa</italic> in both the trunk at 48 hpf and the head at 72 hpf along with magnified views of individual nuclei which contain colocalization of <italic>klf2a</italic> and <italic>scxa</italic> fluorescently labelled transcripts using the voxel colocalization tool available in IMARIS software (See Figure 2G-P). Co-localization in the trunk is observed at most somite boundaries. <italic>mxra5b</italic> expression in the trunk does not obviously colocalize with scxa, though it localizes to somite boundaries (See Figure 2G-I). Cranial <italic>mxra5b</italic> and <italic>scxa</italic> clearly co-localize in cranial tenocytes (See Figure 2Q-V).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Example 2 Figure 4 – could the authors please speak to why matn1 is not significantly downregulated at attachment sites in paralyzed embryos versus wild-type in panel I but it is significantly downregulated in whole embryos in panel E? Does this data suggest that matn1 is not force-responsive at attachment sites? Can the authors please explain how the swimming force in the trunk impacts cranial cartilage development? That is one confusing aspect of this manuscript, how head cartilage development relates to swimming. Perhaps showing images of how cartilage and trunk tendons are affected in paralyzed embryos would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our responses to multiple reviewers #1 and #3. We have revised Figure 3 and moved RT-qPCR results to Figure 3- supplementary figure 1. Differences between the whole embryo RT-qPCR and HCRish results can be explained by the nature of the measurements. <italic>matn1</italic> expression shows no expression in the trunk tenocytes, but shows changes in expression between 36 hpf and 48 hpf, and between WT and paralyzed embryos at 48hpf in the bulk RNAseq. This can be because: 1) <italic>matn1</italic> expression is also localized to the pec fin buds (which are not part of the head tendons), which are contracting during the onset of swimming behavior and 2) at 48 hpf, <italic>matn1</italic> expression also localizes to the developing jaw cartilages and tendons (See Figure 1C and Figure 2. Supplement 2), which lie ventrally closer to the trunk muscles and heart before extending anteriorly by 60 hpf. Therefore it is possible that the forces from contractions of the trunk musculature and pec fins have an effect on <italic>matn1</italic> expression in the cranial tissues as well indeed, we see mechanosensitive transcriptional patterns of <italic>matn1</italic> expression in the RT-qPCRs, and new bulk RNAseq involving aBTX injected paralyzed embryos at 48 hpf, see Figure 3A and G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this work, the authors aim to delineate a model in which mechanical force during embryonic muscle development regulates novel genes in tendon fibroblasts. The role of mechanical forces in regulating gene programs is an exciting area of development and is leading to many unexpected findings across fields.</p><p>There are additional experiments that could significantly strengthen the appended manuscript:</p><p>1) It would help the reader to understand how clean the FACS-sorted cell population used for sequencing analysis is. In brief, it is hard to fully digest the genomics data without having an understanding of this tendon fibroblast population is pure.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to multiple reviewers #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are there phenotypic effects on tendon development from loss of function of any of the identified genes? This remains a large open-ended question of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed multiplex CRISPR injections and saw no noticeable embryonic zebrafish phenotypes for <italic>matn1</italic> and <italic>klf2a. mxra5b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> CRISPant embryos showed disruptions of somite boundary morphology as well as fewer scxa+ trunk tenocytes, which we have included as Figure 7. <italic>matn1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> knockout mice show either no (Li et al. 2020), or very mild skeletal abnormalities and reduced collagen 2 fibril thickness and collagen 2 synthesis (Huang et al. 1999, Chen et al. 2016). We created a stable matn1 mutant line but mutants were viable and fertile with no obvious phenotype, though we will further pursue the possibility that these fish have mild cartilage/skeletal phenotypes as adults.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are instances where the authors use the word 'specific' for the expression patterns of these genes. This is a bit of a misnomer, as genes such as Klf2 are expressed in the vasculature and mxra5b in the notochord. This expression in alternative tissues speaks to why readers need to fully understand how clean and specific the isolated cell population used for sequencing was.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to multiple reviewers #2 and #3. New bulk-RNA-seq experiments combined with spatial gene expression data should alleviate concerns about tissue or cell-type specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The downstream qPCR analysis from this study is done globally on whole fish embryos. Given that these genes are not specific, it is difficult to relate changes in gene expression in whole fish to specific cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to multiple reviewers #4 above</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors' use of fluorescent in situ hybridization to increase resolution and assess the overlap of their genes of interest with known genes expressed in tendon fibroblasts is commendable. Unfortunately, most of the expression overlap of interest is on the order of pixel-level resolution and is difficult to interpret for a broad audience.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to multiple reviewers #3. We have completely revised the HCRish images and quantification of the spatial expression data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While Figure 4 shows that there could be a link between mechanics and expression of these genes, the model used to test this relies on an ion channel loss of function setting. It is nearly impossible to decouple the change in gene expression from the loss of mechanics in this model from the loss of the gating current of the channel. For this reason, additional orthogonal models should be used to bolster and support the authors' claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to multiple reviewers #1.
