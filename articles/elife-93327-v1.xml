the neuroscience of healthy ageing, whereby older adults are proposed to recruit additional brain activity to compensate for reduced cognitive function. However, whether this additional brain activity in older participants actually helps their cognitive performance remains debated. We examined brain activity and cognitive performance in a human lifespan sample (<italic>N</italic> = 223) while they performed a problem-solving task (based on Cattell’s test of fluid intelligence) during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Whole-brain univariate analysis revealed that activity in bilateral cuneal cortex for hard vs. easy problems increased both with age and with performance, even when adjusting for an estimate of age-related differences in cerebrovascular reactivity. Multivariate Bayesian decoding further demonstrated that age increased the likelihood that activation patterns in this cuneal region provided non-redundant information about the two task conditions, beyond that of the multiple demand network generally activated in this task. This constitutes some of the strongest evidence yet for functional compensation in healthy ageing, at least in this brain region during visual problem-solving.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>resilience</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>compensation</kwd><kwd>fluid intelligence</kwd><kwd>multivariate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/H008217/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henson</surname><given-names>Richard N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>732592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henson</surname><given-names>Richard N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000320</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer's Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsvetanov</surname><given-names>Kamen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000627</institution-id><institution>Guarantors of Brain</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G101149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tsvetanov</surname><given-names>Kamen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Older people can recruit additional brain regions to help perform complex tasks, possibly compensating for age-related changes in other parts of the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Preventing cognitive decline in old age is a major public heath priority, which demands a better understanding of the neurophysiological changes that preserve cognitive function despite progressive brain atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabeza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christensen et al., 2009</xref>). Neuroimaging has facilitated the idea that the brain can flexibly respond to tissue loss (e.g., due to ageing) by recruiting additional brain activity to support cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabeza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grady, 2012</xref>).

MDN activation tends to decrease with age as measured, for example, with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during problem-solving tasks that tax fluid intelligence such as the Cattell task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitchell et al., 2023</xref>). So far, these studies have examined age effects in core regions of the MDN but have not explicitly tested for functional compensation in other regions.</p><p>To search for brain regions that might support functional compensation, we conducted a whole-brain voxel-wise search for clusters that showed a positive relationship with both age and cognitive performance (i.e., classic univariate criteria for functional compensation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lövdén et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabeza et al., 2018</xref>). The dependent variable was the difference in fMRI activation for blocks of hard vs. easy odd-one-out problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as measured in 223 adults between 19 and 87 years of age, from Stage 3 of the Cambridge Centre for Ageing &amp; Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shafto et al., 2014</xref>); performance was measured as the proportion of all problems correct. Second, we applied a multivariate Bayesian (MVB) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston et al., 2008</xref>) across all voxels within any candidate regions identified in the whole-brain search, to test whether multi-voxel patterns in these regions provided additional information about task difficulty, beyond that in the MDN. We predicted that, if a region were involved in functional compensation, the additional information it contains about the task would increase with age. To pre-empt the results, unlike in our previous applications of MVB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>), we find one region – within the cuneus – that did show evidence of this additional multivariate information, supporting its role in functional compensation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design, behavioural performance and task activation effects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) version of Cattell task.

Additional activation was observed bilaterally in the inferior/ventral and lateral occipital temporal cortex (i.e., a cluster around the lateral occipital sulcus that extended anteriorly beyond the anterior occipital sulcus), likely due to the visual nature of the task.</p><p>To search for a potentially compensatory pattern of brain activation, we next overlaid maps that tested for positive effects of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, green map) and performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, red map) on the [Hard &gt; Easy] contrast. While age and performance are negatively correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), their effects were estimated simultaneously via multiple regression, and so the activation maps reflect unique effects of each. As reported using related measures and overlapping samples of Cam-CAN participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitchell et al., 2023</xref>), age-related increases in activity were widespread, including the precuneus, middle frontal gyrus, and supplementary motor area. Activity positively related to performance was found in many of the same regions that were more active for hard vs. easy problems (i.e., inferior/middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, superior parietal lobule; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Univariate analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-brain effects of age and performance.

These were in bilateral cuneal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, magenta) and bilateral frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, brown), the latter incorporating parts of the middle frontal gyri and anterior cingulate. Therefore, based on traditional univariate analyses, these are two candidate regions for age-related functional compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabeza and Dennis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabeza et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, we defined regions of interest (ROIs) within these two regions using the overlap activation maps (see section: Regions of interest) to be used for subsequent uni- and multivariate analyses.</p><p>However, the two candidate compensation regions showed different patterns as a function of age and performance: whereas the frontal region showed additive effects of both variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, upper), the cuneus region showed signs of an interaction (p = 0.028; though this would not survive correction for multiple comparisons across the two ROIs), whereby the relationship with performance was strongest in the oldest participants (and there was little sign of a performance relationship in the youngest participants; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, lower). This is suggestive of compensatory activation only engaged by higher-performing older people in the cuneus specifically.</p><p>It has previously been shown that many effects of age on the blood oxygenation level-dependent(BOLD) signal measured by fMRI relate to vascular effects of ageing, rather than necessarily indicating differences in neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsvetanov et al., 2021a</xref>). We therefore repeated the multiple regressions after scaling the Cattell activation effect by an estimate of the Resting State Fluctuation Amplitude (RSFA) for each ROI from an independent, resting-state scan for each participant. Previous work has shown that RSFA relates to age-related vascular differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsvetanov et al., 2021a</xref>), but not neural differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsvetanov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumral et al., 2020</xref>). Despite this RSFA adjustment, the pattern of effects remained similar in each ROI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggests that these effects of age (and the relationship with performance) are neural in origin.

that the task condition could be decoded from voxels in almost all participants, the critical test was whether age influenced the likelihood that adding voxel activation patterns from the ‘compensatory’ ROIs (i.e., joint model) would boost decoding accuracy relative to that for the MDN-only model. A positive age effect on boost likelihood would indicate that, the older someone was, the more likely that activation patterns in the putative ‘compensation ROI’ would provide additional, non-redundant, task-relevant information, consistent with a compensatory role. In line with this compensation account, there was a significant positive effect of age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) on the likelihood that model performance was boosted (i.e., log-evidence change &gt;3) by including voxel activation patterns from the cuneal ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, lower; odds ratio = 2.21). In other words, the amount of unique task information in the multi-voxel pattern within the cuneal ROI (above that present in the MDN) increased with age. In contrast, this analysis for the model containing the frontal ROI voxel activation patterns showed no effect of age (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, upper).</p><p>Note that, since this age effect in the cuneus was present even though the logistic regression model contained this ROI’s univariate response as a covariate of no interest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), the effect of age on boost likelihood is unlikely to be due to differences in the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) across ages.</p><p>As a final analysis, we also tested a more lenient definition of functional compensation, whereby the multivariate contribution from the ‘compensation ROI’ does not necessarily need to be above and beyond that of the task-relevant network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>). To do this, we again assessed whether age was associated with an increase in the spread of the weights over voxels (see Methods), for smaller models containing only the cuneal or frontal ROI. This tested whether increased age led to more voxels carrying substantial information about task difficulty, a pattern predicted by functional compensation (but also consistent with non-specific additional recruitment). In this case, the results of this test did not support functional compensation, as there was no effect detected for the cuneal cortex and even a negative effect of age for the frontal cortex where the spread of the information across voxels was lower for older age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This said, it is worth highlighting that even if an ROI were to have shown an effect of age on this spread measure, it could instead be explained by a non-specific mechanism that recruits multiple regions in tandem (rather than reflecting compensation) as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morcom and Johnson, 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The existence of age-related functional compensation mechanisms remains a matter of debate in the cognitive neuroscience of healthy ageing. Here, we analysed fMRI data from a problem-solving (fluid intelligence) task and identified two brain regions (in bilateral cuneal and frontal cortex; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>) that satisfied traditional univariate criteria for functional compensation. After applying the multivariate criterion that a compensating region should possess additional information about the task, only the cuneal cortex showed an age-related increase in this additional information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), beyond that available in the generic task-activated regions (i.e., the MDN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This is the first demonstration of increased multivariate information with age, since previous studies have shown evidence for no such multivariate increase associated with univariate age-related hyper-activation in other ROIs and tasks; leading to previous findings being interpreted in terms of neural inefficiency, rather than compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Why would the cuneal cortex demonstrate functional compensation when solving difficult visuospatial problems? Since the cuneus has a well-established role in visual attention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corbetta et al., 1998</xref>), we hypothesise that the additional recruitment of this brain region facilitates concurrently attending to multiple features of the stimulus array, to correctly select the ‘odd-one-out’. The recruitment of this brain region in older adults could drive changes in looking strategy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Law et al., 1996</xref>), where, for example, older adults compensate for their reduced visual short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>) – that is, difficulty sustaining representations of puzzle items – by using more or different saccades. This possibility is consistent with the greater cuneal activation that was observed for older adults who performed better at the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Future work pairing fMRI behavioural tasks with eye-monitoring could verify this proposed relationship between age, cuneus activation, overt attention, and fluid intelligence.</p><p>In line with this hypothesised role of the cuneal cortex, there is consistent functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santarnecchi et al., 2017</xref>) and structural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jauk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) neuroimaging evidence that link this brain region to aspects of fluid intelligence like rule application. Similarly, responses from sensory areas (like the secondary visual network that overlaps our cuneus ROI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ji et al., 2019</xref>) have been shown to predict fluid intelligence performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brumback et al., 2004</xref>). In ageing, it is well established that sensory and intellectual decline are correlated (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baltes and Lindenberger, 1997</xref>), either because they share a common cause or because performance of fluid intelligence tasks is partially dependent on sensory processing (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider and Pichora-Fuller, 2000</xref>). While our data cannot tease apart these hypotheses, it may be that compensatory processes in the cuneal region reflect this shared age-related variance between sensory and higher-order cognitive tasks.</p><p>Though activation of the cuneal ROI increased with age, it is worth noting the constant term (reflecting the average across all ages) was negative (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that most people (other than the older ones) showed greater activation of this region for easy than hard problems. This is more difficult to reconcile with its activation reflecting visual attention or eye movements, since this would suggest greater visual attention/eye movements towards easy than hard problems in the young. One alternative possibility is active suppression of the cuneal region in the hard blocks, to avoid distraction (e.g., minimise attentional capture from neighbouring display panels while processing features in each panel). Thus, the age-related reduction in the Easy − Hard difference (leading to the positive correlation of the Hard − Easy difference with age) could reflect reduced ability to inhibit the cuneus during hard problems, consistent with the established age-related decline in the ability to suppress distracting information in complex stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsvetanov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rey-Mermet and Gade, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouhassoun et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is not clear why this alternative account would predict a positive correlation between cuneal activity and task performance, given that greater suppression (in the Hard condition) would be expected to lead to better performance, but more negative activity values for the [Hard − Easy] contrast. Thus, we favour the explanation in terms of functional compensation.</p><p>Another possibility is that the age-related increases in fMRI activations (for hard vs. easy) in one or both of our ROIs do not reflect greater fMRI signal for hard problems in older than younger people, but rather lower fMRI signal for easy problems in the older. Without a third baseline condition, we cannot distinguish these two possibilities in our data. However, a reduced ‘baseline’ level of fMRI signal (e.g., for easy problems) in older people is consistent with other studies showing an age-related decline in baseline perfusion levels, coupled with preserved capacity of cerebrovascular reactivity to meet metabolic demands of neuronal activity at higher cognitive load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calautti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jennings et al., 2005</xref>). Though age-related decline in baseline perfusion occurs in the cuneal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tsvetanov et al., 2021b</xref>), the brain regions showing modulation of behaviourally relevant Cattell fMRI activity by perfusion levels did not include the cuneal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2023</xref>). This suggests that the compensatory effects in the cuneus are unlikely to be explained by age-related hypo-perfusion, consistent with the minimal effect here of adjusting for RSFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). One final possibility is whether the observed boost in decoding from adding the cuneal ROI simply reflects less noisy task-related information (i.e., a better SNR) than the MDN and, consequently, the boosted decoding is the result of more resilient patterns of information (rather than the representation of additional information) based on a steeper age-related decline of SNR in the MDN. Overall then, as none of the explanations above agree with all aspects of the results, to functionally explain the role of the cuneal cortex in this task would require further investigation.</p><p>The age- and performance-related activation in our frontal region satisfied the traditional univariate criteria for functional compensation, but our MVB model comparison analysis showed that additional multivariate information beyond that in the MDN was absent in this region, which is inconsistent with the strongest definition of compensation. In fact, the results from the spread analysis showed that as age increased, this frontal area processed less, rather than more, multivariate information about the cognitive outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) as previously observed in two (memory) tasks for a comparable ROI within the same Cam-CAN cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>).</p><p>This pattern of results suggests that traditional univariate criteria alone are not sufficient for identifying functional compensation. Similar univariate effects have been found in previous studies (though with smaller samples), where lateral and medial frontal areas show increased activation during healthy ageing across a range of tasks, including those related to executive control or attention (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spreng et al., 2010</xref>; for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spreng et al., 2010</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raz et al., 2008</xref>, for a neuroanatomical link). Patients with brain damage also demonstrate increased frontal activation during language and semantic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brownsett et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rice et al., 2018</xref>) indicating that this mechanism might be a response to brain atrophy generally. Instead, our results suggest that this frontal hyper-activation in older adults reflects ‘inefficient’ processing, in terms of more neural resources being needed to perform the task (i.e., for hard vs. easy problems). In fact, neural inefficiency was our favoured interpretation of previous cases when MVB showed no age-related boost, in frontal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>) or motor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>) regions. From these studies, and all previous fMRI or positron emission tomography (PET) studies that showed age-related hyper-activation, it was not known whether the increased activations reflected greater neural inefficiency, or greater haemodynamic resources needed for the same level of neural activity (i.e., vascular rather than neural inefficiency). Here, we showed for the first time that the age-related increase in both ROIs remained even after adjusting for RSFA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), suggesting that this hyper-activation reflects neural rather than vascular inefficiency.</p><p>This said, univariate criteria for functional compensation will continue to play a role in hypothesis testing. For instance, the over-additive interaction observed in the cuneal cortex – where the increase in activity with better performance is more pronounced in older adults – offers evidence of compensation compared to the simple additive effect of age and performance observed in the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, the conclusions that can be drawn from age-related differences in cross-sectional associations of brain and behaviour are limited, mainly because individual performance differences are largely lifespan-stable (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lindenberger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morcom and Johnson, 2015</xref>). So far, the two studies that have combined these univariate, behavioural, and multivariate approaches to assess functional compensation (i.e., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>; the present study) have generally found converging evidence regardless of the method used. However, it is important to note that the MVB approach uniquely shifts the focus from individual differences to the specific task-related information that compensatory neural activations are assumed to carry and provides a specific test of region- (or network-) unique information. With further studies, it may also be that multivariate approaches prove more sensitive for detecting compensation effects than when using mean responses over voxels (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Friston et al., 1995</xref>) particularly since over-additive effects are challenging to observe because compensatory effects are typically ‘partial’ and do not fully restore function (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scheller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morcom and Johnson, 2015</xref>). Within the multivariate analysis options themselves, it is also interesting to highlight that the stringent MVB boost likelihood analysis could detect functional compensation unlike the more lenient analysis focusing on the spread of MVB voxel weights. This suggests the importance of including task-relevant network responses when building decoding models to assess compensation.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>, we did not explicitly test for a relationship between activation and (memory) performance, and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>, we failed to find any relationship between (ipsilateral motor) activation and various (motor) performance measures. In the present study, it may be that the age-related frontal hyper-activation is caused by neural inefficiency, yet the degree of overall activation still relates to (lifespan-stable) problem-solving performance. Converging with the lack of additional multivariate information, this suggests that the frontal region does not show a compensatory response.</p><p>In summary, we propose that our results in the cuneus represent the most compelling evidence to date for functional compensation in healthy ageing, with further work needed to determine the precise function of this region in problem-solving tasks like that examined here. Together with the results in prefrontal cortex, the data also suggest that specific compensatory neural responses can coexist with inefficient neural function in older people.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A healthy population-derived adult lifespan human sample (<italic>N</italic> = 223; ages approximately uniformly distributed from 19 to 87 years; females = 112; 50.2%) was collected as part of the Cam-CAN study (Stage 3 cohort; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shafto et al., 2014</xref>). Participants were fluent English speakers in good physical and mental health, based on the Cam-CAN cohort’s exclusion criteria which includes poor mini mental state examination, ineligibility for MRI and medical, psychiatric, hearing, or visual problems. Throughout analyses, age is defined at the Home Interview (Stage 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shafto et al., 2014</xref>). The study was approved by the Cambridgeshire 2 (now East of England – Cambridge Central) Research Ethics Committee (reference: 10/H0308/50) and participants provided informed written consent.

Participants were scanned while performing the problem-solving task where, on each trial, four display panels were presented in a horizontal row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in the centre of a screen that was viewed through a head-coil mounted mirror. Participants were required to make a button-press response to identify the mismatching panel that was unique in some way from the other three (based on either a figural, spatial, complex, or abstract property).</p><p>In a block design, participants completed eight 30-s blocks which contained a series of puzzles from one of two difficulty levels (i.e., four hard and four easy blocks completed in an alternating block order; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The fixed block time allowed participants to attempt as many trials as possible. Therefore, to balance speed and accuracy, behavioural performance was measured by subtracting the number of incorrect from correct trials and averaging over the hard and easy blocks independently (i.e., ((hard correct − hard incorrect) + (easy correct − easy incorrect))/2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Samu et al., 2017</xref>). For assessing reliability and validity, behavioural performance (total number of puzzles correct) was also collected from the same participants during a full version of the Cattell task (Scale 2 Form A) administered outside the scanner at Stage 2 of the Cam-CAN study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shafto et al., 2014</xref>).

A T2*-weighted echoplanar imaging sequence was used to collect 150 volumes, each containing 32 axial slices (acquired in descending order) with slice thickness of 3.0 mm and an interslice gap of 25% for whole-brain coverage (repetition time, RT = 2000 ms; echo time, TE = 30 ms; flip angle = 78°; field of view, FOV = 192 mm × 192 mm; voxel-size 3 × 3 × 3.75 mm). Higher resolution (1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm) T1- and T2-weighted structural images were also acquired (to aid registration across participants).</p><p>MR data pre-processing and univariate analysis were performed with SPM12 software (Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/">https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/</ext-link>), release 4537, implemented in the AA 4.0 pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cusack et al., 2014</xref>) described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>. Specifically, structural images were rigid-body registered to an MNI template brain, bias corrected, segmented, and warped to match a grey matter template created from the whole Cam-CAN Stage 2 sample using DARTEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashburner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor et al., 2017</xref>). This template was subsequently affine transformed to standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. The functional images were spatially realigned, interpolated in time to correct for the different slice acquisition times, rigid-body coregistered to the structural image, transformed to MNI space using the warps and affine transforms from the structural image, and resliced to 3 mm × 3 mm × 3 mm voxels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Univariate analysis</title><p>For participant-level modelling, a regressor for each condition was created by convolving boxcar functions of 30-s duration for each block with SPM’s canonical haemodynamic response function, using a general linear model (GLM). Additional regressors were included in each GLM to capture residual movement-related artifacts, including six representing the <italic>x</italic>/<italic>y</italic>/<italic>z</italic> rigid-body translations and rotations (estimated in the realignment stage). Finally, the data were scaled to a grand mean of 100 over all voxels and scans within a session, and the model was fit to the data in each voxel. The autocorrelation of the error was estimated using an AR(1)-plus-white-noise model, together with a set of cosines that functioned to high-pass filter the model and data to 1/128 Hz, that were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. The estimated error autocorrelation was then used to ‘prewhiten’ the model and data, and ordinary least squares used to estimate the model parameters. The contrast of parameter estimates for the hard and easy conditions, per voxel and participant, was then calculated and combined in a group GLM with independent regressors for age and in-scanner behavioural performance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Univaraite region of interest (ROI) analysis</title><p>All ROIs were defined by selecting activated voxels from a group-level GLM (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> for number of voxels within ROIs). The two ROIs that were tested as candidate regions for functional compensation (i.e., cuneal cortex and frontal cortex) were defined by contiguous voxels that were significantly positively related to the independent effects of both age and performance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The MDN was defined by the selecting suprathreshold voxels activated by the [Hard vs. Easy] contrast from the Cattell task. For MVB analysis (see below), a subset of the highest activated voxels within the MDN were taken to match the number of voxels with that of the ‘compensation ROI’ being tested (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>For the ROI-based multiple regressions, the activation was averaged across voxels (i.e., mean difference in parameter estimates for Hard – Easy conditions) for each ROI and participant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In the case of RSFA-scaled multiple regression, we used RSFA calculated from independent resting-state scans (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tsvetanov et al., 2015</xref>) to scale the task-related BOLD response (by dividing the Hard – Easy difference in parameter estimates for each voxel by the RSFA value at the same voxel).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Multivariate Bayesian (MVB) analysis</title><p>A series of MVB models were fit to assess the information about task condition that was represented in each ROI or combination of ROIs. Each MVB decoding model is based on the same design matrix of experimental variables used in the univariate GLM, but the mapping is reversed; many physiological data features (fMRI activity in multiple voxels) are used to predict a psychological target variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston et al., 2008</xref>). This target (outcome) variable is specified as the contrast [Hard &gt; Easy] with all covariates removed from the predictor variables.</p><p>Each MVB model was fit using a parametric empirical Bayes approach, in which empirical priors on the data features (voxel-wise activity) are specified in terms of spatial patterns over voxel features and the variances of the pattern weights. As in earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>), we used a sparse spatial prior in which ‘patterns’ are individual voxels. Since these decoding models are normally ill-posed (with more voxels than scans), these spatial priors on the patterns of voxel weights regularise the solution.</p><p>The pattern weights specifying the mapping of data features to the target variable are optimised with a greedy search algorithm using a standard variational scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston et al., 2008</xref>) which was particularly appropriate given the large dataset. This is achieved by maximising the free energy, which provides an upper bound on the log of the Bayesian model evidence (the marginal probability of the data given that model). The evidence for different models predicting the same psychological variable can then be compared by computing the difference in log evidences, which is equivalent to the log of the Bayes factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friston et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chadwick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morcom and Friston, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The outcome measure was the log evidence for each model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>). To test whether activity from an ROI is compensatory, we used an ordinal boost measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>) to assess the contribution of that ROI for the decoding of task-relevant information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Specifically, Bayesian model comparison assessed whether a model that contains activity patterns from a compensatory ROI and the MDN (i.e., a joint model) boosted the prediction of task-relevant information relative to a model containing the MDN only. The compensatory hypothesis predicts that the likelihood of a boost to model decoding will increase with older age. The dependent measure, for each participant, was a categorical recoding of the relative model evidence to indicate the outcome of the model comparison. The three possible outcomes were: a boost to model evidence for the joint vs. MDN-only model (difference in log evidence &gt;3), ambiguous evidence for the two models (difference in log evidence between −3 and 3), or a reduction in evidence for the joint vs. MDN-only model (difference in log evidence &lt;−3). These values were selected because a log difference of three corresponds to a Bayes factor of 20, which is generally considered strong evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee and Wagenmakers, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, with uniform priors, this chosen criterion corresponds to a p-value of &lt;~0.05 (since the natural logarithm of 20 equals three, as evidence for the alternative hypothesis). A reduction in model evidence was not observed in the current study.</p><p>For this MVB boost analysis, participants were only included if their data allowed reliable decoding by the joint model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>). To determine this, we contrasted the log evidence for the joint model with that from models in which the design matrix (and therefore the target variable) was randomly phase shuffled 20 times. The definition of reliable was based on a mean of 3 or more in the difference of log evidence between the true and shuffled model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Note that decoding is performed after removing the mean across voxels (i.e., MVB results are independent of the results in the univariate analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Alongside the MVB boost analysis, we also included an additional measure using the spread (standard deviation) of voxel classification weights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morcom and Henson, 2018</xref>). This measure indexes the absolute amplitude of voxel contributions to the task, reflecting the degree to which multiple voxels carry substantial task-related information. When related to age this can serve as a multivariate index of information distribution, unlike univariate analyses. However, it is worth highlighting that even if an ROI shows an effect of age on this spread measure, such an effect could instead be explained by a non-specific mechanism that represents the same information in tandem across multiple regions (rather than reflecting compensation) as seen previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knights et al., 2021</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morcom and Johnson, 2015</xref>). Thus, it is the MVB boost analysis that is the most compelling assessment of functional compensation because it can directly detect novel information representation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous age and behavioural performance variables were standardised and treated as linear predictors in multiple regression throughout the behavioural (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), wholebrain voxel-wise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>), univariate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>), and MVB (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) analyses.

The authors find that regions of the frontal cortex and cuneus showed unique effects of both age and performance. Interestingly, these two regions demonstrated differential activation patterns taking into account both age and performance. Specifically, the researchers found that the relationship between performance and activation in the cuneal ROI was strongest in older adults, however, this was not found in younger adults. These findings suggest that specifically within the cuneus, greater activation is needed by older adults to maintain performance, suggestive of functional compensation.</p><p>The conclusions derived from the study are well supported by the data. The authors validated the use of the in-scanner Cattell task by demonstrating high reliability in the same sample with the standard out-of-scanner version. Some strengths of the study include the large sample size and wide age range of participants. The authors use a stringent Bayes factor of 20 to assess the strength of evidence. The authors used a whole-brain approach to define regions of interest (ROIs) based on activation patterns that were jointly related to age and performance. Overall, the methods are technically sound and support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Comment from Reviewing Editor: In the revised manuscript, the authors have addressed the weaknesses previously identified by reviewer 1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93327.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This work by Knights et al., makes use of the Cam-CAN dataset to investigate functional compensation during a fluid processing task in older adults, in a fairly large sample of approximately 200 healthy adults ranging from 19 to 87. Using univariate methods, the authors identify two brain regions in which activity increases as a function of both age and performance and conduct further investigations to assess whether the activity of these regions provides information regarding task difficulty. The authors conclude that the cuneal cortex - a region of the brain previously implicated in visual attention - shows evidence of compensation in older adults.</p><p>The conclusions of the paper are well supported by the data, and the authors use appropriate statistical analyses. The use of multivariate methods over the last 20 years has demonstrated many effects that would have been missed using more traditional univariate analysis techniques. The data set is also of an appropriate size, and as the authors note, fluid processing is an extremely important domain in the field of cognition in aging, due to its steep decline over aging.</p><p>Comment from Reviewing Editor: It would have been nice to see an analysis of a more crystallised intelligence task included too, as a contrast since this is an area that does not demonstrate such a decline (and perhaps continues to improve over aging).

To this end, the authors employed a version of the Cattell task, which probes visual pattern recognition for identifying commonalities and differences within sets of abstract objects in order to infer the odd object among a given set. Using a state-of-the-art univariate analysis approach on fMRI data from a large lifespan sample, the authors identified brain regions in which the activation contrast between hard and easy Cattell task conditions was modulated by both age and performance. Regions identified comprised prefrontal areas and bilateral cuneus. Applying a multivariate decoding approach to activity in these regions, the authors went on to show that only in older adults, the cuneus, but not the prefrontal regions, carried information about the task condition (hard vs. easy) beyond that already provided by activity patterns of voxels that showed a univariate main effect of task difficulty. This was taken as compelling evidence for task-specific compensatory activity in the cuneus in advanced age.</p><p>The study is well-motivated and well-written. The authors used appropriate, rigorous methods that allowed them to control for a range of possible confounds or alternative explanations. Laudable aspects include the large sample with a wide and even age distribution, the validation of the in-scanner task performance against previous results obtained with a more standard version outside the scanner, and the control for vascular age-related differences in hemodynamic activity via a BOLD signal amplitude measure obtained from a separate resting-state fMRI scan. Overall, the conclusions are well-supported by the data.</p><p>Comment from Reviewing Editor: The revised manuscript has addressed the points raised during the review of the original submission.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93327.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Knights</surname><given-names>Ethan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Henson</surname><given-names>Richard N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Morcom</surname><given-names>Alexa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Sussex</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brighton</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tsvetanov</surname><given-names>Kamen A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>Point 1: While the manuscript is methodologically sound, the following aspects of image acquisition and data analysis need to be clarified to ensure replicability and reproducibility. The authors state that the sample is a &quot;population-derived adult lifespan sample&quot;, the lack of demographic information makes it impossible to know if the sample is truly representative. Though this may seem inconsequential, education may impact both cognitive performance and functional activation patterns. Moreover, the authors do not report race/ethnicity in the manuscript. This information is essential to ensure representativeness in the sample. It is imperative that barriers to study participation within minoritized groups are addressed to ensure rigor and reproducibility of findings.</p></disp-quote><p>First, the section <italic>Methods</italic>-<italic>Participants</italic> has been updated to refer readers to a prior article where the sample’s demographics are broken down into nine decile age groups (see Wu et al. 2023 Table 1), including information about their education levels. Secondly, we have updated the Data Availability section text to indicate that all Cam-CAN IDs are included in the available OSF datasets, allowing anyone to verify additional participant demographics described in the Cam-CAN protocol article (Shafto et al., 2014). Third, we have updated the Participants section text to refer to another prior study that reported on the representativeness of the Cam-CAN sample indicating that at least some elements of the sample have been independently deemed as representative (e.g., Sex).</p><p>Page-24</p><p>“A healthy population-derived adult lifespan human sample (N = 223; ages approximately uniformly distributed from 19 - 87 years; females = 112; 50.2%) was collected as part of the Cam-CAN study (Stage 3 cohort; Shafto et al., 2014). Participants were fluent English speakers in good physical and mental health, based on the Cam-CAN cohort’s exclusion criteria which includes poor mini mental state examination, ineligibility for MRI and medical, psychiatric, hearing or visual problems. Throughout analyses, age is defined at the Home Interview (Stage 1; Shafto et al., 2014). The study was approved by the Cambridgeshire 2 (now East of England–Cambridge Central) Research Ethics Committee and participants provided informed written consent. Further demographic information of the sample is reported in Wu et al. (2023) and is openly available (see section Data Availability) with a recent report indicating the representativeness of the sample across sexes (Green et al., 2018).”</p><p>Page-30</p><p>“Raw and minimally pre-processed MRI (i.e., from automatic analysis; Taylor et al., 2017) and behavioural data are available by submitting a data request to Cam-CAN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://camcan-archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/dataaccess/">https://camcan-archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/dataaccess/</ext-link>). The univariate and multivariate ROI data, and behavioural data, can be downloaded from the Open Science Framework, which includes Cam-CAN participant identifiers allowing the retrieval of any additional demographic data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/v7kmh">https://osf.io/v7kmh</ext-link>), while the analysis code is available on GitHub.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2: For the whole-brain analysis in which the ROIs were derived, the authors used a threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE; Smith &amp; Nichols 2009). The methodological paper cited suggests that individuals' TCFE image should still be corrected for multiple comparisons using the following: &quot;to correct for multiple comparisons, one [...] has to build up the null distribution (across permutations of the input data) of the maximum (across voxels) TFCE score, and then test the actual TFCE image against that. Once the 95th percentile in the null distribution is found then the TFCE image is simply thresholded at this level to give inference at the p &lt; 0.05 (corrected) level.&quot; (Smith &amp; Nichols, 2009). Although the authors mention that clusters were estimated using 2000 permutations, there is no mention of the TFCE image itself being thresholded. While this would impact the overall size of the ROIs used in the study, the remaining analyses are methodologically sound.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the text to detail the t=1.97 (i.e., p = .05) threshold we applied before interpretation of the resultant TFCE images to the section: <italic>Experimental Design &amp; Statistical Analysis.</italic> This threshold value can also be verified in the analytics code that is referenced on GitHub from the section <italic>Data Availability</italic> within the requisite toolbox functions: https://github.com/kamentsvetanov/CommonalityAnalysis/blob/main/code/ca_vba_tfce_threshold.m#L24 and https://github.com/kamentsvetanov/CommonalityAnalysis/blob/main/code/external/ca_matlab_tfce_transform.m</p><p>Page-30</p><p>“For whole-brain voxelwise analyses, clusters were estimated using threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE; Smith &amp; Nichols 2009) with 2000 permutations and the resulting images were thresholded at a t-statistic of 1.97 before interpretation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3: The authors should consider moving the ROI section to results. The way the manuscript currently reads, the ROIs seem to be derived a priori as opposed to being derived from activation maps in the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>After consideration of this point, we have decided to leave the methodological details regarding the definition of ROIs in the methods, to maintain the focus of the Results section. However, we have improved signposting in the results section to highlight that the ROIs were derived from the overlapped activation maps.</p><p>Page-8</p><p>“Crucially, two areas of the brain showed spatially-overlapping positive effects of age and performance, which is suggestive of an age-related compensatory response (Figure 2A yellow intersection). These were in bilateral cuneal cortex (Figure 2B magenta) and bilateral frontal cortex (Figure 2B brown), the latter incorporating parts of the middle frontal gyri and anterior cingulate. Therefore, based on traditional univariate analyses, these are two candidate regions for age-related functional compensation (Cabeza et al. 2013; 2018). Accordingly, we defined regions of interest within these two regions using the overlap activation maps (see section: ROIs) to be used for subsequent univariate and multivariate analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 4: The manuscript can be strengthened by explaining why the authors chose a greedy search algorithm over a dynamic Bayesian model.</p></disp-quote><p>The text is updated to refer to appropriateness of the computationally efficient greedy search implementation, due to the size of the fMRI cohort dataset.</p><p>Page-28</p><p>“The pattern weights specifying the mapping of data features to the target variable are optimized with a greedy search algorithm using a standard variational scheme (Friston et al., 2007) which was particularly appropriate given the large dataset.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Point 1: However, it might have been nice to see an analysis of a more crystallised intelligence task included too, as a contrast since this is an area that does not demonstrate such a decline (and perhaps continues to improve over aging).</p></disp-quote><p>We (Samu et al., 2017) have previously investigated, but failed to find, univariate evidence for functional compensation in this cohort’s performance on a sentence comprehension task that is more closely aligned to a measure of crystallised intelligence. Based on the additional previous studies where we have applied these types of univariate and multivariate criteria of functional compensation (Morcom &amp; Henson, 2018; Knights et al., 2021), we have consistently observed that the uni-/multivariate effects are in the same direction. Therefore, we would not initially expect a different conclusion here, where the univariate and multivariate effects suggest different outcomes. Notably, the univariate analysis approach in Samu et al. (2017) did differ from focusing on the age x behaviour interaction term here, so it could still be worth future investigation, but it does seem less likely that evidence of compensation would be observed than for fluid intelligence. However, as the Reviewer suggests, such a task may make another good contrast to show evidence against the existence of functional compensation (as in Morcom &amp; Henson, 2018; Knights et al., 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2: Figure 1B: Consider adding coefficients describing relationships to plots.</p></disp-quote><p>Annotations of the coefficients have been added to Figure 1B:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3: Figure 2C.

Wouldn't the fact that a non-MDN region carries task-related information be sufficient to infer that it is involved in the task and, if activated increasingly with increasing age, that its stronger recruitment reflects compensation, rather than inefficiency or dedifferentiation? Put differently, wouldn't &quot;more of the same&quot; in an additional region suffice to qualify as compensation, as compared to the &quot;additional information in an additional region&quot; requirement set by the authors? As a consequence, in my honest opinion, showing that decoding task difficulty from non-MDN ROIs works better with higher age would already count as evidence for compensation, rather than asking for age-related increases in decoding boosts obtained from adding such ROIs. It would be interesting to see whether the arguably redundant frontal ROI would satisfy this less demanding criterion. At any rate, it seems useful to show whether the difference in log evidence for the real vs. shuffled models is also related to age.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the logic for conducting a weaker assessment of functional compensation whereby a brain region does not necessarily have to provide a unique contribution beyond that of the ordinarily activated task-relevant network. However, although non-unique recruitment is predicted by a compensation theory, it can also be explained by a nonspecific mechanism that recruits multiple regions in tandem. In contrast, unique additional recruitment is compatible with compensation but not with nonspecific recruitment. In this article, and those prior (Morcom &amp; Henson, 2018; Knights et al. 2021), we have also deliberately avoided using the specific kind of analysis proposed (i.e., testing for an effect of age on differential log evidence) because these would involve applying statistical tests directly to the log evidence, a variable that is already a statistical test output.</p><p>Nevertheless, temporarily putting these caveats aside, we did run the suggested test. Results from multiple regression showed that using log evidence from frontal cortex models still did not meet this less demanding criterion for functional compensation as there was an effect of age in the opposite direction to that expected by functional compensation: there was a significant negative effect of age (<italic>t</italic>(218) = -7.95, <italic>p</italic> = &lt; .001) indicating that as age increased, the difference in log evidence decreased. This effect is visualised below for transparency, but we preferred not to add this information to the article because we do not wish to encourage using this kind of analysis for the reason mentioned above. Thus, although our main multivariate test of interest is stringent, the additional step of mapping log evidence back to the boost-likelihood categories (e.g., boost vs. no difference to model performance) lends itself to the more appropriate logistic regression statistical approach.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Negative effect of age on MVB log evidence model outcomes for frontal cortex.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93327-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A different approach that could be taken to assess a more lenient definition of functional compensation would be to analyse the effects of age on the spread of multivariate responses predicting task difficulty (i.e., standard deviation of fitted MVB voxel weights; also see Morcom &amp; Henson, 2018; Knights et al., 2021) specifically from models that only include the candidate ‘compensation’ ROIs.</p><p>Accordingly, these analyses and their discussion have been added to the article. To summarise, these analyses showed that (1) the frontal cortex still did not show evidence of functional compensation (i.e., a negative effect of age like in Morcom &amp; Henson, 2018) and (2) no effect of age on the cuneal ROI, implying that the original model comparison approach (i.e., Figure 2C in the manuscript now) can provide more sensitivity for detecting evidence of functional compensation (perhaps because of the importance of including task-relevant network responses when building decoding models).</p><p>Page-15</p><p>“As a final analysis, we also tested a more lenient definition of functional compensation, whereby the multivariate contribution from the “compensation ROI” does not necessarily need to be above and beyond that of the task-relevant network (Morcom &amp; Henson, 2018; Knights et al., 2021). To do this, we again assessed whether age was associated with an increase in the spread (standard deviation) of the weights over voxels, for smaller models containing only the cuneal or frontal ROI. This tested whether increased age led to more voxels carrying substantial information about task difficulty, a pattern predicted by functional compensation (but also consistent with non-specific additional recruitment). In this case, the results of this test did not support functional compensation, as there was no effect detected for the cuneal cortex and even a negative effect of age for the frontal cortex where the spread of the information across voxels was lower for older age (Figure 3C; Table 2).”</p><p>Page-21</p><p>“The age- and performance-related activation in our frontal region satisfied the traditional univariate criteria for functional compensation, but our multivariate (MVB) model comparison analysis showed that additional multivariate information beyond that in the MDN was absent in this region, which is inconsistent with the strongest definition of compensation. In fact, the results from the spread analysis showed that as age increased, this frontal area processed less, rather than more, multivariate information about the cognitive outcome (Figure 3C) as previously observed in two (memory) tasks for a comparable ROI within the same Cam-CAN cohort (Morcom &amp; Henson, 2018).”</p><p>Page-24</p><p>“This said, univariate criteria for functional compensation will continue to play a role in hypothesis testing. For instance, the over-additive interaction observed in the cuneal cortex - where the increase in activity with better performance is more pronounced in older adults - offers stronger evidence of compensation compared to the simple additive effect of age and performance observed in the frontal cortex (Figure 2C). So far, the two studies that have combined these rigorous univariate, behavioral and multivariate approaches to assess functional compensation (i.e., Knights et al., 2021; the present study) have generally found converging evidence regardless of the method used. However, it is important to note that the MVB approach uniquely shifts the focus from individual differences to the specific task-related information that compensatory neural activations are assumed to carry and provides a specific test of region- (or network-) unique information. With further studies, it may also be that multivariate approaches prove more sensitive for detecting compensation effects than when using mean responses over voxels (e.g., Friston et al., 1995) particularly since over-additive effects are challenging to observe because compensatory effects are typically ‘partial’ and do not fully restore function (for review see Scheller et al., 2014; Morcom &amp; Johnson, 2015). Within the multivariate analysis options themselves, it is also interesting to highlight that the stringent MVB boost likelihood analysis could detect functional compensation unlike the more lenient analysis focusing on the spread of MVB voxel weights. This suggests the importance of including task-relevant network responses when building decoding models to assess compensation.”</p><p>Page-32</p><p>“Alongside the MVB boost analysis, we also included an additional measure using the spread (standard deviation) of voxel classification weights (Morcom &amp; Henson, 2018). This measure indexes the absolute amplitude of voxel contributions to the task, reflecting the degree to which multiple voxels carry substantial task-related information. When related to age this can serve as a multivariate index of information distribution, unlike univariate analyses. However, it is worth highlighting that even if an ROI shows an effect of age on this spread measure, such an effect could instead be explained by a non-specific mechanism that represents the same information in tandem across multiple regions (rather than reflecting compensation) as seen previously (Knights et al., 2021; also see Morcom &amp; Johnson, 2015). Thus, it is the MVB boost analysis that is the most compelling assessment of functional compensation because it can directly detect novel information representation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2: [Public Review] (2) Relatedly, does the observed boost in decoding by adding the cuneal ROI (in older adults) really reflect &quot;additional, non-redundant&quot; information carried by this ROI? Or could it be that this boost is just a statistical phenomenon that is obtained because the cuneus just happens to show a more clear-cut, less noisy difference in hard vs. easy task activation patterns than does the MDN (which itself may suffer from increased neural inefficiency in older age), and thus the cuneaus improves decoding performance without containing additional (novel) pieces of information (but just more reliable ones)? If so, the compensation account could still be maintained by reference to the less demanding rationale for what constitutes compensation laid out above.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a possibility and have added this as an additional explanation to the Discussion. We have also discussed why we think it is a less likely possibility, but do concede that it cannot be ruled out currently.</p><p>Page-20</p><p>“Another possibility is that the age-related increases in fMRI activations (for hard versus easy) in one or both of our ROIs do not reflect greater fMRI signal for hard problems in older than younger people, but rather lower fMRI signal for easy problems in the older. Without a third baseline condition, we cannot distinguish these two possibilities in our data. However, a reduced “baseline” level of fMRI signal (e.g., for easy problems) in older people is consistent with other studies showing an age-related decline in baseline perfusion levels, coupled with preserved capacity of cerebrovascular reactivity to meet metabolic demands of neuronal activity at higher cognitive load (Calautti et al., 2001; Jennings et al., 2005). Though age-related decline in baseline perfusion occurs in the cuneal cortex (Tsvetanov et al., 2021), the brain regions showing modulation of behaviourally-relevant Cattell fMRI activity by perfusion levels did not include the cuneal cortex (Wu et al., 2023). This suggests that the compensatory effects in the cuneus are unlikely to be explained by age-related hypo-perfusion, consistent with the minimal effect here of adjusting for RSFA (Figure 2C).</p><p>One final possibility is whether the observed boost in decoding from adding the cuneal ROI simply reflects less noisy task-related information (i.e., a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) than the MDN and, consequently, the boosted decoding is the result of more resilient patterns of information (rather than the representation of additional information) based on a steeper age-related decline of SNR in the MDN. Overall then, as none of the explanations above agree with all aspects of the results, to functionally explain the role of the cuneal cortex in this task would require further investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3: [Public Review] (3) On page 21, the authors state that &quot;...traditional univariate criteria alone are not sufficient for identifying functional compensation.&quot; To me, this conclusion is quite bold as I'd think that this depends on the unvariate criterion used. For instance, it could be argued that compensation should be more clearly indicated by an over additive interaction as observed for the relationship of cuneal activity with age and performance (i.e., the activity increase with better performance becomes stronger with age), rather than by an additive effect of age and performance as observed for the prefrontal ROI (see Fig. 2C). In any case, I'd appreciate it if the authors discussed this issue and the relationship between univariate and multivariate results in more detail (e.g. how many differences in sensitivity between the two approaches have contributed), in particular since the sophisticated multivariate approach used here is not widely established in the field yet.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now considered this point further in a section of the Discussion (which is merged with points 1 &amp; 2 above) about the relevance and distinction of univariate / multivariate criteria for functional compensation. As described in text below, whilst we agree that univariate / behavioural approaches have a role in testing functional compensation, we still view the MVB boost analysis to be a particularly compelling approach for assessing this theory.</p><p>Page-22</p><p>“This said, univariate criteria for functional compensation will continue to play a role in hypothesis testing. For instance, the over-additive interaction observed in the cuneal cortex - where the increase in activity with better performance is more pronounced in older adults - offers evidence of compensation compared to the simple additive effect of age and performance observed in the frontal cortex (Figure 2C). However, the conclusions that can be drawn from age-related differences in cross-sectional associations of brain and behaviour are limited, mainly because individual performance differences are largely lifespan-stable (see Lindenberger et al., 2011; Morcom &amp; Johnson, 2015). So far, the two studies that have combined these univariate-behavioral and multivariate approaches to assess functional compensation (i.e., Knights et al., 2021; the present study) have generally found converging evidence regardless of the method used.

Wouldn't it be reasonable to define a criterion based on the same performance measure (correct - incorrect) as used in the main behavioural analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, though if we were to exclude participants using a chance level exclusion rate based on the formulae used for measuring behavioural performance, this removes identical subjects to those originally excluded.

Therefore, to balance speed and accuracy, behavioural performance was measured by subtracting the number of incorrect from correct trials and averaging over the hard and easy blocks independently (i.e., ((hard correct - hard incorrect) + (easy correct - easy incorrect))/2; Samu et al., 2017). For assessing reliability and validity, behavioural performance (total number of puzzles correct) was also collected from the same participants during a full version of the Cattell task (Scale 2 Form A) administered outside the scanner at Stage 2 of the Cam-CAN study (Shafto et al., 2014). Both the in- and out-of-scanner measures were z-scored.

If that were true, at least for some regions, the set of ROIs putatively carrying task-related information could be expanded beyond that examined here.

To test whether activity from an ROI is compensatory, we used an ordinal boost measure (Morcom &amp; Henson, 2018; Knights et al., 2021) to assess the contribution of that ROI for the decoding of task-relevant information (Figure 3B). Specifically, Bayesian model comparison assessed whether a model that contains activity patterns from a compensatory ROI and the MDN (i.e., a joint model) boosted the prediction of task-relevant information relative to a model containing the MDN only. The compensatory hypothesis predicts that the likelihood of a boost to model decoding will increase with older age. The dependent measure, for each participant, was a categorical recoding of the relative model evidence to indicate the outcome of the model comparison. The three possible outcomes were: a boost to model evidence for the joint vs. MDN-only model (difference in log evidence &gt; 3), ambiguous evidence for the two models (difference in log evidence between -3 to 3), or a reduction in evidence for the joint vs. MDN-only model (difference in log evidence &lt; -3).These values were selected because a log difference of three corresponds to a Bayes Factor of 20, which is generally considered strong evidence (Lee &amp; Wagenmakers, 2014). Further, with uniform priors, this chosen criterion (Bayes Factor &gt; 3) corresponds to a p-value of p&lt;~.05 (since the natural logarithm of 20 equals three, as evidence for the alternative hypothesis).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 12: [Recommendations for the authors] (7) Adding page numbers would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Page numbers have been added to the manuscript file – apologies for this oversight.</p><p>References</p><p>Green, E., Bennett, H., Brayne, C., &amp; Matthews, F.
