4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] lipids found at the plasma membrane in eukaryotic cells. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids serve a critical role in regulating receptor activation, ion channel gating, endocytosis, and actin nucleation. Here, we describe how PIP5K activity is regulated by cooperative binding to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids and membrane-mediated dimerization of the kinase domain. In contrast to constitutively dimeric phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K, type II PIPK), solution PIP5K exists in a weak monomer–dimer equilibrium. PIP5K monomers can associate with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes and dimerize in a protein density-dependent manner. Although dispensable for cooperative PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding, dimerization enhances the catalytic efficiency of PIP5K through a mechanism consistent with allosteric regulation. Additionally, dimerization amplifies stochastic variation in the kinase reaction velocity and strengthens effects such as the recently described stochastic geometry sensing. Overall, the mechanism of PIP5K membrane binding creates a broad dynamic range of lipid kinase activities that are coupled to the density of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and membrane-bound kinase.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane</kwd><kwd>kinase</kwd><kwd>phosphatidylinositol phosphate lipids</kwd><kwd>PIP5K</kwd><kwd>dimerization</kwd><kwd>PI(4,5)P2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER MCB-2048060</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011348</institution-id><institution>University of Oregon, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>lab startup funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation Challenge Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Geometrically Engineered Cellular Systems</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Groves</surname><given-names>Jay T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Health, NIGMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Research Service Award (NRSA)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Health, NIGMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duewell</surname><given-names>Benjamin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Health, NIGMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM111010-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dimerization promotes nonlinear kinetics in PIP5K-dependent lipid phosphorylation reactions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) lipids are an important class of second messengers that regulate the localization and activity of proteins on every intracellular membrane in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balla, 2013</xref>). Synthesis of PIP lipids is regulated by different classes of lipid kinases and phosphatases that drive the interconversion between PIP lipid species through the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of inositol head groups. Of particular importance to a vast array of signaling pathways are phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] lipids, which comprise a minor phospholipid component of the total cellular membrane composition (i.e., ~2 %) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wenk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nasuhoglu et al., 2002</xref>). PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> serves many important functions in biological processes, including receptor activation, ion channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansen, 2015</xref>), endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zoncu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jost et al., 1998</xref>), and actin network assembly at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Janmey et al., 2018</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms that control PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipid synthesis is critical for deciphering how cells regulate receptor signaling and PIP lipid homeostasis at the plasma membrane.</p><p>Two classes of lipid kinases catalyze the production of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids: phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K, type I PIPK) and phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate 4-kinase (PIP4K, type II PIPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke, 2018</xref>). These two families of lipid kinases differ in substrate specificity; PIP5K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate – PI(4)P, while PIP4K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 5-phosphate – PI(5)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loijens and Anderson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rameh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muftuoglu et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the higher abundance of PI(4)P in the plasma membrane, relative to PI(5)P, the majority of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids are generated from reactions catalyzed by PIP5K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doughman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balla, 2013</xref>). Functionally conserved across eukaryotes, yeast express a single PIP5K enzyme denoted Mss4 (multicopy suppressor of Stt4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshida et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Homma et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desrivières et al., 1998</xref>). In humans, three paralogs – PIP5KA, PIP5KB, and PIP5KC – regulate the production of most PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids found at the plasma membrane.</p><p>Several mechanisms regulate membrane docking of PIP5K, including substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muftuoglu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kunz et al., 2000</xref>), electrostatic interactions with anionic lipids at the cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fairn et al., 2009</xref>), and membrane binding of an amphipathic helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Single-molecule characterization of human PIP5KB has revealed a role for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids in controlling cooperative membrane association and positive feedback during PI(4)P lipid phosphorylation reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>). Structural and biochemical studies indicate that, like PIP4K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burden et al., 1999</xref>), PIP5K can homodimerize in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). In the case of zebrafish PIP5KA (zPIP5KA), dimerization has been shown to be required for lipid kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). It remains unclear whether dimerization regulates membrane docking, ATP binding, or catalysis of PIP5K. Overall, the sequence of molecular interactions that control PIP5K membrane localization and activation has not been elucidated.</p><p>Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to measure the kinetics of PIP lipid phosphorylation on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) in vitro, we previously reported that human PIP5KB catalyzes the phosphorylation of PI(4)P with a positive feedback loop based on association with its reaction product, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the crystal structure of zebrafish PIP5KA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muftuoglu et al., 2016</xref>) and previous biochemical data, we have worked under the assumption that members of the PIP5K protein family function as obligate dimers. However, through comparative single-molecule TIRF (smTIRF) microscope measurements of PIP4K and PIP5K membrane-binding dynamics in vitro we discovered that members of the PIP5K protein family exist in a monomer–dimer equilibrium in solution. At low molecular densities, PIP5K protein family members can associate with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> membranes as a monomer and catalyze the phosphorylation of PI(4)P. Under these conditions, the mechanism of PIP5K-positive feedback is controlled by cooperative binding to the reaction product, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Increasing the surface density of membrane-bound PIP5K promotes dimerization, which further increases the dwell time and enhances the catalytic efficiency of the kinase ~20-fold. Consistent with a mechanism of allosteric regulation, dimerization can increase PIP5K catalytic efficiency independently of enhancing membrane avidity. We find that the increase in kinase activity afforded by membrane-mediated dimerization – more specifically the strong positive feedback it creates – dramatically enhances the PIP5K’s ability to form bistable PIP compositional patterns in the presence of an opposing PIP lipid phosphatase on SLBs. The membrane-mediated dimerization also amplifies stochastic fluctuations in kinase reaction velocity. In the context of spatial confinement, these magnified fluctuations facilitate mechanisms such as the recently reported stochastic geometry sensing, in which bistability and even the deterministic outcome of a competitive reaction may depend on system size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Together, our results highlight a mechanism by which PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding and membrane-mediated dimerization create a broad dynamic range of PIP5K activities that cells can potentially leverage to tune the concentration and spatial distribution of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids on cellular membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PIP4K and PIP5K bind to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> membranes with distinct oligomerization states</title><p>The PIP4K and PIP5K families of lipid kinases both reportedly form homodimeric complexes, but with structurally distinct dimer interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burden et al., 1999</xref>). Consistent with size-exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering (SEC/MALS) data published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2015</xref>, we found that wild-type and the dimerization-deficient zebrafish PIP5KA (zPIP5KA) mutant, D84R, showed distinct SEC elution profiles that reflect the dimeric and monomeric states of each kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, comparing the SEC elution profiles of zPIP5KA and PIP4KB – both predicted to have dimeric molecular weights of 90 kDa – indicated that zPIP5KA eluted slowly compared to PIP4KB and protein molecular weight standards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Differences in the elution profile of zPIP5KA and PIP4KB could be the result of distinct subunit orientations or the oligomerization state. This observation led us to further investigate whether the PIP5K family of proteins generally exists in a monomer–dimer equilibrium, rather than being obligate dimers like PIP4K. Unfortunately, our attempts to measure the strength of PIP5K dimerization in solution using fluorescence polarization anisotropy and analytical ultracentrifugation were unsuccessful. For this reason, we established a single-molecule imaging approach to directly visualize and quantify the propensity of PIP4K and PIP5K proteins in solution to associate with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes as either a monomer or dimer. Deciphering the relationship between PIP5K membrane binding, oligomerization, and catalysis, we describe here the molecular basis of positive feedback during PIP5K-dependent generation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PIP4K and PIP5K can bind to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> membranes with distinct oligomeric states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon showing the kinase domain orientation and proposed oligomerization states of PIP4K and PIP5K homodimers.

For these experiments, genes encoding mNeonGreen (mNG) fused to either PIP4KB or PIP5KB were transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged to remove membranes and debris. We quantified the concentration of mNG-PIP4KB and mNG-PIP5KB in clarified cell lysate using a purified mNG protein standard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Samples containing mNG-labeled kinase were then diluted ~10,000-fold in imaging buffer to a concentration of 10 pM and incubated on supported membranes containing 4% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids. Under these conditions, the resulting surface density of membrane-bound mNG-PIP4KB and mNG-PIP5KB was ~0.03 molecules/µm<sup>2</sup> (or ~100 molecules per field of view) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To quantify the differences in the oligomerization states of membrane-bound mNG-PIP4KB and mNG-PIP5KB, we compared the molecular brightness and diffusion coefficients of single particles by smTIRF microscopy. Intensity line scans through mNG foci revealed that the majority of mNG-PIP4KB molecules were two times brighter compared to membrane-bound mNG-PIP5KB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because mNG-PIP4KB is a obligate dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burden et al., 1999</xref>), the molecular brightness distribution of this lipid kinase set the upper limit for the percentage of detectable dimers in our assay. This was based on the fraction of mNG molecules that formed mature chromophores during expression in HEK293 cells, which was ~80% for mNG-PIP4KB. To determine the oligomerization state of membrane-bound mNG-PIP4KB and mNG-PIP5KB, we performed single-molecule photobleaching experiments. In the case of mNG-PIP4KB, the vast majority of membrane-bound particles photobleached in two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By contrast, single-membrane-bound mNG-PIP5KB particles photobleached in a single step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To measure changes in the molecular brightness distribution, we continuously monitored the fluorescence of either membrane-bound mNG-PIP4KB or mNG-PIP5KB under conditions that promoted stepwise photobleaching. Over the course of a 10 s photobleaching experiment, the molecular brightness distribution for mNG-PIP4KB shifted from bimodal to a single peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). During this time, the fraction of mNG-PIP4KB dimers with two visible mNG fluorophores gradually decreased from ~80% to ~20% of the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). By contrast, the molecular brightness distribution of mNG-PIP5KB remained unimodal throughout the 10 s photobleaching experiment, consistent with mNG-PIP5KB associating with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing membranes predominantly as a monomer at a low protein surface density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). We also observed similar differences in molecular brightness comparing recombinantly expressed and purified PIP4KB and PIP5KB that were chemically labeled with Alexa488 in vitro using Sortase-mediated peptide ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the lower labeling efficiency achieved using Sortase-mediated peptide ligation led us to measure the molecular brightness distribution of PIP5K homologs and paralogs using exclusively mNG fusion proteins in this study. Comparing the molecular brightness distributions of mNG-PIP5KA (mouse), mNG-PIP5KB (human), mNG-PIP5KC (human), mNG-zPIP5KA (zebrafish), and mNG-yMss4 (yeast multicopy suppressor of Stt4 or yeast phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase), we also observed only single peaks corresponding to monomeric kinases labeled with a single fluorescent mNG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Photobleaching analysis of membrane-bound mNG-PIP5KA and mNG-zPIP5KA produced similar single-step photobleaching results to those observed for mNG-PIP5KB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with mNG-PIP5K and mNG-PIP4K binding to membranes as either monomers and dimers, respectively, the two lipid kinases also exhibited strikingly different diffusivity when membrane bound. At low surface densities (~0.01 molecules/µm<sup>2</sup>), the mobility of mNG-PIP4KB (0.04 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) was much slower compared to mNG-PIP5K homologs and paralogs (0.15–0.18 µm<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). These diffusion coefficients were very similar to that measured for PIP5KB labeled with an Alexa647 chemical dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that membrane binding of the mNG kinases in dilute cell lysate is indistinguishable from recombinantly purified and fluorescently labeled enzymes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Protein density-dependent changes in PIP5K membrane binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Supported lipid bilayer assay for measuring the single-molecule membrane-binding behavior Ax647-PIP5KB at low and high membrane surface densities of PIP5KB.

This supports a model that PIP5K exists in a weak monomer–dimer equilibrium in solution. However, membrane association reduces the effects of translational and rotational entropy, both of which oppose dimerization in solution, enabling even weakly dimerizing species in solution to robustly dimerize on membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, we anticipated that membrane binding of PIP5K would favor dimerization at some threshold membrane surface density. In order to characterize PIP5K dimerization as a function of membrane surface density, we performed single-molecule-tracking experiments in the presence of low (~0.01 molecules/µm<sup>2</sup>) and high (~100 molecules/µm<sup>2</sup>) densities of membrane-bound PIP5KB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These measurements reveal molecular binding dwell time on the membrane as well as diffusive mobility, both of which are affected by dimerization. For the single-molecule dwell time measurements, we switched to using the more photostable Alexa647 dye (referred to as Ax647) conjugated to either PIP4KB or PIP5KB (τ<sub>bleach</sub> = 26.7 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the presence of a low density of noninteracting Ax647-PIP5KB monomers (i.e., 1–5 pM solution concentration), the distribution of single-molecule dwell times could be fit to a single exponential with a characteristic dwell time of ~0.45 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). When we increased the solution concentration of dark unlabeled PIP5KB, we observed a second population of long dwelling Ax647-PIP5KB molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). At concentrations greater than 1 nM dark unlabeled PIP5KB, the resulting dwell time distributions for Ax647-PIP5KB were best fit to a two-species model with two characteristic dwell times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In addition to observing an enhancement in the dwell time, we also observed a protein surface density-dependent decrease in the diffusion coefficient of membrane-bound Ax647-PIP5KB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Two-dimensional mobility on the membrane has previously been used as a highly effective measure of membrane surface dimerization reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2019</xref>).

concentration, we used a method previously established by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galush et al., 2008</xref> to measure the membrane surface density of Ax647-PIP5KB compared to a fluorescent lipid standard. Using defined molar concentrations of Atto655-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Atto655-DPPE) lipids incorporated into supported membranes, we calibrated the fluorescence intensity in order to measure the surface density of membrane-bound Ax647-PIP5KB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This approach overcame the challenges associated with using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to quantify the high membrane surface density of slow-diffusing Ax647-PIP5KB. These measurements revealed two nonlinear membrane-binding behaviors of Ax647-PIP5KB. First, the density of membrane-bound Ax647-PIP5KB dramatically increased as a function of the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Second, increasing the solution concentration promoted cooperative membrane binding of Ax647-PIP5KB based on elevated protein densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Fitting the membrane-binding curves with a concerted model for cooperativity yielded dissociation constants of 212 nM and 52 nM for Ax647-PIP5KB in the presence of 2% and 4% PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To determine whether the density-dependent change in the dwell time and the step-size distributions of Ax647-PIP5KB were dependent on dimerization of the kinase domain, we sought to characterize a mutant that disrupts the PIP5KB dimer interface.</p><p>Inspection of the zPIP5KA crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2015</xref>) and primary amino acid sequence alignment revealed a high degree of conservation between PIP5K homologs and paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Based on conservation of the primary amino acid sequence, we mutated the dimer interface of human PIP5KB to make the kinase constitutively monomeric. Using smTIRF microscopy, we compared the dwell times and diffusion coefficients of Ax647-PIP5KB and Ax647-PIP5KB (D51R) under conditions with either low and high protein densities on SLBs. When measured at a low protein surface density (~0.01 molecule/µm<sup>2</sup>), the PIP5KB (D51R) mutant still bound cooperatively to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids in a manner that was indistinguishable from the wild-type kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Under these conditions, the diffusion coefficients of membrane-bound Ax647-PIP5KB and Ax647-PIP5KB (D51R) were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, single-molecule membrane-binding experiments performed using a high kinase surface density (~100 molecules/µm<sup>2</sup>) revealed that the single-molecule dwell time of Ax647-PIP5KB increased, while the dwell time of the D51R mutant remained unchanged in the presence of 50 nM unlabeled PIP5KB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In addition, the diffusion coefficient of wild-type Ax647-PIP5KB decreased due to membrane-mediated dimerization, while diffusivity of Ax647-PIP5KB (D51R) remained unchanged in the presence of 50 nM dark PIP5KB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PIP5K binds cooperatively to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> independent of dimerization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Kinase domain orientation for the zebrafish PIP5KA homodimer (4TZ7.pdb).

For these experiments, we recombinantly expressed and purified mNG-PIP5KB and mNG-PIP5KB (D51R). Based on the SEC elution profiles, mNG-PIP5KB and mNG-PIP5KB (D51R) adopted distinct oligomerization states when loaded at a solution concentration of 50 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This concentration is approximately 1000× greater compared to the reported cellular concentration of PIP5K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hein et al., 2015</xref>).

In previous studies, PIP5KB was shown to exhibit higher-order positive feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>). One potential source of higher-order positive feedback is through the ability of PIP5K to bind to multiple PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids. However, mapping the feedback strength based on the reaction coordinate revealed that dimerization is predominantly responsible for PIP5K higher-order positive feedback. Together, these results provide strong evidence that dimerization enhances the activity of PIP5K by both enhancing the membrane avidity and potentiating lipid kinase activity through a mechanism that is consistent with allosteric regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PIP5K dimerization increases the stability of PIP compositional patterns</title><p>The PIP5KB positive feedback mechanism previously enabled us to reconstitute a bistable lipid kinase–phosphatase competitive reaction that breaks symmetry and produces PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> compositional patterns on supported membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>). Based on the ability of PIP5KB to undergo membrane-mediated dimerization and the corresponding nonlinear positive feedback, we hypothesized the kinetic bistability in this system could be dependent on membrane-mediated dimerization. To test this hypothesis, we compared the ability of PIP5KB and the PIP5KB (D51R) dimer interface mutant to form bistable PIP compositional patterns in the presence of an opposing 5-phosphatase with engineering positive feedback based. This was achieved by fusing a minimal PI(4)P binding motif, referred to as DrrA (or SidM/DrrA), to OCRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hammond et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). The resulting chimeric 5-phosphatase, DrrA-OCRL, was previously shown to exhibit positive feedback based on PI(4)P recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>). In the presence of 50 nM PIP5KB (WT or D51R) and 30 nM DrrA-OCRL, we found that the activity of the D51R dimer mutant was strongly impaired compared to wild-type PIP5KB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Restoring the PIP5KB dimer interface with a charge reversal mutation, D51R/R254D, allowed us to reconstitute bistable compositional patterns that were indistinguishable from those formed in the presence of wild-type PIP5K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Again, the behavior of PIP5KB (D51R/R254D) indicated that the D51R mutation does not structurally harm the kinase. Taking into consideration the weakened positive feedback of the dimer mutant, we raised the solution concentration of PIP5KB (D51R) until we were able to balance the opposing 5-phosphatase activity.

The dimer mutant, however, shows only linear positive feedback (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) but still shows at least transient bistability in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>. This is a manifestation of stochastic bistability, referring to bistable behavior in systems that inherently lack two stable steady states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bishop and Qian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artyomov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">To and Maheshri, 2010</xref>). For the wild-type PIP5KB, dimerization enhances stochastic variation in reaction rate and thus we hypothesize will expand the range of conditions over which bistable behavior is possible, even spanning beyond the boundaries of intrinsic bistability. To test this hypothesis, we examine competitive reactions with OCRL phosphatase for PIP5KB and PIP5KB (D51R) under geometric confinement, where stochastic effects are prominent. Reconstitution of the PIP5KB and OCRL competitive reactions in 5 μm × 5 μm membrane corrals reveals strong bistability, reaching final membrane compositions in each corral consisting of steady states dominated by either PI(4)P or PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

This effect is independent of increasing membrane avidity of PIP5K. Due to a lack of structural biochemistry, there is currently a gap in knowledge concerning the role dimerization, PIP lipid binding, and the nucleotide state serve in regulating conformational states of PIP5K. Given our limited structural understanding of PIP5K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muftuoglu et al., 2016</xref>), some researchers have used molecular dynamic simulations to elucidate how membrane docking of PIP5K is controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amos et al., 2019</xref>). Working under the assumption that PIP5K is constitutively dimeric, Amos et al. reported that only a single kinase domain can engage substrate when the dimer is docked on a PI(4)P-containing membrane. Consistent with this observation, we find that the dimerization modestly enhanced membrane binding. If this mechanism is accurate, membrane-mediated dimerization is expected to enhance processivity of membrane-bound PIP5K by allowing kinase domains to toggle between states of catalysis and membrane binding. This mechanism would ensure that dimeric PIP5K remains bound to the membrane during enzyme catalysis, while the monomeric PIP5K would likely catalyze a single PI(4)P phosphorylation reaction before dissociating. According to our single-molecule biophysical studies, we believe that both subunits of the PIP5K kinase domain can engage the membrane. This is based on the enhanced dwell time and slower diffusion coefficient observed when Ax647-PIP5K is visualized is high protein density (i.e., ~100 molecules/µm<sup>2</sup>).

Here, we report that dimerization is responsible for the higher-order positive feedback exhibited by PIP5K, and this contributes to the robustness with which this system exhibits stochastic geometry sensing. Without dimerization, PIP5K displays a simple linear positive feedback profile. Comparing the lipid phosphorylation reaction trajectory variation of PIP5KB and PIP5KB (D51R) highlights how dimerization enhances stochasticity of lipid kinase phosphorylation reactions and will thus amplify any effects dependent on stochastic fluctuations. Given the broad dynamic range of kinase densities and activities that can emerge from these biochemical mechanisms, stochasticity in PIP5K signaling has the potential to strongly influence signaling events orchestrated at the plasma membrane in living cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>PIP5K localization and lipid kinase activity in cells</title><p>The strong lipid phosphorylation activity of PIP5K observed in vitro raises questions about the steady-state localization and activity of PIP5K in cells.

Based on the weak monomer–dimer equilibrium, PIP5K is predicted to exist predominantly as a monomer in the cytoplasm. However, receptor activation could shift the steady-state localization of PIP5K to favor membrane-dependent dimerization and enhanced lipid kinase activity. This could be achieved by increasing PIP5K membrane recruitment through interactions with receptors, endocytic machinery, or small GTPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Halstead et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Honda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funakoshi et al., 2010</xref>).

Cell lysate was aliquoted and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. We did not observe any difference in the quality of the mNG-labeled protein comparing fresh versus freeze-thawed cell lysate.</p><p>To determine the concentration of mNG-tagged lipid kinase in HEK293T cell lysate we generated a twofold serial dilution of bacterially purified mNG diluted in 1× PBS (pH 7.4) and 0.1% NP-40 detergent. The fluorescence intensity was measured using a BioTek 96-well format using a plate reader to generate a standard curve for fluorescence intensity as a function of mNG concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). mNG was excited with a 500 nm light using a 500/10 nm bandpass filter. The emission was monitored at 517 nm with high photomultiplier tube (PMT) sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantitative fluorescence microscopy using supported lipid bilayer standards</title><p>We measured the membrane surface density of Ax647-PIP5KB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) using previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galush et al., 2008</xref>). In brief, we titrated the molar fraction of Atto655-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (Atto655-DPPE; Atto-TEC, Cat# AD 655-151) against DOPC lipids. SUVs were formed using microtip sonication. We used TIRF microscopy to measure the fluorescence intensity of SLBs containing varying concentrations of Atto655-DPPE. These values were used to generate a standard curve that was used to calculate the surface density of membrane-bound Alexa647-PIP5KB. In order to compare the fluorescence intensity of Alexa647-PIP5KB to Atto655-DPPE, we calculated the scaling factor that accounts for the difference in molecular brightness of the two fluorophores measured on the same microscope with identical camera settings, laser power, filters, and optics. To determine the scaling factor, we measured the fluorescence intensity of solutions containing identical concentrations of either Alexa647-PIP5KB or SUVs containing the same molar concentration of Atto655-DPPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). These solutions were added to an imaging chamber passivation with a supported membrane (95% DOPC and 5% DOPS) in order to prevent nonspecific absorption of Alexa647-PIP5KB and SUVs containing Atto655-DPPE. To measure the solution intensity of the Alexa647-PIP5KB and Atto655-DPPE-containing samples, we choose a z-axis imaging plane that was 5 µm above the glass surface and acquired at least 20 fluorescence measurements for each solution concentration. These fluorescence intensity values were averaged and plotted as a function of the fluorophore solution concentration. The scaling factor was calculated by dividing the slope of Alexa647-PIP5KB plot by the slope of the Atto655-DPPE plot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Surface density calibration of mNG-PIP5KB</title><p>Densities of mNG-PIP5KB were estimated using a surface density calibration curve of mNG attached to the lipid bilayer. SLB containing 96% DOPC and 4% Ni-NTA-DOGS by molar percent was incubated with His6-mNG with concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 10 nM in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 150 mM NaCl, 200 µg/mL beta-casein, 5 mM BME for 30 min. The chambers were rinsed with 1 mL of buffer and a calibration curve was established between the TIRF average intensity and surface densities measured by FCS of mNG on the membrane using previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2018</xref>). The same calibration curve was used to estimate the surface density of mNG-PIP5KB. The kinetic measurements were performed on SLB containing 96% DOPC and 4% PI(4)P by molar percent, with the presence of 20 nM Cy3-PLCδ to monitor the change of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. The total PIP lipid was calculated to be at 55,555 lipids/µm<sup>2</sup>. The start and end of the reaction were approximated to have 0 and 55,555 lipids/µm<sup>2</sup> of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, respectively. Images were acquired at a 2 s interval.

The coverslips were dried by nitrogen gas, then baked on 120°C hot plate for 5 min. S1805-positive photoresist were spin-coated on the coverslips by spinning for 2 s at 500 rpm (ACL 440), then for 30 s at 4111 rpm (ACL 3900). The photoresist on the edge of the coverslips were removed by cotton swap soaked with acetone, then baked on 120°C hot plate for 1 min. Mask with desired pattern was mounted on an OAI Series 200 Aligner. The photoresist-coated coverslip was exposed for 0.6 s with UV power around 30 mJ, then developed with MicroPosit MF-321 Liquid Developer for 40 s with mild shaking. The developed coverslips were rinsed with water and dried with nitrogen gas. Approximately 9-nM-thick chromium was subsequently deposited on the coverslips using an electron beam evaporator at 1 × 10<sup>–6</sup> torr. Finally, photoresist is lifted from chromium-patterned glass substrates by bath sonication in Dow Electronic Materials MicroPosit Remover 1165 for 10 min two times, then washed with water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Microscope hardware and imaging acquisition</title><p>Single-molecule imaging experiments were performed on an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti and Ti2 microscopes using a ×100 Nikon objective (1.49 NA) oil immersion TIRF objective. The macroscopic spatial patterning of PIP compositional patterns and the chromium-patterned SLB were visualized using a ×60 Apo TIRF oil immersion objective (1.45 NA). The x-axis and y-axis positions were manually controlled using an ASI stage and joystick. All images were acquired using either a iXon Ultra or iXion Life 897 EMCCD camera (Andor Technology Ltd, UK). Fluorescently labeled proteins were excited with either a 488 nm, 561 nm, or 637 nm diode laser (OBIS laser diode, Coherent Inc, Santa Clara, CA) controlled with either a Solemere (Nikon Ti) or Vortran (Nikon Ti2) laser drive with acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) control. The power output measured through the objective for single-particle imaging was 1–3 mW. For dual-color imaging of spatial PIP lipid patterns on SLBs, samples were excited with 0.2–0.5 mW 488 nm and 0.2–0.5 mW 637 nm light, as measured through the objective. Excitation light was passed through the following dichroic filter cubes before illuminating the sample: (1) ZT488/647rpc and (2) ZT561rdc (ET575LP) (Semrock). Fluorescence emission was detected on an ANDOR EMCCD camera position after a Sutter emission filter wheel housing the following emission filters: ET525/50M, ET600/50M, ET700/75M (Semrock). All experiments were performed at room temperature (23°C). Microscope hardware was controlled using both Micro-Manager v4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>) and Nikon NIS elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Single-particle tracking</title><p>Fluorescent particle detection and tracking was performed using the ImageJ/Fiji TrackMate plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>). Image stacks containing ~1000 16-bit image stacks in the form of a .nd2 file or .tif stack were loaded in ImageJ. Image sequences were cropped to 400 × 400 pixels in order to minimize differences in field illumination caused by TIRF illumination. Using the LoG detector option, particles were identified based on brightness and their signal-to-noise ratio. After identifying the position of all fluorescent particles, we used the LAP tracker to generate particle trajectories that followed molecular displacement as a function of time. Particle trajectories were then filtered based on Track Start (removed trajectories that began in first frame), Track End (removed trajectories present in last frame), Duration (removed trajectories ≤2 frames), Track displacement (removed immobilized particles), and X – Y location (removed particles near the edge of the images). Trajectories were filtered to remove 1–5% of particles that were immobilized throughout the image sequence. The TrackMate output files were analyzed using Prism to calculate the single-molecule dwell times and diffusion coefficients.</p><p>Step-size distribution of single-particle trajectories was plotted in Prism. For all analyses presented in this article, the bin size for the step-size distribution equals 0.01 µm. For curving fitting, the step-size distributions were plotted as probability density versus step size (µm). This was achieved by dividing the frequency distribution (i.e., y-axis values) by the bin size (0.01 µm).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Janice L Robertson as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In general, the reviewers found this paper to be of high interest, presenting exciting results leading to a mechanistic understanding of regulation of pattern forming behavior by PIP5K kinase in membranes. While the data presented was mostly convincing, there are concerns about the interpretation of whether this is dimer specific or related to higher-order oligomerization. In addition, the study suffers from a lack of clarity in the writing, as well as inconsistencies and shortcomings in data presentation. Specifically, the following revisions are required:</p><p>1) While there is evidence of linkage to oligomerization, the overall interpretation that the mechanism is specifically linked dimerization is not strongly supported. To address this, the studies that are currently presented require additional clarification, and control experiments are necessary to map out the dimer specific signal on membranes. Alternatively, the mechanism may be modified to consider that this effect may come from an ensemble of higher-order oligomeric states. With this, the paper and the title require significant revisions to clarify this point.</p><p>2) Sample sizes, errors and statistical tests must be calculated and clearly presented in the paper and in the figure legends. In its current form, it is not possible to assess whether the results presented are reproducible.</p><p>3) The writing needs significant revisions to improve coherency and clarity. The manuscript should be revised to improve accessibility for a broad group of readers, with improved background and discussion of the physical concepts and equations that are presented. In addition, the discussion should be revised to better related the current findings to recently published studies.</p><p>4) Address the specific comments and questions raised by the reviewers below.</p><p>Overall, the study would benefit from editing to improve coherency and clarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The results presented in the size exclusion chromatography analysis (Figure 1B) need some clarification. There is a hypothesized dimer peak for PIP4K, monomer peak for zPIP5KA/D84R and a sharp monodispersed peak for zPIP5KA, that is interpreted as a monomer/dimer mix. While rapid monomer-dimer exchange might account for this, it is surprising that such as mixture is not smeared over both monomer and dimer elution volumes. Changes in column behavior can also create the appearance of peak shifts and so additional calibration is necessary in order to be able to interpret this data. The protein samples should be run with a calibration sample that can control for changes in column behavior and also allow the identification of expected peak positions. In addition, the protein concentration prior to loading should be controlled, as this can also lead to observation of different oligomeric species. An alternate method that often presents clearer results is cross-linking the dilute protein sample by something like glutaraldehyde and the running on SDS-PAGE. This may be used to rule out higher-order oligomeric species.</p><p>2. The brightness analysis presented in Figure 1D,E indicates either that the mNG is folded and fluorescent with 100% yield, or that the PIP4KB being observed is a higher order oligomer than dimer. The PIP4KB intensity distribution in Figure 1E shows very little overlap with the monomeric distributions, and a broad intensity distribution that is 2-3 fold greater that the monomeric samples. Considering binomial labeling probabilities, with around 80% labeling efficiency, a dimer is expected to yield nearly equal probabilities of single and double labelled species, which does appear to be the case for the fluorophore labelled protein presented in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2. For the mNG samples, it is rare for the fluorophore to fold with 100% efficiency, and so it is more probable that the resultant intensity distribution corresponds to &gt; 2 proteins. Photobleaching analysis of the spots would reveal clearer information and test whether higher-order oligomeric species are present.</p><p>3. The statement of weak monomer-dimer equilibrium is not strongly supported by the presented data. To say this, one would need to show a reversible monomer to dimer conversion as a function of protein density, such as an association isotherm. While the data presented shows clear evidence of monomers, the change in behavior with protein concentration is in line with higher order oligomerization. This is even diagrammed in Figure 2A. To isolate the dimer-specific species signal, functional cross-linking of the protein might be useful to switch the protein from monomeric to dimeric states and characterize the dimer-specific signal at low protein densities.</p><p>4. The major argument for the effects being dimerization dependent are from the results of the D51R mutation, as it is interpreted that this mutation solely affects dimerization. However, it seems plausible that other things may change in the protein that impact catalytic activity that are outside of the dimerization. It is unclear as to whether this particular mutant is well folded on its own, thus further analysis of the protein would be useful here. Is the binding and catalytic activity preserved for D51R in solution, and how does this compare to wild-type under monomeric conditions? If dimerization was observable, for example via AUC, then this would also provide supportive evidence of the fold, as well as report the change in stability.</p><p>5. The binding curves for PIP5KA to the membrane in Figure 2F are very clear and present interesting results on the different binding capacities as a function of PIP2. Since the lower leg of the monomer-oligomer equilibrium reaction on the membrane (Figure 4D) will be dependent on the membrane associated protein density, it is important to have this full binding relationship for all constructs in order to interpret the results from the different experiments. As such, this information seems essential for the interpretation of the D51R data. While the dwell time and diffusion distributions show similar behavior to WT, this only reports on the behavior of the molecules that are bound and are all likely to be monomers under the examined conditions (Figure 3C,D). It does not directly report on whether there is the same amount of D51R vs. WT on the membrane. In this case, the data presented in Figure 5, is not expected to have the same amount of membrane bound PIP5K, which could account for the differences in behavior rather than dimerization. Indeed, the addition of 1 μm of D51R increases the observation of the compositional patterns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is not a weakness but rather a limitation that the study is not extended experimentally into real cell situations and only speculates about the potential impact of its finding to the control of the enzymes in real cells.</p><p>2. Some of the methods and terms should be defined and explained for the general reader: e.g. It would be useful to define &quot;dwell time&quot; or explain what the Y axis is in Figure 2B. (for example what is CDF?).</p><p>3. Similarly, the detailed description of how the catalytic activity of the enzymes were calculated (lines 270-310) is important for the experts. However, it would be desirable to &quot;translate&quot; the following sentences to the general reader.</p><p>&quot;When the derivative of the PIP5K kinase reaction traces were plotted against the reaction coordinate, x, the curve displayed a high degree of asymmetry that required a second-order term to fit (kWT(x) = k0 + k1x + k2x2) (Figure 4E). In contrast, the dx⁄dt curve for the dimer mutant was parabolic and could be fit using an equation that describes an enzyme with first order positive feedback (kD51R(x) = k0 + k1x) based on product binding (Figure 4E).&quot; This may not be necessary if the paper is published in a biophysical journal, but for most of the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>, this description is not very accessible.</p><p>4. The legend to Figure 4 Supplement 1. does not really describe what is measured here. First of all, what is measured as &quot;auto-correlation&quot; should be explained. It is not clear what the different colors mean (the concentrations refer to what component?). Panel A-C appear to show graphs on the various PIP5KB forms (wt or mutants), but the Figure legend for panel A does not refer to PIP5KB.</p><p>5. The same is true for the legend to Figure 4 Supplement 2. From the description, one would expect to see three similar measurements for the three forms of the enzyme. Clearly, panel A shows a curve that is not explained. Panels B and C show FCS density as a function of TIRF intensity. What is measured here (what is FCS density?)? How do these curves inform about lipid kinase activity? Clearly, the Authors should do better to explain what is shown here and how does that translate to kinase activity.</p><p>6. I think the DrrA designation of what is better known as SidM should at least be clearly stated somewhere (preferably also in the Figure legends).</p><p>7. Remove the prime from all &quot;5'-phosphatase&quot;. There are no prime numbers on the inositol ring just simple numbers designating the positions on the single carbon ring.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Line 150 and Figure 1B: The authors are referring to a dimer mutant of PIP5K. They need to clarify if that means that the protein is locked in its dimerized state or if the dimerization interface is disrupted and thus the protein resides in its monomeric state. If, as indicated by the 'dimer mutant' reference the protein should be locked in a dimer state, why does the SEC elution profile and their annotation rather indicate that the protein elutes as a monomer? Also, it would be beneficial for the reader to indicate the name of the dimer mutant in the text.</p><p>2. Figure 1 Supplement 2: Monomer/dimer distribution of mNG-PIP4K in Figure 1E are considerably different to the ones shown for the Alexa488-PIP4K version in supplement 2. Is there a reason for this comparison, especially as the authors are later introducing another chemical label with the Alexa647-conjugation construct? They should rather repeat the experiment with the Alexa647-conjugation construct that they are using later on.</p><p>3. Figure 1B: In Figure 1B, the 'dimer' mutant of PIP5K is annotated as zPIP5KA(D84R), however in the respective figure caption, it is referred to as zPIP5KA(D51R) mutant – which one now is the correct mutant? The authors should use a size standard to calibrate the SEC elution profiles to ensure the correct detection of monomers and dimers (SEC-MALS would be even better suited). The critical reader would furthermore like to see an SDS-PAGE gel of the purified proteins, as especially the elution profile of PIP5K indicates impurities.</p><p>4. Figure 1C/D: The authors should indicate the abbreviations of both proteins in the respective figure captions.</p><p>5. How do the authors account for bleaching in their TIRF single particle tracking assay?</p><p>6. Supplementary Figure 1A: What is the reproducibility of the mNG-calibration curve for the quantitative analysis of kinase presence in the cell lysate? As indicated in the figure caption, only a representative curve is shown, however adding standard errors for each concentration and the indication of the number of replicates would need to be included.</p><p>7. Lines 180-181: Several mNG-fusion constructs are named, but it is completely unclear for the reader what they are, as they have not been introduced (e.g. mNG-PIP5KA/B/C or mNG-yMss4?). Even more importantly, in Figure 1E, which is the figure that has been referenced in the text, there are again other abbreviations for the used constructs that do not fit the ones named in the text or have not been referenced in the text. Likewise, also no consistency between the abbreviations between Figures 1E and F. the authors need to clarify this and keep the names of constructs consistent throughout the whole text, figures, and supplementary information.</p><p>8. Figure 1F: The authors are referring to a step size distribution in the figure caption, but at the same time state diffusion coefficients for the respective constructs – they need to elaborate on how exactly they got the diffusion coefficients from the step size distribution, more specifically: what kind of fitting they used. As in Figure 2C, the fit should also be included in the plot. Furthermore, what is the error and standard deviation for the diffusion coefficients? It would be beneficial for the reader to also state the deviations in lines 190/191.</p><p>9. As stated in line 192, the authors are comparing the diffusion coefficients of the cell lysate kinases with purified kinases in Figure 2C. However, in the two cases different membrane compositions have been used – in Figure 1F they state that 2 % PIP2 have been used, while in Figure 2C 4 % have been incorporated. Why do they change the proportion of PIP2 in the membrane between the two cases? This inconsistency especially impedes their assumption in line 193, that the membrane binding of kinases in the cell lysate is indistinguishable from the purified case.</p><p>10. Figure 2B: For readers that are not familiar with single particle tracking, the cumulative density function should be introduced in the caption of the figure or even in the axis label. Same comment for Figure 3CDE.</p><p>11. Figure 2C: Again, a new abbreviation is being introduced for PIP5KB.</p><p>12. Figure 2F: Error bars are missing and SEM of Kd values. In the respective caption, they should state the number of independent replicates. They also need to indicate in the caption that the nh – values they are referring to in the figure are the Hill coefficients. The manuscript would benefit considerably if they would repeat the experiments shown in this Figure also with the D51R mutant – especially as they are comparing the mutant with the wild type throughout the manuscript, and only for Kd values the respective differences cannot be judged. Similar comment for Figure 4AB regarding error bars and replicate numbers.</p><p>13. Figure 3CD: The authors need to indicate in the caption or the figure that this is a low protein density condition.</p><p>14. Figure 3F: Please state the respective diffusion coefficients you have obtained from the used fit. Same comment for Supplementary Figure 3 (and adjust x-axis label to be consistent with similar graphs).</p><p>15. Supplementary Figure 4 (Figure supplement 1 and 2): It seems like the Figure captions of Supplementary Figure 4 Supplement 1 and 2 have been mistaken for each other – please readjust.</p><p>16. Supplementary Figure 4 (Figure supplement 1): In panel B apparently different protein concentrations have been used compared to panels A and C – why?</p><p>17. Supplementary Figure 4 (Figure supplement 2): Panels BC – Please indicate error bars and replicate numbers.</p><p>18. Figure 4A: Why don't the authors compare the reaction half-times of wild-type and the D51R mutant at similar concentrations to enable a more direct comparison between the two? Are the reaction half-times based on the kinetic traces seen in the respective supplementary Figure? If yes, why is there such a difference in the reaction half-time between the trace at 1 nM PIP5K in the supplement (roughly 160 seconds) and the 280 seconds stated in the main Figure? Why are the traces for higher PIP5K concentrations not included in the supplement?</p><p>19. Figure 2 and Figure 4: Why is the fluorescence of a membrane dye used to calibrate for PIP5K membrane density in Figure 2, whereas a more sensitive FCS-approach is used in Figure 4 to do the same? They should have likewise measured FCS for the Alexa-fusion construct in Figure 2.</p><p>20. Lines 294-301: in Line 296, the authors give a definition of the reaction coordinate x. However, they are not defining the omega factor that they are using, and it is not clear what they mean with PIP1 and PIP2 – should that be the educt and product? Please clarify and annotate in the text.</p><p>21. Lines 324-325: Please add the information that the DrrA-OCRL construct is the opposing 5`-phosphatase.</p><p>22. Figure 5B: What is meant with 0`-9`? Are these frame numbers (if yes what is the time difference between them? If the numbering should indicate time – what unit is it? Same question for Figure 6A).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Membrane-mediated dimerization potentiates PIP5K lipid kinase activity&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This is supported by control experiments analyzing the stepwise photobleaching of single membrane bound particles of mNG-PIP5K and mNG-PIP4K. Consistent with SEC data, our single molecule experiments do not show any evidence of high-order oligomers forming on supported membranes. In the Discussion section, we speculate that high-order oligomers can potentially form. However, there is currently no direct evidence to support the formation of high-ordered PIP5K oligomers. If such a mechanism exists, future structural biochemistry studies will be necessary to identify a new protein-protein binding interface that mediate this unknown interaction.</p><p>During our revision, we established new experimental conditions to directly visualize membrane mediated dimerization of mNG-PIP5KB monomers, while still being able to spatially resolve single molecules (see Figure 4). The small fraction of dimeric mNG-PIP5KB species observed on membranes is absent from the population when we characterize the dimerization deficient mutant, PIP5KB (D51R). The efforts to directly visualize mNG-PIP5KB were made possible by a graduate student, Benjamin Duewell. In our revised manuscript, Benjamin is now included as a contributing author.</p><p>The reviewers suggested that we modify the title of our manuscript to state that PIP5K activity is potentiated by higher order oligomerization of PIP5K, rather than dimerization.

The results presented in the size exclusion chromatography analysis (Figure 1B) need some clarification. There is a hypothesized dimer peak for PIP4K, monomer peak for zPIP5KA/D84R and a sharp monodispersed peak for zPIP5KA, that is interpreted as a monomer/dimer mix. While rapid monomer-dimer exchange might account for this, it is surprising that such as mixture is not smeared over both monomer and dimer elution volumes. Changes in column behavior can also create the appearance of peak shifts and so additional calibration is necessary in order to be able to interpret this data. The protein samples should be run with a calibration sample that can control for changes in column behavior and also allow the identification of expected peak positions. In addition, the protein concentration prior to loading should be controlled, as this can also lead to observation of different oligomeric species. An alternate method that often presents clearer results is cross-linking the dilute protein sample by something like glutaraldehyde and the running on SDS-PAGE. This may be used to rule out higher-order oligomeric species.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a good point concerning the limitations of our SEC analysis. We also agree that it’s surprising the zPIP5KA monomer/dimer mix is not distributed over a broad peak. The main purpose of the SEC data included in our manuscript was to confirm previously reported results from Hu et al. (2015), who reported a similar elution profile to ours. Since our SEC data is confirmation of published results and less conclusive compared to our single molecule imaging experiments, we moved the SEC data from Figure 1 to the Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 in our revised manuscript. To strengthen our SEC data, we ran several protein molecular weight standards over our Superdex 200 column, which we compare to the elution profiles of PIP4KB, zPIP5KA, and zPIP5KA(D84R). In addition, we purified more mNG-PIP5KB (wild type and D51R) and compared their elution profiles on a Superdex 200 column (Figure 4A). To rule out the presence of higher order oligomers we performed single molecule photobleaching experiments (Figure 1).</p><p>Overall, we conclude that wild type and dimerization deficient PIP5K mutants exhibit distinct SEC elution profiles. We and other groups have interpreted this result as representing either the monomeric or dimeric states of PIP5K. However, when mNG-PIP5K is diluted to a sub-nanomolar concentration and characterized by smTIRF microscopy, it appears to be exclusively monomeric based on our molecular brightness analysis. By contrast, when PIP4K is diluted to a sub-nanomolar concentration, it binds to supported membranes exclusively as a dimer. This supports a model in which PIP5K exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium, while PIP4K is a constitutive dimer. Unfortunately, we and others have not been able to measure the K<sub>D</sub> for PIP5K dimerization in solution. This challenge potentially reflects the weak affinity between PIP5K monomers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The brightness analysis presented in Figure 1D,E indicates either that the mNG is folded and fluorescent with 100% yield, or that the PIP4KB being observed is a higher order oligomer than dimer. The PIP4KB intensity distribution in Figure 1E shows very little overlap with the monomeric distributions, and a broad intensity distribution that is 2-3 fold greater that the monomeric samples. Considering binomial labeling probabilities, with around 80% labeling efficiency, a dimer is expected to yield nearly equal probabilities of single and double labelled species, which does appear to be the case for the fluorophore labelled protein presented in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2.

Photobleaching analysis of the spots would reveal clearer information and test whether higher-order oligomeric species are present.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point raised by the reviewer. We believe that part of the confusion concerning our interpretation of PIP4K/PIP5K oligomerization stemmed from the way in which data was <italic>originally plotted</italic> in Figure 1E (i.e. 3D plot with a tilted x-axis). We now provide more extensive experimentation showing that we only observe membrane bound monomers and dimers in our single molecule imaging experiments. Based on our additional characterization, there is no evidence supporting the formation of higher order PIP4K or PIP5K oligomers.</p><p>Based on our spectrophotometry measurements, mNG and mNG-PIP5KB purified from either bacteria or insect cells contain ~80% mature and fluorescent chromophores. This is calculated based on the fraction of purified mNG protein that absorbs light at 517 nm, compared to the total protein concentration calculated based on absorption at 280 nm. Knowing this, a protein that is constitutively dimeric (i.e. PIP4K) will exist as a population of molecules with either 1 or 2 mature mNG proteins when visualized using single molecule TIRF-M. Supporting this notion, we performed single molecule step-photobleaching experiments of mNG-PIP4KB (Figure 1D). By monitoring the maximum pixel intensity of single mNG-PIP4KB molecules, we observed that ~80% of the protein contain 2 mature mNG. We never observed mNG-PIP4KB particles photobleached in more than 2 steps (Figure 1D). By contrast, mNG-zPIP5KA, mNG-PIP5KA, and mNG-PIP5KB all photobleached in a single step (Figure 1E and Figure 1 —figure supplement 4). To quantify changes in molecular brightness during step-photobleaching, we continuously imaged single mNG-PIP4K and mNG-PIP5K particles. In Figure 1F-1G, we show how the distribution of mNG-PIP4K molecular brightness shifts from bimodal to unimodal over the course of the 10 second image acquisition. Conversely, the distribution of mNG-PIP5K molecular brightness remains unimodal because particles always photobleached in a single step. Plotted in Figure 1H, we show how the proportion of mNG-PIP4K and mNG-PIP5K with either 1 or 2 visible mNG molecules changes as a function of time from the beginning of image acquisition.

This result implies that PIP5K must be in a weak monomer-dimer equilibrium. By contrast, dilution of mNG-PIP4KB to a sub-nanomolar concentration does not cause the kinase to dissociate into monomers.

The major argument for the effects being dimerization dependent are from the results of the D51R mutation, as it is interpreted that this mutation solely affects dimerization. However, it seems plausible that other things may change in the protein that impact catalytic activity that are outside of the dimerization. It is unclear as to whether this particular mutant is well folded on its own, thus further analysis of the protein would be useful here. Is the binding and catalytic activity preserved for D51R in solution, and how does this compare to wild-type under monomeric conditions? If dimerization was observable, for example via AUC, then this would also provide supportive evidence of the fold, as well as report the change in stability.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous biochemical analysis of zPIP5KA using SEC/MALS showed that this lipid kinase can form a dimer in solution, while zPIP5KA (D84R) was an apparent monomer by SEC/MALS (Hu et al. 2015, Nature Comm., doi.org/10.1038/ncomms9205). In our hands, we observe the same SEC elution profile for zPIP5KA (wild type and D84R) that was reported by Hu et al. (2015) (see Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). Hu et al. (2015) also previously showed by circular dichroism that mutations that disrupt the zPIP5KA dimer interface do not change the α helical character of the kinase compared to the wild type enzyme. This suggests that the kinase is folded properly.</p><p>Using smTIRF, we show that Ax647-PIP5KB(D51R) at a low membrane surface density still binds cooperatively to PIP<sub>2</sub> lipids (Figure 3D). Dwell time analysis of both PIP5KB (WT and D51R) yielded indistinguishable results (Figure 3C-3D and Table 2). This indicates that the D51R mutant is folded properly, because misfolding would disrupt membrane docking and association with PIP<sub>2</sub> lipids.</p><p>Another strong indication that the D51R mutation only disrupts dimerization is our ability to introduce a structural compensatory mutation (D51R/R254D), which fully restores kinase activity (Figure 5A-5D). If the D51R mutation caused misfolding, the lipid kinase activity would still be reduced in the D51R/R254D mutant.</p><p>Throughout the course of this study, we empirically determined that mutations that disrupt protein folding cause PIP5K to be proteolyzed during expression and purification from insect cells. Prior to the Hu et al. (2015) zPIP5KA crystal structure, Lacalle et al. (2015, FASEB Journal, doi: 10.1096/fj.14-264606) reported that they determined the dimer interface of PIP5K based on a structural homology model built from PIP4K. However, in light of the Hu et al. (2015) structure paper, it’s clear that the Lacalle et al. model for PIP5K dimerization is incorrect. Prior to this knowledge, however, we purified the following mutants from insect cells based on Lacalle et al. (2015) PIP5K dimerization model: F190A/L191A/P192A and L35A/Y39A/N43A. Both of these reported “dimer interface” mutants were unstable and proteolyzed during the purification, presumably due to protein misfolding (data not shown). We were never able to biochemically characterize any of “dimer interface” mutants reported by Lacalle et al. (2015). However, the Hu et al. (2015) crystal structure of zPIP5KA, allowed us to successfully purify the following dimer mutants from insect cells without any proteolysis issues: zPIP5KA (D84R), hPIP5KB (D51R), and mPIP5KA (D92R).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The binding curves for PIP5KA to the membrane in Figure 2F are very clear and present interesting results on the different binding capacities as a function of PIP2. Since the lower leg of the monomer-oligomer equilibrium reaction on the membrane (Figure 4D) will be dependent on the membrane associated protein density, it is important to have this full binding relationship for all constructs in order to interpret the results from the different experiments. As such, this information seems essential for the interpretation of the D51R data. While the dwell time and diffusion distributions show similar behavior to WT, this only reports on the behavior of the molecules that are bound and are all likely to be monomers under the examined conditions (Figure 3C,D). It does not directly report on whether there is the same amount of D51R vs. WT on the membrane. In this case, the data presented in Figure 5, is not expected to have the same amount of membrane bound PIP5K, which could account for the differences in behavior rather than dimerization. Indeed, the addition of 1 μm of D51R increases the observation of the compositional patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for the reviewer for this excellent observation. In our revision, we include a plot that shows the relationship between mNG-PIP5KB solution concentration and membrane binding intensity for both wild type and dimer interface mutant (D51R) (Figure 5F). In addition, we reconstitute the bistable spatial patterning reaction in the presence of mNG-labeled PIP5K (wild type and D51R). We find that PIP lipid compositional pattern created by PIP5KB (D51R) contain 2x more kinase bound to the membrane compared to the wild type kinase (Figure 6B-6D). However, the reduced activity of the dimer mutant prevents mutant kinase from robustly competing against the opposing lipid phosphatase to form a stable domain of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> lipids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

If, as indicated by the 'dimer mutant' reference the protein should be locked in a dimer state, why does the SEC elution profile and their annotation rather indicate that the protein elutes as a monomer?

The main point of this supplemental figure was to emphasize that PIP4KB and PIP5KB can be labeled with different fluorescent probes and we still observe a difference in their molecular brightness distribution. We include this control to emphasize that the difference in distributions shown in Figure 1F-1G is not solely dependent on using mNeonGreen.</p><p>In this study, we did not quantify the molecular brightness distribution of Ax647-PIP4KB or Ax647-PIP5KB. Although labeling with Alexa647 results in a very photostable fluorescent protein (see Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for photobleaching kinetics), the labeling efficiency achieved using Sortase mediated peptide ligation is 25-45% in the presence of Alexa647. We consistently observe this low labeling efficiency independent of the specific protein being labeled. We believe that Sortase generally has a difficult time using the Alexa647-LPETGG peptide as a substrate. Interestingly, Alexa488-LPETGG results in a higher labeled efficiency (50-90%) for all proteins we’ve labeled to date. However, the brightness and photostability of Alexa488 is comparable to mNeonGreen. In this study, we found that mNG kinase fusions were the more reliable option for measuring molecular brightness, because we consistently obtain ~80% mature and fluorescently labeled enzyme. Our revised manuscript notes the measured labeling efficiency in the figure legend. We also include the following discussion the main text of the manuscript concerning the important point raised by the reviewer:</p><p>“We also observed similar differences in molecular brightness comparing recombinantly expressed and purified PIP4KB and PIP5KB that were chemically labeled with Alexa488 in vitro using Sortase mediated peptide ligation (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).

The authors should use a size standard to calibrate the SEC elution profiles to ensure the correct detection of monomers and dimers (SEC-MALS would be even better suited).

Figure 4A: Why don't the authors compare the reaction half-times of wild-type and the D51R mutant at similar concentrations to enable a more direct comparison between the two? Are the reaction half-times based on the kinetic traces seen in the respective supplementary Figure? If yes, why is there such a difference in the reaction half-time between the trace at 1 nM PIP5K in the supplement (roughly 160 seconds) and the 280 seconds stated in the main Figure? Why are the traces for higher PIP5K concentrations not included in the supplement?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying this poorly presented data. In our revision, we include data that directly compares reaction kinetics of lipid phosphorylation in presence of PIP5K, wild type and mutants, measured at the same protein concentrations (Figure 5A-5C). Quantification of the reaction half-times for multiple kinetic traces is now included in Figure 5D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. Figure 2 and Figure 4: Why is the fluorescence of a membrane dye used to calibrate for PIP5K membrane density in Figure 2, whereas a more sensitive FCS-approach is used in Figure 4 to do the same? They should have likewise measured FCS for the Alexa-fusion construct in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript, we present two complementary approaches to quantify the surface density of PIP5K. The use of a fluorescently membrane dye is an established method for quantifying membrane surface densities (see Galush, Nye, and Groves 2008). It has similar sensitivity to FCS measurements.</p><p>The slow diffusivity of Ax647-PIP5KB and mNG-PIP5KB prevented us from directly performing FCS measurements on membrane bound fluorescently labeled PIP5KB. Instead, the FCS data included in our manuscript is a measure of mNG attached to a supported lipid bilayer. The fluorescence intensity and membrane density of mNG was then used to calibrate the fluorescence intensity of other mNG fusion proteins (e.g. mNG-PIP5KB).</p><p>Due to limitation in instrumentation, we were unable to perform additional FSC measurements during the period of the manuscript revision. However, we don’t believe this is critical for interpreting our data and it does not change the conclusions of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20.

After the reaction reached the maximum velocity, the kinetics gradually slowed down due to substrate depletion.
