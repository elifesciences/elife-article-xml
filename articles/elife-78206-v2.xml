Here, we show that CCL28 promotes neutrophil accumulation in the gut of mice infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> and in the lung of mice infected with <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>. Neutrophils isolated from the infected mucosa expressed the CCL28 receptors CCR3 and, to a lesser extent, CCR10, on their surface. The functional consequences of CCL28 deficiency varied between the two infections: <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were highly susceptible to <italic>Salmonella</italic> gut infection but highly resistant to otherwise lethal <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> lung infection. In vitro, unstimulated neutrophils harbored pre-formed intracellular CCR3 that was rapidly mobilized to the cell surface following phagocytosis or inflammatory stimuli. Moreover, CCL28 stimulation enhanced neutrophil antimicrobial activity, production of reactive oxygen species, and formation of extracellular traps, all processes largely dependent on CCR3. Consistent with the different outcomes in the two infection models, neutrophil stimulation with CCL28 boosted the killing of <italic>Salmonella</italic> but not <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>. CCL28 thus plays a critical role in the immune response to mucosal pathogens by increasing neutrophil accumulation and activation, which can enhance pathogen clearance but also exacerbate disease depending on the mucosal site and the infectious agent.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemokines comprise a family of small chemoattractant proteins that play important roles in diverse host processes including chemotaxis, immune cell development, and leukocyte activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zlotnik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charo and Ransohoff, 2006</xref>). The chemokine superfamily includes 48 human ligands and 19 receptors, classified into subfamilies (CC, CXC, C, and CX<sub>3</sub>C) depending on the location of the cysteines in their sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nomiyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hughes and Nibbs, 2018</xref>). Four chemokines predominate in mucosal tissues: CCL25, CCL28, CXCL14, and CXCL17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hernández-Ruiz and Zlotnik, 2017</xref>).</p><p>CCL28, also known as Mucosae-associated Epithelial Chemokine, belongs to the CC (or β-chemokine) subclass, and is constitutively produced in mucosal tissues including the digestive system, respiratory tract, and female reproductive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohan et al., 2017</xref>). Although best studied for its homeostatic functions, CCL28 can also be induced under inflammatory conditions and is thus considered a dual function chemokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>CCL28 signals via two receptors: CCR3 and CCR10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pan et al., 2000</xref>). During homeostasis in mice, CCL28 provides a chemotactic gradient for CCR10<sup>+</sup> B and T cells and guides the migration of CCR10<sup>+</sup> IgA plasmablasts to the mammary gland and other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkhardt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuo et al., 2018</xref>). In a disease context, CCL28 has been best studied in allergic airway inflammation. High CCL28 levels are present in airway biopsies from asthma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O’Gorman et al., 2005</xref>), and CCR3<sup>+</sup> and CCR10<sup>+</sup> cells are recruited to the airways in a CCL28-dependent fashion in murine asthma models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">John et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the human gut, CCL28 is upregulated during inflammation of the gastric mucosa in <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>-infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansson et al., 2008</xref>) and in the colon of patients with ulcerative colitis, a prominent form of inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>). In the mouse gut, CCL28 production is increased in the dextran sulfate sodium model of colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuo et al., 2018</xref>). Epithelial cells are an important source of CCL28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>), and its expression can be induced by stimulation of cultured airway or intestinal epithelial cells with the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1ɑ, IL-1β, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-ɑ, or following <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection of cultured HCA-7 colon carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ogawa et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, a variety of studies have postulated that CCL28 is an important chemokine in inflammatory diseases, ranging from asthma to ulcerative colitis, and during the immune response to infection. Yet, CCL28 function remains understudied, largely because <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice have only recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkhardt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Matsuo et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we investigate the function and underlying mechanism of CCL28 during the mucosal response to infection.</p><p>By comparing infection in <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice and their wild-type littermates, we discovered a key role for CCL28 in promoting neutrophil accumulation to the gut during infection with <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium (STm) and to the lung during infection with multidrug-resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (Ab). Neutrophils isolated from the infected mucosal sites harbored CCL28 receptors, particularly CCR3, on their surface. In vitro, CCR3 was stored intracellularly, and was rapidly detectable on the neutrophil surface upon stimulation with proinflammatory molecules or in response to phagocytosis. Neutrophil stimulation of CCL28 resulted in enhanced neutrophil antimicrobial activity against STm, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and enhanced formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), all processes that help control infection but also cause extensive tissue damage. We conclude that CCL28 plays a previously unappreciated role in the innate immune response to mucosal pathogens by regulating neutrophil accumulation and activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CCL28-mediated responses limit <italic>Salmonella</italic> gut colonization and systemic dissemination</title><p>We investigated CCL28 activity during gastrointestinal infection with STm by using the well-established streptomycin-treated C57BL/6 mouse model of colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walker et al., 2023</xref>). At day 4 post-infection (4 dpi) with STm, we observed a ~fourfold increase of CCL28 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis of feces from wild-type mice relative to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a prior preliminary study, we found that <italic>Ccl28<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice infected with STm exhibited increased lethality compared to their wild-type littermates beginning at day 1 post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burkhardt et al., 2019</xref>). To further elucidate the impact of CCL28 on STm infection dynamics and host responses earlier in the course of infection (2–3 dpi), we examined STm colony-forming units (CFU) in the gastrointestinal contents and extraintestinal tissues. Although there was no significant difference in gastrointestinal CFU between wild-type and <italic>Ccl28<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), higher CFU were observed in extraintestinal tissues by 2 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In contrast, when bypassing the gut and infecting mice intraperitoneally with STm, we also observed a ~fourfold increase in serum CCL28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but equal numbers of STm CFU were recovered from the spleen, liver, and blood of both wild-type and <italic>Ccl28<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice at 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Given the rapid (within 1 hr) increase of neutrophil CCR3 surface expression upon STm infection, we hypothesized that CCR3, akin to CR1, may be stored intracellularly in neutrophils, consistent with reports of intracellular CCR3 in eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spencer et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Uninfected bone marrow neutrophils maintained relatively low surface levels of CCR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), but when permeabilized for intracellular staining, almost all (~99%) were CCR3<sup>+</sup>, indicating intracellular storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Upon STm infection in vitro, bone marrow neutrophils increased CCR3 surface expression as quickly as 5 min post-infection, reaching a maximum of ~30% CCR3<sup>+</sup> neutrophils at 2 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These results suggest mobilization of pre-formed receptor from an intracellular compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Intracellular stores of CCR10 were also detected in some bone marrow neutrophils under homeostatic conditions, with a small but significant increase during STm infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, CCR10 was expressed on the surface of only ~0.3% uninfected bone marrow neutrophils, increasing to ~0.6% during STm infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In vitro, Ab infection induced less CCR3 surface expression on neutrophils relative to STm (~7–10%) and took longer to observe the increased CCR3<sup>+</sup> staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), whereas CCR10 did not significantly increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

SB328437 reversed the effects of both CCL28 and CCL11 on neutrophils, confirming receptor specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). An important mechanism of bacterial killing is the production of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fang, 2011</xref>), which is triggered by infection and enhanced by proinflammatory stimuli including cytokines and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). We measured ROS production by incubating neutrophils with the cell-permeable probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA), which forms the fluorescent byproduct 2′,7′-dichorofluorescein (DCF) when oxidized by ROS, and found that CCL28 stimulation enhanced neutrophil ROS production during STm infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Neutrophils migrate from the bone marrow to the blood and to infected sites following a chemokine gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capucetti et al., 2020</xref>), expressing various chemokine receptors including CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR4, and CCR2, and under certain circumstances, CCR1 and CCR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kobayashi, 2008</xref>). CXCR2 is a promiscuous receptor that binds to the chemokines CXCL1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuja and Murphy, 1996</xref>), whereas CXCR1 only binds CXCL6 and CXCL8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capucetti et al., 2020</xref>). Activation of CXCR2 mobilizes neutrophils from the bone marrow to the bloodstream and participates in NET release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marcos et al., 2010</xref>). Engagement of CXCR1 and CXCR2 also triggers signaling pathways boosting production of cytokines and chemokines that amplify neutrophil responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sabroe et al., 2005</xref>). Following extravasation to the site of infection, neutrophils downregulate CXCR2 and upregulate CCR1, 2, and 5, which cumulatively boosts neutrophil ROS production and phagocytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capucetti et al., 2020</xref>). Our results indicate that CCL28 contributes to neutrophil accumulation and activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), with its receptors CCR3 and CCR10 upregulated in the mucosa during infection, where up to ~50% of neutrophils express surface CCR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The reciprocal regulation of CXCR2 and CCR3/CCR10 in neutrophils and each receptor’s contribution to neutrophil migration and retention during infectious colitis requires further study.</p><p>Although an initial study concluded CCR3 was absent on neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Höchstetter et al., 2000</xref>), subsequent studies reported CCR3 expression on human neutrophils isolated from patients with chronic lung disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hartl et al., 2008</xref>) and on neutrophils isolated from the BAL fluid of mice infected with influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rudd et al., 2019</xref>). Our study demonstrates that a substantial number of neutrophils isolated from infected mucosal sites express CCR3, and fewer express CCR10 on their surface, while resting neutrophils do not express these receptors on their surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The rapid surface expression of CCR3 on neutrophils upon infection suggests that the receptor is stored intracellularly, similar to eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spencer et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, neutrophils isolated from bone marrow, blood, and infected mucosal tissue were all positive for CCR3 intracellular staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In vitro, we could recapitulate the increase in surface receptor expression by incubating bone marrow neutrophils with proinflammatory stimuli (LPS, or the cytokines GM-CSF + IFNγ + TNFɑ) or following phagocytosis of bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). CCL28 stimulation of bone marrow neutrophils in vitro increased their antimicrobial activity and ROS production during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, which was reverted by blocking CCR3 but not CCR10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Platelet-activated neutrophils stimulated with CCL28 also showed enhanced NET formation, largely in a CCR3-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, CCL28 is a potent activator of neutrophils, primarily via CCR3. Further studies with receptor knockout mice are needed to determine the contribution of each CCL28 receptor to the in vivo phenotypes.</p><p>A reduction of neutrophil accumulation was also observed in the BAL and lung of <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice during <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), with neutrophils recruited to the lung harboring surface CCR3 and CCR10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). However, the functional consequence of CCL28 deficiency was strikingly different in this model, as <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were protected during Ab pneumonia. Most <italic>Ccl28<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice survived until the experiment’s endpoint at 10 dpi, whereas nearly all wild-type littermates succumbed by 2 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The lung, possessing a thin, single-cell alveolar layer to promote gas exchange, is less resilient than the intestine to neutrophil inflammation before losing barrier integrity and critical functions. Thus, although insufficient neutrophil recruitment can lead to life-threatening infection, extreme accumulation of neutrophils can result in excessive inflammatory lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Craig et al., 2009</xref>). The high survival of <italic>Ccl28<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice infected with Ab indicates that CCL28 may be detrimental for the host in the context of some pulmonary infections. While functioning neutrophils have been described to play a role in controlling <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Faassen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Patiño et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grguric-Smith et al., 2015</xref>), excessive neutrophil recruitment can exacerbate lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zeng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, depletion of alveolar macrophages in one <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> pneumonia study increased neutrophil infiltration, promoted tissue damage, and increased systemic dissemination of the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Salmonella</italic>, CCL28 stimulation did not enhance neutrophil antimicrobial activity against <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, which may partly explain the lack of a protective response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Further investigation is required to understand why <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> may be resistant to CCL28-dependent neutrophil antimicrobial responses.</p><p>Even though CCL28 exhibited direct antimicrobial activity against <italic>Acinetobacter</italic>, higher concentrations of CCL28 (1 μm) are needed for protection and were not sufficient against higher pathogen burdens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings align with prior studies indicating that the host response to infection can be context-dependent, with some immune components mediating different outcomes in the gut and in the lung. For example, <italic>Cxcr2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibit a defect in neutrophil recruitment that is detrimental during <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marchelletta et al., 2015</xref>) but protective during lung infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> due to reduced neutrophil recruitment and reduced pulmonary inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nouailles et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, CCL28-dependent modulation of neutrophil accumulation and activation during infection can be protective or detrimental depending on the pathogen and the site of infection.</p><p>Overall, this study demonstrates that CCL28 plays an important role in the mucosal response to pathogens by promoting neutrophil accumulation at the site of infection. Neutrophils isolated from infected mucosa express the CCL28 receptors CCR3 and CCR10, and CCL28 enhances neutrophil activation, ROS production, and NET formation, primarily through CCR3. These findings have implications for other infectious and non-infectious diseases where neutrophil recruitment plays a major role, and may lead to the identification of CCL28-targeted therapies to modulate neutrophil function and mitigate collateral damage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar <break/>Typhimurium strain IR715</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lab stock; PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7868611/">7868611</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nalidixic acid-resistant derivative of strain ATCC 14028s</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>S.

All tissues were kept in Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Gibco). Next, any Peyer’s patches were removed, and the intestinal fragments were cut open longitudinally and washed with Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) supplemented with 15 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Then, the tissue was shaken in 10 ml of an HBSS/15 mM HEPES/5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)/10% FBS solution at 37°C for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and kept on ice. The remaining tissue was cut into small pieces and digested in a 10 ml mixture of collagenase (Type VIII, 1 mg/ml), Liberase (20 µg/ml), and DNAse (0.25 mg/ml) in IMDM medium for 15 min, shaking at 37°C. Afterwards, the supernatant and tissue fractions were strained through a 70-µm cell strainer and pooled, and the extracted cells were used for flow cytometry staining. For the <italic>A. baumannii</italic> infection model, the lungs were collected, minced, and processed with collagenase and DNase as described above for the gut.

The lavage fluid was centrifuged, and pellets were washed with 1× PBS. Samples where less than 500 µl of the fluid was recovered (indicating improper syringe placement during collection) were excluded from downstream analyses. The obtained cells were used for flow cytometry staining. Briefly, cells were blocked with a CD16/32 antibody (BioLegend), stained with the fixable viability dye eFluor780 (Thermo Fisher), then extracellularly stained using the following conjugated monoclonal antibodies: anti-mouse CD45 (clone 30-F11), anti-mouse CD3 (clone 17A2), anti-mouse CD4 (clone RM4-5), anti-mouse CD8α (clone 53-6.7), anti-mouse CD19 (clone 1D3/CD19), anti-mouse Ly6G (clone 1A8), anti-mouse CD11b (clone M1/70), anti-mouse SiglecF (clone S17007L), anti-mouse F4/80 (clone BM8), anti-mouse CD11c (clone N418) from BioLegend; anti-mouse CCR3 (clone 83101), and anti-mouse CCR10 (clone 248918) from R&amp;D Systems. After staining, cells were washed with DPBS + 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and either immediately analyzed on a SA3800 flow cytometer (Sony Biotechnology), or first fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fixation buffer; BioLegend) and analyzed later. When intracellular staining was performed, cells were permeabilized in Permeabilization buffer (BioLegend), re-blocked with the CD16/32 antibody, and the staining was performed in the same buffer following the manufacturer’s instructions. In different experiments, cells were analyzed using a SA3800 Spectral Cell analyzer, a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and a LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and the collected data were analyzed with FlowJo v10 software (TreeStar).

After stimulation, cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in RPMI media supplemented with 0.1% BSA (wt/vol) to a final concentration of 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml, and 100 μl of the cell suspension were placed in the upper compartment of a Transwell chamber (3.0 μm pore size; Corning Costar). 50 nM of recombinant mouse CCL28, CCL11 (R&amp;D Systems), or CXCL1 (Peprotech) were placed into the lower compartment of a Transwell chamber. The Transwell plate was then incubated for 2 hr at 37°C. The number of cells that migrated to the lower compartment was determined by flow cytometry. The neutrophil chemotaxis index was calculated by dividing the number of cells that migrated in the presence of a chemokine by the number of cells that migrated in control chambers without chemokine stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Neutrophil in vitro infection and bacterial killing assays</title><p>Bone marrow neutrophils were obtained from mice as described above. <italic>S</italic>.

CFU data from in vivo infection experiments, percentage of CCR3<sup>+</sup> or CCR10<sup>+</sup> neutrophils in vivo and in vitro, and data from neutrophil functional assays were transformed to Log10 and passed a normal distribution test before running statistical analyses. Data on cytokine secretion, qPCR data, and relative cell abundances within tissues were compared by Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Survival curves were compared by the Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. Data that were normally distributed were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for independent samples or paired samples, depending on the experimental setup. Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was applied when we compared the different conditions to a single control group, while Tukey’s multiple comparison test was performed when we compared each condition with each other. Greenhouse–Geisser correction was applied when there were differences in the variance among the groups.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Denise M Monack (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) A more detailed examination of CCR3 and CCR10 surface translocation in neutrophils, including the kinetics and rapidity (Reviewer #1); What triggers this, including analysis of additional stimuli such as Acinetobacter or CCL28 (Reviewers #2 and #3). In addition, are CCR3 mRNA or protein levels induced in neutrophils by stimuli (Reviewer #1).</p><p>2) Deeper analysis of immune cells in the Ccl28-/- mice, including eosinophils in the gut and lungs, and neutrophil phenotypes (e.g. AMP levels) (Reviewer #2).</p><p>3) Deeper analysis of NETosis phenotypes and mechanisms for neutrophils in response to CCL28 or in Ccl28-/- mice (Reviewer #2).</p><p>4) Better explanation/justification for specific time points used for STm infection experiments, and clarification of in vivo phenotypes for neutrophils that were reported (Reviewer #3).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors show by ICS that CCR3 is already preformed in neutrophils, and their data indicate that CCR3 translocates to the plasma membrane. How rapid is this translocation of CCR3 to the cell surface? The authors examined 4 hours post-stimulation – did they also examine earlier timepoints? In addition, are Ccr3 mRNA and total protein levels also inducible in neutrophils in response to various stimuli?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1) The authors acknowledge that CCL28 are involved in the recruitment of T-, B-cells and eosinophils. While the authors provide data on lymphocyte populations in their Ccl28-/- mice compared to wild-type mice, there is no data regarding any potential effects on eosinophil populations in the gut or the lungs. As eosinophils are known to induce lung pathology, it would be good to know if these cells are influencing the phenotypes observed in their infection models.</p><p>2) When does CCL28 signalling become important in the neutrophil response? If surface receptor expression needs to be induced by other cytokines/chemokines, is it possible that there is a secondary role of CCL28 in vivo.</p><p>3) There is a general lack of description of the neutrophil phenotype in the Ccl28-/- mice. Do Ccl28-/- neutrophils contain the same amount AMPs and cytokine as WT neutrophils and are there differences in their degranulation and NETosis ability?</p><p>4) In line with the previous question, do CCL28 trigger the release of mitochondrial or nuclear NETs? It would also be advisable to use additional methods to quantify or visualise NETs, either by microscopy or by the SYTOX-green NETs assay.</p><p>5) Would the authors expect a similar phenotype in their models if they depleted neutrophils using antibodies/neutrophil deficient mice?</p><p>6) The authors write and reference that CCL28 is known to be released by epithelial cells in the gut and in the lung. It would be nice to see if there are additional cell types involved in the CCL28 response.</p><p>7) It would be nice to identify triggers for the translocation of CCR3 and CCR10 from the intracellular compartment to the extracellular compartment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Why did the authors look for CCL28 levels by ELISA in the feces and not in the cecal/colonic mucosa?</p><p>2) Figure 1B: Legend for Y-axis should be included in all figure panels.</p><p>3) Lines 106-108: authors should clarify which time-point was used for the intraperitoneal S. Tm experiment.</p><p>4) Why did the authors decide to use 48h time-point to characterize infiltration of inflammatory cells during S. Tm infection by flow cytometry (Figures 1C-D)? A different time point (72h post-infection) was used in previous experiments (Figure 1A-B).</p><p>5) S. Tm benefits from intestinal inflammation to expand in the intestinal lumen. However, CCL28-/- mice have a higher S. Tm burden in cecal contents (Figure 1B) even though they show decreased intestinal inflammation (Figure 1F). How do authors explain the data that S. Tm can colonize the gut better when there is less intestinal inflammation?</p><p>6) Line 164: authors should clarify which time-point was used for Acinetobacter CFU counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or blood (Figure 2B, C).</p><p>7) In line 213, the authors state that &quot;Ccl28-/- mice expressed similar levels of these receptors as wild-type mice.&quot; – Shouldn't Ccl28-/- have lower levels of neutrophils that express the CCL28 receptors (CCR3, CCR10) when compared to WT mice, as these neutrophils wouldn't be attracted to the gut mucosa due to the absence of CCL28? The similar levels of CCR3 and CCR10 expressing neutrophils between WT and Ccl28-/- should be better explained by the authors.</p><p>8) Does Acinetobacter also induce CCR3 and CCR10 expression neutrophils (as shown for S. Tm)? On a similar note, does exposure of neutrophils to CCL28 alter CCR3 and CCR10 expression or their localization to cell surface?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78206.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) A more detailed examination of CCR3 and CCR10 surface translocation in neutrophils, including the kinetics and rapidity (Reviewer #1); What triggers this, including analysis of additional stimuli such as Acinetobacter or CCL28 (Reviewers #2 and #3).

To this end, we have performed new experiments in which neutrophils enriched from bone marrow were infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium (STm) or <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (Ab) for 5 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, or 4 hr (Figure 4A-D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D).</p><p>STm induced a rapid surface expression of CCR3 beginning 5 min post-infection (p.i.), which increased over time and was maximal at 2-4 hr p.i. (Figure 4A). CCR10 was expressed on the surface of only a small percentage of neutrophils and increased to up to ~1% 4 hr after STm infection (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A), when also intracellular CCR10 expression was the highest (~20%; Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). When neutrophils were infected with Ab, CCR3 induction was slower, starting at 1 hr p.i., and peaking at 2-4 hr p.i. (Figure 4C). In contrast, Ab infection did not significantly increase surface and intracellular CCR10 expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D).</p><p>Because we saw the most robust induction of surface CCR3 (and surface CCR10 to a lesser extent) during STm infection, we performed RNA extraction from uninfected neutrophils and neutrophils 1 hr after STm infection. We found that <italic>Ccr3</italic> and <italic>Ccr10</italic> mRNA were induced in neutrophils infected with STm relative to uninfected neutrophils, but the induction level was low (~1.8-2-fold). We provide these data in response to Reviewer 1’s point #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Deeper analysis of immune cells in the Ccl28-/- mice, including eosinophils in the gut and lungs, and neutrophil phenotypes (e.g. AMP levels) (Reviewer #2).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that providing a deeper analysis of the immune cells in <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice is important. To address this point, we needed to conduct extensive mouse breeding to repeat, in essence, our prior study and isolate live cells for more comprehensive immune phenotyping. We compared naive mice to mice infected with STm at both day 2 and day 3 p.i., which also enabled us to address point #4 below. We also compared naive mice to mice infected with Ab for 1 day. Our flow cytometry strategy for comprehensive immune phenotyping is shown in the Figure 1—figure supplement 3, and the results are shown in Figure 1D,E, Figure 2I-L, Figure 1—figure supplements 4 and 5, and Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2.</p><p>During STm infection, we detected fewer neutrophils in the gut of <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice at both day 2 and day 3 p.i. (new Figure 1D,E). At the same time points, we did not find differences in the frequency of other cell types, including eosinophils, macrophage-like F4/80<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> cells, conventional dendritic cell-like CD11c<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>-</sup> cells, B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, or CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in the gut, blood or bone marrow (Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and Figure 1—figure supplement 5). In essence, the new immune phenotyping further supports our initial findings, showing that during STm infection, <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are characterized primarily by a lower percentage of neutrophils in the gut.</p><p>In mice infected with Ab, most cells (~90%) in the BAL fluid were neutrophils. Even though the percentage of BAL fluid neutrophils was comparable between WT and <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, the number of neutrophils was decreased in the BAL fluid (Figure 2I-L). The percentage and abundance of other BAL fluid cells, including eosinophils, were comparable between WT and <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 2L, Figure 2figure supplement 1 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). No differences were observed in any other tissue analyzed (lung, blood, bone marrow; Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2). Also in this case, deeper analysis of the cellular infiltrate during Ab infection is consistent with our initial findings and demonstrates that <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have fewer neutrophils in the BAL fluid.</p><p>To test for possible differences in the neutrophil phenotypes between wild-type and <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we measured levels of the neutrophil markers elastase, myeloperoxidase, and calprotectin by ELISA in the fecal or cecal content of mice at day 2 and 3 after STm infection, and in the BAL fluid of mice at day 1 after Ab infection. We found that there was a trend towards lower levels of these neutrophil markers in the cecal content at day 3 after STm infection, and in the BAL fluid at day 1 after Ab infection, in <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). These differences likely reflect the lower neutrophil abundance in <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, rather than changes in expression of these neutrophil proteins. In future studies outside the scope of this manuscript, we plan to further characterize the neutrophils from infected WT and <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Deeper analysis of NETosis phenotypes and mechanisms for neutrophils in response to CCL28 or in Ccl28-/- mice (Reviewer #2).</p></disp-quote><p>To provide a deeper analysis of NETosis phenotypes, we have expanded on our study in plateletactivated human neutrophils stimulated with CCL28, and we have visualized NET formation by fluorescence microscopy. The new results show that CCL28 enhances NET formation, and that inhibition of CCR3 results in a reduction of NETosis (Figure 5H-I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Better explanation/justification for specific time points used for STm infection experiments, and clarification of in vivo phenotypes for neutrophils that were reported (Reviewer #3).</p></disp-quote><p>In the first version of the manuscript, we used different time points based on the severity of infection, which varied between the two animal facilities at UC Irvine (experiments until 2017) and UCSD (experiments after 2017, due to the Raffatellu lab’s relocation to UCSD). As we have now performed several additional experiments necessary to address the deeper analysis of the immune cells requested by the reviewers, we took the opportunity to collect additional data on both day 2 and day 3 after STm infection. In general, day 3 post-infection shows higher levels of inflammation and more significant differences in the CFUs and the neutrophil infiltrate. For simplicity, we have now included the data from day 3 p.i. in the main figures, whereas most data from day 2 p.i. is shown in the Supplemental figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

To address this, we have performed new experiments in which neutrophils enriched from bone marrow were infected with <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium (STm) or <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (Ab) for 5 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, or 4 hr (Figure 4A-D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D).</p><p>STm induced a rapid surface expression of CCR3 beginning 5 min post-infection (p.i.), which increased over time and was maximal at 2-4 hr p.i.

CCR10 was expressed on the surface of only a small percentage of neutrophils and increased to up to ~1% 4 hr after STm infection (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A), when also intracellular CCR10 expression was the highest (~20%; Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). When neutrophils were infected with Ab, CCR3 induction was slower, starting at 1 hr p.i., and peaking at 2-4 hr p.i. (Figure 4C). In contrast, Ab infection did not significantly increase surface and intracellular CCR10 expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D).</p><p>Because we saw the most robust induction of surface CCR3 (and surface CCR10 to a lesser extent) during STm infection, we performed RNA extraction from uninfected neutrophils and neutrophils 1 hr after STm infection.

As we find that virtually all neutrophils are positive for intracellular CCR3, and because of how rapidly it localized to the cell surface (within 5 min), we think that pre-formed CCR3 is the primary source of surface CCR3. However, as it is possible that newly produced CCR3 also contributes to surface CCR3, we have toned down this claim in the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Ccr3</italic> and <italic>Ccr10</italic> expression is induced in neutrophils by STm in vivo.</title><p>Enriched bone marrow neutrophils (1x10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) were infected in vitro with NMS-opsonized STm (MOI=10) or mock-infected with vehicle (DPBS+10%NMS) for 1 hr.

At the same time points, we did not find differences in the frequency of other cell types, including eosinophils, macrophage-like F4/80<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>-</sup> cells, conventional dendritic cell-like CD11c<sup>+</sup> F4/80<sup>-</sup> cells, B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, or CD4<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in the gut, blood or bone marrow (Figure 1—figure supplements 4 and 5). In essence, the new immune phenotyping further supports our initial findings, showing that during STm infection, <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice are characterized primarily by a lower percentage of neutrophils in the gut.</p><p>In mice infected with Ab, most cells (~90%) in the BAL fluid were neutrophils. Even though the percentage of BAL fluid neutrophils was comparable between WT and <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, the number of neutrophils was decreased in the BAL fluid (Figure 2I-L). The percentage and abundance of other BAL fluid cells, including eosinophils, were comparable between WT and <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 2L, and Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2). No differences were observed in any other tissue analyzed (lung, blood, bone marrow; Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2). Also in this case, deeper analysis of the cellular infiltrate during Ab infection is consistent with our initial findings and demonstrate that <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have fewer neutrophils in the BAL fluid.</p><p>In summary, the extensive immunophenotyping in two infection models further strengthened our conclusions that <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice primarily exhibit a reduction in neutrophil recruitment to the gut during STm infection, and to the lung during Ab infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) When does CCL28 signalling become important in the neutrophil response? If surface receptor expression needs to be induced by other cytokines/chemokines, is it possible that there is a secondary role of CCL28 in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we find that other proinflammatory stimuli (bacterial infection, cytokines, phagocytosis) are essential for inducing surface receptor expression (Figure 3). We agree that CCL28 can also play secondary roles in addition to modulating neutrophil responses. CCL28 is thought to have both inflammatory and homeostatic functions, many of which are still unknown as <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have been developed only recently. As pointed out by Reviewer 1, CCL28 may also promote B and T cell responses in chronic infection models. We now discuss that future studies, outside the scope of the current manuscript, are necessary to elucidate additional roles for CCL28.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is a general lack of description of the neutrophil phenotype in the Ccl28-/- mice. Do Ccl28-/- neutrophils contain the same amount AMPs and cytokine as WT neutrophils and are there differences in their degranulation and NETosis ability?</p></disp-quote><p>To test for possible differences in the neutrophil phenotypes between wild-type and <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, we measured levels of the neutrophil markers elastase, myeloperoxidase, and calprotectin by ELISA in the fecal or cecal content of mice at day 2 and 3 after STm infection, and in the BAL fluid of mice at day 1 after Ab infection. We found that there was a trend towards lower levels of these neutrophil markers in the cecal content at day 3 after STm infection, and in the BAL fluid at day 1 after Ab infection, in <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 6). These differences likely reflect the lower neutrophil abundance in <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, rather than changes in expression of these neutrophil proteins. In future studies outside the scope of this manuscript, we plan to further characterize the neutrophils from infected WT and <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In line with the previous question, do CCL28 trigger the release of mitochondrial or nuclear NETs? It would also be advisable to use additional methods to quantify or visualise NETs, either by microscopy or by the SYTOX-green NETs assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed fluorescence microscopy using the Helix dye (same as SYTOX-green, but sold by BioLegend) in platelet-activated human neutrophils. We analyzed at least 3 fields per sample by fluorescence microscopy to identify and determine the percentage of cells forming NETs. The new images and the quantifications are shown in Figure 5H-I. These results are consistent with the prior flow cytometry results (now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and confirm that CCL28 induces NET formation, and that inhibition of CCR3 results in a reduction of NETosis.</p><p>The use of Helix dye does not allow discrimination between mitochondrial and nuclear NETs. However, prior work has shown that activated platelets induce nuclear NETs in human neutrophils (PMID 22684106), suggesting that nuclear NETs are present in our experimental settings. Still, we can not rule out the possibility that CCL28 induces mitochondrial NETs. Further characterization of NETs will be the investigation of future studies outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Would the authors expect a similar phenotype in their models if they depleted neutrophils using antibodies/neutrophil deficient mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the literature and our experience, we expect neutrophil-deficient mice, or mice treated with antibodies to deplete neutrophils, to develop more severe disease than <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice during STm infection and Ab infection. It is important to note that <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit a significant reduction of neutrophils in the infected mucosal sites, but not a complete depletion. Moreover, <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have normal neutrophil numbers in other body sites, including blood and bone marrow. The suggested antibody depletion studies would deplete neutrophils also from blood and bone marrow. Therefore, we expect that mice with a complete absence/depletion of neutrophils from all body sites will exhibit a much more severe disease during infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors write and reference that CCL28 is known to be released by epithelial cells in the gut and in the lung. It would be nice to see if there are additional cell types involved in the CCL28 response.</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that other cell types secrete CCL28 in the gut and lung in addition to epithelial cells, and that other cell types may be involved in the CCL28 response. Teasing out these additional responses would require extensive additional experiments outside the current study's scope and will be the subject of future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It would be nice to identify triggers for the translocation of CCR3 and CCR10 from the intracellular compartment to the extracellular compartment.</p></disp-quote><p>To address a comment from Reviewer 1, we have performed time-course experiments showing that CCR3 surface expression can be detected within 5 minutes after STm infection while, for example, the response to Ab is slower (Figure 4A-D). We plan to investigate the molecular mechanisms in future studies, which are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Why did the authors look for CCL28 levels by ELISA in the feces and not in the cecal/colonic mucosa?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. In prior studies, CCL28 was detected in the colonic mucosa of humans. We attempted to detect CCL28 by immunohistochemistry in mouse tissue but were unsuccessful. As antibodies specific for IHC in mice were not available, we used the LSBio polyclonal rabbit anti-Human CCL28/MEC antibody (LS-C379500) for IHC, which is described to cross-react with mice. We found the antibody to stain wild-type and <italic>Ccl28<sup>-/-</sup></italic> gut tissues non-specifically, as we also detected a positive signal in <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1B: Legend for Y-axis should be included in all figure panels.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we have now changed this in all relevant figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Lines 106-108: authors should clarify which time-point was used for the intraperitoneal S. Tm experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. The time point was reported in the figure legend and the Materials and methods, but not in the main text. We have now clarified in the main text that mice were infected intraperitoneally for 4 days.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why did the authors decide to use 48h time-point to characterize infiltration of inflammatory cells during S. Tm infection by flow cytometry (Figures 1C-D)? A different time point (72h post-infection) was used in previous experiments (Figure 1A-B).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point. In the first version of the manuscript, we used different time points based on the severity of infection, which varied between the two animal facilities at UC Irvine (experiments until 2017) and UCSD (experiments after 2017, due to the Raffatellu lab relocation to UCSD). As we have now performed several additional experiments necessary to address the deeper analysis of the immune cells requested by the reviewers, we took the opportunity to collect additional data on both day 2 and day 3 after STm infection. In general, day 3 post-infection shows higher levels of inflammation and more significant differences in the CFUs and the neutrophil infiltrate. For simplicity, we have now included the data from day 3 p.i. in the main figures, whereas most data from day 2 p.i. are shown in the Supplemental figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) S. Tm benefits from intestinal inflammation to expand in the intestinal lumen. However, CCL28-/- mice have a higher S. Tm burden in cecal contents (Figure 1B) even though they show decreased intestinal inflammation (Figure 1F). How do authors explain the data that S. Tm can colonize the gut better when there is less intestinal inflammation?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we have now performed several additional experiments, and we have enumerated STm CFUs in a larger number of mice. By combining data from four independent experiments (WT, n=14; <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, n=13), we find that <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have lower STm CFUs in the cecal content at day 2 post-infection (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), but have comparable STm CFU levels to WT mice at day 3 post-infection (eight independent experiment (WT, n=24; <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, n=18); Figure 1B). In general, fecal colonization was similar between WT and <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice at all time points analyzed (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Line 164: authors should clarify which time-point was used for Acinetobacter CFU counts in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid or blood (Figure 2B, C).</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified in the main text that tissue samples for Ab CFU counts were collected at day 1 postinfection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In line 213, the authors state that &quot;Ccl28-/- mice expressed similar levels of these receptors as wild-type mice.&quot; – Shouldn't Ccl28-/- have lower levels of neutrophils that express the CCL28 receptors (CCR3, CCR10) when compared to WT mice, as these neutrophils wouldn't be attracted to the gut mucosa due to the absence of CCL28? The similar levels of CCR3 and CCR10 expressing neutrophils between WT and Ccl28-/- should be better explained by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We would like to clarify that we see similar frequencies of CCR3<sup>+</sup> and CCR10<sup>+</sup> neutrophils in WT and <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). However, <italic>Ccl28</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice indeed have fewer neutrophils in the mucosa during infection (shown, for instance, in Figure 1D-E for STm infection, and Figure 2G-H for Ab infection). Thus, these results are consistent with CCL28-dependent modulation of neutrophil trafficking to the mucosa. Expression of the receptors is independent of CCL28, but dependent on other stimuli and can happen very rapidly during infection (see also the new timecourse data for neutrophils infected with STm or Ab shown Figure 4 A-D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-D). We hope that the revised manuscript and figures better convey the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Does Acinetobacter also induce CCR3 and CCR10 expression neutrophils (as shown for S. Tm)? On a similar note, does exposure of neutrophils to CCL28 alter CCR3 and CCR10 expression or their localization to cell surface?</p></disp-quote><p>In vitro, neutrophils infected with Ab displayed CCR3 induction, albeit slower than with STm, starting at 1 hr p.i. (versus 5 min for STm), and peaking at 2-4 hr p.i. (similar as STm) (Figure 4C). In contrast, Ab infection did not significantly increase surface and intracellular CCR10 expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D). in vivo, ~30% of neutrophils from Ab-infected mice displayed surface CCR3 expression (Figure 4F) and very few expressed surface CCR10 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F).</p><p>Additionally, we tried exposing bone marrow neutrophils to CCL28 (50nM) and co-stimulating with CCL28 and STm (MOI=10) for 1 hour; however, we did not find a significant increase of CCR3 and CCR10 surface expression with CCL28 exposure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). These results track with the finding that CCR3 expression levels of mucosal neutrophils during infection were independent of CCL28 status.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>CCL28 exposure does not alter surface expression of CCR3 or CCR10 by neutrophils.</title><p>Enriched bone marrow neutrophils (1x10<sup>6</sup> cells/well) were infected in vitro with NMSopsonized STm (MOI=10) or mock-infected with vehicle (DPBS+10%NMS), with or without coincubation with recombinant mouse CCL28 (50 nM) for 1 hr.
