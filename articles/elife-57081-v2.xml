Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) family. Whereas PITPs are defined by their abilities to transfer phosphatidylinositol between membranes in vitro, and to stimulate phosphoinositide signaling in vivo, Sfh5 does not exhibit these activities. Rather, Sfh5 is a redox-active penta-coordinate high spin Fe<sup>III</sup> hemoprotein with an unusual heme-binding arrangement that involves a co-axial tyrosine/histidine coordination strategy and a complex electronic structure connecting the open shell iron <italic>d</italic>-orbitals with three aromatic ring systems. That Sfh5 is not a PITP is supported by demonstrations that heme is not a readily exchangeable ligand, and that phosphatidylinositol-exchange activity is resuscitated in heme binding-deficient Sfh5 mutants. The collective data identify Sfh5 as the prototype of a new class of fungal hemoproteins, and emphasize the versatility of the Sec14-fold as scaffold for translating the binding of chemically distinct ligands to the control of diverse sets of cellular activities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Candida</kwd><kwd>lipid signaling</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositides</kwd><kwd>PITPs</kwd><kwd>heme</kwd><kwd>Sfh5</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM131804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bankaitis</surname><given-names>Vytas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BE-0017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bankaitis</surname><given-names>Vytas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new class of fungal hemoproteins is described that emphasizes the versatility of the Sec14-fold for translating binding of chemically distinct ligands to control of diverse sets of cellular activities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lipid metabolism is a major component of the eukaryotic strategy for organizing and regulating cell signaling. This involvement is exemplified by the metabolism of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and its phosphorylated derivatives – the phosphoinositides. Even though eukaryotes only produce five to seven chemically distinct phosphoinositide classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balla, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Craene et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wallroth and Haucke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dickson and Hille, 2019</xref>), these lipids contribute to the control of a broad set of cellular processes. How such diversity of biological outcome is achieved from such a limited set of chemical codes is not well understood. New insights into the mechanisms by which biological outcomes of phosphoinositide signaling are diversified come from studies of how PtdIns-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) signaling is channeled to specific biological outcomes. In that case, the PtdIns 4-OH kinases are biologically insufficient enzymes that are unable to generate sufficient PtdIns4P to override the action of erasers of PtdIns4P signaling, such as lipid phosphatases and PtdIns4P-sequestering activities, to support productive signaling. These deficiencies are overcome by the action of Sec14-like PtdIns transfer proteins (PITPs) that stimulate PtdIns 4-OH kinase activities so that sufficient PtdIns4P pools are generated in a precisely regulated manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ile et al., 2006</xref>). It is through this general strategy that individual Sec14-like PITPs channel PtdIns 4-OH kinase activities to specific biological outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bankaitis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nile et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grabon et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The biological importance of PITPs in regulating phosphoinositide metabolism is demonstrated by the expansion of the Sec14-like PITPs into the large Sec14 protein superfamily united by a conserved Sec14-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sha et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saito et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), and by the striking phenotypes associated with loss-of-function of individual PITPs in biological systems that range from yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bankaitis et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), to plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Peterman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vincent et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghosh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2016</xref>), and to vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamilton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alb et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kono et al., 2013</xref>). Sec14-like PITPs potentiate activities of PtdIns 4-OH kinases via a heterotypic lipid exchange cycle between a membrane-docked PITP molecules and the bilayer where the dynamics of an abortive exchange of a ‘priming’ lipid for PtdIns exposes the PtdIns to the lipid kinase catalytic site. In this way, the lipid exchange cycle renders PtdIns a superior substrate for the enzyme. Structure-based predictions that PtdIns-binding is conserved across the Sec14 superfamily, while the nature of the priming lipid is diversified, suggests a mechanism where the PITP acts as a metabolic sensor for activating PtdIns4P signaling in response to a metabolic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bankaitis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grabon et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>As all characterized Sec14-like PITPs are lipid-binding proteins, interrogation of the priming ligand question has focused on lipids as it is widely presumed that lipid exchange/transfer activity is the common feature amongst these proteins. Recent work suggests the ligand menu for Sec14-like proteins might be broader than previously thought, however. Of the six Sec14-like PITPs expressed in yeast, Sfh5 exhibits several distinguishing properties. First, it is the most divergent member of the group as Sfh5 shares the lowest amino acid sequence homology (17.4% identity/33% similarity) with Sec14. Second, Sfh5 is the only yeast Sec14-like protein that exhibits low levels of PtdIns-transfer activity in vitro, and even high levels of Sfh5 expression fail to rescue the growth phenotypes associated with reduced activity of Sec14 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2000</xref>). Third, the electrostatic properties of Sfh5 are unique among the cohort of yeast Sec14-like PITPs as both the protein surface and large regions of the putative lipid-binding cavity exhibit significant electropositive character – suggesting Sfh5 does not bind a lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tripathi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we describe a biophysical and structural characterization of Sfh5. We report Sfh5 is a novel penta-coordinate high spin Fe<sup>3+</sup> heme-binding protein conserved across the fungal kingdom that exhibits unusual heme-binding properties. While the biological functions of Sfh5 remain to be determined, chemogenomic analyses forecast Sfh5 plays a role in organic oxidant-induced stress responses. As such, Sfh5 is the founding member of a new and conserved class of fungal hemoproteins, and provides the first demonstration that the spectrum of ligands for PITP-like proteins extends beyond lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The unconventional Sec14-like PITP Sfh5 is a heme-binding protein</title><p>The unusual biochemical properties ascribed to Sfh5 became particularly evident when the recombinant protein was overexpressed in bacteria. Within a few hours after induction, the producing bacteria acquired a distinct reddish color. Moreover, the purified recombinant His<sub>6</sub>-Sfh5 itself exhibited an intense reddish-brown color which was resistant to dialysis or gel filtration – suggesting a tightly-bound transition metal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis of purified His<sub>6</sub>-Sfh5 identified the bound metal as Fe, and quantification indicated an Fe/Sfh5 molar ratio of 0.33. Moreover, Sfh5 exhibited a Soret peak with an absorption maximum at 404 nm – the spectral signature of an Fe<sup>3+</sup> heme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In support of this interpretation, sodium dithionite treatment of purified Sfh5 induced a red-shift of the Soret peak to 427 nm – signifying reduction to the Fe<sup>2+</sup> state. Reduction of purified recombinant Sfh5 in the context of pyridine hemochromagen assays revealed the formation of additional spectral peaks at 525 nm and 557 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, inset). Those peaks were diagnostic of β- and α-bands, respectively, of non-covalently bound heme <italic>b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beltrán et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barr and Guo, 2015</xref>).

The crystallographic symmetry was of the orthorhombic space group P4<sub>3</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2 (unit cell dimensions a = b = 205 Å, c = 68 Å) with a high solvent content of ~64% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As molecular replacement proved unsuitable for solving the Sfh5 structure, single-wavelength anomalous diffraction was used to exploit the iron anomalous signal at Cu Kα edge to obtain phase information. The final Sfh5 structure was refined to 2.9 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; PDB ID 6W32). The crystal asymmetric unit (ASU) contained three molecules of Sfh5 with a single heme-Fe bound to each of the chains. The crystallized form appears to be monomeric. While two molecules in the ASU make relatively close contact, the third molecule lacks a contact partner when checked across the symmetry axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Assessment of the crystal contact interfaces by the PISA server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/</ext-link>) concluded that these crystal contacts are unlikely to support stable quaternary assemblies in solution. One chain in the asymmetric unit (chain B) exhibited well-ordered electron density and was built with high confidence and good stereo-chemistry. However, the electron densities of the N-terminal domain of the two other chains (chains A and C) were poorly defined. Thus, the model for chain B was used for all subsequent structural analyses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Sfh5 crystal structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Recombinant Sfh5 forms reddish brown rod-shaped crystals.

A tripod motif formed by helices A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>3</sub> and A<sub>4</sub> characterized the N-terminal domain but, unlike Sec14, the loop connecting helices A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> (A<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> in Sec14) was expanded to host a hairpin turn and another helix (A<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). As typically observed in Sec14-like PITPs, the internal cavity of Sfh5 was defined by a β-sheet floor with α helices A<sub>5</sub>-A<sub>6</sub> forming one side. Helix A<sub>7</sub>, in conjunction with an extension loop, comprised the substructure that gates the cavity. The isostructural A<sub>10</sub>/T<sub>4</sub> gating helices of Sfh1 and Sfh5 were positioned similarly across the opening to the internal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, the Sfh5 helical gate was shifted by ~18 Å across the cavity opening relative to the position of this substructure in Sec14 -- thereby describing a ‘closed’ Sfh5 conformer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Again, in a strategy conserved across the Sec14-like PITP family, Sfh5 residue F<sub>228</sub>, located at the C-terminus of the KKFV gating element (KPFL in Sec14 and Sfh1), engaged K<sub>192</sub> of the adjacent helix A<sub>6</sub> in a cation-π interaction to stabilize the closed conformer. Hydrophobic interactions between V<sub>229</sub> on the loop extending from helix A<sub>7</sub>, and I<sub>195</sub> of helix A<sub>6</sub>, stabilized this closed conformation. Further ramifications of the K<sub>192</sub>-F<sub>228</sub> interaction will be detailed below.</p><p>In Sec14 and Sfh1, the conformational dynamics of the helical gate are coupled to a switch module (G-module) that operates via rearrangement of multiple H-bonds between distinct substructures to open and close the helical gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ryan et al., 2007</xref>). A prominent component of the switch element is a string motif that wraps around the back of the protein molecule and is characterized by a series of short 3<sub>10</sub>-helices. This structural motif is conserved in Sfh5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although no bound phospholipid was detected in the Sfh5 ligand-binding pocket, and the pocket was occupied with heme, the structural elements that comprise the PtdIns-binding substructure in other Sec14-like PITPs are conserved in Sfh5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Coordination environment of Sfh5-bound heme</title><p>Although the final refined Sfh5 structure had poor electron densities for several unstructured regions, especially in chains A and C, the <italic>2Fo-Fc</italic> electron density was clear and well defined for the heme-binding region of all three chains.

First, the porphyrin conformations within the each of the three monomers (identified as chains A, B and C) were largely planar as far as could be determined at the resolution level of the structure. Second, the heme <italic>b</italic> coordination mechanism was unusual. Bound heme-Fe was in close proximity (2.3 Å) to the hydroxyl group of residue Y<sub>175</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; left panel), and tyrosine coordination was consistent with the results of safranin T dye-reduction assays which estimated an unusually low thermodynamic reduction potential for Sfh5 heme (−330 ± 3 mV vs normal hydrogen electrode). The Y<sub>175</sub> hydroxyl group also engaged the Nε2-tautomer of the proximal H<sub>173</sub> via a hydrogen bond interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; left panel). Residue H<sub>173</sub> was positioned orthogonal to the heme plane and was poised to form a salt bridge between the Nδ1-tautomer and one of the heme propionate moieties. Moreover, a chain of H-bond and polar interactions was evident between the bound Fe, Y<sub>175</sub> and H<sub>173</sub>, and extended from the Fe center to a propionate side chain of bound heme in contact with the porphyrin ring. The heme propionate groups also engaged in H-bonding and acid/base interactions with Sfh5 residues Y<sub>128</sub>, R<sub>148</sub> and K<sub>209</sub>. Moreover, the S<sub>191</sub> side-chain was in H-bond contact with the nitrogen of the heme pyrrole ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; left panel). We note this configuration for S<sub>191</sub> was on display in the chain B structure whereas rotamers where the S<sub>191</sub> side-chain was flipped 180° away from the heme center were more consistent with the refined chain A and chain C structures. Alignment of Sfh5 homologs from multiple fungal species indicate residues Y<sub>128</sub>, R<sub>148</sub>, H<sub>173</sub>, Y<sub>175</sub>, and K<sub>209</sub> are invariant, and that multiple other heme-coordinating residues (including S<sub>191</sub>) are also highly conserved -- thereby defining a barcode for heme binding by Sec14-like proteins of the Sfh5 clade (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). This configuration forms an extensive electronic system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; right panel).</p><p>Only two amino acid side chains (S<sub>191</sub> and I<sub>225</sub>) reside within a 5 Å radius on the distal side of the Fe -- reporting the absence of a sixth coordinating ligand and establishing that bound Fe is penta-coordinate. That vacant coordination site on the distal side of the Fe represents a candidate substrate binding pocket positioned close to the Sfh5 protein surface and to which access from solvent is occluded by the side chains of K<sub>188</sub> and K<sub>192</sub> of helix A<sub>6</sub> on one side and residues L<sub>224</sub>, I<sub>225</sub> of helix A<sub>7</sub> and F<sub>228</sub> on the loop connecting helix A<sub>7</sub> and 3<sub>10</sub>-helix T<sub>4</sub>, on the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As discussed above, K<sub>192</sub> and F<sub>228</sub> engage in a cation-π interaction that stabilizes the closed conformation of the Sfh5 helical gate whose isostructural elements control access to the lipid binding cavity in Sec14 and other Sec14-like PITPs. This arrangement suggests a mechanism where rotamer rearrangements of these side chains, and/or conformational transitions of the A<sub>7</sub> helix, gate substrate access into the vacant heme coordination site. Notably, K<sub>188</sub> and K<sub>192</sub> are absolutely conserved across the Sfh5 clade, whereas the F<sub>228</sub> is highly conserved. In cases where the F<sub>228</sub> cognate is a valine, it is the K<sub>188</sub> cognate that is projected to engage in a cation-π interaction with a phenylalanine that replaces the cognate L<sub>224</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Roles of residues Y<sub>175</sub> and H<sub>173</sub> in heme binding and Fe-center chemistry</title><p>Heme-binding tyrosines can be stabilized by adjacent ionizable residues that enhance the tyrosinate character and strengthen the Tyr O-Fe bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pluym et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caillet-Saguy et al., 2008</xref>). The Sfh5 structure suggested that the H<sub>173</sub> Nδ1 proton acts as an H-bond donor to Y<sub>175</sub> – thus transferring negative charge from the tyrosinate ion to the H<sub>173</sub> imidazole ring and modulating strength of the Y<sub>175</sub>-Fe interaction. To test this possibility, a series of Sfh5 Y<sub>175</sub> and H<sub>173</sub> missense mutants was generated and the consequences on heme binding characterized. As demonstrated in other experiments described below, the relevant Sfh5 heme-binding mutants were all properly folded proteins.</p><p>That heme binding was compromised in specific mutants was readily apparent from the colors of the purified recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Substitution of the axial Y<sub>175</sub> by non-polar residues (i.e. Sfh5<sup>Y175A</sup> and Sfh<sup>Y175F</sup>) completely abrogated heme binding whereas the Sfh5<sup>Y175H</sup> mutant largely retained the ability to bind heme -- revealing the necessity of a polar axial ligand for efficient heme binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The Sfh5<sup>H173A</sup> variant showed an ~50% reduction in heme binding, while the Sfh5<sup>H173Y</sup> variant, unlike Sfh5<sup>H173A</sup>, purified with heme loaded at levels comparable to Sfh5 -- further highlighting the role of the amino acid co-axial to residue Y<sub>175</sub> in stabilizing the critical Y<sub>175</sub>-Fe interaction.

Similar data were forthcoming from plasmid-shuffle assays where the abilities of Sfh5 and its variants to bypass the essential cellular requirement for Sec14 activity, when expressed at high levels, were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, right panel). Whereas high-level expression of Sfh5<sup>Y175F</sup> was capable of supporting viability of <italic>sec14Δ</italic> segregants, expression of wild-type Sfh5 was not able to do so.</p><p>As ergosterol synthesis is the sole ‘essential’ heme-dependent activity in yeast grown with glucose as sole carbon source, we tested whether resuscitation of PtdIns-exchange activity of wild-type Sfh5 was recapitulated when Sfh5 was expressed in heme-less <italic>hem1Δ</italic> yeast mutants cultured in the presence of ergosterol.

That is, wild-type Sfh5 produced in a heme-free cellular context still failed to exhibit PITP activity.

In those experiments, the Y<sub>68</sub>A substitution that compromises the Sfh5 PtdIns-binding barcode was incorporated into the heme-less Sfh5<sup>Y175F</sup> context. Surprisingly, the Sfh5<sup>Y68A,Y175F</sup> double mutant protein showed unambiguous resuscitation of low level heme binding. That is, Sfh5<sup>Y68A,Y175F</sup> showed a weak, yet distinct, Soret peak at 413 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), and a weak EPR signature of high spin Fe<sup>3+</sup> heme, while Sfh5<sup>Y175F</sup> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, alterations in the Sfh5 PtdIns-binding substructure defects can partially relieve heme-binding defects – even though the structural elements that coordinate PtdIns headgroup binding and heme-binding are physically distinct. There is specificity to this effect as the E<sub>204</sub>V PtdIns-binding barcode mutation, which effectively abolishes PtdIns-binding by Sfh5, did not resuscitate measurable heme-binding in the Sfh5<sup>Y175F</sup> context (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Sfh5 heme is not exchangeable with an apo-myoglobin acceptor</title><p>As Sfh5 exhibits feeble PtdIns/heme exchange activity in vitro, and it does not exhibit the properties of a canonical PITP in vivo, we considered the possibility that Sfh5 donates bound heme to a suitable acceptor apo-protein. To test this hypothesis, an in vitro assay was developed where Sfh5 served as heme donor and apo-myoglobin was incorporated as an avid heme acceptor. We took advantage of the pseudo-peroxidase activities of myoglobin and of heme-bound Sfh5 to monitor transfer of heme from Sfh5 to apo-myoglobin. Although apo-myoglobin readily bound free heme presented as hemin, no transfer of heme between Sfh5 donor and apo-myoglobin acceptor was recorded in this assay regime -- even after prolonged incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

We report that Sfh5 is a penta-coordinate high spin Fe<sup>3+</sup> heme-binding protein with unusual heme-binding and heme Fe-coordination properties. These describe a complex electronic system that is, to our knowledge, unique. As such, Sfh5 is the prototype of a new class of hemoproteins conserved across the fungal kingdom. In contrast to the known priming lipids of other Sec14-like PITPs, heme is not an exchangeable ligand for Sfh5, and the feeble PtdIns-exchange activity of Sfh5 is strongly enhanced in heme-binding mutants – indicating Sfh5 is not designed to function as a bona fide PITP in vivo. While Sfh5 is non-essential for yeast viability under all conditions tested thus far, chemogenomic analyses suggest Sfh5 participates in stress responses to specific (albeit as yet unidentified) environmental organic oxidants.

This system incorporates three aromatic ring systems (the Y<sub>175</sub> benzyl ring, the H<sub>173</sub> imidazole, porphyrin) and open-shell iron d-orbitals that indicate extensive delocalization. How this unique structure operates poses an open question. That Fe- and heme-coordinating residues are highly conserved amongst the fungal Sfh5 orthologs reinforces our conclusion that these orthologs represent heme-binding proteins, and predicts that they also share the novel integrated electronic system defined by Sfh5. Moreover, the structural information identifies a heme-binding barcode for this class of Sec14-like proteins.</p><p>The absence of a sixth coordinating ligand for the Fe was evident from the structure – confirming Sfh5 heme represents a penta-coordinate system. The vacant site can be occupied by diatomic molecules bound by Sfh5, and is the probable binding site for other potential Sfh5 ligands. The structure also suggests that entry into this vacant coordination site is likely gated by the side chains of two invariant residues of the Sfh5 clade (K<sub>188</sub> and K<sub>192</sub>) and possibly conformational transitions of a gating helix analogous to that described for other Sec14-like PITPs. Interestingly, only ~4% of known hemoproteins exhibit Tyr as an axial ligand, and the majority of those that are penta-coordinate are catalases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>). However, Sfh5 shows no measurable catalase activity -- consistent with the absence of polar side chains near the sixth coordination site capable of stabilizing the oxo-ferryl intermediate of the catalase reaction. These collective results reinforce the structural and biophysical novelty of this site in Sfh5.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Magnetic properties of the Sfh5 heme center</title><p>EPR and Mössbauer analyses demonstrate Sfh5 contains a high-spin S = 5/2 Fe <sup>3+</sup> heme center, and both the EPR and Mössbauer signatures are typical of high-spin hemes. The electronics of the heme center are responsive to substitution of the co-axial H<sub>173</sub> with Ala or Tyr, or substitution of Y<sub>175</sub> with His, in a manner consistent with H<sub>173</sub> status modulating the Y<sub>175</sub>-Fe interaction. Presumably, this modulation is achieved by stabilization of the Fe-coordinating tyrosinate ion. Mössbauer analyses identify two discrete magnetic states for the Sfh5 heme center, and one state is lost in the Sfh5<sup>H173A</sup> mutant. One interpretation of the data is that the two states report alternate protonation states for H<sub>173</sub>. However, attempts to demonstrate a pH-dependent shift from one state to the other by adjusting the pH of the protein solution proved unsuccessful – perhaps due to insufficient solvent exposure of this region of the heme coordination motif. Alternatively, the two states might reflect different conformational states of the heme as heme distortions can be associated with stronger axial ligand-heme bonding and changes in electronic structure of the iron center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Négrerie, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Heme coordination strategies of Sfh5 and hemophores of bacterial pathogens</title><p>Hemophores are proteins secreted by bacterial pathogens that function in Fe-acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nasser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sheldon and Heinrichs, 2015</xref>). These do so by scavenging heme from the host and, upon receptor-mediated retrieval of the hemophore/heme complex to the bacterial cell surface, releasing that micronutrient to the pathogen. HasA of <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> and IsDX1 of <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> represent prototypical bacterial hemophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilks and Burkhard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tong and Guo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Korolnek and Hamza, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Philpott and Protchenko, 2016</xref>). While Sfh5 shares no sequence or structural homology to HasA or IsDX1, and Sfh5 is not secreted from the cell, the yeast protein does share interesting parallels in its heme coordination strategy with those hemophores. For example, HasA exhibits tyrosine (Y<sub>75</sub>) as one of two axial ligands, and an adjacent histidine (H<sub>83</sub>) H-bond acceptor stabilizes the tyrosinate ion and increases the affinity of heme binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Létoffé et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caillet-Saguy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cescau et al., 2007</xref>). Structural analyses of heme-bound HasA in complex with its bacterial surface receptor further suggest that transient protonation of the HasA H<sub>83</sub> Nδ weakens the H-bond with Y<sub>75</sub>, reduces the affinity of HasA for heme, and facilitates heme release to the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krieg et al., 2009</xref>). Other heme-binding NEAT-domain proteins (e.g. IsdA and IsdH-N3 of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and IsdX1 of <italic>B. anthracis</italic>) employ Tyr-Tyr coordination motifs that operate via similar mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grigg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Watanabe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ekworomadu et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Sfh5 does not exhibit the properties of a heme donor</title><p>Yeast cells synthesize heme in the mitochondria, but the mechanisms of intracellular heme transport and compartmentalization remain largely unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Protchenko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">White et al., 2013</xref>). In that regard, the interesting parallels between Sfh5 and heme-binding strategies of bacterial hemophores, when considered together with the activities of hemophores in binding and releasing heme on demand, suggested the possibility that Sfh5 functions in intracellular heme distribution. Two lines of evidence do not support this idea, however. First, consistent with the high affinity of Sfh5 for heme, the inability of an avid heme scavenger to withdraw heme from Sfh5 suggests Sfh5 is not designed to donate bound heme to some proteinaceous acceptor. One caveat associated with this interpretation is the formal possibility that Sfh5 donates heme to a highly privileged acceptor cannot yet be excluded. Second, Sfh5 exhibits only low-level PtdIns transfer activity in vitro and is ineffective in stimulating PtdIns 4-OH kinase activity in vivo. Yet, ‘heme-less’ Sfh5 mutants are resuscitated for both PtdIns-transfer activity in vitro and stimulation of PtdIns 4-OH kinase activity in vivo. These data report a fundamentally antagonistic relationship between heme- and PtdIns-binding where binding of the former is incompatible with exchange of the latter. We speculate that heme-binding locks Sfh5 into what is a substantially ‘closed’ conformer and that this represents the functional Sfh5 configuration. That holo-Sfh5 crystallizes as a ‘closed’ conformer is consistent with this view.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>The enigmatic physiological function of the Sfh5 hemoprotein</title><p>Sfh5 does not play a major role in yeast heme biology under laboratory conditions – at least not one accompanied by a recognizable phenotype. Yet, this hemoprotein is clearly conserved across the fungal kingdom. What then is the significance of the conserved heme-binding ability of Sfh5? One possibility is that heme represents a structural cofactor required for Sfh5 folding, and that Sfh5 activity does not otherwise leverage iron redox chemistry towards some biological function. The deeply sequestered heme pose in the internal Sfh5 cavity, its non-exchangeability, the fact that purified recombinant Sfh5 is very defective in PtdIns-transfer activity even though only some 1/3 of the molecules are heme-bound, and that Sfh5 is destabilized by removal of bound heme, are all consistent with such a scenario.</p><p>Two lines of evidence counter this idea, however. First, as described above, Sfh5 mutants unable to bind heme are well-folded proteins that exhibit robust PtdIns-exchange activity in vitro and are effective in stimulating PtdIns 4-OH kinase activities in vivo. Thus, these mutants are competent to undergo the significant conformational transitions required for PITP activity. Perhaps the corresponding amino acid substitutions exert the dual effects of rendering Sfh5 not only defective in heme-binding, but also sterically permissive for PtdIns-binding. This possibility is strongly supported by our demonstration that wild-type Sfh5 expressed in yeast cells devoid of heme remains incompetent for PITP activity in stimulating PtdIns 4-OH kinase activities in vivo. An innate steric incompetence of Sfh5 for PtdIns-binding provides yet another indication the protein is not designed to function as a PITP.</p><p>Second, chemogenomic analyses identify a specific ‘heme-requiring’ signature for Sfh5-deficient yeast challenged with the organic oxidant oltipraz – an organosulfur compound that is not only used to treat schistosomiasis, but also exerts anti-cancer effects by inducing phase II carcinogen detoxification systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Velayutham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Ghani et al., 2009</xref>). Those data argue that heme binding by Sfh5 is physiologically relevant, but only when yeast are exposed to specific oxidative stressors. In that regard, the human pathogen <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> offers potential insight. This fungus causes lung infections that frequently progress to cryptococcal encephalomeningitis in immune-suppressed individuals and represents a leading cause of death in AIDS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Charlier et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>C. neoformans</italic> expresses three Sec14-like proteins – a restricted cohort as fungi typically express at least five. Two of the <italic>C. neoformans</italic> Sec14-like proteins are orthologs of the canonical PtdIns/PtdCho-exchange PITP Sec14, and one is an Sfh5 ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chayakulkeeree et al., 2011</xref>). Perhaps Sfh5 hemoproteins participate in stress responses to organic oxidants encountered by commensal and pathogenic fungi in host contexts, and by non-pathogenic yeast such as <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> in the wild.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Versatility of the Sec14-fold</title><p>Whereas the biological activity of Sfh5 remains enigmatic, what these collective results powerfully highlight is how evolution uses the Sec14-fold as a versatile scaffold for accommodating the binding of a wide variety of ligands. Our discovery of a novel class of Sec14-like hemoproteins now extends the diversity of ligand binding by members of the Sec14 PITP-like superfamily to molecules that are not lipids. That Sfh5 and its fungal orthologs exhibit an unusual heme coordination mechanism that includes a planar porphyrin, a redox-active iron, and co-axial Tyr and His residues packaged as an integrated electronic system, emphasizes the high complexity of ligand coordination possible with the Sec14-fold. Moreover, that this unique electronic system offers an available axial binding site suggests Sfh5 has a capacity to bind as yet unidentified substrate(s) and to execute new heme-based redox chemistry. It is an exciting proposition that the Sfh5-fold might ultimately prove amenable to the rational engineering of new redox nanoreactors designed for targeted modification of interesting organic molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids, and media</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study were CTY182 (<italic>MATa ura3-52 lys2-801 Δhis3-200</italic>), CTY1-1A (<italic>MATa ura3-52 lys2-801 Δhis3-200 sec14-1<sup>ts</sup></italic>), CTY558 (<italic>MATα ade2 ade3 leu2 Δhis3-200 ura3-52 sec14Δ1::HIS3/pCTY11</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bankaitis et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cleves et al., 1991</xref>).

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports the unusual reconfiguration of a phospholipid binding pocket into a heme binding pocket. Structural analysis of the PhosphatidylInositol Transfer Protein (PITP) Sfh5 shows that the protein binds heme with an unusual electronic arrangement in anpocket that is normally occupied by PI. Analysis of the residues involved in binding and of the affinity to heme indicate that heme is redox active, could adsorb another ligand on one side of the iron atom, and is bound to the protein almost irreversibly.</p><p>Examining published pharmacogenomics screens unveils a link between Sfh5 and a potential redox response.</p><p>Notwithstanding some problems in crystallography interpretation (see below), all four reviewers found that the study was carefully executed, and that the repurposing of a lipid-binding pocket to a heme-binding pocket was surprising and interesting. They felt however that the biological function of heme-binding by Sfh5 was insufficiently investigated. In particular, reviewers 1, 2 and 3 felt that it was at this stage premature to conclude that Sfh5 had lost its ability to bind PI or that heme-binding was not regulating PI binding. A role of Sfh5 as a PITP should therefore not be discounted at this point given how easy it is to resuscitate this function, and given that the concentrations of heme and PI might allow a fair fraction of Sfh5 to be PI-bound in vivo.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 2 proposes an experiment that could shed light on a possible role of Sfh5 as heme-regulated PITP. Heme levels can be titrated up and down in cells. To do this, heme is first made dispensable by providing ergosterol in the medium (the essential function of heme is in ergosterol biosynthesis). In this condition the aminolevulinate synthase HEM1 can be deleted. Heme levels can then be tuned by adding back given amounts of aminolevulinic acid (which is imported into cells).</p><p>Since you show that a heme-binding deficient Sfh5 mutant recovers its PITP activity (in Sec14 delete cells), it is to be expected that wildtype Sfh5 will function as PITP in heme-less cells. Here, by increasing the amount of aminolevulinate (and thus of intracellular heme), Sfh5 should gradually lose its PITP activity. Such an experiment should be quite straightforward and could shed light on the levels of heme necessary to inhibit the PITP function of Sfh5.</p><p>Moreover, reviewer 4 found substantial problems with the validation of the structure based on the density map (see their point 4). The map has also been checked by an independent expert, who saw nothing wrong with the number of molecules per unit cell, but agreed that there are a lot of issues with the structure that need to be fixed.</p><p>- The validation report also flagged issues with the heme geometry that should be fixed.</p><p>- The large number of clashes and protein geometry issues come from poorly traced chains in the C-terminal residues of chains A and C, and in all three copies in the vicinity of residues 40-45. One can see very clearly from the density that the fit is incorrect and violates various geometric constraints. These are all fixable and probably don't affect the interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes the recombinant expression, purification and structural analysis of Sfh5, a Sec Fourteen Homolog, and the surprising discovery that, unlike Sec14 and other related proteins, Sfh5 doesn't appear to bind the phospholipid phosphatidylinositol (PI), but instead binds heme tightly and through an unusual network of bonds. The physiological implication of this binding is not yet understood, but experimental indications allow the authors to speculate on possible roles. First, because the iron center of heme is pentavalent, and that a cavity exists where the sixth bond would be, suggesting that a secondary substrate could bind here (like O2 in hemoglobin). Second, the analysis of a chenogenomics screen shows that Sfh5 mutant cells are sensitive to heme-depleting drugs.</p><p>This is a very intriguing story that certainly asks more questions than it answers. It is carefully executed and exhaustive. It will certainly lay the ground for further research.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The authors speculate that Sfh5 doesn't bind PI in a physiological setting and is unlikely to exchange heme for PI, given the difference in affinity to both metabolites. This is somewhat contradictiry with the fact that PI binding can apparently be rescued by abrogating heme binding, indicating that PI binding has been kept throughout evolution. The authors mention a &quot;barcode&quot; of aminoacids necessary for PI binding, which all have been kept in Sfh5. Moreover, mutating one amino acid of this barcode allows a heme-binding-deficient mutant to regain heme binding to some extent, suggesting that it is PI binding that prevents heme binding in the heme-defective mutant. So what are the amino-acids of this barcode? Are they conserved, and if so, why?</p><p>If the &quot;resuscitable&quot; PI-binding ability of Sfh5 is conserved, then it probably means that PI-binding is an important property of the protein.</p><p>Also, the concentrations of heme and PI might be very different wherever Sfh5 is located, which might compensate for the different inherent affinities. Finally, the authors rightly acknowledge that &quot;the formal possibility that Sfh5 donates heme to a highly privileged, and as-yet-unidentified, acceptor cannot be excluded&quot;, they do not acknowledge the possibility that Sfh5 binding to a third party factor (not necessarily a heme-acceptor) might decrease its affinity for heme in vivo. These points suggest that it could be premature to dismiss the possibility that heme/PI exchange might actually happen in vivo. This possibility does not alter the interest of the present study and can be addressed in further studies.</p><p>- This manuscript talks to scientists with very different sets of expertise. The thorough characterization of the biophysical properties of Sfh5 could in general do with more complete explanations of the various methods in use. For instance:</p><p>Soret spectra are calibrated against mock-expressing bacterial lysate. This information could go in the text or figure legend rather than the Materials and methods section.</p><p>&quot;The isostructural A10/T4 gating helices of Sfh1 and Sfh5 were positioned similarly across the opening to the internal cavity&quot;. The corresponding figure could benefit from better description (no labels on the helices).</p><p>&quot;tyrosine coordination was consistent with the results of safranin T dye-reduction assays which estimated an unusually low thermodynamic reduction potential for Sfh5 heme (-330 ± 3 mV vs. NHE).&quot; This could require better explanations (e.g. NHE is not described anywhere).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors describe an unusual but very interesting member of a class of Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins (PITP), Sfh5. They find that Sfh5 is a novel heme binding protein and, in fact, does not function in activities typically associated with PITPs. Most interestingly, they find that variants of Sfh5 that cannot bind heme restores PITP activity. The major focus of the study is on the biophysical characterization of Sfh5 and its interactions with heme. The work is technically sound, beautifully integrating rigorous structural, spectroscopic, and biochemical characterization of Sfh5, and the manuscript is very well written. However, the studies may not have broad appeal due to the lack of cell biological data demonstrating the physiological significance of heme-Sfh5 interactions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper is technically sound but may be of limited impact due to the lack of data establishing a physiological function for heme binding. In this sense, significant efforts must be made to establish a role for heme binding. As it currently stands, the work may be more appropriate for a specialized audience of biochemists.</p><p>2) The authors should comment on how the PITP activity of the heme-binding mutants of Sfh5 compare to other Sec14-like PITPs? These mutants may have more PITP activity than WT Sfh5, but is the activity comparable to other more typical Sec14-type PITPs?</p><p>The following suggestions are outside the scope of the current study as presented. I hope the comments may prove useful to the authors as they continue their studies on this interesting protein.</p><p>3) Do the authors think heme plays a regulatory role in Sfh5 phosphatidylinositol transfer activity? For instance, it is mentioned that only 1/3 of the protein is heme loaded. Does increasing heme synthesis decrease PITP activity in vivo? If the authors fed WT cells porphobilinogen (PBG), which would increase heme levels, or titrate aminolevulinic acid (ALA) in <italic>hem1∆</italic> cells, is there a dose dependent decrease in Sfh5-related PITP activity in vivo? An experiment such as this demonstrating in vivo regulation of PITP activity by heme would greatly elevate the significance/impact of the current work.</p><p>Note, in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, ALA synthase is not the rate-limiting enzyme for heme synthesis, as it is in other eukaryotes. Thus, to drive heme synthesis in WT cells, one must use PBG.</p><p>4) The authors make the intriguing comment that there may be a privileged acceptor that Sfh5 may donate heme to. Related to this point, I am wondering if heme reduction could induce its dissociation? I understand that the myoglobin transfer experiments were done with ferric heme. Could heme dissociate and transfer to myoglobin if it were reduced with dithionite?</p><p>Sfh1 in some sense reminds me of yeast Dap1, a homolog of mammalian PGRMC1 and PGRMC2. Dap1 is a low potential hemoprotein (~-300 mV) that binds heme with a tyrosine ligand. It was thought that Dap1 might be a heme chaperone for ER localized Cytochrome P450s, although this is controversial. <italic>dap1∆</italic> exhibits fluconazole and MMS sensitivity, in part due to defects in ergosterol biosynthesis, which requires a P450 enzyme. The authors may want to consider looking at fluconazole sensitivity, or defects in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. There was recently a paper in Nature describing role of PGRMCs in nuclear heme trafficking in adipocytes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study demonstrates that a member of the large Sec14-like phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) family, Sfh5, binds heme. This is the first member of this family found to bind heme. The structure of Sfh5 bound to heme is presented and the interactions of the protein with heme and Fe chemistry of the bound heme are carefully examined. While it is fascinating (and surprising) that a PITP binds heme, the study does not shed much light on the functional significance of heme binding by Sfh5. It argues that the protein is unlikely to be a phosphatidylinositol-heme exchanger and shows that Sfh5 does not efficiently deliver heme to the heme-acceptor apo-myoglobin, consistent with the idea that Sfh5 does not supply heme to other proteins. Instead, it suggests that heme bound Sfh5 somehow participates in a cellular response to oxidants but offers no insight into how this might occur. Even without this, I think the finding that PITPs can bind heme is an important discovery and this study could be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. I have two major concerns.</p><p>1) The affinity of Sfh5 for heme should be examined in more detail. This study suggests bound heme is not a readily exchangeable, but this is difficult to square with the statement in the discussion that only 1/3 of Sfh5s are heme-bound. The fraction of endogenous Sfh5 bound to heme should be determined and shown. It is important that these measurements be made with protein lacking a His-tag since this tag bind heme. If it is correct that bound heme is not readily exchangeable but only a fraction of the protein is heme-bound, some effort should be made to explain this. Is the on rate very slow?</p><p>2) The study demonstrates that heme bound by Sfh5 is accessible to small ligands like CN<sup>-</sup>, indicating that the heme is redox active, but does not explain how changes in the redox state of bound heme could be physiologically relevant. How could these changes be sensed by other proteins? Or how do the authors think bound heme could significantly contribute to cytoplasmic redox chemistry?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>Khan et al, report a novel heme-binding function for a member (Sfh5) of a class of yeast proteins (PITPs) that normally transfer lipids. They report a crystal structure of heme-bound Sfh5 and thoroughly describe the biophysical and structural properties of the heme-bound complex using absorption, EPR, and Mössbauer spectroscopies. Data presented indicate that wild-type Sfh5 neither exchanges phosphatidylinositol nor heme. Experiments indicate that yeast deficient of Sfh5 show no significant functional phenotype. However, mining of a &quot;comprehensive HIPHOP chemogenomic study&quot; lead the authors to propose that Sfh5 may be involved in controlling &quot;some aspect of redox control, and/or regulation of heme homeostasis, under stress conditions induced by exposure to organic oxidants&quot; – a hypothesis that was not experimentally explored in this study.</p><p>The strengths of this manuscript are the novelty that a Sec14-like protein can bind heme, and the thorough characterization of the structural and biophysical basis for heme binding. The significance of the &quot;unusual heme-binding arrangement&quot; described in detail in this study is not readily apparent. Furthermore, no biological function was detailed in this study that is supported by data. A more robust functional role for Sfh5's heme-binding properties would strengthen this story.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction: The authors provide a lot of information about the lipid-dependent activities of the PITPs, given that their protein of interest (Sfh5) does not bind lipid and does not appear to function in the manner consistent with PITP function. Since it appears that the function of Sfh5 is unknown (which is interesting), perhaps this should be stated up front along with any information known about its biology in yeast and other eukaryotic homologs-then more briefly mention the functions of related Sec14-like PITPs and lipid-dependent activities as a possible function (i.e., present a hypothesis). The first paragraph of the Results section could be moved up to the Introduction.</p><p>2) Most of the work to show that Sfh5 binds heme was performed using protein expressed in bacteria, which produced heme-bound Sfh5 that copurifed during purification steps. One experiment is shown to link heme binding to Sfh5 in yeast cells (Figure 1C, lower right panel) but the data signal-to-noise is very low for the yeast protein compared to the bacterial protein and no control is provided to show the heme interaction in the yeast pull-down experiment is specific. Can growth conditions for bacterial or yeast grown be discovered that allow purification of heme-free Sfh5-or biochemical stripping/unfolding/repurification of heme-free protein-which can then be used in heme binding analysis via absorbance or ITC measurements and phosphatidylinositol binding assays?</p><p>3) There is no functional evidence presented to prove that Sfh5, which is expressed at low levels and shows no deletion functional phenotype, or its unique heme-binding properties are important in yeast or any other organism. Is it possible Sfh5 could be vestigial in yeast? Do related proteins from other organisms (i.e., those that evolutionarily precede yeast) express Sfh5 with higher expression and more robust heme-dependent functional activities. If Figure 8—figure supplement 2 provides the only insight into the potential functional relevance of Sfh5, the authors should consider moving it to a main figure.</p><p>4) Crystallography: The authors show that Sfh5 is a homodimer using AUC; however, no dimerization was observed in the crystal structure. An issue related to this that should be addressed: when the sfh5_map_coeffs.mtz file provided by the authors is analyzed in CCP4, the Matthews_coef analysis (estimate of the number of asymmetric units in the unit cell) indicates there should be 4 molecules (e.g., two dimers?) in one unit cell with a solvent content ~52.2%. However, the authors solved the structure with 3 molecules in one unit cell. Other issues that should be addressed pertaining to the structure refinement include (1) the Ramachandran outliers in the validation report is 0.5%, which is inconsistent with 0% reported by the authors in the Table 1; (2) the percent of residues with favored Ramachandran is 86%, which can likely be improved; and (3) the R-factor gap (R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub>) is large. Finally, the number of atoms in the protein (129) and ligand (5) reported by the authors in Table 1 needs to be corrected.</p><p>5) Figure 7: The authors prepared apo-myoglobin by methy-ethyl ketone extraction of heme from equine skeletal myoglobin for use in heme-transfer assays to determine if Sfh5 can exchange heme via detection of heme transfer to apo-myoglobin. However, they do not show a critical positive control showing that free heme can bind to their prepared apo-myoglobin to demonstrate the protein is functionally capable of binding heme.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57081.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer 2 proposes an experiment that could shed light on a possible role of Sfh5 as heme-regulated PITP.

These data indicate WT Sfh5 that is not heme-bound is nonetheless an inactive PITP whereas a mutant defective in heme-binding has PITP activity.

Dap1 is a low potential hemoprotein (~-300 mV) that binds heme with a tyrosine ligand. It was thought that Dap1 might be a heme chaperone for ER localized Cytochrome P450s, although this is controversial. dap1∆ exhibits fluconazole and MMS sensitivity, in part due to defects in ergosterol biosynthesis, which requires a P450 enzyme. The authors may want to consider looking at fluconazole sensitivity, or defects in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. There was recently a paper in Nature describing role of PGRMCs in nuclear heme trafficking in adipocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. The <italic>sfh5∆</italic> allele does not alter fluconazole sensitivity of yeast nor does it show any obvious genetic interactions with defects in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. But this general idea is one that merits attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) The affinity of Sfh5 for heme should be examined in more detail. This study suggests bound heme is not a readily exchangeable, but this is difficult to square with the statement in the discussion that only 1/3 of Sfh5s are heme-bound. The fraction of endogenous Sfh5 bound to heme should be determined and shown. It is important that these measurements be made with protein lacking a His-tag since this tag bind heme. If it is correct that bound heme is not readily exchangeable but only a fraction of the protein is heme-bound, some effort should be made to explain this. Is the on rate very slow?</p></disp-quote><p>We demonstrate that position of the His-tag in Sfh5 does not affect its heme-binding properties, and that a His-tagless version of Sfh5 retains:</p><p>1) heme-binding activity, and</p><p>2) the crystal structure unambiguously places the heme-binding pose in the internal hydrophobic pocket of Sfh5 far away from the His-tag.</p><p>Moreover, we find no evidence from extensive studies with other related His-tagged Sec14-like PITPs that the His-tag endows some artifactual heme-binding activity.</p><p>Why is only 30% of the protein occupied by heme? As addressed above for reviewer 2 point 3, we suspect it is because <italic>E. coli</italic> does not make sufficient heme to occupy the amount of Sfh5 produced. We did test to see if supplementing the induction culture with α-ALA increased heme occupancy. It did not for Sfh5 so it remains formally possible that the on-rate is slow. However, those results are also consistent with a model where heme is loaded co-translationally with a fast on-rate. It remains a formal possibility that, without sufficient available heme, a fraction of the protein subtly malfolds and cannot be loaded with heme once it goes off-pathway. We have tried several methods to strip purified Sfh5 of bound heme but the end result is always aggregation. We hope all will agree that the important questions relating to the mechanism of heme-loading, the kinetics of heme loading, etc are outside the scope of this work and could not be completed in a reasonable time frame.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The study demonstrates that heme bound by Sfh5 is accessible to small ligands like CN-, indicating that the heme is redox active, but does not explain how changes in the redox state of bound heme could be physiologically relevant. How could these changes be sensed by other proteins? Or how do the authors think bound heme could significantly contribute to cytoplasmic redox chemistry?</p></disp-quote><p>The questions posed by the reviewer are important and rather broad ones. However, without a physiological context from which to investigate these questions, we do not know how we can address the questions posed. We can only speculate. Given the HIP-HOP data our current hypothesis is that Sfh5 could function to detoxify an organic oxidant(s). Hemoproteins that exhibit such activities typically show very high specificity towards, and high specific activity against, their privileged substrates. But these proteins exhibit very low activities towards other substrates. So, we would need to go fishing for substrate – a daunting task with no clear prospects for success. We hope all will agree that the questions posed, while of critical importance, are simply not experimentally accessible at this time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction: The authors provide a lot of information about the lipid-dependent activities of the PITPs, given that their protein of interest (Sfh5) does not bind lipid and does not appear to function in the manner consistent with PITP function. Since it appears that the function of Sfh5 is unknown (which is interesting), perhaps this should be stated up front along with any information known about its biology in yeast and other eukaryotic homologs-then more briefly mention the functions of related Sec14-like PITPs and lipid-dependent activities as a possible function (i.e., present a hypothesis). The first paragraph of the Results section could be moved up to the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>Revised as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Most of the work to show that Sfh5 binds heme was performed using protein expressed in bacteria, which produced heme-bound Sfh5 that copurifed during purification steps. One experiment is shown to link heme binding to Sfh5 in yeast cells (Figure 1C, lower right panel) but the data signal-to-noise is very low for the yeast protein compared to the bacterial protein and no control is provided to show the heme interaction in the yeast pull-down experiment is specific. Can growth conditions for bacterial or yeast grown be discovered that allow purification of heme-free Sfh5-or biochemical stripping/unfolding/repurification of heme-free protein-which can then be used in heme binding analysis via absorbance or ITC measurements and phosphatidylinositol binding assays?</p></disp-quote><p>Sfh5 is expressed at very low levels in yeast cells and purifying it from yeast in any quantity is a challenge. The question was whether Sfh5 purified from yeast came bound to heme and it does. We trust all will agree the weight of the data identify Sfh5 as a bona fide hemoprotein. We have tried hard to produce heme-free Sfh5 by various methods exactly for the purposes suggested by the reviewer. Those efforts have met with no success. The protein from which heme is extracted simply aggregates in all cases and, as indicated in our response to reviewer 3 point 1, the heme-free fraction of the recombinant Sfh5 is also inactive by any measure we have at our disposal. We also now add the experiment that shows heme-free WT Sfh5 produced in yeast devoid of heme is NOT resuscitated for PITP activity – unlike the heme-binding mutants (see response to reviewer 2, point 3). Our interpretation is that the mutations that abrogate heme binding have the added effect of permitting PtdIns-binding whereas the wild-type Tyr/His coordination motif is intrinsically nonpermissive for PtdIns-binding. Those new data are consistent with our initial interpretations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is no functional evidence presented to prove that Sfh5, which is expressed at low levels and shows no deletion functional phenotype, or its unique heme-binding properties are important in yeast or any other organism. Is it possible Sfh5 could be vestigial in yeast? Do related proteins from other organisms (i.e., those that evolutionarily precede yeast) express Sfh5 with higher expression and more robust heme-dependent functional activities. If Figure 8—figure supplement 2 provides the only insight into the potential functional relevance of Sfh5, the authors should consider moving it to a main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Whether this is a vestigial gene or not is a teleological question we cannot confidently answer. We agree that assessing the functions of Sfh5 orthologs in other systems is a likely next step. But we hope all agree this is well beyond the scope of this work. However, the fact that it is conserved across significant evolutionary distances suggests to us this is not vestigial.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Crystallography: The authors show that Sfh5 is a homodimer using AUC; however, no dimerization was observed in the crystal structure. An issue related to this that should be addressed: when the sfh5_map_coeffs.mtz file provided by the authors is analyzed in CCP4, the Matthews_coef analysis (estimate of the number of asymmetric units in the unit cell) indicates there should be 4 molecules (e.g., two dimers?) in one unit cell with a solvent content ~52.2%. However, the authors solved the structure with 3 molecules in one unit cell. Other issues that should be addressed pertaining to the structure refinement include (1) the Ramachandran outliers in the validation report is 0.5%, which is inconsistent with 0% reported by the authors in the Table 1; (2) the percent of residues with favored Ramachandran is 86%, which can likely be improved; and (3) the R-factor gap (R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub>) is large. Finally, the number of atoms in the protein (129) and ligand (5) reported by the authors in Table 1 needs to be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>The AUC experiments were performed at physiological pH whereas the crystallization conditions were at pH 4.2 so the two results cannot be confidently compared. Regarding the Matthews_coef analysis, the calculated asymmetric unit content with 3 molecules gives a solvent content of 66.4% and with 4 molecules you get a solvent content of 55.1 %. Both are in the acceptable range for proteins. The SAD electron density showed only 3 polypeptide chains per ASU with no additional chain density or gaps in the packing identified.</p><p>1) Regarding the inconsistency of the validation report vs. Table 1, we thank reviewer 4 for the careful examination. We mistakenly rounded to the whole and it is corrected now.</p><p>2) Regarding improvement of the favored Ramachandran, as described above, only the density for chain B was well-ordered. The resultant model for chain B has 100% fit to electron density based on RSRZ values, and no Ramachandran outliers. Chain B model was used for all analysis and interpretation, as well as a guide to build chains A and C, which have large regions of poor density. We now explicitly state this in the text. These regions are the main contributors to the Ramachandran outliers. Imposing stricter geometry restrains by changing weights in the refinement leads to greater gap between R<sub>free</sub> and R<sub>work</sub>.</p><p>3) Regarding the R-factor gap, as stated above, this was a challenging structure to solve and build as chains A and C show large regions of disordered density in the original SAD maps and with model phases. Multiple attempts were made to rebuild the model and multiple data sets were sampled – all sharing the same problems. We chose the best R<sub>work</sub> and R<sub>free</sub> combination that we could obtain and stopped the refinement once R<sub>free</sub> started to increase when we attempted to fix geometry further (as suggested above).</p><p>4) The values have been corrected in the Table 1. Thank you for pointing out this error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 7: The authors prepared apo-myoglobin by methy-ethyl ketone extraction of heme from equine skeletal myoglobin for use in heme-transfer assays to determine if Sfh5 can exchange heme via detection of heme transfer to apo-myoglobin. However, they do not show a critical positive control showing that free heme can bind to their prepared apo-myoglobin to demonstrate the protein is functionally capable of binding heme.</p></disp-quote><p>That control is now included in a new Figure 8.</p></body></sub-article></article>
