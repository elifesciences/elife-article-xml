We then proceeded to evaluate the extent of overlap between the effects related to T2DM and age by applying correlation measures to the separately characterized neurocognitive changes. Our findings were complemented by meta-analyses of published reports with cognitive or neuroimaging measures for T2DM and healthy controls (HCs). We also evaluated in a cohort of T2DM-diagnosed individuals using UK Biobank how disease chronicity and metformin treatment interact with the identified neurocognitive effects.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>The UK Biobank dataset included cognitive and neuroimaging data (N = 20,314), including 1012 T2DM and 19,302 HCs, aged between 50 and 80 years. Duration of T2DM ranged from 0 to 31 years (mean 8.5 ± 6.1 years); 498 were treated with metformin alone, while 352 were unmedicated. Our meta-analysis evaluated 34 cognitive studies (N = 22,231) and 60 neuroimaging studies: 30 of T2DM (N = 866) and 30 of aging (N = 1088). Compared to age, sex, education, and hypertension-matched HC, T2DM was associated with marked cognitive deficits, particularly in <italic>executive functioning</italic> and <italic>processing speed</italic>. Likewise, we found that the diagnosis of T2DM was significantly associated with gray matter atrophy, primarily within the <italic>ventral striatum</italic>, <italic>cerebellum</italic>, and <italic>putamen</italic>, with reorganization of brain activity (decreased in the <italic>caudate</italic> and <italic>premotor cortex</italic> and increased in the <italic>subgenual area</italic>, <italic>orbitofrontal cortex, brainstem,</italic> and <italic>posterior cingulate cortex</italic>). The structural and functional changes associated with T2DM show marked overlap with the effects correlating with age but appear earlier, with disease duration linked to more severe neurodegeneration. Metformin treatment status was not associated with improved neurocognitive outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The neurocognitive impact of T2DM suggests marked acceleration of normal brain aging. T2DM gray matter atrophy occurred approximately 26% ± 14% faster than seen with normal aging; disease duration was associated with increased neurodegeneration. Mechanistically, our results suggest a neurometabolic component to brain aging. Clinically, neuroimaging-based biomarkers may provide a valuable adjunctive measure of T2DM progression and treatment efficacy based on neurological effects.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>The research described in this article was funded by the W.

Patients with T2DM are at greater risk for developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and have been reported to exhibit inferior cognitive performance when compared to age-matched healthy controls (HCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moheet et al., 2015</xref>). Several human neuroimaging studies have linked T2DM with brain atrophy and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moheet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callisaya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mankovsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manschot et al., 2006</xref>); recent research suggested that T2DM resulted in a more rapid rate of cognitive decline than typically associated with natural aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rawlings et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zilliox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pelimanni and Jehkonen, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite strong preliminary evidence linking T2DM to neurological and cognitive decline, few patients with T2DM undergo a comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation as part of their clinical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zilliox et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biessels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ninomiya, 2014</xref>). This may reflect the fact that T2DM diagnosis often occurs in middle age, hindering dissociation of patients’ cognitive changes from normal aging. Several studies published to date focused on the neurocognitive effects of T2DM including age-matched participants. However, because none has compared lifespan neurological changes to those experienced by equivalently aged patients with T2DM, it is currently unknown whether neurocognitive effects represent a T2DM-specific neurodegenerative pathway or the exacerbation of typical brain aging. Moreover, there remain limited data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tuligenga, 2015</xref>) evaluating the impact of chronicity or role of effective treatment in the progression of cognitive and neurological decline.</p><p>Routine clinical protocols typically focus on peripheral biomarkers (e.g., blood glucose and insulin levels, body fat percentage) as diagnostic modalities for T2DM. However, the neurological effects of T2DM may reveal themselves many years before they can be detected by peripheral markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Callisaya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zilliox et al., 2016</xref>). As such, by the time T2DM is diagnosed and treated by standard measures, patients may have already sustained irreversible brain damage. Thus, there are direct clinical implications with respect to defining the neurocognitive impact of T2DM and to determine how these negative sequelae might be prevented or treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaiser et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given these unknowns and their clinical importance, here we focus on addressing three questions. First, we establish T2DM neurocognitive effects compared to age, sex, education, and hypertension-matched HCs. To do so, we leverage the robust statistical power made possible by UK Biobank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sudlow et al., 2015</xref>), the largest (N = 20,314, ages 50–80 years) neurocognitive lifespan dataset to date. The UK Biobank results are then compared to a meta-analysis of the published literature (34 cognitive studies, 60 neuroimaging studies) to assess convergence. Second, we ask whether changes in the brain observed in T2DM represent accelerated aging or a nonaging-related degenerative pathway specific to T2DM. Third, we test whether T2DM chronicity exacerbates, and medication status ameliorates, the progression of neurocognitive effects.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis of UK Biobank dataset (N = 20,314)</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>General overview</title><p>UK Biobank data were analyzed for both cognitive and neuroimaging data. Datafield identifiers for all utilized features are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. The primary factor of interest was T2DM, which we dissociated from age-related effects by age matching T2DM and HC. To permit comparison of T2DM-specific effects to age-specific effects, we also assessed the same neurocognitive variables with age as a factor of interest from samples that excluded patients diagnosed with T2DM. To control for potential neurocognitive confounds, T2DM and HC were exact pairwise matched for not only age, but also sex, education, and hypertension status. T2DM status was assessed based on self-reported diagnosis by doctor. We considered education as a binary variable based on possession of a college degree. Hypertension was quantified using measured blood pressure values: all individuals with systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &gt;90 mmHg were labeled with hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chobanian et al., 2003</xref>). To exclude potential confounding effects due to menopausal transition, particularly relevant to the youngest age group in our sample (age cutoff &gt;50 years), we excluded all female subjects who did not report menopause or if they reported ongoing hormone therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maki and Henderson, 2016</xref>). To minimize the number of individuals with type 1 diabetes in our sample, rather than type 2 diabetes, we only included diabetic individuals with a self-reported age of onset ≥ 40 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We fitted linear regression models to neurocognitive variables and quantified associated effects as the maximum likelihood point estimates and confidence intervals (95% CIs) of the corresponding regression coefficients. T2DM was accounted for as a binary factor with two states corresponding to HCs and individuals diagnosed with T2DM, whereas age was considered as a linear continuous factor with increments in years. The latter was justified given the linear trends we observed across age in all modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">6</xref>). Regression models were fit using the Statsmodels Python library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Seabold and Perktold, 2010</xref>). To account for multiple comparisons, we applied Bonferroni correction to cognitive and structural results, and adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) in our brain activation results; we report adjusted p-values exclusively.</p><p>To determine whether T2DM neurocognitive effects suggested an acceleration of typical aging trajectories, versus nonaging-related degenerative pathways specific to T2DM, we compared the progression of neurodegeneration seen in T2DM to that seen in relation to age across brain regions and cognitive domains using bivariate Pearson correlations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Cognition</title><p>Data on five cognitive domains for 18,829 participants (T2DM: N = 914, HC: N = 17,915) were extracted from the UK Biobank dataset, including <italic>abstract reasoning</italic>, <italic>executive function</italic>, <italic>processing speed</italic>, <italic>reaction time</italic>, and <italic>numeric memory</italic> (~2–3 s).

We employed linear regression and considered the maximum likelihood estimates of coefficients belonging to age and T2DM to estimate their associations with performance in each of the five domains.

For region-specific analyses, we coarse-grained the default unilateral parcellation of 139 regions provided by UK Biobank into 45 bilateral regions and normalized gray matter volumes for head size. We applied linear regression and quantified atrophy in each anatomical region as a relative percentage change in average gray matter volume by dividing the estimated regression coefficients and 95% CIs of the factor of interest by the average gray matter volume of HC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-4"><title>Brain function</title><p>Using functional MRI data from the UK Biobank dataset, we assessed the effects occurring with T2DM (T2DM: N = 646; HC: N = 646, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1B</xref>) compared to non-T2DM-specific age-related effects (N = 2250, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>) on resting-state brain activity. Data were accessed already preprocessed by UK Biobank according to their standard pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfaro-Almagro et al., 2018</xref>).

ALFF was computed from the 0.01–0.08 Hz frequency band, within a gray matter-only brain mask. Computed voxel space ALFF values were normalized to the global mean of each individual subject. Statistical analyses were performed in voxel space using the Nistats Python library. We used a significance threshold of p&lt;0.05 and a minimum cluster size of 12 voxels (~100 mm<sup>3</sup>) and controlled for multiple comparisons using FDR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-5"><title>Implications of T2DM duration</title><p>To evaluate the implications of T2DM chronicity, we analyzed whole-brain gray matter volume with time since T2DM diagnosis as a regressor. Time since diagnosis was derived from self-reported age at T2DM diagnosis. To improve the accuracy of self-reported values, we averaged the reported age of onset values from three visits, separated by multiple years. To estimate the degree to which T2DM progression was associated with gray matter loss relative to age, we calculated the ratio of regression coefficients corresponding to T2DM duration and age, and expressed it as a percentage, using Fieller’s theorem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fieller, 1954</xref>) to quantify the confidence interval (95%) for this ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-6"><title>Implications of metformin treatment</title><p>For patients with T2DM, we evaluated whether metformin, a first-line medication for the treatment of T2DM, was associated with improved outcomes in terms of cognition, atrophy, and/or brain activation.

For these comparisons, we exact-matched for sex, education, and hypertension, and coarse-matched for age (bin size of 5 years) and disease duration (bin size of 3 years). Since UK Biobank did not measure HbA1c levels, we also included body mass index (BMI) as a regressor since it was the only available proxy measure for disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-7"><title>Implications of sex</title><p>To determine whether results detected in the sample might be driven by sex-specific factors, we additionally performed analyses separately in females and males.

Cognitive differences between participants diagnosed with T2DM and HC were determined by calculating standardized mean difference (SMD) effect sizes and 95% CIs for all cognitive domains. Effect size analyses were chosen to account for within-domain variability in the type and sensitivity of cognitive tests across different reports. We calculated effect sizes as Cohen’s d by dividing the mean difference in group scores by the pooled standard deviation of individual domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cohen, 1988</xref>); an SMD (Cohen’s d) of –1.0 was interpreted as a difference of 1 SD in the negative direction. We used random-effects models to account for variability between samples not due to sampling error with significance at p&lt;0.05, and effect size heterogeneity was evaluated using values for Cochran’s Q and I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Moheet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Higgins et al., 2003</xref>).

NeuroQuery is an automated Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fox et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Van Horn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yarkoni et al., 2010</xref>) tool based on a database of z-scores collected by crawling through texts and tables of published research articles by an automated algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>). We utilized NeuroQuery to address limitations of standard approaches to meta-analyses of neuroimaging results, which rely on summary statistics and thus risk overfitting to what typically comprise a relatively small number of in-sample studies (i.e., they fail to generalize to out-of-sample studies). NeuroQuery optimizes for rigor and reproducibility by utilizing predictive modeling, a higher threshold for results than statistical significance. In a quantitative evaluation of its generalization performance with 16-fold cross-validation and 10:90 test-train splits, NeuroQuery was found to accurately produce brain maps for out-of-sample neuroimaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>). We note that because of NeuroQuery’s criteria for neuroimaging data quality and completeness in reporting, the algorithm draws only from journals that focus on functional neuroimaging results, and thus can exclude some general interest and non-neurological medical journals. This exclusion criterion is important to reduce false positives and ensure the quality and relevance of the compiled results. The database in total contains 149,000 neuroimaging papers and represents the single largest database of neuroimaging foci to date. By the law of large numbers, NeuroQuery therefore provides the most unbiased approach to choosing representative papers, even at the risk of excluding relevant and well-cited articles specific to any one field.</p><p>Using the collected database of articles, NeuroQuery applies a multivariate model to predict the spatial distribution of voxel activations corresponding to a search term. The search terms we used to obtain the meta-analytic maps were “diabetic” and “age.” These terms identified the 30 most relevant neuroimaging studies for T2DM and 30 most relevant neuroimaging studies for age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). To account for any errors in the automated search results, the identified set of studies were cross-validated by an independent manual search using the same search terms for Google Scholar and PubMed to verify their relevance, as well as to confirm that they included T2DM age-matched HC and T2DM (not type 1 diabetes). In the T2DM datasets, 23 were fMRI (ALFF), 2 were structural (T1), 3 were FDG positron emission tomography (PET), and 2 were tractography (diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]). In the age datasets, 22 were fMRI (ALFF), 3 were structural (T1), and 5 were tractography (DTI, diffusion weighted imaging).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-4"><title>Data analysis (brain)</title><p>For region- and voxel-level comparisons of the meta-analytic T2DM and age maps from NeuroQuery with their structural and functional counterparts from UK Biobank, the meta-analytic statistical maps were transformed onto comparable coordinate space and spatial resolution. At the voxel level, the meta-analytic maps were resampled to the standard MNI affine (the transformation matrix that maps from voxel indices of the data array to actual real-world locations of the brain; no registration was required as images were already aligned). For region-level comparisons, the transformed voxel maps were coarse-grained to the 45 regions of interest from UK Biobank by masking with each individual region and computing the mean activation of the masked voxels as the representative region value.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cognitive correlates with age and T2DM</title><p>Individuals without T2DM showed age-based cognitive effects across all domains in the UK Biobank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

These findings were supported by meta-analysis of the published literature. Deficits in cognitive performance were accompanied by marked brain atrophy in the T2DM sample compared to age-matched HC. The atrophy was most severe (6.2% gray matter loss compared to HC) in the <italic>ventral striatum</italic>, a region critical to learning, decision-making, goal-directed behavior, and cognitive control. These cognitive functions, collectively known as <italic>executive functioning</italic>, were (with <italic>processing speed</italic>) also those most affected by T2DM. Neurodegeneration severity for all regions increased with longer disease duration. We detected qualitatively consistent results in females and males; however, males exhibited stronger effects in relation to T2DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This result is consistent with the well-established neuroprotective effects of female hormones such as estrogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behl, 2002</xref>). This result also suggests that the T2DM neurological effects observed result from chronic degenerative processes, which, for our female participants, may have been at least partially ameliorated prior to menopause.</p><p>Our findings indicate that structural brain imaging, in particular, can provide a clinically valuable metric for identifying and monitoring neurocognitive effects associated with T2DM. Normalizing across sample sizes to compare the measures of neurocognitive effects – <italic>structural MRI</italic>, <italic>functional MRI</italic>, and <italic>cognitive testing</italic> – structural atrophy showed global effects that were far more statistically robust (p&lt;2e–10) than either global cognitive measures (p=0.0001) or global brain activation (p=0.002). One additional advantage of structural MRI over cognitive testing is that the former avoids confounding associated with education and practice effects, and therefore may be more interpretable in real-world clinical settings in which matching for education and practice effects is not feasible. Structural MRI also showed advantages as a biomarker over a functional MRI-derived measure of brain activation (ALFF). The reorganization of brain activity seen with T2DM may reflect the brain’s switch to less metabolically expensive networks to conserve energy in the face of diminishing access to glucose, a pattern previously documented in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tomasi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weistuch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tomasi and Volkow, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mujica-Parodi et al., 2020</xref>). Yet activation patterns that are spatially reorganized, rather than globally increased or decreased, are less straightforward to quantify. Moreover, functional MRI is an inherently more complex measure than structural MRI, reflecting both neuronal and hemodynamic influences. Each of these influences may be differentially affected by T2DM, further complicating its interpretation in a clinical setting.</p><p>The localization of brain atrophy in T2DM to the <italic>ventral striatum</italic>, followed by the <italic>cerebellum</italic>, may reflect the fact that these two brain regions contain the densest concentrations of insulin-dependent GLUT-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Messari et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El Messari et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vannucci et al., 1998</xref>) compared to non-insulin-dependent isoforms GLUT-1 and GLUT-3. The <italic>ventral striatum</italic> functions as a critical hub within the reward circuit, integrating inputs (including external stimuli) from both cortical and subcortical regions, and therefore is a key structure required for all learning. Rat studies have shown modulation of nitric oxide within the <italic>ventral striatum</italic> to control release of acetylcholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prast et al., 1995</xref>), a neurotransmitter severely reduced in dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kurotani et al., 2003</xref>) and a target for its pharmaceutical treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferreira-Vieira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muramatsu et al., 2019</xref>). Release of nitric oxide is insulin dependent and reduced in T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tessari et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these suggest a potential mechanistic pathway between insulin resistance, atrophy of the <italic>ventral striatum</italic>, and widespread deficits with respect to learning. In this context, memory deficits may be primarily driven by failure to <italic>encode</italic> rather than failure to <italic>retrieve</italic>, which would be consistent with our results that did not identify the hippocampus to be one of the regions most affected. Importantly, the structural and functional changes associated with T2DM show marked overlap with age-related effects but appear earlier. This, on the one hand, suggests that neurocognitive changes seen in T2DM may progress via a common mechanistic trajectory as normal brain aging, but which is accelerated. From another perspective, the overlap implies that brain aging itself may be a metabolic syndrome driven by impaired brain insulin signaling and glucose metabolism, the same processes that, outside the brain, are well-established with respect to T2DM.</p><p>Our analyses had two limitations, inherent in the datasets analyzed, which represent important directions for future research. First, our use of a lifespan dataset permitted tracking how variables change with age, but not for the same subjects. A more rigorous assessment of phase shift between trajectories of neurodegeneration for patients with T2DM and HC would be made possible only with a longitudinal study. Second, while we had access to disease duration and BMI, we did not have HbA1c measures, which would have provided a more direct measure of disease severity. While metformin was not found to be associated with better neurocognitive measures, even when matched to unmedicated patients with equivalent disease duration and after controlling for BMI (a proxy measure for disease severity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bower et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bae et al., 2016</xref>), it was not possible to determine other diabetes-related characteristics. As such, our medication findings should be considered suggestive but not conclusive.</p><p>Consistent with findings from earlier studies that focused on the brain and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sokoloff, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clark, 1999</xref>), our results suggest that T2DM and its progression may accelerate pathways associated with typical brain aging. As T2DM diminishes s glucose availability within the brain, this chronic loss of energy may compromise the brain’s structure and function . We consider the possibility that, by the time T2DM is formally diagnosed, neuronal insulin resistance may have already resulted in significant damage. As such, our findings underscore the need for additional research into brain-based biomarkers for T2DM and treatment strategies that specifically target its neurocognitive effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaiser et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is part of a Novo Nordisk data monitoring committee service for semaglutide in SOUL and FLOW trials.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this timely study the authors explore the impact of age and diabetes status on cognition. The study leverages the UK Biobank data set and validates findings using a meta-analysis of the relevant clinical literature. The major finding is that Type II diabetes is associated with changes in brain structure and cognition similarly to those identified in aging but occurring earlier in individuals with Type II diabetes.</p><p>Please respond to all the issues raised by the reviewers.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1. Sexual dimporphism.</p><p>2. Control group- is it free of diabtes or pre- diabetics as well.</p><p>3. Exclusion of T1DM based on age cutoff is problematic as well because people can develop T1DM even after 20 years of age.</p><p>4. It takes many years before people develop T2DM, and transition from a normal glucose metabolism, to insulin resistance, prediabetes, diabetes; associated with these changes there are many other associated inflammatory, metabolic and molecular changes of systemic and cerebral blood vessels. Authors should discuss this point in their paper.</p><p>5. The duration of diabetes and metformin treatment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Please provide more information regarding how the mid-life or lat<italic>e-</italic>life onset of T2DM influences cognition and neurodegeneration in the analyzed dataset. The duration of diabetes must be considered along with age, sex, and education while performing paired analysis. Provide the average age of subjects selected in T2DM and HC groups? Also, include the minimum and maximum age of subjects included in each group for the assays.</p><p>2. Since sex hormones play an essential role in T2DM and neurodegeneration, I would recommend the authors separate the cognition data based on sex difference and present it as a figure to show how sex differences and their association with T2DM influence cognitive performance.</p><p>3. Does early diabetic intervention limit neurodegeneration and cognition decline in the analyzed dataset? What is the disease severity between the metformin-treated and the untreated groups?</p><p>4. To compare the meta-analysis with UK Biobank data analysis, the parameters used for analysis should be similar. Is the meta-analysis for cognitive performance include sex-based comparison? There is no information regarding this in the methods section. Please clarify</p><p>5. Please check the dataset, for other disease conditions or co-morbidities that could potentially affect the studied cognition domain or brain structure and activity. Because conditions like hypertension that are usual in aged and diabetic conditions can influence the observed data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Strengths of the study include</p><p>a) the use of the UK Biobank,</p><p>b) identification of overlap between the age-sensitive brain structural and functional changes with those in the T2DM group,</p><p>c) demonstration that the duration of T2DM impacts the extent of change,</p><p>d) interesting outcome of the ALFF pointing to reorganization rather than simple decline in &quot;activity&quot; by brain region,</p><p>e) the validation using the meta-analysis and neuroquery combination,</p><p>f) the regression analysis showing congruence for structural outcomes and for cognitive outcomes between the UK Biobank and Meta-analysis approaches.</p><p>Moderate concerns include</p><p>a) The primary focus here is on T2DM, for which (according to the methods) the comparisons to healthy controls were pairwise matched by age, sex, education. The actual number of subjects used is unclear: The UK Biobank dataset included cognitive and neuroimaging data (N=26,125) including 1,270 T2DM and 24,855 HC. T2DM cohort is 5% the size of the HC. What was the actual reference analysis? Were 1270 matched HC used as the reference or were all HC included – how did this impact variance in the measures?</p><p>b) Given the cross-sectional nature of the work differences in composition of the cohort at the various times points and the numbers contributing to each of the increments would be helpful. Were the numbers of data points equivalent across the 50-75 years of age?</p><p>c) Can the authors provide an explanation as to why males and females were combined?</p><p>d) It would be helpful to understand how other potentially important variables such as BMI contributed in the analysis.</p><p>e) The declines in the various parameters with age are quite modest, making those identified in the T2DM all the more striking. In the narrative declines per year are described but actual age is not mentioned and does not appear at all until later in the manuscript (Figure 4) and (Figure S1). The data are shown as 5-year increments from 50-75 years. It is unclear what happened before this time point – is there a period during adulthood when volume remains steady? Appreciating the ~8.3 to ~7.6 GMV voxel count over the 25 year time frame – it would be helpful to understand if the declines are detected from 50 years or earlier.</p><p>f) Was sex or BMI a contributing factor in either the T2DM or the HC outcomes?</p><p>g) The final conclusion of the abstract &quot;As such, neuroimaging-based biomarkers may provide a valuable adjunctive measure of T2DM progression and treatment efficacy based on neurological effects&quot; is not supported. Actual comparisons to established clinical assessments of glucoregulatory impairment were not conducted (effect size and sensitivity), and apart from the obvious considerations of cost and accessibility, this comment seems unnecessary and detracts from the work.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>a) The authors point to &quot;accelerated&quot; cognitive aging but it seems the slopes of decline are rather similar for aging and for T2DM – what differs is the starting value at age 50. It is semantics I suppose but accelerated seems a better fit if the pace of aging is increased, i.e. a different slope. It is appreciated that premature onset of aging phenotypes has in the field been described as accelerated but often it is also accompanied by a quicker rate of decline. What seems to be happening here is premature age-related decline.</p><p>b) Speculation about &quot;switch to less metabolically expensive networks&quot; is unwarranted. In the absence of glucose uptake measures &quot;diminished access to glucose&quot; is not tested. Even with those data, inferences about the metabolism of glucose cannot be made as PET tells nothing about the fate of glucose. This argument ignores the possibility of a role of insulin, lipid signaling, or even inflammatory processes that might equally be speculated upon.</p><p>c) It is somewhat alarming that while 559 of the T2MD were treated with metformin for their condition, 473 were unmedicated. Is this usual?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73138.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Sexual dimporphism.</p></disp-quote><p>In our original submission, we had already excluded the possibility that our results were solely due to sexual dimorphism, as we matched for sex in all analyses in the UK Biobank (every female with T2DM was matched with a female HC control, and equivalently for males). When investigating age, effects were derived from a combination of equally distributed <italic>female only</italic> and <italic>male only</italic> subsamples. However, we agree with the reviewers that differences due to sexual dimorphism in the UK Biobank are relevant and should be reported. Edits can be found on lines 192-195, 358-375, and 385-390.</p><p>To eliminate interaction effects stemming from the menopausal transition process in females, we excluded all female subjects who did not report menopause or reported hormone replacement therapy. As the distribution of the raw sample was strongly skewed towards ages &gt;60 years, these exclusions did not result in significant loss of sample size.</p><p>To address sexual dimorphism, we compared females and males across all three investigated sets of features: cognitive performance, atrophy (gray matter volume), and brain activity (ALFF). For all three, we found significant differences between males and females, which are now reported in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</p><p>In addition, we investigated the interaction between sex and our main factors of interest: T2DM and age, by performing all main analyses independently for females only and for males only. We found that, although age-related effects were equivalent in females and males, T2DM effects were more pronounced in males, even if matched for disease duration (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 4, Figure 2—figure supplement 5, Figure 3—figure supplement 4). This manifested not only in reduced statistical power in females due to smaller sample sizes, but also in smaller mean differences between HC and T2DM in females. We discuss these results and a potential explanation in the discussion on lines 385-390. Our second level analyses correlating effects associated with T2DM and age also showed stronger results in the <italic>male only</italic> subsample (Figure 2—figure supplements 6, 7 and Figure 3—figure supplements 5, 6). However, given that both males and females show the same effects (the differences are of degree, but not of kind), we also present our results from the combined sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Control group- is it free of diabtes or pre- diabetics as well.</p></disp-quote><p>The groups were defined as those that had vs. had not been diagnosed with diabetes by a doctor (“Diabetes diagnosed by doctor”, UK Biobank datafield #2443). While not perfect, this was the best available such feature in the dataset. We acknowledge this limitation in the discussion on lines 430-435. However, it should reassure the reviewer to note that, if there were prediabetics in the control group, this would have weakened the effect size for the comparison, rather than strengthened it. Therefore, the fact that the control group may have contained prediabetics, and yet we still found marked statistical differences between that group and those diagnosed with diabetes, suggests that the results are very robust and might even be more robust than reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Exclusion of T1DM based on age cutoff is problematic as well because people can develop T1DM even after 20 years of age.</p></disp-quote><p>According to a recent study using the same UK Biobank dataset, investigating the distribution of age at diagnosis of T1DM based on genetic markers, only ~1.8% of diagnoses above the age of 40 involved T1DM [1]. Thus, we re-analyzed the data, choosing 40 years as the new cutoff in terms of age at diagnosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Please provide more information regarding how the mid-life or lateLife onset of T2DM influences cognition and neurodegeneration in the analyzed dataset. The duration of diabetes must be considered along with age, sex, and education while performing paired analysis. Provide the average age of subjects selected in T2DM and HC groups? Also, include the minimum and maximum age of subjects included in each group for the assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made edits to the manuscript (line 106) and have added several new figures to clarify. Exact sample sizes and corresponding distributions across age are shown on Appendix figures 1, 2, 3, and 7 for all analyses. Regarding the actual age distributions, all samples were aged 50-80 years, the average age typically being ~65 years across analyses. Given this distribution and the T1 diabetes-related age of onset cutoff at 40 years, our analyses were specific to cases with mid-life and lat<italic>e</italic>-life onset of T2DM. Our analysis of disease duration with respect to gray matter volume did not reveal different outcomes for cases of mid-life vs lat<italic>e</italic>-life onset of T2DM, while matching for duration (see Figure 4). The significant association between disease duration and neurodegeneration appears to be consistent in its extent across the 50-80y age range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Since sex hormones play an essential role in T2DM and neurodegeneration, I would recommend the authors separate the cognition data based on sex difference and present it as a figure to show how sex differences and their association with T2DM influence cognitive performance.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above (Essential Comment #1), we re-analyzed all UK Biobank data to investigate the interaction between sexual dimorphism and T2DM.

Does early diabetic intervention limit neurodegeneration and cognition decline in the analyzed dataset? What is the disease severity between the metformin-treated and the untreated groups?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the dataset did not include sufficient information to evaluate this question. Accordingly, we indicate in the Discussion section (lines 430-435), that we did not have access to appropriate biomarkers such as blood-based measures to assess disease severity between metformin treated and untreated groups. We did control for BMI as the best proxy available, but we did not observe marked differences in this measure: the average BMI was 29.1 and 30.6 for unmedicated and medicated samples, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Please check the dataset, for other disease conditions or co-morbidities that could potentially affect the studied cognition domain or brain structure and activity. Because conditions like hypertension that are usual in aged and diabetic conditions can influence the observed data.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this issue, we now have quantified hypertension based on peripheral blood pressure measurements for all samples, as described in the Methods section (lines 121-123). Consistent with literature, we observed hypertension to influence gray matter volume in several brain regions [2] as well as cognition (short-term memory and abstract reasoning). Since hypertension moderately correlated with T2DM+ status, we repeated all analyses in the UK Biobank by matching for hypertension (along with age, sex and education), to mitigate the variable as a confound.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>a) The primary focus here is on T2DM, for which (according to the methods) the comparisons to healthy controls were pairwise matched by age, sex, education.

What was the actual reference analysis? Were 1270 matched HC used as the reference or were all HC included – how did this impact variance in the measures?</p></disp-quote><p>This information is now clarified in the manuscript, primarily in Appendix figures 1, 2, and 3. In our T2DM vs HC comparisons, we used all eligible T2DM+ samples and matched each one of them with a HC from the total sample, in a 1:1 ratio. For instance, in the case of gray matter volume, we compared 821 T2DM+ to 821 HC which were matched for age, sex, education and hypertension, but otherwise randomly picked from the total sample. Consequently, this resulted in numerous HC samples being discarded. When addressing effects associated with age, we investigated within HC only, resulting in significantly larger sample sizes and statistical power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Given the cross-sectional nature of the work differences in composition of the cohort at the various times points and the numbers contributing to each of the increments would be helpful.

We refer the reviewer to our response given to an earlier comment (Essential Comment #1) where we explain our findings in detail. Please note that all our UK Biobank analyses matched for sex, to exclude it as a confounder. With respect to sex specific T2DM related effects, we did not detect qualitatively different results when performing analyses in <italic>females only</italic> vs in <italic>males only</italic>, which justified our decision to present the main results combining sexes. Sex-specific results are now presented in Supplemental Figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) It would be helpful to understand how other potentially important variables such as BMI contributed in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we re-performed all our analyses with BMI as an additional covariate and found BMI to be a significant predictor for gray matter volume, but not for cognition or brain function. As for structure, we were unable to dissociate BMI and T2DM associated effects given the strong collinearity between increased BMI and T2DM+ status. The collinearity was so strong that even matching was deemed impractical due to significant sample size loss (lack of T2DM+ with low BMI).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The declines in the various parameters with age are quite modest, making those identified in the T2DM all the more striking. In the narrative declines per year are described but actual age is not mentioned and does not appear at all until later in the manuscript (Figure 4) and (Figure S1). The data are shown as 5-year increments from 50-75 years. It is unclear what happened before this time point – is there a period during adulthood when volume remains steady? Appreciating the ~8.3 to ~7.6 GMV voxel count over the 25 year time frame – it would be helpful to understand if the declines are detected from 50 years or earlier.</p></disp-quote><p>The ~0.5-1% decline per year we identified with respect to age (as shown in Figure 1 for cognition and Figure 2 for gray matter volume) were indeed specific to 50 years and above. Less than 1% of our sample was younger than 48 years and none was younger than 44 years. This precludes the evaluation of aging-related neurocognitive deterioration prior to age 50.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) Was sex or BMI a contributing factor in either the T2DM or the HC outcomes?</p></disp-quote><p>Sex was a statistically significant contributing factor across all our features; consequently, we matched for it. Please once again refer to our earlier response to Essential Comment #1. BMI, as described in our response above to another comment above, was also significant but only in the context of gray matter volume.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) The final conclusion of the abstract &quot;As such, neuroimaging-based biomarkers may provide a valuable adjunctive measure of T2DM progression and treatment efficacy based on neurological effects&quot; is not supported. Actual comparisons to established clinical assessments of glucoregulatory impairment were not conducted (effect size and sensitivity), and apart from the obvious considerations of cost and accessibility, this comment seems unnecessary and detracts from the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We respect the reviewer’s perspective. However, our remark occurs at the end of the Discussion section in the context of a direction for future clinical research. We believe that this research is warranted based on the widespread neurodegenerative effects that we identified in patients with T2DM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments:</p><p>a) The authors point to &quot;accelerated&quot; cognitive aging but it seems the slopes of decline are rather similar for aging and for T2DM – what differs is the starting value at age 50. It is semantics I suppose but accelerated seems a better fit if the pace of aging is increased, i.e. a different slope. It is appreciated that premature onset of aging phenotypes has in the field been described as accelerated but often it is also accompanied by a quicker rate of decline. What seems to be happening here is premature age-related decline.</p></disp-quote><p>This is more clearly represented in the analyses where we break up the T2DM+ cohort with respect to disease chronicity. Specifically, in Figure 4 we show that as disease duration increases, the deviation between T2DM+ and HC increases (acceleration of 0.26% ± 0.14%).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Speculation about &quot;switch to less metabolically expensive networks&quot; is unwarranted. In the absence of glucose uptake measures &quot;diminished access to glucose&quot; is not tested. Even with those data, inferences about the metabolism of glucose cannot be made as PET tells nothing about the fate of glucose. This argument ignores the possibility of a role of insulin, lipid signaling, or even inflammatory processes that might equally be speculated upon.</p></disp-quote><p>This claim is based on existing literature [3, 4], providing evidence not only for inhomogeneity among brain regions in terms of metabolic requirements and efficiency. Subcortical regions and the cerebellum were found to be metabolically cheaper, which is relevant to the brain activity patterns we observed in relation to T2DM and age: brain activity manifested a general shift from cortical to subcortical regions (Figure 3) [3].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) It is somewhat alarming that while 559 of the T2MD were treated with metformin for their condition, 473 were unmedicated. Is this usual?</p></disp-quote><p>Half of unmedicated subjects were diagnosed less than five years earlier (25% within two years), whereas for medicated subjects, average duration was twice as high. This suggests that a significant number of subjects might not have been diagnosed for sufficient time to start medication. In addition, our sample of 498 subjects who reported taking metformin included those only who took metformin exclusively (we excluded those taking multiple medications to treat their diabetes). There were an additional ~150 subjects who were excluded due to polypharmacy, further raising the ratio.</p><p>References:</p><p>[1]: Thomas, Nicholas J., et al. &quot;Frequency and phenotype of type 1 diabetes in the first six decades of life: a cross-sectional, genetically stratified survival analysis from UK Biobank.&quot; <italic>The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology</italic> 6.2 (2018): 122-129.</p><p>[2]: Gianaros, Peter J., et al. &quot;Higher blood pressure predicts lower regional grey matter volume: Consequences on short-term information processing.&quot; <italic>Neuroimage</italic> 31.2 (2006): 754-765.</p><p>[3]: Tomasi, Dardo, Gene-Jack Wang, and Nora D.
