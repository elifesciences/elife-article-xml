Typically, this phenomenon has been considered maladaptive and may preclude vision restoration in the blind. However, several recent studies utilizing triggered photoreceptor ablation have shown adaptive responses in bipolar cells expected to support normal vision. Whether such homeostatic plasticity occurs during progressive photoreceptor degenerative disease to help maintain normal visual behavior is unknown. We addressed this issue in an established mouse model of Retinitis Pigmentosa caused by the P23H mutation in rhodopsin. We show robust modulation of the retinal transcriptomic network, reminiscent of the neurodevelopmental state, and potentiation of rod – rod bipolar cell signaling following rod photoreceptor degeneration. Additionally, we found highly sensitive night vision in P23H mice even when more than half of the rod photoreceptors were lost. These results suggest retinal adaptation leading to persistent visual function during photoreceptor degenerative disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>homeostatic plasticity</kwd><kwd>sensory systems</kwd><kwd>eye</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>retinal degeneration</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00 EY026651</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vinberg</surname><given-names>Frans</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001694</institution-id><institution>International Retinal Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Regular Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vinberg</surname><given-names>Frans</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001818</institution-id><institution>Research to Prevent Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dr. H.

maintaining their stability in the face of numerous perturbations occurring over a lifetime. Homeostatic plasticity is the process whereby the activity of the neuron or neural network is maintained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burrone, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>). Homeostatic plasticity is a relatively new concept first described in the central nervous system in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turrigiano et al., 1998</xref>). Since then various homeostatic plasticity mechanisms have been reported in different regions of the brain, including the hippocampus and somatosensory and visual cortices, using in vivo models and ex vivo and in vitro preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gainey and Feldman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turrigiano, 2017</xref>). As examples, binocular visual deprivation triggers compensatory synaptic changes in the primary visual cortex leading to the stabilization of spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goel and Lee, 2007</xref>), and stroke can trigger homeostatic plasticity that is thought to compensate for neural damage and play an important role in early phase rehabilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murphy and Corbett, 2009</xref>). Homeostatic plasticity counteracts insufficient activity in neural synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burrone, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>), but it also works to prevent saturation of synapses that could be caused by positive feedback mediated by Hebbian plasticity, which is better known for its role in experience-dependent plasticity, learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Bear, 1996</xref>).</p><p>The neural retina of the eye is considered relatively stable both structurally and functionally after postnatal development. Still, remodeling of the retina in response to photoreceptor degenerative diseases is well established. Retinal remodeling often has been described as a maladaptive process that can exacerbate the disease and impede treatment strategies designed to rescue light responsiveness of the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fariss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones and Marc, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marc and Jones, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Telias et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toychiev et al., 2013</xref>). It involves formation of ectopic synapses and expression of disruptive spontaneous oscillatory activity in the post-receptoral inner retina during photoreceptor degenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haverkamp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Margolis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michalakis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stasheff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toychiev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tu et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, recent evidence supports adaptive rather than solely destructive neural changes. For example, dendritic compensatory synapse formation occurs in retinal bipolar cells when various retinal cells, including rod and cone photoreceptors, have been ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Care et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shen et al., 2020</xref>). These studies suggested that rod or cone bipolar cell dendrites can extend their arbors and form new synapses with their correct targets (i.e. rod and cone photoreceptor cells) either within their normal territory or sometimes outside of their normal dendritic field to compensate for the reduced number of photoreceptor cells. On the other hand, the most recent of such studies showed functional compensation without any observable anatomical changes in rod bipolar cells even after ablation of ~50% of rods in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Care et al., 2020</xref>). These homeostatic changes could help maintain retinal output and vision at or near normal levels. It is likely that the mechanisms, onset and time course of degeneration as well as the cell types in question all contribute to remodeling in the retina, and whether it will have a supportive or deleterious effect on vision. Thus, it will be critical to determine the nature of remodeling and plasticity under various conditions of retinal degeneration.</p><p>Whether homeostatic plasticity is present during a progressive retinal degenerative disease is unknown. We hypothesized that an inherited photoreceptor degenerative disease that progresses in a moderate manner would promote homeostatic plasticity supporting normal vision. We tested this hypothesis using an established mouse model of the most common form of Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) caused by a dominant P23H mutation in the rod visual pigment, rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakami et al., 2011</xref>). By conducting whole retinal RNA-sequencing, in vivo and ex vivo electrophysiology, as well as behavioral experiments in diseased and control mice during the course of disease progression, we demonstrate that rod photoreceptor degeneration triggers homeostatic plasticity and the potentiation of rod–rod bipolar cell signaling that is associated with the maintenance of highly sensitive scotopic vision. This type of compensatory mechanism may explain why patients with inherited retinal diseases can maintain normal vision until a relatively advanced disease state is reached and could inspire novel treatment strategies for blinding diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Progression of retinal degeneration and functional decline in heterozygous P23H mice</title><p>Retinal remodeling following photoreceptor cell death has been observed in a number of genetic and induced animal models of retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beltran, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LaVail et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petersen-Jones, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ross et al., 2012</xref>), as well as in postmortem human eye specimens from patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) or age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fariss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jones et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 1995</xref>). In the current study, we utilized a well-established mouse model of autosomal dominant RP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakami et al., 2011</xref>), caused by a heterozygous P23H mutation in the rhodopsin gene (<italic>Rho<sup>P23H/WT</sup></italic>). These mice will be referred to in this report as P23H mice. We started by confirming the suitability of this model for our study, focusing on rod-mediated retinal signaling and night vision. We followed structural changes of the retina by standard histology and optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, and confirmed that the outer nuclear layer (ONL) where the photoreceptor nuclei reside, and the inner and outer segments (IS and OS, respectively) of rod and cone photoreceptors progressively degenerated, while inner retinal layers appeared to remain anatomically intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–G</xref>). In mice, the thickness of the ONL correlates with the number of surviving rod photoreceptors. We found 20%, 60% and 73% decreases in central retinal ONL thickness at 1-, 3- and 5 months of age, respectively, in P23H mice compared to WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Next, using in vivo electroretinography (ERG) we tested the light-activated mass electrical response arising from the retina. We analyzed the a-wave of the fully dark-adapted retina, which is primarily a rod-dominant response with a minute contribution from cones. The dark-adapted a-wave showed an almost 50% suppression in P23H mice by 1 month of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>) consistent with an earlier study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakami et al., 2011</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of retinal degeneration progression in heterozygote P23H rhodopsin-mutated mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative histology image of a wild-type (WT) mouse eye.

ANOVA analysis revealed a modest but statistically significant (F<sub>1,12</sub>=5.25, p=0.04) increase in the photopic ERG amplitude in P23H mice compared to WT littermates at 1 month of age, which continued at 3 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). However, cone function started to decline thereafter, and at 5 months of age the photopic ERG amplitudes significantly decreased in P23H mice.</p><p>Next, using eyecup cryosections and antibody staining, we evaluated the integrity of the synapse site between photoreceptors and bipolar cells, the outer plexiform layer (OPL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We stained rod bipolar cells by anti-protein kinase C α (PKCα), horizontal cells by anti-calbindin, and photoreceptor synaptic terminals by anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) antibodies. PKCα and calbindin staining patterns and intensities appeared unchanged in 1-month-old P23H retinas compared to WT littermates. Instead, immunoreactivity of both these markers decreased with disease progression until 3- and even more until 5 months of age. VGLUT1 staining revealed slight thinning of the OPL already at 1 month of age in P23H mice, and this degeneration progressed with aging.</p><p>Finally, we performed anti-C-terminal-binding protein 2 (CtBP2) and anti-metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6) double-staining and optical sectioning fluorescence imaging with high magnification to show pre- and postsynaptic terminals, respectively, at the OPL in 1-month-old retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We observed intact morphology and density of the pre- and postsynaptic terminals, but the count of synapses was decreased by ~20% in P23H retinas. This is likely attributable to the overall thinning of the OPL.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Decreased number of photoreceptor-bipolar cell synapses in 1-month-old P23H mouse retinas.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative sections of wild-type and (<bold>B</bold>) P23H mouse retinas stained with mGluR6 (green) and CtBP2 (magenta) antibodies that stain the postsynaptic and presynaptic compartments at the photoreceptor-bipolar cell synapse, respectively.

In contrast, GO analysis revealed robust increases in gene clusters associated with neural growth and development, encompassing such cellular processes as synapse organization, postsynaptic specialization, glutamatergic synapse formation, axonogenesis, and cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Strikingly, despite the ~40% decrease of photoreceptor input in 1-month-old P23H mice, their bipolar cell responses did not diminish at any of the light flash intensities utilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Since rod bipolar cells derive their responses by pooling input from several rod photoreceptors, we quantified the sensitivity of rod bipolar cells to their intrinsic input in two ways. First, we compared the ratio of bipolar cell and photoreceptor cell responses (<italic>R<sub>BC</sub></italic>/<italic>R<sub>PR</sub></italic>) between control and P23H mice at each light flash intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). This ratio increased in 1-month-old P23H mice compared to control mice, indicating a significant increase in the sensitivity of the bipolar cells. We also found less pronounced but statistically significant increases of <italic>R<sub>BC</sub></italic>/<italic>R<sub>PR</sub></italic> in 5-month-old P23H mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These results are consistent with two prior studies showing less severe reduction of the in vivo ERG b-waves as compared to a-waves in a P23H transgenic rat model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aleman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Machida et al., 2000</xref>). However, one caveat in analyzing <italic>R<sub>BC</sub></italic>/<italic>R<sub>PR</sub></italic> is that the photoreceptor response amplitudes are not linear functions of light intensity. Thus, a second, more quantitative way to determine the sensitivity of bipolar cells to their photoreceptor input is to plot <italic>R<sub>BC</sub></italic> as a function of <italic>R<sub>PR</sub></italic> and determine the <italic>R<sub>PR</sub></italic> required to generate a half-maximal <italic>R<sub>BC</sub></italic> (=<italic>RP<sub>P,1/2</sub></italic>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref> below and Materials and methods).

However, at an older age, it is possible that the cone-mediated responses, which we found to be preserved longer compared to rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>), and even hyper-sensitized in the early disease state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), could dominate and explain the compensation of bipolar cell responses in P23H mice. To exclude this possibility and to study more quantitatively the implications of the P23H rhodopsin mutation in the rod signaling pathway, we crossed P23H mice with a cone transducin-α (<italic>Gnat2</italic>) knock-out (P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) mouse line. The cones in these mice do not generate light responses but have no structural abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ronning et al., 2018</xref>). We observed a qualitatively similar phenomenon in P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice as in P23H knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The maximal rod response amplitude was suppressed by more than half in 1-month-old P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to their littermate control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). A further decrease of the maximal rod response amplitudes in aging P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was accompanied by the desensitization of their rods as indicated by larger values of <italic>I<sub>1/2</sub></italic> in 1–6 month-old P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The rod bipolar cell responses decreased less than the rod responses in 1- and 5-month-old P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice before a relatively steep decrease from 5 to 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Since the decrease of <italic>R<sub>BC</sub></italic> was slower compared to the decline in <italic>R<sub>PR</sub></italic> with age, the <italic>R<sub>BC</sub>/R<sub>PR</sub></italic> ratios remained significantly higher up to 6 months of age in P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (the oldest age tested, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Moreover, we found an almost twofold decrease in photoreceptor input required to generate a half-maximal RBC response in 1-month-old P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice as compared to that in control mice, and <italic>R<sub>PR,1/2</sub></italic> continued to decrease down to ~20% of that in control retinas in 6-month-old P23H mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Although Barium Chloride (BaCl<sub>2</sub>) has been shown to be effective in blocking the ex vivo ERG component arising from Müller cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolnick et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nymark et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vinberg and Kefalov, 2015b</xref>), the experiments above did not specifically assess the potential contribution of Müller cells to the b-wave amplitudes. To test that, we recorded ex vivo ERG responses from 1-month-old <italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and their littermate P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse retinas perfused with Ames’ medium without and with 100 μM BaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We found that b-wave amplitudes in the absence of BaCl<sub>2</sub> were smaller than those in the presence of barium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). This is probably because barium removes the negative slow PIII component that temporally overlaps with the positive b-wave. Comparison between 1-month-old control and P23H mice revealed that b-wave amplitudes were not affected by the P23H rhodopsin mutation in the absence or presence of barium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Finally, we derived Müller cell responses by subtracting the responses recorded in the presence of barium from those recorded in the absence of barium from individual retinas across different light intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,F</xref>). Müller cell responses were not affected at dim light but tended to be somewhat smaller with the two brightest light intensities used in these experiments in the 1-month-old P23H mice as compared to those in control mice. These results do not support a role for increased Müller cell activity in explaining the observed potentiation of the b-wave responses in P23H mice.</p><p>Although the cones lacking GNAT2 do not generate light responses, light signal transmission from rods to the cone pathway through gap junctional coupling could be upregulated in P23H mice to compensate for the reduced rod input. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of a gap junction blocker, meclofenamic acid (MFA), on the photoreceptor a-wave and ON bipolar cell b-wave by ex vivo ERG in 1-month-old P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). If potentiation of the b-wave responses is due to increased signaling of rods to the cone pathway via gap junctions, we expected to see suppression of the b-wave amplitudes by MFA. Although MFA trended toward suppressing the b-wave amplitude, it appeared to cause even larger suppression of the a-wave amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This result suggests that electrical transmission from rods to cones or cone bipolar cells does not contribute significantly to the measured ex vivo ERG bipolar cell component in P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and cannot explain the observed potentiation of <italic>R<sub>BC</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Another possibility for the increased sensitivity of the rod bipolar cells in P23H mice is reduced inhibitory input into rod bipolar cells, that is. disinhibition. To test this, we determined the contribution of GABA-, glycine-, and inhibitory dopaminergic signaling to the rod bipolar cell responses using ex vivo ERG in the retinas from <italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and C57 wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). No significant differences were found in the ERG a- or b-wave amplitudes between the control and treated conditions with any of the antagonists suggesting that disinhibition, as a mechanism, likely does not play a significant role in elevating rod bipolar cell responses observed in ex vivo ERG recordings from P23H mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that during rod degeneration and suppressed rod phototransduction triggered by the P23H rhodopsin mutation, the rod-rod bipolar cell signaling is strengthened via compensatory pathways that are most probably intrinsic to the rod axon terminal and/or rod bipolar cells.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Contribution of gap junctions or inhibitory synaptic inputs to bipolar cells on the photoreceptor and bipolar cell components of the ex vivo ERG signal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example traces to dim and bright flashes recorded from a dark-adapted wild-type mouse retina perfused with Ames’ containing 100 µM BaCl<sub>2</sub>.

Our aim was to focus on the question of whether potentiation of the rod-rod bipolar cell signaling in P23H mice can help maintain high-sensitivity night vision. This goal was further facilitated by use of the <italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background to abolish light responses of cones and the use of ambient light ranging from scotopic to photopic conditions. We found that CS decreased slightly in P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice only at the dimmest background light up until 3 months of age in ambient light ranging from −3.3 to 0.85 log(Cd/m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). At 5 months of age, CS was suppressed at the two dimmest ambient light levels (−3.3 and −2.4 log(Cd/m<sup>2</sup>)), but not at brighter illuminances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, a significant drop in performance occurred in 6-month-old P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at all except the brightest ambient light level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). A decrease in the sensitivity of rod-mediated vision was expected since absolute rod bipolar cell responses decreased in P23H mice as they aged beyond 1 month (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarria et al., 2015</xref>). However, consistent with our finding that the rod bipolar cell sensitivity to their rod input was potentiated in P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice up to 5 months of age, the decrease in scotopic contrast sensitivity was less severe than expected if based solely on the degeneration and functional decline of rod photoreceptors caused by the P23H rhodopsin mutation.

In phase 1, glial cells are activated, and neural reprogramming begins due to photoreceptor death, typically starting in rods that mediate our night vision. Phase 2 refers to an advanced disease stage when collateral, secondary cone cell death ensues. Phase 3 is a terminal phase and is thought to begin when all the photoreceptors have degenerated. According to this classification, our study using an adRP mouse model begins when remodeling is in phase 1 and ends in the earliest steps of phase 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>We employed knock-in mice that carry a heterozygous P23H rhodopsin mutation. The P23H mouse line is a well-characterized model for the most common form of adRP, and closely parallels the pathological characteristics of the human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sakami et al., 2011</xref>). Typically, the clinical disease first manifests as night blindness followed by a gradual loss of visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berson et al., 1991</xref>). However, the disease severity and progression are moderate compared to many other types of RP, and the patients can retain normal visual acuity well into their thirties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berson et al., 1991</xref>). This may be due to the cone population preserved in many patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hartong et al., 2006</xref>). We found that the number of cone cells remained normal in P23H mice up to 5 months of age, the last time point studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Cone function was normal in 1- and 3-month-old P23H mice but significantly decreased at 5 months of age when compared to their WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). An earlier study demonstrated that the maximal rod response amplitude is suppressed by only 5% at post-natal day (P) 14 in heterozygous P23H mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakami et al., 2014</xref>), implying practically normal amplitudes at eye opening. We found that the maximal ERG response arising from the rod population was reduced by 45–60% in 1-month-old P23H mice compared to control mice depending on the method of recording (in vivo vs. ex vivo) and the background of the mice (C57 vs. <italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). However, the waveform of the ERG response appeared qualitatively normal, and the first positive deflection of the in vivo ERG signal (b-wave) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) as well as the rod bipolar cell responses derived using ex vivo ERG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) were comparable between 1-month-old P23H and control mice. Therefore, we concluded that 1 month of age represents an optimal time for a molecular genetics screen of P23H mice as by this age a functional deficit of the rod population is significant, whereas their degeneration is not yet severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Furthermore, at 1 month of age the confounding factors arising from any developmental plasticity associated with the retina is avoided due to the full maturation of the mouse retina at this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Young, 1985</xref>).</p><p>We first hypothesized that if homeostatic plasticity occurs in response to rod cell death in the retina, it must show a discernible fingerprint in the retinal transcriptome. As expected, due to a loss of rods, several photoreceptor selective gene clusters were downregulated in P23H retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, in the early disease state pronounced upregulation arose in pathways involving neural development, such as synaptic organization, axonogenesis and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). We also found several enriched pathways that overlap between cell stress responses and neuronal plasticity, such as the MAPK, NF-kappa B and TNF signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pozniak et al., 2014</xref>). In the case of P23H retinas, it is difficult to determine whether these major transcription regulators are upregulated primarily due to cell degeneration and stress or due to the induction of plasticity machinery. Nevertheless, our RNA-seq analysis is consistent with our hypothesis that a robust neural network adaptation in the retina takes place in the early stages of photoreceptor degenerative disease caused by the P23H rhodopsin mutation. At the same 1 month of age, we found that while the photoreceptor component of the ex vivo ERG response was significantly suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>), the light sensitivity of the rod bipolar cell responses was similar to that in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In the C57 background, the light-sensitivity of bipolar cells tended to be even higher in 1-month-old P23H mice as compared to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, this may be due to the contribution from increased light responses of cones observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), since without the contribution of cone phototransduction, the rod bipolar cell sensitivity slightly decreased in P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We also found better preserved visually guided behavior on the C57 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) as compared to the <italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, the compensatory sensitization of the rod bipolar cells to their rod input cannot be explained simply by upregulation of cone-mediated signaling, since the same phenomenon was observed in P23H mice both in C57 and <italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were also observed to perform almost normally until 3 months of age in a behavioral visual contrast threshold task, even at the lowest luminance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). At this age, the overall rod input already decreased by more than half in P23H mice which was expected to significantly elevate contrast thresholds (or decrease contrast sensitivity) specifically at the two lowest luminance levels where the contrast sensitivity is proportional to background light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Therefore, it appears that the gradual loss of the rod photoreceptors, or declined input from them, triggers functional homeostatic adaptation in the retina that allows maintenance of visual function downstream of the photoreceptors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Is retinal remodeling and plasticity supporting or impairing retinal output and vision?</title><p>Our results using the P23H mouse model appear at odds with some prior research casting a rather negative connotation over retinal remodeling following the loss of photoreceptors.

What might underlie this apparent discrepancy with our findings?

Their dark-adapted ERG response is observable but already significantly compromised at P18 and by 1 month of age the light responses of rods are practically abolished and most of their photoreceptors have degenerated, particularly in the central retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gargini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is possible that functional and behavioral studies using <italic>rd1</italic> and <italic>rd10</italic> mice, typically conducted with mice older than 1 month of age, may have missed the window for observing constructive remodeling expected to promote retinal output and vision. In contrast, the slower rate of retinal degeneration in the heterozygous P23H animal model provides a broader window of opportunity for investigating the impact of photoreceptor degeneration on early stage retinal remodeling (phase 1).</p><p>Recent studies using the specific deletion of ~50–90% of rods, cones or rod bipolar cells during development or in mature mice have revealed homeostatic mechanisms associated with the maintenance of normal retinal output and vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Care et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Care et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tien et al., 2017</xref>). Here we used a P23H knock-in mouse model of RP that recapitulates the human disease. Our results are consistent with the idea that at least during phase 1 of remodeling, photoreceptor death induces functional compensation that supports close to normal retinal output and rod-mediated vision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Even at the stage where we observed prominent cone dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) in 5- or even 6-month-old P23H/<italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, the rod bipolar cells continued to increase their sensitivity to rod input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), although at this point the light responses of rods were already small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) and the absolute amplitudes of the rod bipolar cell light responses had significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) together with lower contrast sensitivity of their rod-mediated vision in dim light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results therefore suggest that up to a point where some residual rod light responses exist, the retina can adapt toward supporting normal retinal output and scotopic vision. In this manner, patients at this stage of retinal degenerative disease might be expected to benefit from various treatments designed to restore photoreceptors and their light responses. However, the duration during which the inner retina remains capable of processing light signals and therefore is amenable to these types of treatments remains unknown. Studies with other animal models suggest that corruption of the inner retina would become a problem at later time points, including in P23H mutation-associated RP models. Quantitative functional and behavioral studies at later stages will be needed to address this question.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanism for increased sensitivity of rod bipolar cells to their rod input</title><p>Our RNA-seq and electrophysiology data strongly suggest that homeostatic plasticity is induced at early stages of rod degeneration in the P23H mouse retina. Still, the homeostatic plasticity mechanisms for the increased sensitivity of rod bipolar cells to their rod input remain unclear. Possibilities include (1) formation of new synapses between rod bipolar cells and surviving photoreceptors, (2) increased electrical coupling of rods to the cone pathway, (3) reduced inhibitory drive to rod bipolar cells (disinhibition), (4) pre- and/or postsynaptic scaling, and (5) increased excitability through axonal remodeling of rod bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We tested hypotheses 2 and 3 by using blockers for gap junctions and major inhibitory postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our findings did not support either of these hypotheses, and it appears that the potentiation of the ERG b-wave is not mediated by disinhibition or altered gap junctional coupling in P23H mice. Hypothesis 1 would align well with recent studies showing that cone bipolar cell dendrites formed new synapses with surviving cones after ~50% of cones had been ablated in juvenile or mature mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Care et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shen et al., 2020</xref>). In another study, ablation of 50–90% of rod bipolar cells during development led to an extension of the dendrites of the remaining rod bipolar cells so that they contacted more rods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>). It also has been shown that restoration of rod function in juvenile mice, which lacked rod function during development, can lead to the formation of new functional synapses between rods and rod bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). However, our data from IHC staining does not support formation of new synaptic contacts . We detected fewer mGluR6 positive puncta, reflecting a decreased number of synapses, in 1-month-old P23H retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and on the other hand, rod bipolar cell labeling showed indistinguishable staining patterns between P23H and control retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In line with this, ablation of ~50% of rods in a WT adult mouse retina, phenotypically mimicking the situation in young adult P23H mice including compensation of the ERG b-wave amplitude, did not lead to morphological synaptic changes in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Care et al., 2020</xref>. Our RNA-seq data show upregulations in a number of mRNAs of ion channels and G protein-coupled receptors, such as the <italic>Trpm1</italic> cation channel crucial for ON bipolar cell depolarization as well as glutamatergic receptors that could contribute either to the strengthening of individual rod-rod bipolar cell synapses or increased excitability of the rod bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). Therefore, postsynaptic scaling and/or increased intrinsic excitability of rod bipolar cells (hypotheses 4 and/or 5) appear the most likely candidates in explaining the functional compensation upon rod death in P23H mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). On the other hand, Care et al. proposed that functional compensation at rod bipolar cells upon ~50% input loss from rods was attributable to disinhibition (our hypothesis 3). It should be noted, however, that the mechanism by which neurons and neural networks adapt to acute stressors versus progressive disease conditions may differ. Another interesting possibility is that Müller cells would support bipolar cell function and contribute to the preservation of b-wave response amplitudes in ex vivo ERG experiments. Although we used barium to block the slow PIII component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolnick et al., 1979</xref>), it is possible that Müller cells contribute to the ERG b-wave even in the presence of barium. If this contribution changes in P23H mice, that could in principle also explain the observed potentiation of the ex vivo ERG b-waves in the P23H mice. Additional work will be needed to resolve the exact homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that promote rod-rod bipolar cell signaling and visual function. Such knowledge could then help us understand how sensory systems respond to potentially compromising circumstances throughout life, and as well help in designing interventions to enhance homeostatic plasticity when needed.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Hypotheses for the potentiation of the rod-rod bipolar cell signal transmission in the P23H mice.</title><p>Numbers 1–5 indicate the five different hypotheses discussed in the text.

Light stimulation was produced by an in-house scripted stimulation series in Espion software (version 6; Diagnosys). Before scotopic recordings, the mice were dark-adapted overnight and animal handling before recording was performed under dim red light. The eyes were stimulated with a green LED (peak 544 nm, bandwidth 160 nm) using a 13-step ascending flash intensity series ranging from 0.00015 to 300 cd·s/m<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Before photopic ERG recordings, mice were kept in a vivarium. After induction of anesthesia, the eyes were first adapted to a rod-suppressing green background light at 20 cd/m<sup>2</sup> for 1 min. Stimulation was performed with a blue LED (peak emission 460 nm, bandwidth ∼100 nm) at light intensity increments of 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 cd·s/m<sup>2</sup>. As the short wavelength cone opsin (S-opsin) and medium wavelength cone opsin (M-opsin) sensitivities peak at 360 and 508 nm in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nikonov et al., 2006</xref>), respectively, the blue LED stimulates both S- and M-opsins. LED light emission spectra were measured with a Specbos 1211UV spectroradiometer (JETI Technische Instrumente GmbH, Jena, Germany).</p><p>The ERG signal was acquired at 2 kHz and filtered with a low frequency cutoff at 0.25 Hz and a high frequency cutoff at 300 Hz. Espion software automatically detected the ERG a-wave (first negative ERG component) and b-wave (first positive ERG component).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA isolation, quantitative PCR and RNA-sequencing</title><p>Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and eyes were promptly harvested. Retinas were dissected away from the eyecup and put into RNAlater solution (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). The samples were stored at −80°C before processing. The retinas were homogenized using a motorized pestle, and the homogenate was spun in a tabletop centrifuge at full speed for 3 min. Supernatant was collected and RNA extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. On-column DNAase digestion (Qiagen RNase-Free DNase) was used to remove any genomic DNA contamination from the sample. Five hundred ng of purified RNA were used for cDNA synthesis using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Irvine, CA), and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used as one of the initial sample quality checks before RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), and also in verifying the expression level of <italic>Grm6</italic>, <italic>Trpm1</italic>, <italic>Slc17a7</italic> and <italic>Cacna1F</italic> using the ∆∆Ct method.

(Sacramento, CA) using the Illumina HiSeq instrument. QC was performed with agarose gel electrophoresis and Nanodrop and Agilent 2100 devices. The gene expression data were aligned with a reference genome (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> mm10) using Tophat2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml">http://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml</ext-link>). The gene expression level was measured by transcript abundance and reported as Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs (FPKM) sequenced. As the first measure of dataset reliability, a Pearson correlation was conducted between all samples. Subsequently, to test data integrity between experimental groups (1-month WT female, n = 4; 1-month WT male, n = 3; 1-month P23H female, n = 4; 1-month P23H male, n = 3; 3-month WT, n = 3; 3-month P23H female, n = 2: 3-month P23H male, n = 2), the FPKM distribution was inspected in violin plots. Next, Venn diagrams were inspected to reveal relationships between the four groups, after which the sexes were pooled and only genotypes (WT females+males vs P23H females+males) were compared in further analyses. The Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analyses, and predicted protein-protein interaction analysis using the STRING database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org/cgi/input.pl">https://string-db.org/cgi/input.pl</ext-link>), were obtained to reveal gene expression changes at the level of networks.

A single retina extract was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (70 µl) containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM magnesium acetate, 6 M urea, 2% SDS, benzonase nuclease (25 U per ml), protease inhibitor (cOmplete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma Aldrich). Homogenates were centrifuged and the supernatants mixed with Laemlli sample buffer (Bio-Rad). Protein concentration in each sample was determined using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA). Forty-eight µg of protein were loaded onto a Mini-Protean TGX gel (Bio-Rad) and electrophoresis was run on an ice-bed. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% fat-free milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hr, and thereafter incubated in primary antibody in 1% milk in TBST. After an overnight incubation, the membrane was washed three times with TBST and thereafter incubated in fluorescent secondary antibody solution (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) at 1:10,000 dilution for 2 hr. The membrane was washed three times with TBST and subsequently imaged using an Odyssey imager (LI-COR). The primary antibodies used were mouse anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (dilution 1:1000), rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (dilution 1:2000) and rabbit α-tubulin (dilution 1:2000) all purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The phospho-ERK1/2 expression was evaluated first using a 680 nm secondary anti-mouse antibody, and the same membrane was re-incubated later in ERK1/2 and α-tubulin solution using an 800 nm secondary anti-rabbit antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Ex vivo electroretinogram</title><p>Transretinal (ex vivo) electroretinography (ERG) was conducted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vinberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vinberg et al., 2015a</xref>). Briefly, mice were dark adapted for at least two hours and euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> and cervical dislocation under dim red light. Eyes were enucleated and immediately placed into carbonated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) Ames’ medium (A1420; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) containing 1.932 g/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The retina was dissected from the eye and transferred to the recording chamber which was perfused at a rate of 1 mL/min with heated (37°C) Ames’ medium containing 100 µM BaCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) to remove the Müller glia contribution to the ERG signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolnick et al., 1979</xref>). To isolate the photoreceptor component of the ERG signal, 40 µM DL-AP4 (Cat. #0101; Tocris Bioscience) was added to the perfusion medium. In some experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the following drugs were added into Ames’ (µM; supplier Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO unless otherwise noted): 100 picrotoxin (PTX) to block GABA receptors, 10 strychnine (STR) to block glycine receptors, 100 meclofenamic acid (MFA) to block electrical coupling via gap junctions, 50 (1,2,5,6-Tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid (TPMPA) to block GABA<sub>C</sub> receptors, and 10 L-741626 and L-745870 (both from Tocris Bioscience) to block D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>4</sub> receptors respectively. Drugs were first dissolved in ethanol (PTX), DMSO (L-741626) or water (STR, L-745870, MFA, TPMPA), and 0.02–0.2% of the stock solutions were added into Ames’ to achieve the final concentration indicated above.

ON bipolar cell responses were determined by subtracting the photoreceptor response (containing DL-AP4) from the ERG response without DL-AP4.

Additional cylindrical neutral density filters (in layers) were placed around the mouse platform to assess contrast sensitivity in scotopic and mesopic-photopic conditions. The ambient luminance (Cd/m<sup>2</sup>) was calibrated using an optometer (UDTi FlexOptometer, photometric sensor model 2151, Gamma Scientific, CA).

Before each experiment mice were dark-adapted overnight, and the testing started at the dimmest light condition. The test was administered in a single-blinded fashion, with the experimenter unaware of the stimulus presented to the mouse. Horizontally drifting vertical sine-wave gratings moving left or right with different contrast were presented at a spatial frequency of 0.128 cycles/degree and a grating rotation speed (drift speed) of 5.4 degrees/s to measure contrast thresholds (CT, 1–100%) at different ambient luminance (<italic>L</italic>) levels from 5*10<sup>−4</sup> to 7 Cd/m<sup>2</sup>.

This work should facilitate future research to refine the molecular mechanism of the retinal adaptation to photoreceptor death and to aid in designing therapeutic strategies to support vision during degeneration. However, we would like to point out that our results did not demonstrate increased synapse formation (on the contrary we saw a modest decrease in synapses, please see above and below) but rather suggests strengthening of remaining, individual synapses. We emphasized this hypothesis in the revised manuscript, and softened down narration about dendritic remodeling in the Abstract and Discussion as it could be easily interpreted to mean structural rather than functional remodeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major revisions suggested with the understanding that with the pandemic this may not be possible at present but the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>1) Changes in bulk RNA-seq profile in the degenerating retina will at least in part reflect changes in the cellular composition (i.e., loss of rods).

We certainly observed a lot of transcriptomics changes primarily due to a mass loss of rods, and considered investigation of the downregulated pathways somewhat pointless in our study. A future single-cell RNA-seq study, perhaps published as an <italic>eLife</italic> research advance, should address this gap. However, bulk sequencing is able to pick up postsynaptic changes with less disturbance caused by rod loss. For instance, genes such as <italic>Grm6</italic> and <italic>Trpm1</italic>, essential for ON bipolar cell depolarization, were upregulated in 1-month-old P23H retinas as measured by FPKMs from RNA-seq, and later confirmed by qPCR (see Figure 3—figure supplements 4, 5). Importantly, this upregulation remained as disease advanced from early (1-mo) to a more intermediate state (3-mo). The current manuscript aimed at testing if functional network adaptation takes place upon progressive photoreceptor degeneration in a robust and easily understandable paradigm accessible to a wide readership. We believe this goal was achieved by using a simple transcriptomics screen.</p><p>However, for the revised manuscript we added IHC experiments to label rod terminals using antibody against the vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1), bipolar cells using antibody for protein kinase (PKC)-α and horizontal cells using antibody for Calbindin (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1). These results show that at one month of age the overall morphology of the bipolar or horizontal cells is not altered in P23H mice based on standard fluorescence light microscopy. The staining pattern of PKCα was indistinguishable at the OPL in 1-month WT and P23H samples, and it seems unlikely that bipolar cells undergo clear-cut “expansion”. Later at 3- and 5-month P23H retinas, the intensity of PKCα decreased and horizontal cells appear to degenerate. As expected due to rod degeneration, VGLUT1 staining decreased with age in the P23H mouse retinas. These results do not suggest formation of new synapses in line with a recent paper from Care et al., 2020, where ablation of rods led to a functional potentiation without corresponding anatomical changes. The PKCα/Calbindin/vGLUT1 staining, however, did not accurately assess details of synaptic densities and counts at the OPL. To attempt this, we co-stained pre- and postsynaptic terminals with antibodies for a ribbon synapse marker CtBP2 and mGluR6, respectively, and performed imaging at high resolution using optical sectioning. These data revealed, as expected, localization of the mGluR6 and CtBP2 puncta adjacent to each other both in WT and P23H mouse retinas (new Figure 2). We quantified the number and size of the mGluR6 puncta in several different sites in control and P23H mouse retinas and found that the count was modestly decreased in P23H samples, which is likely attributable to overall thinning of OPL. The mGluR6 puncta size, and overall density and appearance of synapses were unchanged in P23H samples (see 300x images in Figure 2E, F).</p><p>To summarize, our data do not indicate formation of new synaptic contacts as a mechanism of synaptic adaptation. Rather, we believe that remaining (post)synapses gain strength, as shown by Care et al., 2020, with a photoreceptor ablation model. Our gene expression data point in same direction. These hypotheses are now emphasized in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) BaCl2 is an effective way to remove Muller cell influences on the ERG.

Did the authors examine the ex vivo retina ERG without BaCl2 treatment?</p><p>It would also be important to include the discussion of potential impacts of Muller glia on maintaining visual function in P23H mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Very interesting point as it is well-known that Müller glia cells respond early in many retinal degenerative diseases. The slow PIII component, originating in Müller cells, overlaps significantly with the b-wave and diminishes the observed bipolar cell component of the ex vivo ERG signal in a way that does not necessarily reflect true activity of the bipolar cells. In typical ex vivo ERG experiments, the electrical component from Müller glia is removed completely by the use of 100 μM BaCl<sub>2</sub> (see Figure 2D in Vinberg and Kefalov, 2015) and, thus, our experiments are expected to reflect the adaptation of retinal neurons. It is worth noting, though, that Müller cells were not chronically blocked during our follow-up in P23H mice. In fact, even during the experiments Barium would only have blocked their barium-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> channels but not necessarily other functions which could play a role in supporting bipolar cell function.</p><p>To address reviewers comment about potential contribution of Müller cell component to the ERG b-waves, we conducted additional experiments by comparing ex vivo ERG b-waves in the absence and presence of 100 μM Barium in 1-month <italic>Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>P23H/Gnat2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). As expected, b-wave amplitudes in the absence of Barium were smaller than in the presence of Barium, probably due to a negative overlapping of the slow PIII component both in WT and P23H mice. As we found with Barium, the b wave amplitudes without Barium were also quite similar between 1-month control and P23H mice (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, E). We also isolated the slow PIII by subtraction (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C) and found that it was not affected by P23H mutation in 1-month mice in dim light but appeared somewhat smaller with brighter flashes (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). Consequently, our results do not support a hypothesis that increased Müller cell activity could explain the observed potentiation of the b-waves in P23H mice. One potential confounding factor remains, however, as it is possible that 100 μM Barium failed to block some other unknown positive component generated in part by activity of Müller cells. Potentiation of this component could also in principle explain the observed potentiation of the b-wave amplitudes, but we think this explanation is highly unlikely. However, discovering unknown positive components, and their potential modulation by RP disease, would be an extremely interesting finding, and we briefly discuss this possibility in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
