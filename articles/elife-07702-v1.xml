could influence species’ regenerative capacity. To directly test that premise, we humanized the zebrafish p53 pathway by introducing regulatory and coding sequences of the human tumor suppressor <italic>ARF</italic> into the zebrafish genome. <italic>ARF</italic> was dormant during development, in uninjured adult fins, and during wound healing, but was highly expressed in the blastema during epimorphic fin regeneration after amputation. Regenerative, but not developmental signals resulted in binding of zebrafish E2f to the human <italic>ARF</italic> promoter and activated conserved ARF-dependent Tp53 functions. The context-dependent activation of ARF did not affect growth and development but inhibited regeneration, an unexpected distinct tumor suppressor response to regenerative versus developmental environments. The antagonistic pleiotropic characteristics of <italic>ARF</italic> as both tumor and regeneration suppressor imply that inducing epimorphic regeneration clinically would require modulation of ARF –p53 axis activation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07702.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07702.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07702.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Zebrafish are capable of remarkable feats of regeneration in which damaged or lost body parts can be replaced with exact replicas of the original. Humans cannot do this; so one major goal of regenerative medicine is to understand the basis of these differences. This could make it possible to regenerate damaged limbs, heart muscle and other tissues in people.</p><p>A group of genes called tumor suppressor genes are critical for protecting us from cancer. However, they also limit the ability of cells to grow and divide, which are both important for regeneration processes. Differences in how organisms use tumor suppressor genes could possibly contribute to their differing abilities to regenerate body parts.</p><p>A tumor suppressor gene called <italic>ARF</italic> plays an important role in protecting mammals from cancer, but it is not found in zebrafish and other animals that can regenerate body parts. Hesse et al. introduced the human <italic>ARF</italic> gene into zebrafish to investigate whether it has any effect on tissue regeneration. The experiments show that <italic>ARF</italic> is silent in growing and uninjured fish, but it is activated when it detects regeneration occurring after an injury. <italic>ARF</italic> drastically inhibits this process to the point that fish with the <italic>ARF</italic> gene cannot regenerate damaged tissue. The findings suggest that <italic>ARF</italic> mistakenly identifies regeneration as the formation of a tumor; therefore therapies that aim to induce regeneration in people may need to control the activity of this gene.</p><p>Hesse et al.’s findings show that the specific tumor suppressor genes an organism has can affect its ability to regenerate. Future challenges will be to understand the situations in which <italic>ARF</italic> is able to interfere with tissue regeneration in mammals, and to learn how to manipulate this process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07702.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07702.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>tumor suppressors</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>ARF</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sandler Foundation </institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Opportunity Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pomerantz</surname><given-names>Jason H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship, 2011118799</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hesse</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-R01-HD059862 and 1R01DK090382</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahituv</surname><given-names>Nadav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evolution of tumor suppressor genes can involve a trade-off because the acquisition of certain anti-cancer characteristics diminishes the ability to regenerate damaged tissue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Urodele amphibians and teleost fish are unique among vertebrates in that they possess the ability to regenerate injured complex structures such as limbs, fins, jaws, and heart by epimorphic regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Morgan, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Brockes and Kumar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Poss, 2010</xref>). For example, zebrafish fin regeneration proceeds through steps that include wound healing, blastema formation, and regenerative outgrowth to faithfully restore preinjury structures and size of the fin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Poss et al., 2003</xref>). In such highly regenerative species, the blastema consists of a heterogeneous pool of highly proliferative mesenchymal cells that gives rise to the large amount of new tissue in the regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Knopf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tu and Johnson, 2011</xref>). In contrast, absence of a proliferative blastema is a prominent feature of most mammalian solid tissue injury responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Muneoka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Straube and Tanaka, 2006</xref>). An open question in biology is how cellular mechanisms controlling proliferation affect the blastema and whether they have evolved to contribute to divergent regenerative capacities among vertebrate species.</p><p>Tumor suppressor genes control the proliferative and differentiated state of cells, and many are also developmental regulators critical for normal formation of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jacks et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Berman et al., 2008</xref>). The complex and precisely controlled proliferation and differentiation that occurs during epimorphic regeneration likely requires similar machinery, and as a group, tumor suppressors are probably necessary for well-orchestrated regeneration to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pomerantz and Blau, 2013</xref>). For example, in eukaryotes the retinoblastoma gene <italic>Rb1</italic> regulates the G1/S transition by sequestering E2f transcription factors, and it controls cellular differentiation by associating with chromatin modifiers to regulate activity of tissue-specific transcription factors. Therefore, the role of <italic>Rb1 </italic>in tumor suppression is likely less important from an evolutionary standpoint than its ancient broad functions in regulating cellular differentiation and tissue formation. In contrast, the mammalian gene <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> is an essential tumor suppressor in mice and humans, but it is dispensable for mammalian development and tissue formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Serrano et al., 1996</xref>). In mammals, <italic>Cdkn2a </italic>encodes two structurally unrelated proteins translated via alternate reading frames, p16Ink4a and Arf, each of which is a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Chin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sherr, 2006</xref>). While p16Ink4a is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) that functions upstream of Rb1, Arf exerts its tumor suppressor function by responding to inappropriate Rb pathway signaling above a presumed threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lowe and Sherr, 2003</xref>). When induced, it stabilizes and activates Tp53 by binding and sequestering Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and negative regulator of Tp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pomerantz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Weber et al., 1999</xref>). Depending on the context, stabilized Tp53 either promotes cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. In addition to canonical Tp53-dependent functions, Arf has other important functions including controlling ribosome biogenesis and responding to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sherr, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Weber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Damalas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Menendez et al., 2003</xref>). The resulting general function of Arf is to maintain the postmitotic state, and we have previously shown that suppression of Arf in the context of compromise of the Rb pathway results in dedifferentiation and proliferation of mammalian muscle cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pajcini et al., 2010</xref>). Unlike in development or in regeneration of epithelial and hematopoietic tissues, reversal of the postmitotic state and dedifferentiation also occur in lower vertebrate epimorphic regeneration scenarios that involve a blastema. Regulation of Tp53 has recently been shown to be important during epimorphic regeneration, where it is downregulated during blastema formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yun et al., 2013</xref>). Although cell cycle reentry of postmitotic cells and dedifferentiation are characteristics of malignant transformation which tumor suppressor mechanisms oppose, why these two processes are permitted to occur in the context of intact tumor suppressor mechanisms during epimorphic regeneration is unknown.</p><p>How evolution of the central cellular growth and tumor suppressor pathways impacts regenerative capacity is poorly understood. The advent of somatic stem cells in metazoans is thought to have enabled the formation of new types of cancer, thus requiring advanced tumor suppressor mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Belyi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pearson and Sanchez Alvarado, 2008</xref>). Among metazoan species, including vertebrates, selective pressures such as different physiologies and environmental exposures undoubtedly continue to apply pressure to generate species-specific tumor suppressor repertoires. For some tumor suppressor genes such as <italic>Tp53</italic>, multiple family members have evolved to carry out certain differentiation functions separately from tumor suppression. For others, such as <italic>Arf</italic>, a single member has evolved and exists in a limited number of species. Whether such differences in turn relate to distinct regenerative capacities remains unknown.</p><p>Although tumor suppressors are generally highly conserved in eukaryotes, <italic>Arf </italic>is unusual in that it is poorly conserved in non-mammalian lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The <italic>Cdkn2a/b</italic> locus of teleost fish, including zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) and fugu (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gilley and Fried, 2001</xref>), exists as a single protein-producing unit that only encodes for a CKI. During evolution, <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> and <italic>Cdkn2b</italic> developed into two separate but related genes encoding for biochemically related CKIs. Arf is not a CKI and is not closely related to either Cdkn2a or Cdkn2b. Arf is thought to be the product of a genetic duplication caused by either an insertion or transposition into the <italic>Cdkn2a/b</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gil and Peters, 2006</xref>). Of the highly regenerative species for which genomes have been completely sequenced, none possess an ortholog of <italic>Arf </italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Flicek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karolchik et al., 2014</xref>). The earliest documented ortholog of <italic>Arf</italic> exists in the chicken genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kim et al., 2003</xref>). This restricted representation coupled with <italic>ARF</italic> functions of responding to a high threshold of proliferative signaling and inhibiting dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pajcini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sherr, 2006</xref>) is compatible with a hypothesis that the presence of <italic>Arf </italic>could impact regenerative capacity.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07702.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title> <italic>ARF</italic>, not normally present in highly regenerative vertebrates, is specifically activated in blastemas of <italic>ARF</italic> transgenic zebrafish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of amino acid sequences of proteins produced by the Cdkn2a/b loci of zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), amphibians including the axolotl (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>) and western clawed frog (<italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic>), chickens (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>), and mammals including the mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) and human (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>).

The results of this analysis, while not directly demonstrating an association of ARF with regeneration, support the hypothesis and prompted our investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Context-specific activation of<italic> ARF</italic> by regenerative signals in the zebrafish blastema</title><p>To investigate how the <italic>ARF </italic>gene responds to environmental cues, we generated reporter fish in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) is expressed under the control of the human <italic>ARF </italic>promoter (Tg (<italic>ARF</italic>:GFP) or <italic>ARF</italic>:GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top).

The ARF promoter has previously been empirically defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">del Arroyo et al., 2007</xref>) and no other regulatory sequences or enhancers have been described to date. We first confirmed that the human <italic>ARF</italic> promoter can function in zebrafish cells <italic/><italic>in vitro</italic> in transfection experiments using previously described firefly luciferase reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">del Arroyo et al., 2007</xref>). Experiments were performed with ZF4 and zebrafish kidney stromal (ZKS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Stachura et al., 2009</xref>) cells with HeLa cells used as a positive control since they express high levels of endogenous ARF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These assays confirmed that the 736 base pair (bp) promoter is active in HeLa cells and in zebrafish lines. Therefore, we chose the 736 bp genomic fragment encompassing the human <italic>ARF</italic> promoter to generate <italic>ARF </italic>transgenics that mimic regulation of the human <italic>ARF</italic> gene. Tol2-mediated transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kwan et al., 2007</xref>) was used to generate <italic>ARF</italic>:GFP fish, and transgenic fish were detected using cardiac GFP expression driven by a separate <italic>cmlc2</italic>:GFP cassette on the transgene.</p><p>We monitored expression of GFP driven by the human <italic>ARF</italic> promoter during normal development and in adult fish after injury and during regeneration. To determine if<italic> ARF</italic>:GFP is active during organogenesis in the zebrafish embryo, we assayed GFP expression at three developmental time points, 24, 48, and 72 hr postfertilization (hpf). We were unable to detect <italic>ARF</italic>:GFP expression in the embryo head, body, or tail by wide field epi or confocal immunofluorescence indicating that the <italic>ARF </italic>promoter is silent at these developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

To confirm that our analysis was not significantly compromised by limits of detection, we also performed <italic/><italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for GFP transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The <italic/><italic>in situ</italic> hybridization results confirmed the immunofluorescence analysis and indicate that <italic>ARF </italic>is silent or minimally expressed during development, including the developing tail fin region.</p><p>To investigate <italic>ARF</italic> activation during regeneration, <italic>ARF</italic>:GFP regenerates were assessed at the time of amputation and then at time points during which wound healing, blastema formation, and outgrowth of regenerating fins occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Poss et al., 2003</xref>). <italic>ARF</italic>:GFP transgenic fish regenerated their fins normally. In stark contrast to development, <italic>ARF</italic>:GFP was induced and highly expressed in the blastema of regenerating adult fins. GFP was specifically detected in <italic>ARF</italic>:GFP fins after amputation, and GFP colocalized with Msxb and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). GFP was not detected in the surrounding epithelium. This observation indicates that the <italic>ARF</italic> promoter is active in at least a subset of Msxb + blastema cells. GFP signal in the regenerate was first detected at 12 hr postamputation (hpa), peaked at 48 hpa, and then declined to undetectable levels within 6 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). To correlate GFP expression with proliferation in <italic>ARF</italic>:GFP fins, we assessed EdU incorporation in regenerates at the above time points. There is a low level of proliferation in uninjured fins (0 hpa), but proliferation quickly increases to maximal levels within 48 hpa and then decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). GFP expression mirrored proliferative changes, suggesting that <italic>ARF</italic> detects and responds to high proliferative signaling in the regenerate.</p><p>To further examine the specificity of <italic>ARF</italic> regulation, we examined the response to the creation of an epithelial laceration wound. In this interray wound model, healing occurs without regeneration or blastema formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gauron et al., 2013</xref>). An epithelial wound was created in the dorsal fin lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and the ventral fin lobe of the same fish was amputated. GFP expression was evaluated 1 day postinjury (dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). As expected, GFP was detected in the forming ventral blastema. However, GFP was undetectable in the healing wound. These distinct <italic>ARF </italic>responses to development and to the two different forms of injury indicate that <italic>ARF</italic> specifically senses and responds to signals particular to the regeneration environment that differ significantly from those present during wound healing or in the highly proliferative environment of developmental organogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Zebrafish E2f1 binds the human ARF promoter specifically in the context of Rb hyperphosphorylation during regeneration</title><p>In mammalian cells, <italic>ARF</italic> detects and responds to aberrant inhibition of the Rb pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sharpless, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sherr, 2006</xref>). To investigate the specific factors that activate <italic>ARF</italic> during zebrafish fin regeneration, but not during development, we assessed Rb pathway inhibition by Western blot analysis of E2f1, Rb1, and hyperphosophorylated-Rb1 (p-Rb1) in developing embryos (72 hpf), in adult uninjured fin tissue (uninj.) and at 2 days postamputation (dpa). Whereas p-Rb1 levels were relatively low in uninjured adult fins, a modest increase was detected in 72 hpf embryos. However, 2 dpa regenerates contained a dramatic increase in p-Rb1 levels despite stable levels of total Rb1 and total E2f1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This reflects a high level of pro-proliferation signaling resulting in inactivation of Rb1 by phosphorylation, as occurs commonly in tumors. To further investigate where in the regenerating fin the changes in p-Rb1 phosphorylation occurred, immunostaining of regenerating and uninjured fins was performed. Similar to Western blot analysis, immunostaining revealed a dramatic increase in p-Rb1 staining during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A small amount of p-Rb1 staining was observed in uninjured fins, which is most likely the result of homeostatic proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wills et al., 2008</xref>).

We found that the core mammalian tumor suppressor <italic>ARF</italic> senses regeneration signals and specifically responds to negatively alter the proliferative balance in the zebrafish blastema, greatly perturbing regeneration. Our findings provide the first <italic/><italic>in vivo</italic> experimental evidence that evolution of tumor suppressors can negatively impact solid tissue regeneration potential.</p><p>Although the core tumor suppressors as a whole support regenerative processes, the properties of <italic>ARF</italic> identified in this study are at odds with epimorphic regeneration. This new example of antagonistic pleiotropy adds to previously recognized trade-off characteristics of tumor suppressor genes affecting mammalian stem cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Pardal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Greaves, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pomerantz and Blau, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rodier et al., 2007</xref>) and shows that <italic>ARF</italic> antagonistic properties also manifest in the context of the blastema. The evidence that ARF is a critical tumor suppressor in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sherr, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sharpless, 2005</xref>), but opposes regeneration functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sharpless and DePinho, 2007</xref>), suggests that the selective pressure that has driven the evolution of <italic>ARF</italic> has primarily enhanced tumor suppression either at the expense of or in the absence of regeneration pressures. Although our experiments and those of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Gemberling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Poss et al., 2003</xref>) show that the regenerative capacity of zebrafish is vulnerable to single gene alterations, whether altering function of a single gene in mammals would induce the emergence of robust epimorphic regenerative capacity is a much more complex issue. Indeed, the multifactorial genetic differences of highly and less regenerative vertebrates make it unlikely that manipulation of a single gene could enable regeneration. It is notable, however, that <italic>Cdkn1a (p21</italic>) knockout mice do possess a somewhat enhanced ability to regenerate solid structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Heber-Katz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Clark et al., 1998</xref>) such as pinnae, which lack the complex tissue structure of a digit, but nonetheless, demonstrate that alteration of cellular growth control mechanisms can impact regeneration. Moreover, the importance of active repression of <italic>ARF</italic> to maintain stem cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Molofsky et al., 2005</xref>), and of <italic>ARF</italic> reduction to facilitate dedifferentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pajcini et al., 2010</xref>) have been documented.</p><p>Among the core tumor suppressor genes that are frequently inactivated in mammalian tumors, <italic>ARF </italic>is unique in that it does not have orthologs represented in most vertebrates including highly regenerative species. By contrast, <italic>Tp53, Pten, </italic>and<italic> Ink4a </italic>have distant orthologs, present in invertebrates and vertebrates alike. The transgenesis approach we used to study ARF in fin regeneration made it possible for us to study ARF with its human regulatory components but without increasing <italic>CDKN2A</italic> CKI gene dosage, which could have been a complicating factor in a transgenic harboring the entire <italic>CDKN2A (INK4A/ARF)</italic> locus. This study extends our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pajcini et al., 2010</xref>) that ARF prevents dedifferentiation in muscle cells in culture and provides new evidence that ARF functions <italic/><italic>in vivo</italic> to oppose tissue regeneration. Future experiments will determine whether ARF prevents dedifferentiation <italic/><italic>in vivo</italic>, such as the dedifferentiation of osteoblasts in regenerating fins, or whether it acts on proliferating blastema cells after they have dedifferentiated. Combined, our findings suggest that zebrafish cells are more promiscuous in terms of tolerance to high levels of mitogenic activity, thus permitting the cellular processes required for epimorphic regeneration. It follows that regenerating cells in organisms that have an <italic>ARF</italic> gene would need to prevent ARF activation or would be inherently more restricted in these activities.</p><p>We found that ARF recapitulates its core mammalian mechanistic functions in zebrafish cells and tissues. As in mammals, when ARF is overexpressed in zebrafish cells, it associates with Mdm2, stabilizes Tp53, and induces cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. This functional conservation over an evolutionary distance demonstrates that cross-species genetic variations can be experimentally examined in the study of regeneration. When ARF expression is driven by its endogenous human promoter in zebrafish cells, activation of the p53 axis occurs specifically in the blastema-regeneration scenario. Remarkably, the inhibitory effect on regeneration by <italic>ARF</italic>:ARF was stronger than with the heat shock promoter, probably reflecting ongoing surveillance of regenerative signals by the <italic>ARF</italic> promoter in contrast to fluctuating ARF levels obtained with intermittent heat shock induction of a short half-life protein. In the developing or adult uninjured state, E2f1 is sequestered and inhibited by Rb1, and <italic>ARF</italic> is inactive. However, during blastema formation and regeneration, Rb1 hyperphosphorylation is associated with sufficient free E2f1 to activate <italic>ARF</italic>, which inhibits fin regeneration via a Tp53-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our findings and model are in agreement with the recent proposal that in salamanders the absence of ARF permits downregulation of Tp53 during blastema formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yun et al., 2013</xref>). The responsiveness of <italic>ARF</italic> to the Rb pathway proliferative signaling characteristic of zebrafish fin regeneration implies that similar mitogenic signaling occurring in a mammalian context would be detected as aberrant, activate ARF–MDM2–TP53 tumor suppressor mechanisms, and oppose regeneration. Our findings are compatible with previous mouse studies showing that ARF is a potent tumor suppressor that is dispensable for normal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Serrano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kamijo et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, prior observations that <italic>ARF</italic> is not developmentally expressed in the majority of tissues in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gromley et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Zindy et al., 2003</xref>) support the fidelity of the promoter used in this study. Although the majority of tumor suppressors probably function in regeneration as they do in normal development, the findings of the present study indicate that <italic>ARF</italic> represents an unusual departure from that paradigm in that the properties that cause it to respond specifically to tumorigenesis also cause it to distinguish regeneration contexts from developmental ones.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07702.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title> Model of <italic>ARF</italic> function in the context of Rb pathway activity during zebrafish development and fin regeneration.</title><p><italic>ARF</italic> is not active during development during which a moderate level of mitogenic signaling causes modest phosphorylation of Rb1 (top); however, during regeneration, high mitogenic signaling induces Rb1 hyperphosphorylation and abundant free E2f1, which activates <italic>ARF</italic> and leads to inhibition of regeneration (bottom).

Such an approach should prove useful for examining other candidate genes and pathways of interest. Our findings with respect to ARF strongly suggest that it is a barrier to mammalian epimorphic regeneration because it interprets the regeneration context as similar to tumorigenesis. It follows conceptually that approaches to induce epimorphic regeneration clinically would need to disrupt ARF–MDM2–TP53 axis activation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish</title><p>Zebrafish maintenance at 28–30°C and all experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Francisco.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marianne Bronner (Reviewing Editor) and Gage Crump (peer reviewer).</p><p>In this manuscript, Hesse and colleagues tested human ARF promoter activity and protein function during fin regeneration. They showed that a 735 bp ARF promoter fragment drives transgene expression during fin regeneration, but not noticeably during development. Their analysis suggests that E2F1, which might be de-repressed by hyperphosphorylated-Rb1, binds ARF promoter. Next, they examined ARF protein function during fin regeneration, using a heat-shock-inducible ARF overexpression transgenic line. ARF introduction slowed fin regeneration, an effect that is partially suppressed by p53 loss-of-function mutation or inhibition of p53 activity. Furthermore, they find that ectopic expression of ARF driven by the human ARF promoter fragment inhibits fin regeneration. Overall, they provide evidence that a tumor suppressor gene ARF that is not present in zebrafish can impact regeneration, and that the Rb-E2F-ARF-p53 axis is functionally conserved among vertebrate species.</p><p>The result that the human ARF promoter is selectively activated during tail fin regeneration, but not during development or in wounding is interesting, and will likely be a useful tool for the regeneration community. The paper is well written and the experiments provide further evidence for a hypothesis that tumor suppression counteracts regeneration in mammals. However, some of their data are not as compelling as they should be. Additional basic characterizations, a better description of methods, and improved images are needed to support their interesting hypothesis. Specific criticisms are summarized below:</p><p>1) The finding that misexpression of ARF blocks tail fin regeneration by interacting with the same set of players used in tumor suppression (E2f1, Rb, p53) is a nice result (especially showing that driving ARF from the blastema-induced ARF promoter blocks regeneration). However, one wonders whether driving high-level expression of a tumor suppressor in general would have this same effect, since the usual function of these proteins is to block cell proliferation and induce cell death (as shown here for the regenerating fin). Given that loss of ARF was previously shown to enhance dedifferentiation in mice, and that reduction of p53 (a target of ARF) is required for limb regeneration in axolotls, the ARF gain-of-function results here are not that surprising.</p><p>2) In general, the experiments are well performed and accurately interpreted (with adequate numbers and statistics).

I thought the authors dealt well with the issue of loss of Arf most likely not being sufficient to significantly increase regenerative potential in mammals, though this needs to be formally tested in the future. What could be discussed and/or examined is whether ARF is expressed during mouse development.

However, one wonders whether driving high-level expression of a tumor suppressor in general would have this same effect, since the usual function of these proteins is to block cell proliferation and induce cell death (as shown here for the regenerating fin). Given that loss of ARF was previously shown to enhance dedifferentiation in mice, and that reduction of p53 (a target of ARF) is required for limb regeneration in axolotls, the ARF gain-of-function results here are not that surprising. </italic></p><p>We agree that the most surprising finding of this work relates to the selective activity of the ARF promoter during regeneration and not during development or wound healing, rather than to the growth inhibitory effects of the ARF protein per se. Since ARF does not normally exist in fish, it was unclear whether the Rb/p53 pathway is mechanistically conserved to the degree required to recapitulate ARF functions when introduced into that species. Therefore, in contrast to most other tumor suppressors, which have conserved orthologues in fish and other vertebrates, the possibility of studying the impact of ARF on regenerative capacity over evolutionary distances was unclear and turned out to be feasible. We agree that driving other tumor suppressors using strong inducible or constitutive promoters during regeneration would in general be expected to inhibit the proliferation dependent aspects of the process. However, some tumor suppressors such as Rb or Hippo, which are essential for tissue formation and differentiation are probably required for effective regeneration, and modulation could conceivably enhance regeneration, a line of experimentation which merits investigation in our opinion. We address these comments in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic> 2) In general, the experiments are well performed and accurately interpreted (with adequate numbers and statistics).

The finding of this study, that ARF is not significantly expressed during development in transgenic fish, is in good agreement with previous data in mice that that ARF is not developmentally expressed in the vast majority of mouse tissues. In the revised manuscript, we have added this to the Discussion section, citing prior work done by the Sherr laboratory using ARF reporter mice. Our similar findings in zebrafish support the fidelity of the ARF promoter used in our study.

In the revised manuscript we have replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> with the standard wide-field microscope images and moved the confocal images to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>. Confocal images for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> were used because the confocal images have lower background in this assay which required longer exposures to demonstrate that GFP is not expressed throughout the embryo. The wide-field microscope images show the same staining pattern as the confocal images. The GFP fluorescence in the heart is readily visible at developmental time points 48 and 72 hpf. At 24 hpf, developmental expression of <italic>cmlc2</italic> is much lower, making the marker difficult to see at that stage. In addition to GFP immunofluorescence, we separately assayed GFP expression by in situ hybridization to attain sufficient sensitivity to support the conclusion that ARF expression is minimal if present at all during development. The images included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> have been improved to remove uneven background and increase contrast. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the requested figure modifications including annotations and amputation planes are now provided, and higher magnification images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref>. The insets included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref> display the overlap of GFP, Msxb, and PCNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> has been revised, and the data are now depicted with the standard line chart parameters. With respect to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, in</xref> light of the reviewers’ comments, we have clarified that there is no background level for the wild-type fish because GFP intensity of <italic>ARF:</italic>GFP fish was recorded relative to that of WT. The red bar has been removed because it was confusing, and we describe the measurement procedure in the legend. Additionally, we have included whole mount images of endogenous GFP expression over the whole time course from 0 hpa to 144 hpa in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2C</xref>.</p><p><italic> 4) With regard the subsection “Zebrafish E2f1 binds the human ARF promoter specifically in the context of Rb hyperphosphorylation during regeneration” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, Rb1 and E2f1 expression patterns have not been reported during fin regeneration in zebrafish.

How many replicates, and how do we assess significance?</italic></p><p>Since regulation of Rb1 and E2f1 is primarily by phosphorylation of Rb1 (hyperphosphorylated Rb1 (p-Rb1) is only expressed in cells entering S-phase) which in turn controls E2f1 activity, we addressed this comment by performing immunostaining of uninjured and 2 dpa <italic>ARF:</italic>GFP fins to visualize p-Rb1, Msxb, and GFP protein expression. The results show that very little p-Rb1 is present in the uninjured fin, in contrast to high levels of p-Rb1 in Msxb + / GFP + cells in the blastema at 2 dpa. This staining pattern is exclusive in the blastema and not the surrounding epithelium. We have included these images in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and the data is discussed in the revised text in subsection “Zebrafish E2f1 binds the human ARF promoter specifically in the context of Rb hyperphosphorylation during regeneration,” confirming that the alterations of Rb1 protein phosphorylation shown by Western occur in the blastema.

As expected ARF expression is detected in regenerating tissue of <italic>hs</italic>:ARF fin but not WT fins. Although the heat shock every 6 hours is intense from the heat shock standpoint, the short half-life of the ARF protein results in fluctuating ARF expression, rather than sustained high levels. Nonetheless, the inhibitory effects on regeneration were consistent and readily detectable. The pulsatile expression, in contrast to that of the ARF-ARF line most likely accounts for the less severe inhibition of regeneration in the hs-ARF fish compared to ARF-ARF fish.</p><p><italic> 7) The authors report (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>) that p53 inhibition or loss-of-function of p53 can suppress impaired regeneration caused by ARF overexpression.

We show this using immunostaining and qRT-PCR rather than Western blot given the very low overall level of p53 compared to total protein (wild-type cells with ARF-induced p53 either exit the cell cycle or undergo apoptosis). We confirmed p53 protein stabilization by immunostaining 4 dpa WT and <italic>hs</italic>:ARF fins for p53 and ARF.
