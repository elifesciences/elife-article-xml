ClC-7, a Cl<sup>-</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter responsible for lysosomal Cl<sup>-</sup> permeability, is a candidate to contribute to the acidification process as part of this ‘counterion pathway’ The signaling lipid PI(3,5)P2 modulates lysosomal dynamics, including by regulating lysosomal ion channels, raising the possibility that it could contribute to lysosomal pH regulation. Here, we demonstrate that depleting PI(3,5)P2 by inhibiting the kinase PIKfyve causes lysosomal hyperacidification, primarily via an effect on ClC-7. We further show that PI(3,5)P2 directly inhibits ClC-7 transport and that this inhibition is eliminated in a disease-causing gain-of-function ClC-7 mutation. Together, these observations suggest an intimate role for ClC-7 in lysosomal pH regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>ClC-7</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositide</kwd><kwd>chloride</kwd><kwd>pH</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leray</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name><name><surname>Hilton</surname><given-names>Jacob K</given-names></name><name><surname>Nwangwu</surname><given-names>Kamsi</given-names></name><name><surname>Becerril</surname><given-names>Alissa</given-names></name><name><surname>Mikusevic</surname><given-names>Vedrana</given-names></name><name><surname>Fitzgerald</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name><name><surname>Amin</surname><given-names>Anowarul</given-names></name><name><surname>Weston</surname><given-names>Mary R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mindell</surname><given-names>Joseph A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibiyiton of the lysosomal chloride-proton antiporter ClC-7 by the signaling lipid PI(3,5)P2 is important for lysosomal pH maintenance and is disrupted by a disease-causing gain-of-function mutation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lysosomes are acidic organelles that participate in cellular defense and homeostasis by clearing and recycling intra- and extracellular components and informing the cell of its stress and metabolic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saftig and Klumperman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Settembre et al., 2013</xref>). Their acidity provides an optimal environment for luminal enzyme activity and is a source of electrochemical energy for lysosomal transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sagné and Gasnier, 2008</xref>). Two main systems act in tandem to maintain a set point value ranging between 4.5 and 5.0 pH units: a V-ATPase that pumps and concentrates protons inside the lysosomal lumen using ATP hydrolysis, and a counterion pathway that dissipates the membrane electrical potential generated by V-ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mindell, 2012</xref>). We currently do not know if the counterion pathway is a single system or a set of channels and transporters with different ion selectivities. One candidate is the lysosomal transporter ClC-7 of the CLC family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kornak et al., 2001</xref>): it is expressed widely, located predominantly on late-endosome/lysosomal membranes, exports 1H<sup>+</sup> to import 2Cl<sup>-</sup> per transport cycle, and is the major lysosomal chloride conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lange et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leisle et al., 2011</xref>). Although ClC-7’s role as a counterion pathway is still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jentsch and Pusch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kornak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mindell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steinberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weinert et al., 2014</xref>), new work on patients with a novel ClC-7 disease-causing mutation strongly supports this hypothesis, with a gain of function of the transporter resulting in lysosomal hyperacidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicoli et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Recent work established a connection between ClC-7 and the phospholipid kinase PIKfyve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gayle et al., 2017</xref>). PIKfyve synthesizes phosphatidylinositol-3,5-biphosphate (PI(3,5)P2) from PI3P at the lysosomal membrane and participates in the maturation and trafficking of endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasegawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jin et al., 2016</xref>). While it is well established that pharmacological inhibition or gene disruption of PIKfyve depletes PI(3,5)P2, alters endolysosomal trafficking, and leads to generation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bissig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ikonomov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamamoto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>), relatively few studies have examined the effects of PIKfyve inhibition on lysosomal pH. In these studies, PIKfyve inhibition had no effect in some cell types but did affect the pH in others, depending on the inhibitor used and the measurement method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). In this context, it was surprising that <italic>ClCN7</italic> and <italic>OSTM1</italic> (ClC-7’s β-subunit) were among only four hits in a global CRISPR screen targeting 19,050 protein-coding genes to confer apilimod resistance, and the only two genes that, upon CRISPR knockdown, reduced PIKfyve-inhibitor-induced vacuole formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gayle et al., 2017</xref>). Given the potential role of ClC-7 in lysosomal acidification, these results suggest that PIKfyve might regulate lysosomal pH by modulating ClC-7 activity, and might thereby tune lysosomal traffic. Consistent with this hypothesis, PI(3,5)P2 inhibits ClC-a, a CLC anion/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger that contributes to the vacuolar acidification of plant cells, equivalent to lysosomes in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carpaneto et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, using ratiometric measurements of lysosomal pH in cells treated with the PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod, we first explored the effects of PIKfyve inhibition on lysosomal pH and size. We then assessed the relationship between lysosomal pH and vacuole formation. Finally, we evaluated the role of ClC-7 in this process using both pH measurements of lysosomes from ClC-7 knockout cells and patch-clamp electrophysiology of ClC-7 trafficked to the plasma membrane. Moreover, we link these effects to a recently identified rare disease mutation, Y715C, that causes enlarged vacuoles and lysosomal hyperacidification, similar to the effects of apilimod, providing insight into the mechanism of PI(3,5)P2 action on ClC-7. Altogether, our data reveal that PI(3,5)P2 inhibition of ClC-7 provides a brake for the lysosomal acidification mechanism, preventing overacidification by the V-type ATPase. Our results further indicate that vacuole formation is not tightly coupled to lysosomal pH and that vacuoles can form even when normal lysosomal pH is perturbed. Finally, we demonstrate that the mechanisms of PI(3,5)P2 inhibition of ClC-7 and of the recently described disease-causing mutation Y715C are tightly intertwined.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lysosomes swollen by PIKfyve inhibition are hyperacidic</title><p>We initially sought to determine the effect of PIKfyve inhibition on lysosomal pH using the osteosarcoma cell line U2OS; U2OS lysosomes are easily loaded with pH-sensing dyes and are distributed in the cells sparsely enough to image quantitatively and robustly. As our pH probe, we used Oregon Green 488-dextran (OG), a ratiometric pH-sensitive dye with a pKa of 4.8, well suited for the lysosomal pH range and which is delivered effectively to lysosomes via fluid-phase endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DiCiccio and Steinberg, 2011</xref>).</p><p>We loaded endolysosomes and lysosomes, hereafter referred to as lysosomes, with OG using standard methods with an overnight pulse of OG488-dextran followed by a 4 hr chase in dye-free media to allow the dye to accumulate in lysosomes. Most OG+positive vesicles are lysosome-related compartments, as shown by staining with both cathepsin B and LysoTracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). After delivering OG fully to lysosomes, we treated cells for 3 hr with 100 nM of the PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod or its vehicle (0.25% DMSO), enough to induce visible cytoplasmic vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The OG-containing vacuoles seen in these cells are enlarged lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bissig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). We measured lysosomal pH using excitation-ratio imaging, including full pH calibration curves in every experiment. Though apilimod causes dramatic changes in lysosome size, overlap between pH calibration curves in control and apilimod-treated conditions shows that vacuole properties do not interfere with pH measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A representative experiment reveals a substantial shift in lysosomal pH in cells treated with apilimod compared with control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), further supported by averaged results from multiple independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In control conditions, the lysosomal pH is 4.32 ± 0.04 (mean ± SEM). We find that, in addition to its well-known effects on size, apilimod treatment induces robust lysosomal hyperacidification, reaching an average pH of 4.02 ± 0.05. This decrease of 0.31 pH unit corresponds to a doubling of the free proton concentration of the lysosomal lumen compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The global shift of the cumulative distribution of individual lysosomal pHs reveals that apilimod-induced lysosomal hyperacidification is homogeneous and not restricted to a subset of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similar measurements in neonatal fibroblasts and SUDHL B-cell lymphoma cells confirmed that their lysosomes also hyperacidify when treated with apilimod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these results establish that acute pharmacological inhibition of PIKfyve indeed affects lysosomal pH, surprisingly causing hyperacidification. Well-documented hyperacidification is rare in lysosomal manipulation or disease, though we recently reported a disease-causing ClC-7 gain-of-function mutation with this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicoli et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lysosomes swollen by PIKfyve inhibition are hyperacidic.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Protocol timeline.

In contrast, with the signaling lipid in the pipette we observe substantial inhibition that develops over the first several minutes after break-in and reaches steady state by approximately 3 min, our chosen time point for measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Current families recorded in the absence (30 s after break-in) and presence (3 min after break-in) of PI(3,5)P2 reflect the effect of the signaling lipid on the transporter current. Recordings made without PI(3,5)P2 in the pipette showed little change between the two time points; activation and deactivation kinetics and current magnitudes remained mostly constant, again demonstrating that the ClC-7 currents are stable over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, including 50 µM PI(3,5)P2 in the pipette resulted in an ~39% decrease in maximum voltage-activated currents and a 66% decrease in the amplitude of tail currents following repolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and E</xref>). The deactivation rate was also significantly faster in the presence of PI(3,5)P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The effects of PI(3,5)P2 on maximal current and tail current amplitude were dose-dependent with increasing inhibition by PI(3,5)P2 over concentrations between 25 and 100 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). PI(3,5)P2 inhibition of ClC-7 appears to be specific: neither PI3P nor PI(4,5)P2 yielded detectable inhibition of the ClC-7 currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Because the lipid bound to ClC-7 in the structure was modeled as a PI3P (due to steric clashes between the 5-phosphate and adjacent residues when PI(3,5)P2 was modeled), its lack of effect on ClC-7 currents was surprising. Since the lipid in the cryo-EM structure was not added during the purification, it must have been carried through the preparation bound to ClC-7 and should be tightly bound, but the lack of effect in our experiments suggests, at best, a low affinity. To further test for an interaction with PI3P, we therefore attempted competition experiments with equimolar mixes of PI(3,5)2 and PI3P; the presence of PI3P in these experiments did not detectably affect the inhibition by PI(3,5)P2, suggesting a specific effect of the doubly phosphorylated lipid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). We conclude that PI(3,5)P2 specifically inhibits ClC-7 transport currents.</p><p>The concentrations of PI(3,5)P2 required for effective inhibition in our experiments are relatively high, with an EC50 of approximately 30 µM. We sought to distinguish the possibility of low-affinity interaction with ClC-7 from the alternative explanation that the concentration of lipid in the patch pipette does not deliver a matching level to the plasma membrane by calibrating our system against a protein with a known dose response to PI(3,5)P2, in this case the lysosomal cation channel TPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">She et al., 2018</xref>). PI(3,5)P2 activates currents of a mutant TPC1 expressed in HEK cells when added to the pipette in conditions similar to those we use. In published work, the EC50 of this activation is approximately 145 nM. In our hands, PI(3,5)P2 activates TPC1 at higher pipette concentrations, with an EC50 of 7–10 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting less efficient delivery of the lipid to the plasma membrane in our system. In this setting, our measured EC50, though higher than that of TPC1, is in a similar range. In either case, we expect that the final concentration of PI(3,5)P2 in the plasma membrane is substantially, likely more than an order of magnitude, lower than that in the pipette solution, leaving the actual binding affinity uncertain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The pathogenic mutation Y715C abolishes PI(3,5)P2 inhibition of ClC-7</title><p>Recently, a novel disease-causing mutation in ClC-7, Y715C, was reported in two patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicoli et al., 2019</xref>). At the lysosomal level, this variant is characterized by enlarged vacuoles and hyperacidified lysosomes, a phenotype remarkably similar to that observed in apilimod-treated cells. Consistent with these features, currents measured from cells expressing ClC-7-Y715C were larger than those expressing wildtype ClC-7, suggesting that enhanced chloride/proton exchange could allow more Cl<sup>-</sup> to enter the lysosome and facilitate excess acidification, thereby contributing to the observed lower pH levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicoli et al., 2019</xref>). Examination of the human ClC-7 structure reveals that the side chain of tyrosine 715, located on the cytoplasmic domain, is within 10 Å of the inositol ring of the bound PIP, and that it is involved in a hydrogen-bonding network with ring hydroxyls and several TM-domain residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>We reasoned that this network might play an important role in coupling the binding of PI(3,5)P2 to changes in transport currents. If so, the Y715C mutation might perturb this interaction and limit the inhibitory effect of PI(3,5)P2, resulting in the more active phenotype we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicoli et al., 2019</xref>). To test this possibility, we repeated the PIP2 patch-clamp electrophysiology experiments described above after introducing the Y715C mutation. For currents from ClC-7PM Y715C, the inhibitory effect of PI(3,5)P2 we observed for WT transporters is no longer detectable; the phosphoinositide had essentially no effect on the mutant ClC-7 currents under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This result suggests that the Y715C mutation either weakens the binding of PI(3,5)P2 to ClC-7 or disrupts the coupling between lipid binding and the transporter gating. As with wildtype ClC-7, PI3P also had no detectable effect on Y715C mutant currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Even increasing the pipette concentration of PI(3,5)P2 to 100 µM did not affect Y715C currents (not shown). These results demonstrate a mechanistic connection between the lysosomal effects observed under PIKfyve inhibition and those observed in patients carrying the Y715C mutation: in the former case, a decrease in available PI(3,5)P2 relieves a tonic inhibition of ClC-7 by the lipid, and in the latter, PI(3,5)P2 may be present but it is unable to elicit its usual inhibition of transport.</p><p>Close examination of the human ClC-7 structure reveals that Y715 is engaged in a network of H-bonds with residues on the protein’s transmembrane domain that extends to the 5′ hydroxyl on the PIP inositol ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We tested the importance of the hydroxyl group and phenyl ring on this tyrosine by mutating it to a phenylalanine or to a serine, respectively, and measured transporter currents using the ClC-7PM expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes with two-electrode voltage clamp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Removing either the hydroxyl group (Y715F) or the phenyl ring (Y715S) both increased maximal current at +80 mV and sped current activation. For each mutation we examined, the transporter current had characteristics nearly identical to that of the original Y715C mutant, suggesting that the WT tyrosine is essential at this position. Indeed, multiple other mutations at this position all resulted in currents very similar to that of Y715C, strongly supporting the importance of the WT tyrosine for proper transporter function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Y715 is required for proper ClC-7 function.</title><p>Y715x mutations were introduced to the plasma membrane-targeted ClC-7 and currents measured in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes under two-electrode voltage clamp.

Our mechanistic experiments revealing direct inhibition of ClC-7 by PI(3,5)P2 suggest that tonic PI(3,5)P2 inhibition of the ClC-7 is relieved by the lipid depletion caused by apilimod inhibition of PIKfyve. We observed hyperacidification in multiple cell types, including U20S osteosarcoma cells, human neonatal fibroblasts, and SUDHL B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cells. Our results clearly establish that PIKfyve inhibition can affect lysosomal pH. There are several possible reasons why previous efforts to identify such changes were unsuccessful. First, it is essential to use a dye with sensitivity at the low end of the lysosomal pH range. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho et al., 2015</xref> used FITC as their pH-sensing dye; with a pKa around 6.0 the dye is minimally sensitive to pH below about 4.5 so changes in the range we observe would be difficult to detect. Recently, Sharma et al. measured lysosomal pH with OG and concluded that apilimod or a new PIKfyve inhibitor named WX8 does not affect lysosomal pH of RAW or U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). However, their experiments yield untreated lysosomal pH values of 5.25 ± 0.05 units in both cell lines; this is above the range we observe and may indicate a problem with calibration or image processing. Nonetheless, that group did observe a (significant) hyperacidification of ~0.2 pH units with one inhibitor (WX8), consistent with our findings. Additional variability may result from cell-type differences in acidification control or in the role of PIKfyve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sbrissa and Shisheva, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Apilimod-induced vacuoles originate from endolysosomes and lysosomes through alterations in the tubulation/fission processes that constantly reform these organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bissig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). Although the molecular mechanism for these processes remains unknown, Compton et al. showed (and our results replicated) that the proton pump V-ATPase must be active to produce vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Compton et al., 2016</xref>), though it has been suggested that these effects could result from off-target effects of BafA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mauvezin et al., 2015</xref>). Our results using pH-modifying agents early in vacuole development clearly demonstrate that the hyperacidic luminal pH resulting from apilimod treatment is neither responsible for initiation of vacuole formation, nor for the increase in vacuole size, as alkalinizing lysosomes to pH values above about pH 5.5 had no impact on these effects. In further support of a bifurcation of these processes, lysosomal tubulation and fission events (size decrease) precede the return to normal pH. However, lysosomal size and pH are not completely decoupled, as indicated by the observation that ClC-7 knockout dampens both apilimod-induced size and pH changes, as well as by the effects of the disease-causing mutation ClC-7 Y715C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicoli et al., 2019</xref>). This shift could reflect alteration of lysosomal membrane electrical potential or changes of luminal ion concentrations, in turn affecting the trafficking and/or inducing osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Zanni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sartelet et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our electrophysiology experiments reveal a direct and specific inhibitory effect of PI(3,5)P2 on ClC-7 activity. Based on the changes caused by PI(3,5)P2 to the kinetics of slow ClC-7 voltage-dependent activation and deactivation, we suggest that the lipid tunes this slow gating process rather than affecting the transport cycle itself. Notably, in the human ClC-7 structure the bound lipid is modeled as a PI3P, a lipid that did not perceptibly inhibit ClC-7 transport in our experiments and did not compete with PI(3,5)P2 at concentrations we could achieve. Further work will be necessary to determine the role, if any, of PI3P in ClC-7 function. The headgroup of the bound lipid in the structure participates in a hydrogen bonding network that encompasses residues both on the TM domain and the cytoplasmic domain of the protein, and which includes the Y715 residue that is mutated in the gain-of-function patient. Our observations here that the Y715C mutation abolishes PI(3,5)P2 inhibition and that the Y715 position is exquisitely sensitive to mutation suggest a model wherein ClC-7 voltage-dependent gating comprises substantial conformational changes involving this interface, changes that we infer are modulated by the presence and identity of the bound lipid. Perhaps upon binding PI(3,5)P2 the 5-phosphate revises the H-bond network and induces a gating-controlling conformational change to inhibit the transporter. This model is consistent with a large body of evidence for a role of the cytoplasmic domain in slow gating of ClC-7, including a report that the ClC-7 C-terminal domain is necessary for voltage-dependent gating that corroborates the importance of this interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Zanni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ludwig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sartelet et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The work we present here advances our understanding of the role of ClC-7 in lysosomal acidification. Previous work has suggested that ClC-7 forms part of the lysosomal counterion pathway based on increases in lysosomal pH in cells with ClC-7 knocked down using siRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graves et al., 2008</xref>), as well as the effect of Cl<sup>-</sup> removal from the bathing media in isolated lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohkuma et al., 1982</xref>). However, cells from multiple tissues in ClC-7 KO mice show normal lysosomal pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasper et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wartosch et al., 2009</xref>), a conclusion reinforced by the retention of normal pH in the untreated ClC-7 KO U2OS cells we examined here. Our results suggest a possible explanation for this discrepancy: we hypothesize that ClC-7 is largely inhibited by PI(3,5)P2 in normal cellular conditions, preventing it from strongly influencing baseline lysosomal pH, but is activated by stimuli that decrease PI(3,5)P2 concentrations, thereby providing additional Cl<sup>-</sup> as a counterion and facilitating further lysosomal acidification. This model is supported by the hyperacidification in patient-cell lysosomes carrying the Y715C gain-of-function mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicoli et al., 2019</xref>). Such a mechanism could complement that observed in microglia, where trafficking of ClC-7 to the lysosome upon activation by inflammatory stimuli caused acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Majumdar et al., 2011</xref>). Of course, an alternate explanation is that ClC-7 is indeed the central locus of the counterion pathway, but compensatory changes in expression or regulation of other channels/transporters in the ClC-7 KO account for the normal lysosomal pH in those cells and animals. The nature of the physiological stimuli for changes in PI(3,5)P2 to regulate lysosomal pH remains to be determined, though the PIKfyve kinase has been shown to participate in multiple metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCartney et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>A complementary possibility is that the effects of ClC-7 activity on lysosomal [Cl<sup>-</sup>] are important in some or all of the effects we observe. Due to the lack of a lysosomal pH change in the ClC-7 KO mouse, as well as the significant defects in mice carrying an uncoupled ClC-7, Jentsch and colleagues have proposed that ClC-7’s primary function could be to regulate luminal [Cl<sup>-</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weinert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weinert et al., 2014</xref>). We have not yet been successful in measuring lysosomal Cl<sup>-</sup> in our system; we leave open the possibility that increased flux through ClC-7 could lead to increased luminal osmotic strength, which, in turn, contributes to vacuole growth. However, the dissociation between vacuole size and hyperacidification and the continued size increase in the ClC-7 KO cells perhaps argues against this hypothesis.</p><p>Regulation of lysosomal pH is critical for normal cellular function; the complexity of this regulation is fertile ground for further study. Though the proton-pumping V-Type ATPase is clearly the metabolic driver of acidification, other factors, including the counterion pathway, are also critical. In recent years, a host of candidates for the counterion pathway have been identified, including ion channels like TRPML1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2010</xref>), TPC1 and TPC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and TMEM175 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cang et al., 2015</xref>), and ion transporters like ClC-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graves et al., 2008</xref>); indeed, several of these channels are also known to be modulated by PI(3,5)P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">She et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). However, their physiological functions and contributions to different lysosomal processes are still emerging. Interestingly, knockout of FIG4, the phosphatase that degrades PI(3,5)P2, leads to a phenotype that shares many characteristics with the gain-of-function ClC-7 Y715C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chow et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lenk et al., 2019</xref>). Paradoxically, the FIG4 KO demonstrates <italic>reduced</italic> levels of PI(3,5)P2; thus, its phenotype may also reflect increased activity of ClC-7 due to decreased inhibition by the signaling lipid.</p><p>Besides pH maintenance, lysosomal ions clearly contribute to multiple other processes, including triggering membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2010</xref>), driving the export of lysosomal degradation products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sagné and Gasnier, 2008</xref>), maintaining osmotic balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freeman et al., 2020</xref>), and mediating lysosomal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cang et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a need for coordinated control of multiple pathways. The work we present here uncovers a wealth of possibilities to study fundamental processes underlying lysosomal pH control and hints at complex interactions between multiple ion pathways to balance competing physiological requirements. Much work remains to understand the interplay of these factors and their pleiotropic effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Apilimod (MedChemExpress); WX8 (gift from Juan S.

Size, intensity, and 488/445 ratio of each ROI were then calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>pH calibration curve</title><p>Just after imaging cells in protocol-based conditions, imaging media were washed out and replaced sequentially by a set of pH calibrated buffers supplemented with monensin (7.0 µg/mL, dissolved in ethanol) and nigericin (7.5 µg/mL, dissolved in ethanol; 0.29% ethanol in final solution) to equilibrate pH across cell and organelle membranes. pH calibration buffers composition: pH 7.0: imaging media (IM) plus 40 mM dibasic sodium phosphate (NaP) and 10 mM Tris-maleate (TM); pH 6.0: IM plus 25 mM NaP and 25 mM TM; pH 5.0: IM plus 5 mM NaP and 45 mM TM; pH 4.5: IM plus 30 mM NaP and 20 mM citrate; pH 4.0: IM plus 26 mM NaP and 24 mM citrate; pH 3.0: IM plus 20 mM NaP and 30 mM citrate. For each buffer, lysosomal pH measures were obtained on 4–5 different cells. 488/445 nm ratios were then plotted in function of pH buffers and fitted by a four-parameter sigmoidal function curve using Sigma plot v12 (Systat Software Inc).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>ClC-7 KO CRISPR clone engineering</title><p>To knock out ClC-7 at the genomic level in U2OS cells, two guide RNA plasmid constructs were created using lentiCRISPRv2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>).

Pipette resistance was 2–5 MΩ in the extracellular solution. A reference electrode was placed in a separate chamber containing extracellular solution and connected to a 2% agar bridge made from extracellular solution. Extracellular solution consisted of (in mM) 130 NaCl , 5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 HEPES, and 20 glucose, with the pH adjusted to 7.4 using NaOH and the osmolality adjusted to 310 mOsmol using sucrose.

Relief of this inhibition leads to lysosome overacidification and enlargement and can explain the phenotype of a disease-causing ‘gain-of-function’ mutation in CLC-7.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Haoxing Xu (Reviewer #2); Elena Oancea (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The concentrations of PI(3,5)P2 used in the patch clamp experiments are very large compared to what are thought to be physiological concentrations, based on studies investigating other PI(3,5)P2-sensitive channels and transporters. For comparison, reported values for activation of lysosomal cation channels for PI(3,5)P2 are three orders of magnitude smaller for mouse TRPML1 (Dong et al., JBC, 20210), and more than two orders of magnitude smaller for <italic>Drosophila</italic> TRPML1 and human TPC2 (Feng et al., JBC, 2013; Wang et al., Cell, 2012; Boccaccio et al., Cell Mol Life Sci, 2014). Also for the plant vacuolar CLC-a transporter, inhibition occurs with an apparent affinity of 12 nM (Carpaneto et al., Sci Rep, 2017). These discrepancies need to be discussed in detail. In addition, a concentration of &quot;~1 mol% PI(3,5)P2 in the cytosolic membrane&quot; appears to be extremely high. Indeed, PI(3,5)P2 is actually a very minor lipid and it is thought that the low level of PI(3,5)P2 keeps channels like TRPML shut. Such channels are only activated in response to a synthesis of PI(3,5)P2. Thus, the hypothesis of a tonic block of CLC-7/Ostm1 that is released by a decrease of PI(3,5)P2, i.e. the idea that CLC-7/Ostm1 activity is relevant only in response to a decrease of PI(3,5)P2 appears rather unphysiological.</p><p>Therefore, it is essential to demonstrate at what PI(3,5)P2 concentrations are CLC-7 wt and Y715C mutant inhibited. Are these concentrations physiological (or in a range that we think can be reached under physiological conditions), are they higher or lower than those that inhibit other lysosomal channels, primarily TPC2 and TRPML1, both of which can have the same effect on lysosomal pH. One possible approach for evaluating whether CLC-7 is inhibited by physiological concentrations of PI(3,5)P2 would be to use PM targeted TPC1 for calibration, see e.g. She et al., 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature26139, extended Figure 2b). The mutant Y715C should also be evaluated.</p><p>2) The electrophysiological experiments are not sufficiently documented. In particular, the kinetics of the onset of inhibition by PI(3,5)P2 upon break-in into the whole cell configuration provides important information: is the time course compatible with the assumptions? Is the time course reproducible? How fast is steady state achieved? These are standard, and extremely easy to implement controls of experimental quality that need to be shown.</p><p>3) The main rationale for CLC-7 being responsible for the apilimod-induced effects on lysosomal pH and size in Figures1-4 is the lack of apilimod-induced effects on CLC-7-KO cells (shown in Figure 5). Because CLC-7-KO lysosomes could have altered expression of other PI(3,5)P2-sensitive channels (a point that is not considered by the authors and it is not easy to quantify), the authors should use well-characterized inhibitors of these channels to separate the CLC-7-mediated effect from other PI(3,5)P2-sensitive channels. As mentioned in the discussion, CLC-7 is not the only transporter regulated by PI(3,5)P2, but it is the only one reported to be negatively regulated. Two other endolysosomal cation channels, TRPML1 and TPC2 are positively regulated by PI(3,5)P2. Thus, if at rest PI(3,5)P2 concentration is high enough to keep CLC-7 closed, preventing Cl<sup>-</sup> from being transporter in the lumen, ca<sup>2+</sup> and/or Na<sup>+</sup> would also leave the lumen through TRPML1 and TPC2. (For example, the TPC2 KO leads to enlarged melanosomes (lysosomal-related organelles; Ambrosio et al., PNAS 2016), suggesting that TPC2 could be open at baseline.) Although other channels maybe be beyond the scope of this paper, the question of whether endolysosomes can function with a CLC-7 closed at baseline must at least be discussed.</p><p>4) One extremely important aspect regarding the role of CLC-7/Ostm1 in lysosomal enlargement, i.e. chloride transport, has been completely ignored by the authors. In fact, chloride accumulation has been proposed to be one of the major functions of CLC-7/Ostm1. This is related to the repeated finding that knock-out of CLC-7/Ostm1 does not impair lysosomal acidification, seen also here by the authors. It is therefore highly desirable to investigate the levels of lysosomal chloride in the various experimental conditions, i.e. PIKFYVE inhibition and CLC-7/Ostm1 knock-out.

For comparison, reported values for activation of lysosomal cation channels for PI(3,5)P2 are three orders of magnitude smaller for mouse TRPML1 (Dong et al., JBC, 20210), and more than two orders of magnitude smaller for Drosophila TRPML1 and human TPC2 (Feng et al., JBC, 2013; Wang et al., Cell, 2012; Boccaccio et al., Cell Mol Life Sci, 2014). Also for the plant vacuolar CLC-a transporter, inhibition occurs with an apparent affinity of 12 nM (Carpaneto et al., Sci Rep, 2017). These discrepancies need to be discussed in detail. In addition, a concentration of &quot;~1 mol% PI(3,5)P2 in the cytosolic membrane&quot; appears to be extremely high. Indeed, PI(3,5)P2 is actually a very minor lipid and it is thought that the low level of PI(3,5)P2 keeps channels like TRPML shut. Such channels are only activated in response to a synthesis of PI(3,5)P2. Thus, the hypothesis of a tonic block of CLC-7/Ostm1 that is released by a decrease of PI(3,5)P2, i.e. the idea that CLC-7/Ostm1 activity is relevant only in response to a decrease of PI(3,5)P2 appears rather unphysiological.</p><p>Therefore, it is essential to demonstrate at what PI(3,5)P2 concentrations are CLC-7 wt and Y715C mutant inhibited. Are these concentrations physiological (or in a range that we think can be reached under physiological conditions), are they higher or lower than those that inhibit other lysosomal channels, primarily TPC2 and TRPML1, both of which can have the same effect on lysosomal pH. One possible approach for evaluating whether CLC-7 is inhibited by physiological concentrations of PI(3,5)P2 would be to use PM targeted TPC1 for calibration, see e.g. She et al., 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature26139, extended Figure 2b). The mutant Y715C should also be evaluated.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and we performed the suggested experiments to address it. We calibrated our experimental system against the TPC1 results in She et al. 2018 by expressing plasma membrane‐targeted mouse TPC1 (Origene Cat. #MR210795) in HEK‐293 cells and measuring current responses after including a range of concentrations of PI(3,5)P2 diC8 in the pipette solution, from 0 to 100 µM. After allowing solution exchange with the cytosol for 3 min, we measured an EC50 of ~10 µM for mTPC1, whereas She et al. saw a value of ~145 nM in their experimental system. This suggests that our experimental setup requires much higher concentrations of PIP2 to achieve the same effect as others have seen in systems with more direct means to apply the lipid and with more lysosome‐like membrane environments. We suspect that the amount of PI(3,5)P2 available to ClC‐7 in the plasma membrane is significantly less than the solution concentration in the pipette suggests. Note that the literature examples cited above mostly used patch‐clamp of enlarged endolysosomes, with lipid applied in the bath solution and perfused across the vacuoles, a setup that may require lower PIP2 concentrations to elicit the effect. Based on the comparison between CLC‐7 and TPC1 in the plasma membrane, we suspect that the affinity of the transporter for PI(3,5)P2 is substantially higher than our measured EC50 and have noted this in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The electrophysiological experiments are not sufficiently documented. In particular, the kinetics of the onset of inhibition by PI(3,5)P2 upon break-in into the whole cell configuration provides important information: is the time course compatible with the assumptions? Is the time course reproducible? How fast is steady state achieved? These are standard, and extremely easy to implement controls of experimental quality that need to be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize to the reviewers for not including these results in the original version and have clarified this issue in our revision. We determined our time point (3 min) for these measurements by analyzing the time course of the CLC‐7 response at a series of times after breaking into the cell. We found that the effect had essentially saturated by the three‐minute point, which is why we reported that time point. We have added a supplemental figure (Figure 6--figure supplement 1) to demonstrate the kinetics of inhibition as requested by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The main rationale for CLC-7 being responsible for the apilimod-induced effects on lysosomal pH and size in Figures1-4 is the lack of apilimod-induced effects on CLC-7-KO cells (shown in Figure 5). Because CLC-7-KO lysosomes could have altered expression of other PI(3,5)P2-sensitive channels (a point that is not considered by the authors and it is not easy to quantify), the authors should use well-characterized inhibitors of these channels to separate the CLC-7-mediated effect from other PI(3,5)P2-sensitive channels. As mentioned in the discussion, CLC-7 is not the only transporter regulated by PI(3,5)P2, but it is the only one reported to be negatively regulated. Two other endolysosomal cation channels, TRPML1 and TPC2 are positively regulated by PI(3,5)P2. Thus, if at rest PI(3,5)P2 concentration is high enough to keep CLC-7 closed, preventing Cl<sup>-</sup> from being transporter in the lumen, ca<sup>2+</sup> and/or Na<sup>+</sup> would also leave the lumen through TRPML1 and TPC2. (For example, the TPC2 KO leads to enlarged melanosomes (lysosomal-related organelles; Ambrosio et al., PNAS 2016), suggesting that TPC2 could be open at baseline.) Although other channels maybe be beyond the scope of this paper, the question of whether endolysosomes can function with a CLC-7 closed at baseline must at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and one which, of course, interests us greatly. We do think that the interplay between all of these ion permeabilities is likely to be very important in lysosomal homeostasis. However, we agree with the reviewers that careful study of these interactions will be an enterprise unto itself and must wait for a further publication. In recognition of the importance of these issues, we have expanded our discussion to address them more directly, including the last point about a ClC‐7 closed at baseline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One extremely important aspect regarding the role of CLC-7/Ostm1 in lysosomal enlargement, i.e. chloride transport, has been completely ignored by the authors. In fact, chloride accumulation has been proposed to be one of the major functions of CLC-7/Ostm1. This is related to the repeated finding that knock-out of CLC-7/Ostm1 does not impair lysosomal acidification, seen also here by the authors. It is therefore highly desirable to investigate the levels of lysosomal chloride in the various experimental conditions, i.e. PIKFYVE inhibition and CLC-7/Ostm1 knock-out. It is surprising that the authors not even mention this possibility. At minimum, the potential role of chloride, and the related literature, need be discussed as a viable possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a paragraph to the discussion addressing the role of [Cl-].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The observation that cells with CRISPR-mediated CLC-7 KO do not have altered pH, although consistent with the observation in other systems, could reflect the adaptation of the cells to lack of CLC-7 by changing the expression of activity of the other channels and transporters in the membrane.

Nevertheless, we prefer not to take on this controversy in this work. As the reviewers point out, without acutely inhibiting ClC7, we can’t make firm conclusions about its role at baseline; we were careful, however, to word our conclusion in a way that leaves open the possibility that baseline ClC‐7 permeability contributes to acidification (“largely inhibited by PI(3,5)P2 in normal cellular conditions..” We also added a sentence to the discussion pointing out that compensatory changes could be responsible for the maintained pH in the KO cells/mice.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers are pleased with your revisions and have identified just a few remaining issues that should be straightforward for you to address:</p><p>1) We appreciate your rationale for postponing chloride measurements for future work.
