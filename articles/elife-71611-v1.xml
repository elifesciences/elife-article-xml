In bacteria, DNA replication is triggered by the initiator protein DnaA, which has long been suggested to respond to nutritional changes; nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we report a novel mechanism that adjusts DnaA synthesis in response to nutrient availability in <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>. By performing a detailed biochemical and genetic analysis of the <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA, we identified a sequence downstream of the <italic>dnaA</italic> start codon that inhibits DnaA translation elongation upon carbon exhaustion. Our data show that the corresponding peptide sequence, but not the mRNA secondary structure or the codon choice, is critical for this response, suggesting that specific amino acids in the growing DnaA nascent chain tune translational efficiency. Our study provides new insights into DnaA regulation and highlights the importance of translation elongation as a regulatory target. We propose that translation regulation by nascent chain sequences, like the one described, might constitute a general strategy for modulating the synthesis rate of specific proteins under changing conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>mRNA</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>starvation</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>797801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Felletti</surname><given-names>Michele</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-03300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-03765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>E Gerhart H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001729</institution-id><institution>Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FFL15-0005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stockholm University, Strategic Research Area</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-03545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Kristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Specific amino acids in the N-terminus of the replication initiator protein DnaA inhibit translation elongation upon carbon starvation, illustrating that the identity of the N-terminal amino acids of a protein can modulate protein synthesis yield under changing conditions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most cells must be able to integrate external information with proliferative functions such as DNA replication, cell division, and protein synthesis. In particular, unicellular bacteria that frequently face drastic environmental changes in their natural habitat are able to precisely adjust their growth and division rate in response to environmental cues. While most bacteria proliferate rapidly under optimal conditions, they slow down growth and often enter a non-growing state under adverse conditions, for example, nutrient limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinrich et al., 2015</xref>). This dynamic switching between proliferative and non-growing modes contributes to stress and antibiotic tolerance, as well as the virulence of pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Bolle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hobbs and Boraston, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wood et al., 2013</xref>). Previous research has focused on the mechanisms that allow bacteria to globally reprogram gene transcription in response to nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schellhorn, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steinchen et al., 2020</xref>). More recently, the advance of ribosome profiling technologies has also revealed a central role of translational regulation in the adaptation to changing nutrient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Parker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tollerson, 2020</xref>). Despite significant progress, the precise molecular mechanisms regulating the translation of specific proteins during nutrient limitation are incompletely understood.</p><p>When entering growth arrest, most bacteria inhibit DNA replication initiation and halt their cell division cycle with a reduced number of fully replicated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jonas, 2014</xref>). Shutting down DNA replication initiation prior to the cessation of key metabolic functions and cell division likely preserves genome and cellular integrity. In nearly all bacteria, replication initiation depends on DnaA, an ATP-binding protein consisting of four distinct structural and functional domains: (1) a helicase loading domain, (2) a linker domain, (3) an AAA+ (<underline>A</underline>TPase <underline>A</underline>ssociated with diverse cellular <underline>A</underline>ctivities) domain, and (4) a DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen and Atlung, 2018</xref>). DnaA is only active in the ATP-bound state and, upon binding to specific DnaA-boxes in the bacterial origin of replication, it unwinds double-stranded DNA and recruits the replisome. ATP hydrolysis following replication initiation subsequently inactivates DnaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katayama et al., 2010</xref>). Due to its critical function in replication initiation, DnaA has been proposed to be a crucial player in the nutritional control of DNA replication for more than 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donachie, 1968</xref>). Yet, the precise molecular mechanisms that regulate this important protein in response to changing nutrient conditions remain poorly understood.</p><p>In the freshwater bacterium <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<italic>Caulobacter</italic> hereafter), DnaA levels decrease at the onset of carbon starvation when growth rate declines, which entails a block of DNA replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorbatyuk and Marczynski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lesley and Shapiro, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leslie et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Caulobacter</italic> is an important model for bacterial cell cycle studies due to its asymmetric cell cycle and its genetical tractability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Govers and Jacobs-Wagner, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, as a member of the <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>, it is representative of a diverse group of bacteria, including important pathogens and agriculturally relevant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Govers and Jacobs-Wagner, 2020</xref>). In its natural habitat, <italic>Caulobacter</italic> frequently experiences fluctuations in nutrient availability, for example, as an indirect consequence of seasonality or changes in the microbial composition of its niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heinrich et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>Caulobacter</italic> DnaA is a relatively unstable protein that is degraded by the AAA+ protease Lon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Felletti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jonas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Although Lon-dependent proteolysis is required for rapid clearance of DnaA at the onset of starvation, the rate of proteolysis is not significantly affected by changing nutrient conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leslie et al., 2015</xref>). Instead, a starvation-induced decrease in DnaA translation rate was shown to be responsible for nutritional regulation of DnaA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leslie et al., 2015</xref>). However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive.</p><p>Here, we reveal the mechanistic basis underlying the starvation-induced downregulation of DnaA translation in <italic>Caulobacter</italic>. An in-depth biochemical and genetic characterisation of the <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA showed that its 5' untranslated leader region (5'UTR) is dispensable for this regulation. Instead, inhibition of DnaA translation occurs during polypeptide chain elongation in a starvation-dependent manner, within a coding sequence downstream of the start codon. Our data are consistent with a model in which specific amino acids in the N-terminus of DnaA mediate a translation arrest in response to nutrient limitation while, or after, being added to the growing nascent polypeptide chain. In addition to providing new molecular insights into the nutritional regulation of DnaA, our findings illustrate how specific sequence motifs in nascent polypeptides can tune the first stages of translation elongation under changing nutrient conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The 5'UTR of the <italic>Caulobacter dnaA</italic> mRNA adopts a complex secondary structure</title><p>In <italic>Caulobacter</italic>, DnaA levels decrease when cells are shifted from a glucose-supplemented minimal medium to the glucose-limiting medium M2G<sub>1/10</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorbatyuk and Marczynski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leslie et al., 2015</xref>). Previous work established that this carbon starvation-induced downregulation of DnaA abundance is caused by decreased <italic>dnaA</italic> translation in combination with constitutive DnaA degradation by Lon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leslie et al., 2015</xref>). To elucidate the mechanistic basis for starvation-dependent downregulation of DnaA, we structurally and functionally characterised the mRNA region comprising the 155 nucleotides (nt) long 5'UTR and the first 118 nt of the <italic>dnaA</italic> coding region (total RNA length 273 nt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schrader et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zweiger and Shapiro, 1994</xref>). Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of this in vitro transcribed <sup>32</sup>P-5'-end-labelled RNA indicated a dominant conformation of the <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA leader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine its secondary structure, we combined mFold and ViennaRNA computational predictions with structural probing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). The latter was performed with Pb<sup>2+</sup> to induce RNA cleavages in single-stranded regions, RNase T1 to cleave after single-stranded G residues, and RNase V1 for mapping double-stranded stretches. The experimental and in silico analyses suggested seven base-paired segments: one helical element (P1) and six stem-loop motifs (P2–P7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The 5'-most 8 nt are part of helix P1, which is connected via a three-way junction to stem-loops P2 and P3. The stable GC-rich stem P4 carries a G-rich loop which is highly susceptible to T1 RNase cleavage. A fifth stem-loop structure (P5) is located upstream of the AUG start codon. Two mismatches in this stem confer some instability (ΔG<sub>folding</sub> of –7 kcal/mol). The region around the start codon appears mostly unstructured, suggested by T1 cleavages at nucleotides G154, G158, and G164 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The mRNA region encompassing the first 118 nt of the <italic>dnaA</italic> coding region folds into two stable stem-loops, P6 and P7. The additional RNase V1 cleavages in this portion of the RNA might indicate base-pairing of the 3' terminal nucleotides with the mRNA region around the start codon.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Caulobacter dnaA</italic> mRNA assumes a complex secondary structure that inhibits pre-initiation complex formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth curve (red) and DnaA abundance (blue) measured during a carbon exhaustion experiment.

A set of six mutant strains was constructed, with point mutation in the 5'UTR predicted to modify the stability of stem P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, the stabilising mutation G125C (ΔG<sub>folding</sub><sup>P5</sup> = –11.3 kcal/mol) completely abolished eGFP expression, whereas mutations that weaken stem P5 increased eGFP expression during exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In particular, the C127A mutation, predicted to both break one base-pair and entail fraying at the bottom of the stem, caused a strong increase in basal eGFP expression.

Both assays showed that the eGFP reporter was stable in both strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), excluding that the presence of DnaA N<sub>t</sub> at the N-terminus of eGFP significantly affects protein stability.

Our previous work showed that in these two media the nutrient-dependent regulation of DnaA translation is recapitulated, resulting in 4–5 times higher DnaA levels in PYE compared to M2G in exponentially growing cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leslie et al., 2015</xref>). Consistently, according to calculations by Aretakis et al., the absolute number of translated DnaA molecules as well as the percentage of translation dedicated to DnaA synthesis is higher in PYE than in M2G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and B</xref> ), demonstrating that DnaA is more efficiently translated during growth in rich medium. This is in contrast to the translational output of other cell cycle master regulators that is largely unaffected by the growth medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). Most interestingly, when visualising the ribosome footprint density along the <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA, we observed, in M2G, a strong enrichment of ribosomes footprints in the region encoding N<sub>t</sub> but only very low occupancy in the remaining part of the mRNA. By contrast, in PYE, ribosome footprints were more evenly distributed along the length of the <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>).

A BLAST search revealed high conservation of the DnaA N<sub>t</sub> amino acid sequence in several members of the <italic>Caulobacteraceae</italic> family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A general feature of the identified sequences is a high degree of hydrophobicity, with alanine being the most abundant amino acid. Using our fluorescent reporter, we designed two mutants in which regions of DnaA N<sub>t</sub> were deleted; mutant D1 lacks a hydrophobic region spanning residues 6–15, and mutant D2 lacks residues 18–22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Both D1 and D2 resulted in moderately higher Δt and Δf values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) compared to the 5'UTR-N<sub>t</sub> strain, indicating a delay in starvation-dependent inhibition of DnaA translation. However, none of these mutations recapitulated the phenotype observed in the ΔN<sub>t</sub> or dfsN<sub>t</sub> strains. In order to identify shorter motifs responsible for the phenotype observed in the D1 mutant, we generated additional amino acid deletions and substitutions in this segment of DnaA N<sub>t</sub>. Most of these did not affect eGFP accumulation during carbon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, the deletion or substitution of one group of three residues (A14-A15-I16; AAI motif hereafter) in the conserved hydrophobic region significantly increased both Δt and Δf values compared to the 5'UTR-N<sub>t</sub> control, similar to the 5'UTR-ΔN<sub>t</sub> and 5'UTR-dfsN<sub>t</sub> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results indicate that the amino acids of the AAI motif contribute to the inhibition of DnaA translation.</p><p>Previous work established that synonymous codons, decoded by distinct isoacceptor aminoacyl (aa)-tRNAs (i.e., charged with the same amino acid), can display differences in their sensitivity to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>). For instance, the charged levels of major aa-tRNAs, which read the most abundant codons, rapidly decrease upon amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elf et al., 2003</xref>). However, when the AAI motif codons were mutated to either less or more abundant synonymous codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), no significant effects on the starvation-dependent inhibition of DnaA translation were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This suggests that the amino acid sequence of the N-terminus of DnaA mediates the starvation-induced translation arrest irrespective of the synonymous codon choice. It is of note that the introduction of less abundant codons, containing A or T in the third position, resulted in higher eGFP expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), probably due to a decreased propensity for a stable mRNA structure near the translation start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bentele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Thus, our data suggest that, under carbon-limiting conditions, translation elongation efficiency decreases in a sequence-dependent manner during the synthesis of the DnaA N-terminus.

In the model organism <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, we identified a specific N-terminal sequence in the nascent DnaA polypeptide chain that acts as a novel regulatory element which tunes DnaA translation elongation in response to the cellular nutrient and growth status. With its crucial function in bacterial replication initiation, the abundance and activity of DnaA must be precisely regulated in response to environmental and cellular changes to ensure cellular survival.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A model for DnaA regulation under carbon starvation</title><p>Based on our results, we propose a model of nutritionally controlled DnaA translation. Under optimal conditions, efficient transcription of <italic>dnaA</italic> and a high rate of DnaA translation ensure the accumulation of active DnaA that triggers DNA replication initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). At the onset of carbon starvation, translation ceases during the early stage of the elongation phase at a specific sequence located downstream of the <italic>dnaA</italic> start codon (as discussed below). Ribosome pausing at this sequence, as supported by our analysis of ribosome profiling data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), is expected to result in ribosome traffic jams that, as previously proposed, stimulate premature translation termination either directly, by inducing disassembly of the leading ribosome from the mRNA, or indirectly, by recruiting the tmRNA or ArfB ribosome rescue systems that are present in <italic>Caulobacter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feaga et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrin and Subramaniam, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keiler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>). Due to the proximity of the stalling site and the start codon, persistent queues of 2–3 ribosomes might also decrease translation rates by physically preventing access of initiating ribosomes to the translation start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">MacDonald et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mitarai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, ribosome pausing may result in increased mRNA decay or Rho-dependent termination of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Samatova et al., 2020</xref>). The postulated starvation-dependent elongation pause significantly reduces the rate of DnaA synthesis. The concomitant degradation of full-length DnaA by Lon then aids the rapid clearance of DnaA from the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leslie et al., 2015</xref>), preventing DNA replication initiation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The molecular mechanism of starvation-induced translation inhibition</title><p>The nutritional downregulation of DnaA translation depends on a specific sequence downstream of the <italic>dnaA</italic> start codon. Since neither the RNA secondary structure of this sequence nor the codon choice impacted the nutritional regulation of DnaA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we rule out that the RNA structure spatially hinders ribosome movement. Furthermore, we have shown that synonymous mutations of the AAI motif did not perturb the capacity of N<sub>t</sub> to mediate the regulatory response. Based on this result and the previously made findings that under starvation the charged levels of the different isoacceptor tRNAs depend on their codon usage during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dittmar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Subramaniam et al., 2014</xref>), we consider it also unlikely that reduced charging levels of a specific set of isoacceptor tRNAs (e.g., Ala-tRNAs) is the major cause of the downregulation of translation during starvation. Instead, we suggest that the amino acids encoded by this sequence arrest translation after, or while, being added to the growing DnaA polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This model is in line with the recent observation that the identity of the amino acids encoded by early codons of a gene can impact protein synthesis yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verma et al., 2019</xref>). Previous work has also demonstrated that certain nascent peptide sequences specifically arrest translation through interactions with the ribosome exit tunnel surface, thereby regulating the expression of downstream genes through translational coupling, or affecting transcription termination and mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ito and Chiba, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). A well-characterised example is the force-sensing arrest peptide SecM, which contributes to the translational control of the downstream gene <italic>secA</italic> that encodes a translocase subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Murakami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakatogawa and Ito, 2002</xref>). Another class of arrest peptides modulates gene expression by interacting with small effector molecules in the ribosome exit tunnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gong et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Herrero Del Valle et al., 2020</xref>). The AAI motif identified in this study, possibly along with neighbouring amino acids in the N-terminus of DnaA, might interact with the ribosome in a similar way as arrest peptides. However, while arrest peptides commonly serve as <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that regulate the expression of downstream genes, the sequence element that we describe represents, to our knowledge, the first example of a regulatory nascent polypeptide sequence in the N-terminus of a protein that directly modulates translation efficiency of the same protein in response to nutrient availability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Possible ways of sensing nutrients</title><p>The identified nascent sequence element specifically decreases overall DnaA translation rates at the onset of carbon starvation, demonstrating that it is responsive to the nutrient status of the cell.

For example, reduction in the supply of one or more components of the translation machinery (e.g., ribosomes, aa-tRNAs, elongation factors, GTP) could in principle slow down overall translation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Samatova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>).

Before adding the carrier tRNA and the probes, the labelled RNA was allowed to refold for 10 min in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.5, 100 mM K<sup>+</sup>-acetate, 5 mM, DTT, and 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>-acetate (10 μL total reaction volume). RNase T1 probing was done using one unit of enzyme (Invitrogen, #AM2283) for 5 min, and stopped by adding 40 μL cold 0.3 M Na<sup>+</sup>-acetate. Chemical probing was done with Pb<sup>2+</sup>-acetate (Sigma-Aldrich-Merck) at a final concentration of 10 mM and 25 mM for 5 min. Reactions were stopped with addition of cold EDTA (50 mM final concentration) followed by 35 μL of cold 0.3 M Na<sup>+</sup>-acetate. After phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extraction, RNA was ethanol-precipitated. RNA pellets were dried and dissolved in loading dye. About 10,000 cpm of each sample were loaded on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, fixed for 5 min (10% ethanol, 6% acetic acid), and transferred to 3 mm Whatman paper. Signals were detected using a storage phosphor screen and a PMI system (Bio-Rad), and analysed using Image Lab 6.1 (Bio-Rad). Cleavage pattern induced by the probes was assigned using RNase T1 hydrolysis under denaturing conditions (i.e., T1 ladder) and an alkaline ladder. The ladders were prepared following the manufacturer’s instructions (RNase T1 manual, Invitrogen). We used 0.2 pmol of 5'-end-labelled RNA/2 μg of carrier yeast tRNA for the T1 ladder, and 0.1 pmol of 5'-end-labelled RNA/1 μg of carrier yeast tRNA were used for the alkaline ladder.</p><p>The second probing approach used primer extension to detect cleavage positions after treatment with RNases T1 and V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Here, reactions were performed as described above, but using 1 pmol of unlabelled RNA and 1 μg carrier yeast tRNA. RNase V1 probing was done using 0.1, 0.02, or 0.01 enzyme units (Invitrogen, #AM2275) for 5 min, stopped by adding 40 μL of cold 0.3 M Na<sup>+</sup>-acetate. T1 ladders were done in the presence of 1 pmol of unlabelled, denatured RNA and 2 μg of carrier yeast tRNA. The probed RNA and the ladders were phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol extracted and precipitated. Dried pellets were then resuspended in water, and primer extension was performed at 37°C for 20 min using 100 U of SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, #18090010) and two different <sup>32</sup>P-5'-end-labelled primers: 5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">CACCCAGCTCACGCTTCAAAG</named-content>-3' (primer A) or 5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">GAGAAGTCCTGGCTGGCAAC</named-content>-3' (primer B). Primers were labelled using T4 PNK in buffer A and [γ-P<sup>32</sup>]-ATP (10 mCi/mL, 3000 Ci/mmol) and purified using G-50 Microspin columns (GE Healthcare, #27-5330-01). Reverse transcription reactions were stopped by adding 40 μL of cold 0.3 M Na<sup>+</sup>-acetate. After phenol-chloroform extraction, the RNA template was removed by addition of 3 M KOH for 3 min at 90°C, followed by 1 hr incubation at 37°C. After base neutralisation with HCl, the cDNAs were ethanol-precipitated, centrifuged, dissolved in loading buffer, and resolved on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed and treated as above. The sequencing reactions were done using the USB Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing Kit (Affymetrix #78500) and <sup>32</sup>P-5'-end-labelled primers A and B. The template for the sequencing reaction was obtained by PCR using <italic>C. crescentus</italic> NA1000 genomic DNA and the following primers: 5'-<named-content content-type="sequence">CAAATATTTACAAAGGCCGATCAGGG</named-content>-3' (fw2, forward) and primer A (reverse).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Toeprinting assay</title><p>The toeprinting assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huttenhofer and Noller, 1994</xref>) was performed in a 10 μL reaction volume using 0.2 μM of unlabelled RNA and, when present, 100 nM of <italic>E. coli</italic> 30S subunits and 300 nM of <italic>E. coli</italic> initiator tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Romilly et al., 2019</xref>). The reaction buffer contained 10 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.6, 100 mM K<sup>+</sup>-acetate, 1 mM DTT, and 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>-acetate. The RNA was denatured for 1 min at 90°C in the presence of 5'-end-labelled primer A (3 μL, about 50,000 cpm/μL) and 0.5 mM dNTPs. After 1 min on ice, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-acetate was added. RNAs were refolded for 5 min, followed by addition of activated 30S (10 min at 30°C). Next, initiator tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> was added, and 30S-initiation complexes were allowed to form for 20 min. In the unfolded RNA sample, the 30S subunits and the initiator tRNA<sup>fMet</sup> were added immediately after the 1 min incubation at 90°C. Reverse transcription was started by addition of 50 U of SuperScript IV for 20 min and stopped by adding 40 μL of cold 0.3 M Na<sup>+</sup>-acetate. The reverse transcription reactions were treated as above and resolved on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Homologous sequence search and alignments</title><p>Three complementary approaches were used to identify homologous sequences of <italic>Caulobacter</italic>’s 5′UTR<italic><sub>dnaA</sub></italic> and N<sub>t <italic>dnaA</italic></sub>. In the first one, an input nucleotide sequence including both the 5'UTR and the first 25 codons of DnaA was used in a BLASTn search against the NCBI nucleotide collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) and the genome database (March 2020), using an E-value threshold of 10<sup>–6</sup>. In the second approach, aiming to identify more distant homologs, the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> DnaA protein sequence (CCNA_00008) was used in a BLASTp search against the annotated proteins in NCBI’s representative bacterial genome database (E-value cut-off 10<sup>–6</sup>). The resulting hits were aligned with mafft 7.427 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>), and a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree built with IQTREE 1.6.10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>) in order to select the cluster of the most closely related sequences for further analysis. Finally, a tBLASTn search was performed against the NCBI database of representative bacterial genomes to identify additional unannotated homologs. As previously, a tree was inferred on the hits and only sequences forming a cluster of highly related sequences were analysed further. For each hit resulting from the BLASTp and the tBLASTn searches, the upstream region containing the 5'UTR was extracted from the corresponding genome using the coordinates of the BLAST results. The results of the three homology searches were manually screened, pooled, and aligned using the MUSCLE alignment tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edgar, 2004</xref>) as implemented in SeaView 5.0.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gouy et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Computational analysis</title><p>mFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zuker, 2003</xref>) and the RNAfold server of ViennaRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruber et al., 2008</xref>) were used for RNA secondary structure predictions at 30°C. For a search of putative SD sequences in the 5'UTR of <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA, we used the RNAcofold tool of the ViennaRNA package to calculate the ΔG of interaction at 30°C between an 8 nt sliding window of the 5'UTR and the anti-SD sequence of <italic>Caulobacter</italic>’s 16S rRNA. Three different anti-SD sequences were considered: 5'-CCUCC-3', 5'-CCUCCU-3', and 5'-CACCUCCU-3'. The structural analysis based on co-variance was performed using CMfinder 0.4.1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yao et al., 2006</xref>) according to the developer’s indications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Reporter assays</title><p>A Tecan Spark multimode microplate reader was used for culture incubations as well as OD<sub>600</sub> and eGFP fluorescence measurements. Reporter strains were grown in 150 μL of medium at 30°C in sterile 96-well transparent plates with flat-bottom and lid (Greiner Bio-One # 655182). Initial culture OD<sub>600</sub> was 0.02 (1 cm optical path length). The plates were orbitally shaken at 180 rpm with a 3 mm amplitude using a humidity cassette to protect from evaporation. OD<sub>600</sub> and fluorescence were measured every 15 min. The following instrument settings were used to measure eGFP fluorescence: bottom read, excitation wavelength = 485 nm (20 nm bandwidth), emission wavelength = 535 nm (25 nm bandwidth), detector gain = 100 (manual), and automatic z-position optimisation.</p><p>Raw data were processed similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zaslaver et al., 2006</xref> using R and the splines package. The OD<sub>600</sub> measurements of the cultures were background-subtracted using the average value of the blank wells at each time point. To estimate the value of the background fluorescence, we grew a strain carrying the empty pMR10-BG plasmid in each plate. By plotting fluorescence against OD<sub>600</sub>, we noticed that background changed non-linearly over the growth curve. To account for this variation, we fitted the pMR10-BG fluorescence and OD<sub>600</sub> data with a smoothing spline (‘smooth.spline’), generating a mathematical function that allows calculation of the expected background fluorescence at any given OD<sub>600</sub>. Background correction was performed by subtracting the expected background fluorescence to the reporter strain’s fluorescence at each time point. Finally, the resulting value was normalised by dividing it with the OD<sub>600</sub>.</p><p>Δt and Δf were calculated as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The times of maximum fluorescence (t<sub>maxFluo</sub>) and maximum OD<sub>600</sub> (t<sub>maxOD</sub>), as well as the fluorescence values at 24 hr (f<sub>24h</sub>) and at maximum OD<sub>600</sub> (f<sub>maxOD</sub>) were calculated after fitting growth and fluorescence curves with smoothing splines (‘smooth.spline’). To determine the fluorescence intensity at OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.05, we first determined the time at which OD<sub>600</sub> equals 0.05 using ‘interSpline’ and ‘backSpline’ functions. Then, the obtained value was used to calculate the corresponding fluorescence with the R function ‘predict’. All statistical analyses and graph preparations were performed in GraphPad Prism (version 7).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Translation shut-off assays</title><p>For the western blot-based translation shut-off assay, cells were cultured in 25 mL of M2G<sub>1/10</sub> medium for 7 hr until growth arrested.

We have carefully considered each point and have addressed most by modifying the manuscript text to increase clarity of our work. Based on a suggestion by Reviewer 2 we have also included the results of a new experiment.</p><p>In addition to addressing all comments of the reviewers, we have expanded the part of the study analysing the functionality of <italic>Caulobacter</italic>’s DnaA N<sub>t</sub> in the heterologous host <italic>E. coli</italic>. Furthermore, we have replaced our original set of fluorescence data by a new data set that has been acquired using optimized measurement parameters (bottom read and 100 for the detector gain – see Material and Methods for details), which have improved the signal-to-noise ratio and the overall quality of the fluorescence profiles. Importantly, these new data do not change, but rather strengthen, our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Felletti et al. provide compelling new evidence that a CDS element in the dnaA mRNA is required for nutrient dependent translationol control. This provides a mechanisms by which dnaA translation is shut off during carbon starvation, and is supported by a rather rigorous analysis of the mRNA performed both in vitro and in vivo. Overall it was a pleasure to read and the data are generally very compelling. My specific comments are below:</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>While the authors rule out differences in charging of different ala-tRNAs as controlling the nutrient dependent repression in translation, the authors assume that this must be due to the nascent sequence. However, could it also be possible that all ala-tRNA isoacceptors have lower charging after C-starvation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. As Reviewer 1 pointed out, we cannot conclusively exclude that carbon starvation could lead to reduced charging levels of all isoacceptor Ala-tRNAs. However, based on the available literature, we consider it unlikely. In a first work by Elf et al. 2003 (confirmed later by Dittmar et al. 2005 and Subramaniam et al. 2014) the authors argued that under amino acid-limiting conditions the charging levels of the different isoacceptor tRNAs depend directly on their codon usage during translation. Importantly, in our work we could show that N<sub>t</sub> mediates the inhibition of translation independent of the synonymous codon choice, suggesting that aa-tRNA levels are not limiting in our experimental conditions. To address this comment of Reviewer 1, we discussed this matter in a greater detail in the revised version of the manuscript (line 374-379).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>It was observed many years ago that tmRNA is required for the proper timing of DNA replication initiation in Caulobacter (Cheng and Keiler J Bact 2009).

Cheng and Keiler 2009 proposed an indirect involvement of the tmRNA in the transcriptional regulation of DnaA over <italic>Caulobacter</italic>’s cell cycle. In the revised version of the manuscript, we mention the tmRNA and ArfB protein as possible factors involved in ribosome rescue following Nt-induced ribosome stalling and we refer to Keiler et al. 2000 and Feaga et al. 2014.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 49 – add &quot;initiation&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The word “initiation” was added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 61 – is &quot;cleared&quot; meant to be proteolyzed or simply meaning to have a lower protein level?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if we were not clear.

Based on our previous experience (especially the extensive work by the Wagner lab), typical ribosome standby sites only occur in largely unstructured regions. Furthermore, in Supplementary Figure 4 we show that the deletion of stem P4 does not affect eGFP expression levels. For these reasons, we consider it unlikely that the putative CUG start codon is part of a ribosome standby site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 253-255 – this is a beautiful experiment, but very hard to understand from the text.

The DnaA protein is the key chromosome replication initiator probably for most bacteria and as such DnaA is the target of many regulatory inputs. The authors created an accurate reporter system that allows them to dissect the 5' mRNA translated and untranslated sequences of dnaA and they have convincingly demonstrated that the N-terminal DnaA peptide sequence and not the RNA mediate the response to starvation by glucose exhaustion. This is potentially a model example for global translational responses in bacteria.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The main conclusion, i.e. that the DnaA leader peptide &quot;Nt&quot; mediates this response is convincing. However, there were 2 major problems that should be easily addressed. These do not subtract from the main conclusion.</p><p>1) <italic>E. coli</italic> 30S subunits were used in the &quot;Toeprint&quot; assay of Figure 1. Obviously Caulobacter 30S Ribosome subunits should have been used, or a justification should be given. One remedy would be to make this supplementary information.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for this comment. We agree that it would be better to use <italic>Caulobacter</italic> 30S ribosome subunits in our toeprint experiments. However, because toeprint assays with <italic>E. coli</italic> 30S ribosome were already established in our lab (i.e. the Wagner lab, where the assays were performed) and because works by other groups have shown that <italic>E. coli</italic> 30S subunits can be used to study the translation of mRNAs from other bacteria, we decided to use this experimental set up. Based on our results, we also had no reason to doubt the suitability of the <italic>E. coli</italic> 30S subunits. The toeprint showed that translation starts at the <italic>in silico</italic> predicted translation start site, which was further confirmed by our in vivo mutagenesis experiments. For these reasons, we are confident that the toeprint assays indicate the true translational start site. However, we acknowledge that we could have been more explicit about the use of the purified <italic>E. coli</italic> 30S subunits and tRNA-fMet in toeprinting assay. To increase clarity and transparency, in this revised version of the manuscript, some parts of the main text were rephrased and references to the use of <italic>E. coli</italic> 30S and tRNA-fMet were introduced (including Figure 1 legend). We hope that these changes will address the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The results in Figure 6B could be due to the Nt simply making the hybrid protein more unstable in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This is the main impression given by the drop in signal. In this case, the conclusion would be wrong, and Nt is not transferring a starvation translation block from C. crescentus to <italic>E. coli</italic>. Nt is just making the protein unstable. These results should be treated as preliminary pending protein stability measurements. However, this defect does not subtract from the other main points and without the Figure 6 <italic>E. coli</italic> experiments they still make a complete and interesting story. One remedy would be to make this also supplementary information.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed striking that a drop of normalised fluorescence is observed for the 5’UTR<italic><sub>dnaA</sub></italic>-N<sub>t</sub> construct in <italic>E. coli</italic> but not in <italic>Caulobacter</italic>. In order to address if this behavior can be explained by reduced protein stability, we have performed a translation shut-off assay using the 5’UTR<italic><sub>dnaA</sub></italic>-N<sub>t</sub> <italic>E. coli</italic> reporter construct. The results of this experiment (shown in Supplementary Figure 9A and described in line 327-329) show that the normalised fluorescence remains stable over 10 hours after chloramphenicol addition to the culture, ruling out that the presence of N<sub>t</sub> significantly affects eGFP protein stability in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Importantly, this experiment also showed that in contrast to the chloramphenicol treated culture, in which the OD<sub>600</sub> decreased after reaching stationary phase, the OD<sub>600</sub> of the non-treated cultures slightly increased between 2 and 10 hours (Supplementary Figure 9A). Because this increase was not observed in carbon starved <italic>Caulobacter</italic> cultures, we consider the different growth dynamics between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Caulobacter</italic> to be the most likely explanation for differences in eGFP accumulation at later time points during the experiment.</p><p>To further strengthen our <italic>E. coli</italic> data, we have analysed additional relevant N<sub>t</sub> mutants that we identified as most critical mutants in our <italic>Caulobacter</italic> experiments presented in Figure 5, namely dfsN<sub>t</sub>, mutD1, mutD2, ΔAAI and AAI→DDK. Determination of Δt and Δf values for the <italic>E. coli</italic> strains carrying these different N<sub>t</sub> constructs showed similar results as for the corresponding constructs in <italic>Caulobacter</italic>. Collectively, these new data further support the notion that N<sub>t</sub> operates in <italic>E. coli</italic> through a conserved inhibitory mechanism of translation. These data are now included in a reorganized new version of Figure 6 (panels A, B) as well as in Supplementary Figure 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>There are also 6 minor issues that are easily addressed, most by small changes to the text, and these should improve this otherwise fine manuscript.</p><p>1) Line 88 Figure 1A shows DnaA degradation upon entering stationary phase from a low glucose media and not a simple starvation response to one component like glucose. Did the authors consider trying simple washout experiments, i.e. resuspend the cells in glucose-free media? This would have the advantage of suddenly exposing the cells to starvation and thereby studying the sudden response rather than the slower lingering response which would be due to many factors and not just glucose removal.</p></disp-quote><p>In a previous work from our lab (Leslie et al. 2015), we have conclusively shown that the downregulation of DnaA synthesis depends primarily on the nutrient content of the growth medium.</p><p>Besides being in continuity with our previous work, we think that the starvation protocol that we used in the present study, and that was also used by the Sean Crosson lab (Boutte et al. 2012), might better reproduce what happens in the natural environment when nutrient levels gradually decrease until becoming limiting for bacterial growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reference 16 should be cited are the first publication to show that glucose and other starvations induce DnaA degradation in Caulobacter.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Reference 16 to the first sentence of the Results section, in which we state that DnaA levels decrease when cells are shifted from a glucose-supplemented minimal medium to a glucose-limiting medium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1D shows that the TOEprint is not changed by adding the ribosome, very surprising considering its size and SD docking and alignment. 2 Minor bands then appear when the tRNA-Met is further added. These are presumably the &quot;toeprints&quot;. A control with just the added tRNA-Met would make this result much more significant.</p></disp-quote><p>In the existing literature, there is a common consensus to consider real toeprints (i.e., indicative of the presence of an assembled translation pre-initiation complex) as only those bands that appear faintly in the presence of the 30S ribosome subunit but that become clearly enhanced upon addition of the initiator tRNA-fMet. Some examples can be found in Hoekzema et al. 2019, Romilly 2014, Romilly 2020. In cases when the translation start site is buried in a structural element, the intensity of the toeprint signal is further increased when the mRNA is rendered unfolded, as seen in our data.</p><p>tRNA-30S-independent bands always show up in toeprint experiments, but their intensities differ with the sequence of the mRNA and sometimes the choice of RT used for primer extension. Addition of initiator tRNA-fMet alone is commonly not done in toeprint experiments (see references mentioned above). Finally, we want to point out again (see also our answer on “Problem 1”) that the toeprint data are very much consistent with our <italic>in silico</italic> predictions and our in vivo mutagenesis data. Therefore, we are confident that the observed toeprint upstream of the AUG corresponds to the true ribosome binding site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why does the cell OD drop, e.g. in Figure 2, is it cell death from starvation?</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t think that the slight reduction of OD<sub>600</sub> observed in our experiments is due to cell death. Based on our knowledge, carbon starved cells remain viable up to 24 hours after the starvation onset. Instead, we have observed a cell volume reduction, which may at least partially explain the observed OD<sub>600</sub> decrease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Line 327 Discussion &quot;This study reveals a new mechanism, by which some bacteria can regulate the synthesis of the replication initiator DnaA in response to nutrient availability by modulating the rate of translation.&quot; Rate of translation or rate of translation abortions (as implied in Figure 6)?</p></disp-quote><p>The rate of translation is the result of multiple contributions such as initiation, elongation, abortion and termination. Our data indicate that N<sub>t</sub> is a regulator of DnaA translation elongation responding specifically to the nutritional state of the cell. Translation abortion could be one of the possible outcomes (but not the only one) of ribosome stalling. For these reasons, in the new version of the manuscript, we added the word “elongation” at the end of the sentence mentioned by Reviewer 2 (line 354).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It seems that for most experiments with the eGFP the translation and protein decay components of the signal could have been easily uncoupled by running a parallel +chloramphenicol control. For example, this would simplify the interpretation of Figure 6 where Nt eGFP stabilities are an issue and it is important to establish that comparable protein stability with and without the Nt peptide.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s comment, we have now included a chloramphenicol control experiment (stability assay) performed with <italic>E. coli</italic> carrying the 5’UTR<italic><sub>dnaA</sub></italic>-N<sub>t</sub> reporter construct (Supplementary Figure 9A). Please, see the response above for more details. For the experiments with the <italic>Caulobacter</italic> 5’UTR<italic><sub>dnaA</sub></italic>-N<sub>t</sub> reporter we show in Supplementary Figure 7 that the N<sub>t</sub> peptide has no destabilising effect on eGFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p><italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> is a model bacterium that has provided many insights into bacterial physiology that are now exploited to understand many organisms.
