In general the system trains more PhDs and postdocs than can be employed as independent group leaders, PIs or university lecturers, so the competition for these positions can be intense. The present authors know this first-hand because we all started in such positions at universities in the UK between 2015 and 2018. Moreover, we know that new group leaders, PIs and university lecturers face a wide range of challenges as they seek to establish their research groups and undertake new responsibilities in their department or institute.</p><p>In this article we will use the term PI as a short-hand for independent group leader, principal investigator or university lecturer. There are several routes to becoming a PI in the UK. The two most frequent are: i) recruitment as a permanent lecturer (subject to passing probation) at a university; ii) recruitment as a fixed-term research fellow at a university or research institute (funded directly by a university, or externally by research councils and charities). There are pros and cons associated with both routes: lecturers typically have long-term job security, but externally-funded research fellows can often establish their research programme faster than lecturers.</p><p>To explore how new PIs are recruited, supported and evaluated, we conducted a survey of PIs appointedin the UK between 2012 and 2018. This article reports the results of this survey, discusses what it tells about the hopes and concerns of new PIs in the UK, makes recommendations to employers and funders to address some of these concerns, and concludes with advice for those hoping to become a new PI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our survey is described in detail in the Methods section. In summary, the survey was completed by 365 individuals who had become PIs over the past six years: 83% worked in the life sciences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), 57% were male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), 51% were from the UK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and 84% classified themselves as white (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46827.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of cohort demographics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 83% (302/365) of respondents classified themselves as being in the Life Sciences (LifeSci); 16% (59/365) were in the Physical Sciences and Engineering (Ph/Eng); and 1% (4/365) were from in the Social Sciences and Humanities (Soc/Hu).

This seven-year period likely reflects the eligibility restrictions that were in place for some fellowships until recently, and it will be interesting to see if the recent decision by many funders to remove such restrictions has an influence on the time taken for PhDs to become PIs.</p><p>A longer time spent as a postdoctoral researcher may allow some individuals the extra time needed to complete and publish ambitious or collaborative projects. However, it might also increase the average age at which researchers become independent (which is 34 years old for the respondents to our survey; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and this would increase the length of time during which postdocs have to balance starting a family with the pressures imposed by fixed-term contracts and the need to show mobility.</p><p>With regard to families, half of our cohort had dependents, female investigators had taken the longest career breaks and were the most likely to have dependants, and almost everyone (361/365) worked full time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>International mobility plays a key role in the academic career path. 51% of respondents had spent more than one year training outside of the UK as postdocs, and 67% had undertaken at least one international move as part of their career (either when moving between their PhD and postdoc, or when moving from a postdoc to a PI position in the UK; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

However, 24% (79/330) were either dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with their space and facilities, compared with 56% (185/330) who were satisfied or very satisfied.

Flexible or part-time working is often put forward as a way to improve work-life balance but, as noted above, just four of the respondents worked part-time. Given all the challenges associated with being a new PI – find funding, build a research group, publish work, prepare and give lectures – it is not surprising that practically no one works part-time.</p><p>The pressures of being a new PI are best expressed in this direct quotation from one respondent: “I feel like I'm trying to do three separate jobs (research, management/admin, teaching) as well as be a mother... be my own postdoc (because I can't afford one), be the lab technician (because I can't afford one), be the lab manager (because I can't afford one...), be a good mentor for my students, plan strategy, write grants (constantly, I need the money), stay up to date with other research, prepare new teaching material (this takes me ages, I want to do a good job), teach, mark assessments and answer student queries etc. I could go on. No, seriously, is it even possible?”.</p><p>Clearly there is a need to find other mechanisms to improve the work-life balance besides offering part-time/flexible working patterns. However, despite elements of dissatisfaction, it is important to highlight over 50% of respondents were optimistic for the future (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This highlights a strong resilience and positivity amongst new PIs as they tackle the various demands of their role. It was also encouraging to find that having dependants did not affect satisfaction ratings or optimism scores for new male or female PIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Career track comparison and gender disparity</title><p>As previously mentioned, there is no single route to becoming a PI in the UK. Typically, two career paths exist: (a) appointment as a lecturer, possibly followed by promotion to senior lecturer, then reader and lastly professor; (b) appointment as a research fellow, possibly followed by an advanced fellowship or a transfer to the lecturer career path. 41% of our respondents were on the lecturer career path, with 59% on the research fellow path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The research fellows secured funding from a range of bodies and 70% of respondents were from 24 research-focused institutions, referred to as the Russell group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

In particular, male PIs are much more likely to have secured additional funding in excess of £1 m (p=0.025), and female PIs were awarded significantly fewer grants (p=0.039). Compared to new female PIs, it looks as if new male PIs were better able to gain momentum and accelerate through continued grant success, allowing them to build critical mass expanding the numbers in their labs. We should delve deeper into this issue and ensure that new female PIs are being encouraged and supported to apply for more funding and to build their teams in the same way as new male PIs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46827.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Gender comparisons in pay and grant income.</title><p>All plots are expressed as the percentage of respondents within each category.

Although the number of contact hours was significantly less than the number for lecturers, nearly 40% of research fellows were expected to have more than 10 contact hours with undergraduates per year, and 10–15%, were expected to have more than 40 contact hours per year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). There is an argument that research fellows should engage with their departments, bring new material to undergraduate courses, and participate in some level of teaching early in their independent careers: moreover, if the new PI hopes to be appointed as a lecturer in the longer term, gaining teaching experience will be beneficial. However, having to give more than 40 hr of lectures and tutorials is excessive for a new research fellow, so we suggest that all funders should consider specifying a limit on teaching hours. Some funders already apply limits, but these data suggest there is a lack of enforcement by either the fellow or the institution.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46827.020</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Teaching and administration load.</title><p>All plots are expressed as the percentage of respondents within each category. (<bold>A</bold>) Almost all (119/121) new PIs appointed as lecturers are expected to teach, along with 60% (100/167) of new PIs appointed as fellows.

These statistics suggest female PIs are over-committing themselves and/or are more frequently tasked with non-research roles than male PIs.

While one might assume that such a fellow would be appointed as a lecturer (or higher on the academic career ladder) at their host university when their fellowship ended, 70% of research fellows did not have an agreement for such a 'proleptic appointment' in place with their host university (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, 58% were unaware of what they had to do to get a permanent position or how their host institution or department went about making such decisions. Since these fellows are hired by universities on contracts which are dependent on the funding source, they can be made redundant at the end of the fellowship with little consequence. These fellows do not have job security despite supporting their own salary, bringing in large grants, passing stringent external selection processes and, on the whole, being more likely to contribute to the research excellence framework (REF: this is the process through which university research is assessed in order to determine the future level of government funding). We would encourage funders to address this issue in order to protect their investment in these researchers.</p><p>Some of our respondents were extremely critical about these matters. “Career progression is very non-transparent” said one, “Vague descriptions of the areas in which excellence is required, but no idea of the level equivalent to excellence. Getting a proleptic appointment is very difficult.” A second commented as follows: “It is widely believed that if you have funded your own salary from grants for seven years then the school should take you on as a full-time lecturer.

However, when we plot the percentage of male and female respondents against year of appointment, we find a spike in the number of male researchers appointed as new PIs in 2013 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We feel it is likely that this spike was caused by a wave of recruitment ahead of REF2014. The next REF will be in 2021. Each REF tends to be preceded by a 'transfer window' in which new academic staff are appointed and established staff sometimes move between universities. However, it is extremely clear from our data that the wave of new appointments before REF2014 significantly favoured male applicants. It seems likely to us that this wave of male recruitment may have been due to an increase in direct head-hunting, or more informal recruitment techniques driven by networks within fields, and that these practices seem to favour men. We urge institutions to ensure that female academics are not disadvantaged in this way ahead of REF2021.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46827.030</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Recruitment of men and women by year.</title><p>The gap between the number of men and women appointed as new PIs seems to have narrowed in recent years (with the gap being eight in 2012 and just one in 2017 and 2018), with the very noticeable exception of 2013, when 47 men and 21 women were appointed.

The majority of those responding were in the life sciences, in part because of the networks that the survey was circulated around, and partly due to the language used in the survey (the term PI does not have the same meaning in the social sciences, for instance). We do not claim that this is a fully representative sample. However, the sample has a similar gender and nationality breakdown to those reported for the sciences elsewhere (e.g., by the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/23-02-2017/departmental-demographics-academic-staff">Higher Education Statistics Agency</ext-link> in the UK), and we do feel that it allows us to say important things about at least a significant subgroup of new PIs in the UK.</p><p>A pilot version of the survey was originally run with 10–12 volunteers recruited via the UK_NewPI slack group.

The revised survey with full questions can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. The survey was distributed, through the authors networks, via the NewPI slack (both UK and US), the eLife ambassadors mailing list, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

Ordinal regression allowed us to control for multiple factors, to be more sure that the relationship that we found was not a result of (at least measured) confounding factors, for ordinal outcome variables.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by myself (Emma Pewsey) and the eLife Features Editor, Peter Rodgers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Amanda N Sferruzzi-Perri (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While the list of points to address may seem long and will require major revision of the article, we feel that they will greatly benefit the clarity of the article, and its ability to influence decision-makers. We hope you will be able to submit the revised version within two months.</p><p>SUMMARY OF MANUSCRIPT</p><p>This is an important and timely topic that should get major spotlight and we congratulate the authors for deciding to tackle it. The paper does a good job of identifying the major struggles of new PIs, and makes some suggestions for how PIs, host institutions and funding agencies can help to prevent these struggles. The opportunity that the findings present to influence senior academics and other decision makers therefore make it crucial that this manuscript is of excellent quality and that it leads to clear conclusions about why and how the situation should change.</p><p>LIST OF REQUIRED REVISIONS</p><p>GENERAL</p><p>1. There are a number of incorrect citations (for example, the in-text citations for the panels of Figure 10 are labelled as Figure 9, and a citation to 14F appears to be for 14G). Also, the 4th sentence in the caption to figure 13 should start: &quot;Fellows (D) and Lecturers (E) were then.. . &quot;. Please check and correct the text and figure captions for issues like these. Please also ensure that all in-text discussion of data that's presented in a figure cites that figure.</p><p>2. Please present the findings in a more neutral manner. For example, instead of making a broad statement such as &quot;too many new investigators express frustration&quot;, please report on the percentages who are frustrated.</p><p>PRESENTATION OF FIGURES</p><p>3. The article will be easier to read if the number of figures is reduced. eLife allows the figures in a paper to have figure supplements; the figures appear in both the online and pdf versions; the figure supplements only appear in the online version, but the figure caption makes it clear that the figure supplement are available online. Please combine figures and convert some panels into figure supplements as suggested below.</p><p>4. Some panels are not discussed in the text (2C, 6A, 6B, 6D, 6E, 7A, 7B, 9C, 10A, 13B, 13C, 14D, 14E, 14F, 14I, 15A); please either i) delete these or ii) convert them to figure supplements (and make sure they are cited somewhere in the text or the relevant figure caption).</p><p>5. The results of yes/no questions (5A, 5B, 5C, 6C, 10B, 10C, 10D, 10E, 12A, 12B, 13A, 14A, 14B) would be better presented by stating the percentage of respondents who answered yes in the text and/or figure caption, and citing the appropriate section of your supporting data file.</p><p>6. Please include y-axes and keys for figures where these are missing (including Figures 3, 4, 11).</p><p>7. Figure panels 14G and H show the same data, so please convert one to a figure supplement. Also, for 14G, please adjust the y-axis scaling to make it possible to see the data that supports the statement in the text about start-up funds &quot;in the region of £20-60K&quot;.</p><p>8. Please ensure that the order of the figures matches the order in which they are cited/mentioned in the text.</p><p>RESULTS</p><p>9. Please present the results of the statistical tests for all the data shown; for example, this is missing from comparisons between female and male PIs and/or lecturers and researcher fellows. Please state the types of statistical tests run for each piece of presented data, with details on how certain confounders were controlled for, as well as detailing any corresponding statistical outcomes.</p><p>10. The first sentence of the results states that '...365 respondents represents a significant proportion of new group leaders in the UK.' To support this comment, please state the number of new group leaders in the UK for the period corresponding to the results presented.</p><p>11. Please rephrase the final sentence for the second paragraph of the results ('There has been some discussion... in redressing the balance') to make its meaning clearer.</p><p>12. Please clarify what Figure 2B represents by describing it in the figure legend; you may also wish to add further clarification in the main text. Should the values for women and men add to 100%? Does this graph show only those that had dependents/caring responsibilities? Does '0' for length of break mean the individual had a dependent but took 0 months off from work? What is the mean and median for the data for each gender? How does this relate to the number of dependents per respondent? Furthermore, the panel shows possibly 1 or 2 men taking very long periods of leave, which does not appear to support the statement in the text that '... fathers are also taking significant periods of leave and sharing childcare responsibilities.' Please clarify.</p><p>13. Please provide the data supporting the following sentence: 'It was also encouraging to find that having dependents did not affect satisfaction ratings or optimism scores for either females or males'; the data presented is not separated by sex.</p><p>14. Instead of stating that the proportion of lecturers to research fellows captured in the study was roughly equal, please state the exact percentages.</p><p>15. The comments about research fellows being based at Russell group universities (bottom of page 3) seems to reflect that these universities first recruit individuals as research fellows (rather than as lecturers), as shown in Figure 5D. Please discuss this in the text.</p><p>16. Could the data presented in Fig 8 and 15 also relate to when career breaks may occur for a women (which we know are for longer periods)? Was information collected about the timing of leave with regard to the trajectory of the respondent's career paths? In regards to 8C, could this be related to men asking for more money for each grant compared to women? Could a calculation be made to determine whether the amount awarded per grant varied between women and men?</p><p>17. Based on the data presented in 9B and C, women have the larger loads for teaching and committees. Please discuss this, as these data may be related to the finding that women also secure fewer grants and have small lab sizes - as they are simply over-committing themselves to, or are more commonly tasked with, non-research activities.</p><p>18. The sentence 'New PIs should also be aware that supervision of master's students and PhD students would also count as teaching contribution', is not strictly true for all universities. There are differences in what universities classify as part of a teaching load.</p><p>19. Please check that the data presented in 10C does correspond to the sentence stating 'Nearly 18% of externally funded fellows reported not having an.. .'.</p><p>20. The statement '...participated by submitting projects to up to 5-6 in some cases (Fig 14C).' does not agree with the data shown in Figure 14C.</p><p>21. Please show the data that supports the statement that '...lecturers were the least satisfied with worklife balance compared to research fellows'.</p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVED SUPPORT OF NEW PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS</p><p>22. Many of the advice points are not related to issues arising from the data. It would instead be more compelling to discuss recommendations directly related to the data and/or to discuss sources that may support the potential effectiveness of these solutions. The article would also be strengthened by more recommendations that new PIs can act on regardless of host support. For example when mentioning that mentorship to new PIs is not ideal, you could direct readers to resources for effective use of mentorship.</p><p>23. For the actions by host institutions, could you recommend anything related to the observations that there are clear gender differences in salary and start-ups, as well as recruitment around the REF?</p><p>24. Please explain the rationale for suggesting different grades for research fellows and university-funded fellows (action points 7 and 8 for host institutions).</p><p>METHODS AND SUPPORTING DATA</p><p>25. Please expand the methods section to give full details of the nature of the items included in the survey and explain why these were chosen, the pilot testing and revision process, the specific definition of the sought respondents, and the recruitment strategy used. Please also refer the reader to the document of the final survey questions.</p><p>26. Please provide a supporting data file that clearly states the number and percentages of respondents to each option in the survey, broken down by gender and lecturer/fellow as appropriate.</p><p>[Editors' note: further editorial revisions were requested prior to acceptance, and these revisions resulted in changes to the numbering of the figures.]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46827.037</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We repeat the reviewers’ points here in italic, and include our replies point by point, as well as a description of the changes made, in Roman.</p><p>GENERAL</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

Please show the data that supports the statement that '...lecturers were the least satisfied with worklife balance compared to research fellows'.</p></disp-quote><p>REPLY: This is now shown in a new figure supplement - NEW Figure 9 - figure supplement 1</p><p>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVED SUPPORT OF NEW PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22. Many of the advice points are not related to issues arising from the data. It would instead be more compelling to discuss recommendations directly related to the data and/or to discuss sources that may support the potential effectiveness of these solutions. The article would also be strengthened by more recommendations that new PIs can act on regardless of host support. For example when mentioning that mentorship to new PIs is not ideal, you could direct readers to resources for effective use of mentorship.</p></disp-quote><p>REPLY: Please see tracked changes, we note that peer-peer mentorship can be extremely important and an excellent source of support.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23. For the actions by host institutions, could you recommend anything related to the observations that there are clear gender differences in salary and start-ups, as well as recruitment around the REF?</p></disp-quote><p>REPLY: Having discussed this with our host departments this is a very difficult issue to address, as they require a degree of flexibility in starting salary in order to recruit their favoured candidates who may have other offers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24. Please explain the rationale for suggesting different grades for research fellows and university-funded fellows (action points 7 and 8 for host institutions).</p></disp-quote><p>REPLY: University funded fellowships are generally a scheme to bring in potential candidates for career development fellowships, so within our peer group this is generally viewed as a stepping stone towards independence which is solidified when external funding is awarded.</p><p>METHODS AND SUPPORTING DATA</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25.
