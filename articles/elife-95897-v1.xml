Emerging studies in mice indicate a dynamic change of the myometrial epigenome and transcriptome during pregnancy to ready the contractile machinery for parturition. However, the regulatory systems underlying myometrial gene expression patterns throughout gestation remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated human term pregnant nonlabor myometrial biopsies for transcriptome, enhancer histone mark cistrome, and chromatin conformation pattern mapping. More than thirty thousand putative enhancers with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 double positive marks were identified in the myometrium. Enriched transcription factor binding motifs include known myometrial regulators AP-1, STAT, NFkB, and PGR among others. Putative myometrial super enhancers are mostly colocalized with progesterone receptor-occupying sites and preferentially associated with highly expressing genes, suggesting a conserved role of PGR in regulating the myometrial transcriptome between species. In human myometrial specimens, inferred PGR activities are positively correlated with phospholipase C like 2 (<italic>PLCL2</italic>) mRNA levels, supporting that PGR may act through this genomic region to promote <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression. PGR overexpression facilitated <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene expression in myometrial cells. Using CRISPR activation, we assessed the functionality of a PGR putative enhancer 35 kilobases upstream of the contractile-restrictive gene <italic>PLCL2</italic>. In summary, the results of this study serve as a resource to study gene regulatory mechanisms in the human myometrium at the term pregnancy stage for further advancing women’s health research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myometrium</kwd><kwd>Progesterone</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z1AES103311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeMayo</surname><given-names>Francesco J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Gaine Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRF-2018-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH Intramural Training Program Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quiroz</surname><given-names>Elvis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIEHS Scholar Connect Program Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montague Redecke</surname><given-names>Skylar G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-wide epigenetic profiling reveals chromatin regions in the human myometrium involved in functional regulation and hormonal control during pregnancy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The myometrium is the muscular component of the uterus. Throughout gestation, the myometrium maintains contractile quiescence until labor, where uterine contractility facilitates parturition. Pre-term birth, often characterized by aberrant myometrial activity before term, results in the termination of pregnancy prior to 37 weeks gestation. Complications associated with pre-term birth account for 35% of neonatal death and contribute to lifelong physical and socioeconomic multi-morbidities to surviving neonates and mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chawanpaiboon et al., 2019</xref>). It is therefore critical to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance and shift of myometrial quiescence throughout gestation.</p><p>The myometrium undergoes extensive structural and functional remodeling in preparation for parturition through genomic regulatory mechanisms which influence gene expression throughout pregnancy. Major transcription factor families have been identified to contribute throughout the remodeling process. Studies on the role of steroid hormone receptors in myometrial remodeling suggest that the withdrawal of functional progesterone signaling at term results from a stoichiometric shift favoring the PGR-A isoform over PGR-B. This shift is associated with increased activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) expression at term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mesiano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Merlino et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muter et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex subunits have been observed to act as PGR coregulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2003</xref>) and have dynamic expression patterns throughout gestation in both humans and rodent models. For example, FOS:JUN heterodimers are implicated to be critical for the initiation of labor through transcriptional regulation of gap junction proteins such as Gja1 (Gap junction alpha 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mitchell and Lye, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mitchell and Lye, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balducci et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Contributing to the dynamic nature of the myometrial transcriptome during term is the epigenome and its reprogramming. Studies investigating epigenetic markers related to gene activation in the mouse myometrium have revealed that the promoters for contractility-driving genes, such as Gja1, are epigenetically activated well before the onset of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shchuka et al., 2020</xref>). Considering this, the myometrial epigenome’s role in parturition disorders, such as preterm birth, has thus been under investigation. For example, it is known that altered DNA methylation is linked with preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barcelona de Mendoza et al., 2017</xref>), including at the promoters of genes associated with myometrial contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erickson et al., 2023</xref>) and fetal membrane rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). However, differential myometrial DNA methylation at CpG islands in the promoters of contractility-driving genes is not thought to be a major contributor to preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mitsuya et al., 2014</xref>). Given that DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation often occurs outside of CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Irizarry et al., 2009</xref>), there is still work to be done at this interface. Regardless, whether through epigenetic or transcriptomic gene regulatory programs, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of genes critical for myometrial reprogramming and quiescent maintenance are still poorly understood.</p><p>In this study, we aim to improve our understanding of the cellular processes involved in shaping the myometrium’s dynamic state of quiescence at pregnancy through the epigenetic and transcriptomic profiling of the human myometrium. Because of the relevance of genomic regulatory mechanisms in coordinating myometrial activity, we identified candidate cis-acting regulatory regions using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) assays of surrogate histone enhancer markers H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>) and H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>) alongside chromatin conformation capture assays in term pregnant myometrial tissues. Using this data, we investigated cis-acting regulatory regions for the gene phospholipase C like 2<italic>,</italic> which encodes for the protein PLCL2 and has been implicated in the modulation of calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Uji et al., 2002</xref>) and maintenance of myometrial quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peavey et al., 2021</xref>). Putative enhancers upstream of the PLCL2 transcriptional start site were subjected to functional assessment using CRISPR activation-based assays. Here, we identified a genomic region 35 kilobases upstream of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcriptional start site involved in <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we aimed to characterize this genomic region through the identification of candidate <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcriptional regulators co-localizing with this cis-acting element using integrative cistrome and transcriptome analysis and have demonstrated PGR to be a direct regulator for <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression. These findings build upon our understanding of myometrial remodeling throughout gestation and will be pertinent for the development of medical interventions aiming to address pre-term birth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epigenomic landscape in term pregnant myometrial specimens</title><p>To better understand the regulatory network shaping the myometrial transcriptome before labor, we analyzed transcriptome and putative enhancers in individual human myometrial specimens. Using RNA-seq, we identified actively expressed RNAs, while ChIP-seq for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 was used to map putative enhancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Active genes were associated with nearby putative enhancers based on their genomic proximity. Additionally, chromatin looping patterns were mapped using Hi-C to further link active genes and putative enhancers within the same chromatin loops (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The ChIP-seq assay identified an average of 44,238 H3K27ac and 74,325 H3K4me1-positive genomic regions in three term-pregnant, nonlabor myometrial biopsies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). An RNA-Seq assay revealed an average of 12,157 active genes in these specimens that manifested expression levels of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) greater than or equal to 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). A High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (Hi-C) assay further found a total of 27,162 chromatin loops from two of the three myometrial specimens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, subject 1 and 3). We failed to identify chromatin loops in the second subject’s biopsy due to limited sample availability. Together, these results delineate a map of H3K27ac and H3K4me1-positive signals in the human term pregnant myometrial tissue before the onset of labor, which we use as a resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms that prepare the myometrium for subsequent parturition.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Epigenome and transcriptome profile of the individual myometrium biopsy.</title><p>Active genes are defined as FPKM ≥1.

However, significant variations in the number and location of H3K27ac-positive intervals are present across the six samples among these two studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Depending on the number of mapped intervals, the 8563 common regions constitute between 20.7% and 71.5% of total H3K27ac-positive intervals across the six myometrial specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the fraction of intervals commonly identified in the present study’s three specimens ranges between 56.4% and 70.0% of each of their total H3K27ac-positive regions, while the Dotts dataset has a wider range between 28.0% and 74.0%. With a less stringent criterium, most of the H3K27ac-positive intervals are found in at least two samples, ranging between 75.4% and 98.3% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data together highlight the degree of variation in mapping the epigenome among specimens and datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Putative enhancers for gene regulation in the human myometrium</title><p>Since H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marked genome regions are associated with enhancers for gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>), we define the regions that have overlapping H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks as putative myometrial enhancers at the term pregnant nonlabor stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Among the three specimens, 13,114 putative enhancers are commonly present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A significant variance in the location of myometrial putative enhancers is also seen among biopsies as evident by the observation that these common putative enhancers make up less than half of the total putative enhancers in each individual specimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). More than one-third of these 13,114 common putative enhancers are located within a 100-kilobase vicinity of actively high-expressing genes (FPKM≥15), while a much smaller fraction of them (13.3%) are associated with actively low-expressing genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Motif enrichment analysis on these common putative enhancers further reveals an overrepresentation of binding motifs for myometrial transcription factors AP-1, STAT5, and NFκB, steroid hormone receptors PGR and NR3C1, and smooth muscle transcription regulators SRF and ELK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

Shchuka and colleagues utilize the mouse model to show that the myometrial epigenome is readily programed for parturition-associated gene induction days ahead of the term pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shchuka et al., 2020</xref>), laying the ground for subsequent laboring events. We chose to study the human myometrium at the term pregnant nonlabor stage in order to examine the association between the epigenome landscape and the gene expression pattern not only for preparing the myometrium for parturition, but also for maintaining myometrial quiescence. We also performed a multi-omic study on a myometrial specimen from each individual human subject to better align all the datasets together, reflecting specimen and subject individuality. While the variation among specimens is substantial, we were able to identify myometrial cis-acting elements commonly shared among three individuals. As a proof of principle, we subsequently used this information to functionally screen for genomic regions that may mediate the regulation of the contractile-suppressing gene <italic>PLCL2</italic>. The H3K27ac marked 35-kilobase upstream region as a result of the screening then serves as a bridge to identify PGR as one of the upstream regulators for modulating <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene expression in human myometrium. These findings showcase the value of these datasets as a resource for future investigations on the mechanisms of myometrial gene regulation.</p><p>Variations across cistromic datasets for the human myometrium are significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dotts et al., 2023</xref>). Contributing factors likely include but are not limited to subject-to-subject differences and batch effects from sample preparations. Taking the H3K27ac marked genomic regions as an example, regions commonly identified in the specimens of this study’s three subjects account for 55.9%, 67.7%, and 57.9% of total H3K27ac-positive intervals in each individual sample, despite our best attempt to reduce the batch effect. Heterogeneity in cell type compositions, likely due to the sampling location, could be a major contributing factor to the variation. It is also speculated that the genomic regions with subject-to-subject variances could be transiently present, and thus, the signal could not be captured across samples. In addition, the underlying health conditions, medications, and environmental challenges among others may also affect the epigenomic profile. Variations could also arise from differences in the detection threshold. We identified an average of 44,238 H3K27ac marked regions per specimen, while Dotts and colleagues found nearly 19,000 per sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dotts et al., 2023</xref>). Reagent and sample handling could confound with biological variances of specimens, leading to this difference. Future investigations using standardized sample preparation protocols at the single-cell resolution may help to reduce this variation.</p><p>Results from the CRISPRa-based Perturb-Seq assay demonstrate the capability of this technology to screen for cis-acting elements that are in topological vicinity of the gene of interest. This assay is particularly useful on genes that are expressed at low levels in the screening platform, that is the cells. The dCas9VPR activator can generate satisfactory signal-to-noise ratios to be detected by single-cell RNAseq. The advantage of assaying with this system is that each individual cell serves as a container to generate data points instead of relying on multiple wells on cell culture plates. Multiplexing with multiple gRNAs can be achieved by using the gRNA sequence as a unique barcode of the cell, enabling the simultaneous collection of numerous data points for each individual gRNA. In the present study, 56.7% of tested cells carried one species of detectable gRNAs, permitting the study of the resulting effect under a single gRNA. Moreover, another 27.0% of assayed cells have more than one species of detectable gRNAs, which opens the possibility to study interactions between different cis-acting elements. However, we failed to use this approach for the purpose of identifying target genes of a putative enhancer of interest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Challenges such as difficulties in defining the criteria of the associated genes and unsatisfactory signal-to-noise ratios on genes already at high baseline levels should be considered in future experimental designs.

Reverse transcription of mRNA and cDNA amplification were carried out following the manufacturer’s instruction (10 x Genomics, Cat. 1000268, Cat. 1000262 with 10 x Genomics protocol CG000316). The amplified cDNA was separated into CRISPR-sgRNA-derived cDNA and transcriptome-derived cDNA. The CRISPR-sgRNA-derived cDNA was used to make NGS sequencing libraries.

These data provide a useful resource for further evaluation of gene regulatory mechanisms in the myometrium and include the first Hi-C data published for this tissue. There is a comparison to previously published histone modification data and integration with RNA-seq to highlight potential enhancer-gene regulatory relationships. The authors further investigate putative enhancers upstream of the PLCL2 gene and identify a candidate region that may be regulated by the PGR (progesterone receptor) signaling.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strengths of this study are in the multi-omics nature of the design as several genome-wide data sets are generated from the same patient samples. Extending this type of approach in the future to a larger number of samples will allow for additional investigation into gene regulation as correlation between epigenomic features and gene expression across a larger number of samples can reveal regulatory relationships.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One of the most interesting aspects of this study is the generation of the first Hi-C data for the human pregnant myometrium, however, there is minimal description in the results section of the Hi-C data analysis and the only data shown are the number of loops identified and one such loop that includes the PLCL2 promoter shown in figure 3A. The manuscript would benefit from a more extensive analysis of the Hi-C data, for example, the analysis of TADs (topological associating domains) would be interesting to add and could be used to evaluate to what extent H3K27ac domains and putative regulated genes fall within the same TAD.</p><p>The authors present some convincing evidence on the transcriptional regulation of the PLCL2 gene using Perturb-Seq to identify putative upstream enhancer regions and PGR over-expression showing PGR can act as an activator. These two experiments on their own are interesting, however, they are not as mechanistically integrated as they could be to clarify the molecular mechanisms. Deletion of the putative enhancer upstream of PLCL2 followed by over-expression of PGR would clarify the mechanistic relationship between the proposed enhancer, PGR and PLCL2 expression. Does PGR act through the proposed enhancer? In addition, reporter assays using this proposed enhancer region with and without increased expression of PGR and mutation of any PRE sequences would also provide mechanistic insight. Although CRISPRa and Perturb-Seq can be used to identify potential regulatory regions, the best approach to verify the requirement for a particular enhancer in regulating a specific gene is a deletion approach.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have addressed my comments that were directly sent to them, however, my comments in the public review, specifically the superficial nature of the Hi-C analysis were not addressed.</p><p>In addition, many of the comments to reviewer 3 were unaddressed and declared out of the scope of this study, as these were points of accuracy in the data analysis they are very much in scope.</p><p>I hope the authors reconsider presenting a more thorough analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95897.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript, Wu et al. investigate active H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks in term pregnant nonlabor myometrial biopsies, linking putative enhancers and super enhancers to gene expression levels. Through their findings, they reveal the PGR-dependent regulation of the PLCL2 gene in human myometrial cells via a cis-acting element located 35-kilobases upstream of the PLCL2 gene. By targeting this region using a CRISPR activation system, they were able to increase the elevate the endogenous PLCL2 mRNA levels in immortalized human myometrial cells.</p><p>This research offers novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing gene expression in myometrial tissues, advancing our understanding of pregnancy-related processes.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) A more comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic and transcriptomic data would have strengthened the paper, moving beyond basic association studies.

Such a small sample size (N = 3) limits the statistical power of the study. As mentioned in the manuscript they failed to identify chromatin loops in the second subject's biopsy is observed due to a limited sample.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment about the sample size. We sincerely hope the result of this study would increase the interest of stakeholders to fund future projects in a larger scale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure quality: There is a lack of good representations of the results (e.g., screenshots of tables as figure panels!) as well as missing interpretations that might add value to the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1B and 2B have been converted to the pie chart format.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Definition of super-enhancer: The definition of super-enhancer is not clear. Also, the computational merging of enhancers to define super-enhancers should be described better.</p></disp-quote><p>Added more details about tool and parameter setting in the Method section of “Identification of super enhancers”:</p><p>“Identification of super enhancers</p><p>H3K27ac-positive enhancers were defined as regions of H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks in each sample. The enhancers within 12.5Kb were merged by using bedtools merge function with parameter “-d 12500”. The combined enhancer regions were called super enhancers if they were larger than 15Kb. The common super enhancers from multiple samples were used for downstream analysis.”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Whyte WA, Orlando DA, Hnisz D, Abraham BJ, Lin CY, Kagey MH, Rahl PB, Lee TI, Young RA.

These limitations should be addressed properly to avoid false-positive results and improve the interpretability of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>The major limitations of the CRISPRa-based Perturb-Seq protocol in this study are the use of the hTERT-HM cells and the two-vector system for transduction. While hTERT-HM cells are a much easier platform in terms of technical operation, primary human myometrial cells are generally considered retaining a molecular context that is closer to the in vivo tissues. Due to the limitation on the efficiency of having two vectors simultaneously present in the same cell, hTERT-HM cells are much more affordable and operationally feasible to conduct the experiment. Future advancements on the increase of viral vector payload capacity may overcome this challenge and open the venue to perform the assay on primary human myometrial cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Sample collection and comparison: There is mention of matched gravid term and non-gravid samples whereas no description or use of control samples was found in the results. Also, the comparison of non-labor samples with labor samples would provide a better understanding of epigenomic and transcriptomic events of myometrium leading to laboring events.</p></disp-quote><p>The description has been updated:</p><p>“Collection of myometrial specimens</p><p>Permission to collect human tissue specimens was prospectively obtained from individuals undergoing hysterectomy or cesarean section for benign clinical indications (H-33461).

This needs clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>In RNA-seq analysis, the gene expression levels are often quantified using FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads). Setting a threshold of FPKM for defining &quot;active&quot; genes in RNA-seq analysis is biologically relevant, because it helps to distinguish between genuinely expressed genes and background noise. It helps researchers focus on genes, which are more likely to have a significant biological impact. A common threshold for defining &quot;active&quot; genes is FPKM ≥ 1. Genes with FPKM values below this threshold may be transcribed at very low levels or could be background noise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6d) The understanding of differentially methylated genes at promoters is underrated as per the authors. But, why leaving DNA methylation apart, they selected histone modification as the basis of epigenetic reprogramming in terms of myometrium is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>DNA methylation indeed plays a crucial role in evaluating the impact of cis-acting elements on gene regulation. Large-scale studies, such as the comprehensive analysis of the myometrial methylome landscape in human biopsies (Paul et al., JCI Insight, 2022, PMID: 36066972), have provided valuable insights. When integrated with histone modification and chromatin looping data, contributed by our group and collaborators, future secondary analyses leveraging machine learning are poised to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying myometrial transcriptional regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6e) How does the identification of PGR as an upstream regulator of PLCL2 gene expression in human myometrial cells contribute to our understanding of progesterone signaling in myometrial function?</p></disp-quote><p>In a previous study, we demonstrated a positive correlation between <italic>PLCL2</italic> and <italic>PGR</italic> expression in a mouse model and identified PLCL2's role in negatively modulating oxytocin-induced myometrial cell contraction (Peavy et al., PNAS, 2021, PMID: 33707208). The present study builds on this by providing evidence for a direct regulatory mechanism in which PGR influences <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcription, likely through a cis-acting element located 35 kb upstream. These findings suggest that PLCL2 acts as a mediator of PGR-dependent myometrial quiescence prior to labor, rather than merely participating in a parallel pathway. Further in vivo studies are necessary to delineate the extent to which PLCL2 mediates PGR activity, particularly the contraction-dampening function of the PGR-B isoform.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Grammatical error: The manuscript has numerous grammatical errors.

Rather than simply listing approaches and end results in Table 1, offer concise explanations for the experiments alongside the supporting data presented in detailed figures. Using appropriate figures/graphs to effectively contextualize these datasets would be greatly appreciated by readers and would add more value to this research. Currently, it is difficult for us to assess and appreciate the quality of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>The following statement is included in the beginning of the Result section:</p><p>&quot;To better understand the regulatory network shaping the myometrial transcriptome before labor, we analyzed transcriptome and putative enhancers in individual human myometrial specimens. Using RNA-seq, we identified actively expressed RNAs, while ChIP-seq for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 was used to map putative enhancers. Active genes were associated with nearby putative enhancers based on their genomic proximity. Additionally, chromatin looping patterns were mapped using Hi-C to further link active genes and putative enhancers within the same chromatin loops.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The statistics for every sequencing approach need to be provided for each sample (e.g., RNA-seq: number of total reads, number of mapped reads, % of mapped reads; ChIP-Seq: number of mapped reads, % of mapped reads, % of duplicates).</p></disp-quote><p>We have generated the summary table of each dataset included in this study (Dataset S7) [NGS-summary.xls].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure S1: The rationale behind comparing the Dotts study and yours regarding H3K27ac-positive regions needs to be better defined. Why is this performed if the data will not be used afterwards? What are the conserved regions associated with vs the ones that are variable? Is this biologically relevant? Why not use only the regions conserved between the 6 samples, to have more robust conclusions?</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of comparing our data with the Dotts dataset is to highlight the degree of variation across studies. In this study, we focused on addressing specific biological questions using our own dataset rather than developing methodologies for meta-analysis. Future advancements in meta-analysis techniques could leverage the combined power of multiple datasets to provide deeper insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Perhaps due to a lack of details, I am unable to ascertain how the putative myometrial enhancers were defined. In Dataset S1, it is stated, &quot;we define the regions that have overlapping H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks as putative myometrial enhancers at the term pregnant nonlabor stage (Dataset S1)&quot;. Within Dataset S1, for subjects 1, 2, and 3, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 double-positive enhancers are shown in term pregnant, non-labor human myometrial specimens, with approximately 100 regions corresponding to 131 (sample 1), 127 (sample 2), and 140 (sample 3) common peaks. However, in Figure 1a, reference is made to the 13114 putative enhancers commonly present across the three specimens. Is Dataset S1 intended to represent only a small fraction of the 13114 putative enhancers? Detailed analyses need to be conducted and better showcased.</p></disp-quote><p>Dataset S1 has been updated to list all 13,114 putative enhancers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) For the gene expression analyses of RNA-seq data, FPKM values were utilized. However, it is unclear why the gene expression count matrix was normalized based on the ratio of total mapped read pairs in each sample to 56.5 million for the term myometrial specimens. I would recommend exercising caution regarding the use of FPKM expression units, as samples are normalized only within themselves, lacking cross-sample normalization. Consequently, due to external factors unaccounted for by this normalization method, a value of 10 in one sample may not equate to 10 in another.</p></disp-quote><p>We value the reviewer’s input. This question will be addressed in future secondary data analyses with suitable methodologies, as it is beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In Figure 1b, the authors have categorized their 12157 active genes into 3 bins based on FPKM values: &gt;5 FPKM &gt;1, &gt;15 FPKM &gt;5, and &gt;15 FPKM. However, in the text, they describe these as 'actively high-expressing genes (FPKM &gt;= 15)'. I would advise caution regarding the interpretation of these values, as an FPKM of 15 is not typically associated with highly expressed genes. According to literature and resources such as the Expression Atlas, an FPKM of 15 is generally considered to represent a low to medium expression level.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback. This question will be revisited during secondary data analyses using appropriate methodologies, as it falls outside the scope of the present study.</p><p>To increase readability and clarity, we modified the sentence as following: More than 40% of the 540 putative super enhancers are located within a 100-kilobase distance to high-expressing genes (FPKM &gt;= 15), while only 7.3% of putative myometrial super enhancers are found near low-expressing genes (5 &gt; FPKM &gt;= 1) (Figure 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Out of the 12157 active genes, approximately two-thirds have an FPKM &gt;15. Was this expected? How does this correspond to what is observed in the literature, particularly in other similar studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30988671/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30988671/</ext-link> ; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35260533/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35260533/</ext-link>).</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an intriguing question that merits further exploration in future secondary analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) It is also surprising to see that for the motif enrichment analysis (Fig. 1C), the P-values are small. This is probably because the percentage of target sequences with the motif is very similar to the percentage of background sequences with the motif. For instance, for selected genes in Figure 1C: AP-1 (50.68% vs. 46.50%), STAT5 (28.08% vs. 25.04%), PGR (17.90% vs. 16.12%), etc. Can one really say that you have a biologically relevant enrichment for values that are so close between target sequences and background sequences?</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer’s comment is noted. Biological relevance shall be experimentally examined though wet-lab assays in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) For Figure 2, again not convinced that FPKM &gt;= 15 can be used to say: Compared with the regular putative enhancers, the putative myometrial super-enhancers are found more frequently near active genes that are expressed at relatively higher levels (Figure 1B and Figure 2B). A higher threshold should be used if they want to say this.</p></disp-quote><p>To compare the association of putative enhancers with active genes expressed at different levels, we categorized the active genes into three groups based on their FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) values. These groups are defined as follows: the top third active genes (FPKM ≥ 15), the middle third active genes (5 ≤ FPKM &lt; 15), and the bottom third active genes (1 ≤ FPKM &lt; 5). By &quot;active genes expressed at relatively higher levels,&quot; we refer specifically to the top third active genes with FPKM values of 15 or higher, indicating their relatively higher expression levels compared to the other groups of active genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) More detailed explanations and methods are needed regarding how the data for Figure S2 was obtained.</p></disp-quote><p>The following details were added to the methods section:</p><p>“Colocalization of super enhancers and PGR genome occupancy was compared by calling peaks from previously published PGR ChIP-seq data (GSM4081683 and GSM4081684). The percentages of enhancers and super enhancers that manifest PGR occupancy were calculated by overlapping the genomic regions in each category with PGR occupancy regions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) In Figure 2C, there is no information provided on the genes used to obtain the results. It would be helpful to include examples of these genes, along with their expression values, for instance.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression levels of the 346 active genes that are associated with myometrial super enhancers are included in Dataset S4, along with results of the updated gene ontology enrichment analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) of Knowledgebase v2024q4. Selected pathways of interest are listed in updated Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) The linking of PLCL2-related data to the first part of the story is lacking, and the rationale behind it is missing. This entire section should be more detailed, and the data should be expanded to better reflect the context.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we included the following statement at the beginning of the section “Cis-acting elements for the control of the contractile gene PLCL2”:</p><p>“We previously demonstrated the positive correlation of PLCL2 and PGR expression in a mouse model and PLCL2’s function on negatively modulating oxytocin-induced myometrial cell contraction (Peavy et al., 2021). However, the mechanism underlies the PGR regulation of PLCL2 remains unclear. Taking advantage of the mapped myometrial cis-acting elements, we aimed to identify the cis-acting elements that may contribute to the PLCL2 transcriptional regulation with a special interest on the PGR-related enhancers.”</p><p>The context is that our results provide additional evidence to support a direct regulation mechanism of PGR on the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcription, likely though the 35-kb upstream cis-acting element. This finding suggests that PLCL2 likely plays a mediator’s role of PGR dependent myometrial quiescence before laboring rather than a mere passenger on a parallel pathway.

Compared to the numbers of H3K27ac intervals (Table 1), the H3K27ac/H3K4me1 double positive peaks are 62.9%, 70.7%, and 61.2% of corresponding H3K27ac intervals in each individual specimen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) For the first set of data (Table 1), the authors state, &quot;Together, these results reveal an epigenomic landscape in the human term pregnant myometrial tissue before the onset of labor, which we use as a resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms that prepare the myometrium for subsequent parturition.&quot; While it is acknowledged that an epigenetic landscape exists in all tissues, there is a lack of clarity regarding this landscape in the current manuscript, as we are only presented with a table containing numbers.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been revised to: “Together, these results delineate a map of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 positive signals in the human term pregnant myometrial tissue before the onset of labor, which we use as a resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms that prepare the myometrium for subsequent parturition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) For S1, the authors conclude: These data together highlight the degree of variation in mapping the epigenome among specimens and datasets. This conclusion seems somewhat perplexing, and I find myself in partial disagreement. Firstly, providing a clear rationale for this section would strengthen the conclusions. It's important to consider what factors may contribute to this variability. It could simply be attributed to differences in experimental settings, such as variations in samples, protocols used, antibodies, sequencing departments, or overall data quality. Deeper analyses of the data could have provided more information.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that deeper analyses are needed in order to extract more information among studies. However, appropriate methods for meta-analyses should be carefully evaluated and employed for this purpose. We humbly believe that such a task should belong to future studies that may combine available datasets for secondary analyses, leveraging the collective contribution of the reproductive biology community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(18) In the methods section, please include an explanation of how enhancers and super-enhancers were defined or add appropriate citations for reference.</p></disp-quote><p>Added more details about tool and parameter setting in the Method section of “Identification of super enhancers”.</p><p>“Identification of super enhancers</p><p>H3K27ac-positive enhancers were defined as regions of H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks in each sample.

Its usage has declined in recent years due to the emergence of newer and more advanced tools. The main reason is that it was used for RNA-seq analysis at early stage of this study a few years ago. For the purpose of comparison and consistency, we continued using this tool for later RNA-seq analysis. If we start a new project now, we will choose newer tools, such as HISAT2, Salmon, and DEseq2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(22) Overall, sentence structure and typos need to be corrected across the text.
