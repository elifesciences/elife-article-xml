Systematically understanding the metabolic interactions in the rhizosphere, as well as in other types of microbial communities, would open the door to the optimization of specific predefined functions of interest, and therefore to the harnessing of the functionality of various types of microbiomes. However, mechanistic knowledge regarding the gathering and interpretation of these interactions is limited. Here, we present a framework utilizing genomics and constraint-based modeling approaches, aiming to interpret the hierarchical trophic interactions in the soil environment. 243 genome scale metabolic models of bacteria associated with a specific disease-suppressive vs disease-conducive apple rhizospheres were drafted based on genome-resolved metagenomes, comprising an in silico native microbial community. Iteratively simulating microbial community members’ growth in a metabolomics-based apple root-like environment produced novel data on potential trophic successions, used to form a network of communal trophic dependencies. Network-based analyses have characterized interactions associated with beneficial vs non-beneficial microbiome functioning, pinpointing specific compounds and microbial species as potential disease supporting and suppressing agents. This framework provides a means for capturing trophic interactions and formulating a range of testable hypotheses regarding the metabolic capabilities of microbial communities within their natural environment. Essentially, it can be applied to different environments and biological landscapes, elucidating the conditions for the targeted manipulation of various microbiomes, and the execution of countless predefined functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microbial community</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006031</institution-id><institution>United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>US-5390-21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freilich</surname><given-names>Shiri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Understanding metabolic interactions and successive cross-feeding in native microbiomes illuminates the mechanisms behind plant disease promotion and suppression, enhancing our ability to manipulate microbiomes toward specific functions of interest.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rhizosphere serves as a hotspot for a diversity of interactions spanning from the secretion of organic compounds by plant roots to their uptake by the adjacent soil microbial community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhalnina et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomariz et al., 2015</xref>).

A comprehensive understanding of the dynamics within the rhizosphere, considering both plant–microbe (PM) and microbe–microbe interactions, can guide the targeted assembly and maintenance of plant-beneficial soil microbial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freilich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Embree et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tsoi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zengler and Zaramela, 2018</xref>). The development of such microbiome-based, plant-beneficial strategies presents ecologically sound alternatives to conventional, chemical-based solutions in supporting plant health and productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vessey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Toju et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>`Omics data in general and specifically metagenomics data analyses can potentially provide keys for unraveling the black box of PM and microbe–microbe interactions in complex ecosystems such as the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faust and Raes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Widder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Magnúsdóttir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">San León and Nogales, 2022</xref>). Sequence-based analyses are, however, typically limited in terms of functional interpretation of community dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basile et al., 2020</xref>). Constraint-based modeling (CBM) is an approach that allows for the simulation of bacterial-metabolic activity in a given environment based on the constraints imposed by the annotated microbial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faust and Raes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Orth et al., 2010</xref>). This approach has long been used for studying the physiology and growth of single cells, represented as genome scale metabolic models (GSMMs), under varying conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuevas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Price et al., 2004</xref>). Applying CBM over a GSMM can be used to assess the uptake and secretion of metabolites in the environment under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Orth et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, when CBM is applied over multiple GSMMs, metabolite exchange profiles (secretion into and consumption from the environment) become interconnected. This sheds light on conditions supporting the growth of different bacterial groups within the community as well as their functional potential in the trophic network formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freilich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stolyar et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Advancement of sequencing technologies alongside the development of automatic pipelines for GSMM construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Machado et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henry et al., 2010</xref>) has promoted an increased use of CBM for the modeling of communities with growing complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faust and Raes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Widder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Magnúsdóttir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basile et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zampieri et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinken et al., 2023</xref>). The relevance of CBM to the study of microbiomes has been demonstrated in a variety of ecosystems and recent works have shown that CBM-based predictions can guide the development of strategies for microbiome management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinken et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faust, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ruan et al., 2022</xref>). An accurate representation of microbial metabolic networks depends on the origin of the genomes analyzed. To date, most studies attempting to model the microbiome of specific ecosystems by GSMM represent native species using corresponding genome sequences from public depositories, a process which is usually referred to as 16S-based genome imputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basile et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhakar et al., 2022</xref>). Genome recovery, or genome-resolved metagenomes, often referred to as metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) allows one to obtain full genomes directly from metagenomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taş et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Uritskiy et al., 2018</xref>). Constructing GSMMs based on MAGs derived from a specific biological sample or directly from a native community enables a genuine view of the metabolic activities carried out <italic>in situ</italic>, hence bypasses the need in 16S-based genome imputation. Such an in silico representation of a native community (with respect to its environment) can be used to decrypt the myriad interconnected uptake and secretion exchange fluxes transpiring within the root-associated microbiome, spanning from root exudates to altered organic forms.</p><p>The current study describes the recovery of 395 unique MAGs from metagenomes constructed for the native rhizosphere community of apple rootstocks cultivated in orchard soil affected by apple replant disease (ARD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Somera et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berihu et al., 2023</xref>). Soils were amended with <italic>Brassicaceae</italic> seed meal, or were not amended, supporting the development of either disease-suppressive or disease-conducive root microbiomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Somera et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berihu et al., 2023</xref>). MAGs were recovered from metagenomics data collected from these apple rhizosphere microbiomes. GSMMs constructed for the MAGs provide an in silico representation of highly abundant species in the native rhizosphere community. CBM simulations were then conducted in a rhizosphere-like environment, where microbial uptake-secretion fluxes were connected to form a directional trophic network. The aims of this study were twofold: first, to provide a general framework for delineating inter-species interactions occurring in the rhizosphere environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and second, to characterize the metabolic roles specific groups of bacteria fulfill in seed meal-amended (disease-suppressive) vs non-amended (disease-conducive) apple rhizobiome communities.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A framework for interpreting and characterizing the network of metabolic interactions of root-associated bacteria.</title><p>Going from obscure rhizosphere (upper circle) to the elucidated rhizosphere (lower circle): Microbial genomic DNA extracted from rhizosphere soil serves the construction of a rhizosphere-derived metagenome and the recovery of rhizosphere community metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). For each MAG, a genome scale metabolic model (GSMM) is built, representing a specific species in the microbial community. Apple-root exudate profiles based on metabolomics data are used for the construction of a simulation environment. Via constraint-based modeling (CBM), applied on GSMMs, interactions are characterized in the simulated root environment, yielding predictive information regarding potential trophic exchanges within the native rhizosphere microbial community.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94558-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assembly of a collection of MAGs representing a native microbial community from a soil agroecosystem</title><p>Metagenomic sequencing obtained from the rhizosphere of apple rootstocks grown in orchard soil with a documented history of replant disease resulted in a total of approximately 2 billion quality reads (after filtration) at a length of 150 bp, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berihu et al., 2023</xref>.

The 10 most frequent functional categories across the MAG collection were involved in primary metabolism, for example, carbohydrate metabolism, and the biosynthesis of essential cellular building blocks such as amino acids and vitamins. Specialized functional categories included those associated with autotrophic nutrition such as carbon fixation and metabolism of nitrogen, sulfur, and methane. Functional diversity was found to exist also when considering ubiquitous functions. For instance, though all bacteria are in need of the full set of amino acids, most genomes lack the full set of relevant biosynthesis pathways. The prevalence of biosynthetic pathways across MAGs (requiring at least a single relevant enzyme) ranges from 99.5% (e.g., glycine; missing in only two genomes) to 21% (e.g., tyrosine; detected in only 83 MAGs). Notably, the diversity of metabolic pathway completeness regarding amino acids and other essential cellular components suggests that the majority of bacterial soil species rely on an external supply of at least some of their obligatory nutritional demands.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Construction of a simulation system for exploring environment-dependent metabolic performances and growth of rhizosphere bacteria</title><p>Categorical classifications of discrete gene entities, such as pathway completeness analyses, have several inherent limitations as an approach for the contextualization and functional interpretation of genomic information. First, categorical classifications may underestimate the completeness of robust pathways with multiple redundant routes resulting in low pathway completeness. Second, pathway completeness analyses do not take into consideration the directionality and continuity of a biosynthetic process whose full conductance requires the availability of a specific environmental resource together with the required successive series of genes/reactions. Although functional potential can be inferred based on the static set of genes and enzymes present, actual metabolic performances of bacterial species in soil are dynamic and reflect multiple factors, including the availability of different nutritional sources. Such sources can be environmental inputs like root exudates or downstream exchange metabolites secreted by cohabiting bacteria.</p><p>To better understand environment-dependent metabolic activity occurring in a native rhizosphere, a set of 395 GSMMs was constructed for the entire collection of the rhizosphere-bacterial community MAGs. All models were systematically subjected to validity and quality tests using MEMOTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lieven et al., 2020</xref>), leaving a total of 243 GSMMs whose stoichiometric consistency was confirmed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). On average, GSMMs included 1924 reactions, from which 203 were exchange reactions (specific reactions carrying out extracellular import and secretion of metabolites) and 1312 metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>). Altogether, the GSMM set held 5152 unique metabolic reactions, 597 exchange reactions, and 2671 different compounds.

Additionally, comparison of GSMM scales indicated that the metabolic coverage (i.e., the number of reactions, which denote the potential of executing a metabolic function) of our data is within the same order of magnitude as described in recent large-scale automatic reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basile et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinken et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Next, species-specific rich (optimal) and poor (suboptimal) media were defined for each model in order to broadly assess GSMM growth capacity. A rich environment was defined as a medium containing all metabolites for which the model encodes an exchange reaction. A poor environment was defined as the minimal set of compounds enabling growth (see Methods). Essentially, poor environments contained species-specific carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous sources together with other trace elements. In addition to the two automatic media, we aimed to design a realistic simulating environment to explore the impact of the root exudates on the native community.

As expected, growth performances were higher on the poor medium supplemented with exudates in comparison to growth on the poor medium alone but lower than the growth in rich medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Notably, GSMM growth patterns were not phylogenetically conserved and were inconsistent between related taxa. Moreover, ranking of models’ growth rate was inconsistent in the three different media (i.e., some models’ growth rates were markedly affected by the simulated media whereas others did not; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

By avoiding the inclusion of non-exudate organic metabolites, the true-to-source rhizosphere environment was designed to reveal the hierarchical directionality of the trophic exchanges in soil, as rich media often mask various trophic interactions taking place in native communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Opatovsky et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the rhizosphere environment also included an array of inorganic compounds used by the 243 GSMMs, which includes trace metals, ferric, phosphoric, and sulfuric compounds.

MCSM utilizes FVA to simulate and enumerate the exchange fluxes of individual models, extending their secretion profiles beyond the standard FBA-based solutions commonly used in other CBM tools designed for modeling microbial interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basile et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pacheco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">San Roman and Wagner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diener et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dukovski, 2021</xref>). Unlike certain CBM tools designed for modeling microbial community interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diener et al., 2020</xref>), MCSM bypasses the need to define a community objective function, as the growth of each species is simulated individually. Trophic interactions are inferred by the extent to which exchange compounds secreted by bacteria could support the growth of other community members. MCSM iteratively grows the GSMMs in a defined environment, sums up their individual secretion profiles, and updates the initial simulation environment with those secreted compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Then, the initial environment was updated with 145 additional compounds predicted to be secreted by the growing community members. The second iteration supported the growth of 33 additional species whose growth was supported by compounds predicted to be secreted by bacteria that grew in the first iteration. Following the second iteration, 25 new secreted compounds were added to the rhizosphere environment. The third iteration supported the growth of 11 additional GSMMs, with one additional compound secreted. After the third iteration, the updated environment did not support the growth of any new species. Overall, iterative growth simulations resulted in the successive growth of 71 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; iterations 1–3).</p><p>To enlarge the array of growing species, we tested the effect of the addition of organic phosphorous sources. Organic phosphorous is typically a limiting factor in soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) and its utilization varies greatly between microbial species [i.e., different P sources were shown to have a selective effect on different microbial groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>)]. The initial rhizosphere environment contained only inorganic phosphorous. During first to third MCSM simulations, nine organic P compounds were secreted to the simulation medium, which was updated accordingly. At the beginning of the fourth iteration, 31 additional organic P compounds were identified by screening the species-specific poor medium and were added to the medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>; organic phosphorous compounds). The additional organic P compounds supported the growth of nine additional GSMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and led to the secretion of 13 new compounds, which were added to the environment. The fifth iteration supported the growth of four additional GSMMs and two new compounds were secreted. Final simulations in the cumulative rhizosphere environment were composed of all secreted compounds and led to the same secretion and growth profile as the previous iteration. Therefore, no further growth iterations were conducted.</p><p>Overall, the successive iterations connected 84 out of 243 native members of the apple rhizosphere GSMM community via trophic exchanges. The inability of the remaining bacteria to grow, despite being part of the native root microbiome, possibly reflects the selectiveness of the root environment, which fully supports the nutritional demands of only part of the soil species, whereas specific compounds that might be essential to other species are less abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buée et al., 2009</xref>). It is important to note that the specific exudate profile used here represents a snapshot of the root metabolome as root secretion profiles are highly dynamic, reflecting both environmental and plant developmental conditions. A possible complementary explanation to the observed selective growth might be the partiality of our simulation platform, which examined only plant–bacteria and bacteria–bacteria interactions while ignoring other critical components of the rhizosphere system such as fungi, archaea, protists, and mesofauna, as well as less abundant bacterial species, components all known to metabolically interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardgett and Putten, 2014</xref>). Finally, the MAG collection, while relatively substantial, represents only part of the microbial community. Accordingly, the iterative growth simulations represent a subset of the overall hierarchical trophic exchanges in the root environment, necessarily reflecting the partiality of the dataset.</p><p>In terms of the phylogenetic distribution of the models, 27 bacterial species grew on the first iteration (in which root exudates served as the sole organic sources).

Notably, the S-classified root exudates included compounds reported to support dysbiosis and ARD progression.

This exploratory framework aims to illuminate the black box of interactions occurring in the rhizospheres of crop plants and is based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berihu et al., 2023</xref>, in which a gene-centric analysis of metagenomics data from apple rhizospheres was conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berihu et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>We recovered high-quality sets of environment-specific MAGs, constructed the corresponding GSMMs, and simulated community-level metabolic interactions. By including authentic apple-root exudates in the models, we were able to begin untangling the highly complex plant–bacterial and bacterial–bacterial interactions occurring in the rhizosphere environment. More specifically<bold>,</bold> we used the framework to investigate a microbial community via examining its hierarchical secretion-uptake exchanges along multiple iterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These analyses, which linked community-derived secretion profiles with the growth of other community members, demonstrated the successive, trophic-dependent nature of microbial communities. These interactions were elucidated via construction of a community-exchange network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Possible connections between root exudates, differentially abundant (DA) bacteria, their secreted end-products, and soil health were explored using the data derived from this network. From these analyses, we were able to associate different metabolic functionalities with diseased or healthy systems, and formulate new hypotheses regarding the general function of DA bacteria in the community.</p><p>The framework we present is currently conceptual. Dealing with a highly complex system such as the rhizobiome inevitably comes with limitations. These limitations include the usage of automatic GSMM reconstruction, inherent caveats of CBM and the use of single-species GSMMs, the lack of transcriptomic and spatial-chemo-physical data, and the exclusion of competition over all its forms. Furthermore, a portion of the metabolomics data used in this framework was taken from a different source (different rootstock genotype), possibly introducing further bias to the analyses. This potential factor is due to the inherent discrepancy between the conditions from which genomics and metabolomics data were collected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhalnina et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korenblum et al., 2020</xref>). Also not considered in this framework is the role of eukaryotes in the microbial-metabolic interplay. Moreover, the use of an automatic GSMM reconstruction tool (CarveMe; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Machado et al., 2018</xref>), though increasingly used for depicting phenotypic landscapes, is generally less accurate than manual curation of metabolic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henry et al., 2010</xref>). This approach typically neglects specialized functions involving secondary metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freilich et al., 2011</xref>) and introduces additional biases such as the overestimation of auxotrophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Price, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machado and Patil, 2023</xref>). Nevertheless, manual curation is practically non-realistic for hundreds of MAGs, an expected outcome considering the volume of sequencing projects nowadays. As the primary motivation of this framework is the development of a tool capable of transforming high-throughput, low-cost genomic information into testable predictions, the use of automatic metabolic network reconstruction tools was favored, despite their inherent limitations, in pursuit of addressing the necessity of pipelines systematically analyzing metagenomics data.</p><p>For these reasons, among others, the framework presented here is not intended to be used as a stand-alone tool for determining microbial function. The framework presented is designed to be used as a platform to generate educated hypotheses regarding bacterial function in a specific environment in conjunction with actual carbon substrates available in the particular ecosystem under study. The hypotheses generated provide a starting point for experimental testing required to gain actual, targeted, and feasible applicable insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhakar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berihu et al., 2023</xref>). While recognizing its limitations, this framework is in fact highly versatile and can be used for the characterization of a variety of microbial communities and environments. Given a set of MAGs derived from a specific environment and environmental metabolomics data, this computational framework provides a generic simulation platform for a wide and diverse range of future applications.</p><p>In the current study, the root environment was represented by a single pool of resources (metabolites). As genuine root environments are highly dynamic and responsive to stimuli, a single environment can represent at best a temporary snapshot of the conditions. Conductance of simulations with several sets of resource pools (e.g., representing temporal variations in exudation profile) can add insights on their effect on trophic interactions and community dynamics. In parallel, confirming predictions made in various environments will support an iterative process that will strengthen the predictive power of the framework and improve its accuracy as a tool for generating testable hypotheses. Similarly, complementing the genomics-based approaches done here with additional layers of 'omics information (mainly transcriptomics and metabolomics) can further constrain the solution space, deflate the number of potential metabolic routes and yield more accurate predictions of GSMMs’ performances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zampieri et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>To summarize, we have constructed a framework enabling the analysis of metabolic interactions among microbes, as well as between microbes and their hosts, in their natural environment. Where recent studies begin to apply GSMM reconstruction and analysis starting from MAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zampieri et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zorrilla et al., 2021</xref>), this work applies the MAGs to GSMMs approach to conduct large-scale CBM analysis over high-quality MAGs derived from a native rhizosphere and explore the complex network of interactions in light of the functioning of the respective agroecosystem. The application of this framework to the apple rhizobiome yielded a wealth of preliminary knowledge about the metabolic interactions occurring within it, including novel information on putative functions performed by bacteria in healthy vs replant-diseased soil systems, and potential metabolic routes to control these functions.

This set of compounds was identified using the minimal_medium module from COBRApy (minimize components = True, growth rate of 0.1 biomass increase hour<sup>−1</sup>). Poor medium + exudates was defined as the poor medium with the addition of an array of apple-root exudates. These compounds were retrieved from two metabolomics studies characterizing the exudates of apple rootstocks grown in Lane Mountain Sand (Valley, WA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leisso et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leisso et al., 2018</xref>). Exudate compounds were aligned with the BIGG database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">King et al., 2016</xref>) in order to format them for use in COBRApy. For each media type, GSMM growth rates were calculated by solving each model using the summary method in COBRApy, which utilizes Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) for maximizing biomass.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Construction of a common root environment medium and application of the MCSM</title><p>In order to simulate the dynamics of the rhizosphere community in the root environment, a fourth growth medium representing a natural-like environment was defined and termed the ‘rhizosphere environment’. The rhizosphere environment was composed of two arrays of compounds: (1) the exudates (as described above) and (2) inorganic compounds essential for sustaining bacterial growth. This array was determined according to the minimal set of compounds identified for each GSMM (also described above). Rhizosphere environment components are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>. Both sets of compounds were then consolidated into one array in which further simulations were conducted.</p><p>The MCSM (which is the first module out of three comprising this computational framework) simulates the growth of a microbial community by iteratively growing the GSMMs in the community and adding compounds ‘secreted’ by the growing species to the simulation environment (i.e., the medium), thus enriching the medium/environment and supporting further growth. Unlike FBA, which is used for gathering an arbitrary solution regarding non-optimized fluxes, the MCSM uses FVA to determine exchange fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mahadevan and Schilling, 2003</xref>). FVA gathers the full range of exchange fluxes (both secretion and uptake) that satisfy the objective function of a GSMM (i.e., biomass increase). The FVA fraction of optimum was set to 0.9 (sustaining the objective function at 90% optimality, allowing a less restricted secretion profile). Secretion compounds added to the updated medium in each iteration were set to be given in optimal fluxes in next iteration, to ensure a metabolic effect based on the presence of specific metabolites in the environment, rather than their quantity. Flux boundaries of updated medium components were set to 1000 mmol/gDW hour (for a specific exchange compound; gDW, gram Dry Weight).</p><p>MCSM was initially simulated in the rhizosphere environment medium. After each growth iteration, GSMM growth values and the compounds secreted by the species growing were collected, where the latter were added to the medium for the next iteration as described above. Growth iterations continued until no new compounds were secreted and no additional GSMMs had grown. After the third iteration, a set of organic phosphorous compounds (containing both carbon and phosphorous) was added to the environment. These compounds were gathered from the pool of model-specific minimal compounds selected for use in the poor medium. Information regarding the chemical formula of these compounds was gathered with the formula attribute of each compound object in COBRApy. Along MCSM iterations, secreted metabolites were classified into biochemical categories based on BRITE annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki-Kinoshita and Kanehisa, 2007</xref>) or, in the absence of classification, manually. MCSM was further applied to inspect the framework’s ability to tracing cellulose degradation using cellulose medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>). The tutorial for the MCSM stage of the framework workflow is found in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/FreilichLab/Trophic_interactions_predicting_framework">GitHub</ext-link>, along with the GSMMs and media files. Instructions for conducting the analysis are in the README.md file.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Construction of the exchange network and its untangling for screening sub-network motifs</title><p>For each GSMM, a directed bipartite network representing all potential metabolic exchanges occurring within the rhizosphere community was constructed based on uptake and secretion data derived from MCSM iterations. Edges in the network were connected between GSMM nodes and metabolite nodes, with edge directionality indicating either secretion or uptake of a metabolite by a specific GSMM. The network was constructed with the networkx package, a python language package for the exploration and analysis of networks and network algorithms. Network-specific topography was obtained using the Kamada-kawai layout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hagberg et al., 2008</xref>). Information regarding the degree and connectivity of the different node types was acquired from the graph object (G). Code for the network construction module in the framework is found at the project’s GitHub page under the name NETWORK.py.</p><p>Untangling the exchange network into individual paths (i.e., sub-network motifs) was done using the all_shortest_paths function in networkx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hagberg et al., 2008</xref>), applied over the exchanges network. Briefly, the algorithm screens for all possible shortest paths within the network, specifically screening for paths starting with an exudate node and ending secreted metabolite nodes (secreted by bacterial species but not consumed). This algorithm yielded two types of paths: (1) PM paths in which node positions one, two, and three represented exudate, microbe, and secreted metabolite, respectively, and (2) PMM paths. PMM paths (length of five nodes) were constructed based on PM paths (length of three nodes), in which positions four and five displayed unique (i.e., not found in PM paths) microbe and metabolite nodes, respectively. Code for the network untangling module in the framework is found at the project’s GitHub page under the name PATHS.py.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Associating PM and PMM sub-network motifs features with soil health</title><p>Sub-network motifs (PM and PMM) were functionally classified as associated with healthy soil (H), sick soil (S), or not-associated with either soil type (NA) based on differential abundance of the corresponding MAGs (PM) or MAGs combination (PMM) in the sub-network. Next, the GSMMs in both PM and PMM sub-networks were characterized according functional classification. For PMMs, the distribution of counts of classified sub-networks, at the different positions, was compared using the ANOVA test, followed by a Tukey test to significantly distinguish the groups. GSMM classifications were further projected on uptake and secreted metabolites in the pathway motifs. For simplification, the analysis focused only on PM paths because PMM paths incorporate PM paths, and exchanges within a PMM path do not directly reflect the effect of an exudate on the secreted end-product (but over the intermediate compound). On that account, start/end metabolites in PM paths were associated with H/S/NA paths based on one-sided hypergeometric test, comparing the frequency of each compound in a functionally characterized path type (either H or S) vs its frequency in NA classified paths and the reciprocal dataset.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Software, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Validation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Supervision, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-94558-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability</title><p>A reproducible workflow for central computational analyses was deposited in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/FreilichLab/Trophic_interactions_predicting_framework">GitHub</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">FreilichLab, 2023a</xref> including all GSMMs. Raw metagenome sequences used in this study have been deposited in NCBI under BioProject accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA779554">PRJNA779554</ext-link>.

Beyond identifying microbial species associated with specific host and soil traits (e.g., disease tolerance), a detailed understanding of the interactions underlying these associations is necessary for developing targeted microbiome-centered interventions for plant health. It has nonetheless remained challenging to define the roles of specific organisms and metabolic species in natural rhizobiomes. Here, the authors combine microbial compositional data obtained through metagenomic sequencing with a new collection of genome-scale models to predict interactions in the native rhizosphere communities of apple rootstocks. To do this, they have established processes to integrate these sources of data and model specific trophic exchanges, which they use to obtain testable hypotheses for targeted modulation of microbiota members in situ.</p><p>The authors carry out a careful model curation process based on metagenomic sequencing data and existing model generation tools, which, together with basing the in silico medium composition on known root exudates, strengthens their predictions of interaction network features. Moreover, its reliance on genome-scale models provides a broader basis for linking sequence-based information to predictions of function on a multispecies level beyond rhizosphere microbiomes.</p><p>Having generated a set of predicted trophic interactions, the authors carried out a detailed analysis linking features of these interactions to organism taxonomy and broader ecosystem properties. Intriguingly, the organisms predicted to grow in the first iteration of their framework (i.e., on only root exudates) broadly correspond to taxonomic groups experimentally shown to benefit from these compounds. Additionally, the simulations predicted some patterns of vitamin and amino acid secretion that are known to form the basis for interactions in the rhizosphere. Together, these outcomes underscore the applicability of this method to help disentangle trophic interaction networks in complex microbiomes.</p><p>The methodology described in this paper represents a useful and promising framework to better understand the complexity of microbial interaction networks in situ. In particular, the authors' simulation of trophic interactions based on cellulose degradation have generated predictions of interactions that can more readily be validated. While a more complete analysis of the method's sensitivity to environmental composition is still needed to fully interpret its conclusions - particularly those predicting the inability of many of the in silico organisms to produce biomass - it represents a valuable addition to the growing toolkit of computational and experimental methods for generating educated hypotheses on complex trophic networks.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94558.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study presents a solid framework for the metabolic modeling of microbial species and resources in the rhizosphere environment.

I find this especially important given that relatively few (84 of 243) species were predicted to grow even after cross-feeding, suggesting that a richer medium could lead to different interaction network structures. While the authors do state the importance of environmental composition and have carefully designed an in silico medium, I believe that simulating a broader set of resource pools would add necessary insight into both the predictive power of the models themselves and trophic interactions in the rhizosphere more generally.</p></disp-quote><p>The original analyses were indeed focused on a single well-defined environment supporting the growth of only a subset of the species. We have added a paragraph to the discussion section dealing with the potential limitations of this approach.</p><p>On line 289 we write:</p><p>&quot;Overall, the successive iterations connected 84 out of 243 native members of the apple rhizosphere GSMM community via trophic exchanges. The inability of the remaining bacteria to grow, despite being part of the native root microbiome, possibly reflects the selectiveness of the root environment, which fully supports the nutritional demands of only part of the soil species, whereas specific compounds that might be essential to other species are less abundant1. It is important to note that the specific exudate profile used here represent a snapshot of the root metabolome as root secretion-profiles are highly dynamic, reflecting both environmental and plant developmental conditions. A possible complementary explanation to the observed selective growth might be the partiality of our simulation platform, which examined only plant-bacteria and bacteria-bacteria interactions while ignoring other critical components of the rhizosphere system such as fungi, archaea, protists and mesofauna, as well as less abundant bacterial species, components all known to metabolically interact2. Finally, the MAG collection, while relatively substantial, represents only part of the microbial community. Accordingly, the iterative growth simulations represent a subset of the overall hierarchical-trophic exchanges in the root environment, necessarily reflecting the partiality of the dataset.&quot;</p><p>In addition, we have tried to better explain the advantages of a limited/defined medium to such an analysis. On Line 231 we add:</p><p>&quot;By avoiding the inclusion of non-exudate organic metabolites, the true-to-source rhizosphere environment was designed to reveal the hierarchical directionality of the trophic exchanges in soil, as rich media often mask various trophic interactions taking place in native communities3&quot;</p><p>More generally, beyond the above justification of our specific medium selection, we agree that simulating a broader set of resource pools would contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the trophic interactions. Therefore, we conducted the analysis in an additional environment, in which cellulose was used as an input. We were able to follow its well-documented degradation via multiple steps, conducted by different community members, to serve as a benchmark to our suggested framework.</p><p>On line 357 we add:</p><p>&quot;To validate the ability of MCSM to capture trophic dependencies and succession, we further tested whether it can trace the well-documented example of cellulose degradation - a multi-step process conducted by several bacterial strains that go through the conversion of cellulose and its oligosaccharide derivatives into ethanol, acetate and glucose, which are all eventually oxidized to CO24. Here, the simulation followed the trophic interactions in an environment provided with cellulose oligosaccharides (4 and 6 glucose units) on the 1st iteration (Supp. Table 3). The formed trophic successions detected along iterations captured the reported multi-step process (Supp.Fig.7).&quot;</p><p>Finally, we have included additional text regarding the challenge of defining our simulation environment in the Discussion section.</p><p>On line 532 we add:</p><p>&quot;In the current study, the root environment was represented by a single pool of resources (metabolites). As genuine root environments are highly dynamic and responsive to stimuli, a single environment can represent, at best, a temporary snapshot of the conditions. Conductance of simulations with several sets of resource pools (e.g., representing temporal variations in exudation profile) can add insights regarding their effect on trophic interactions and community dynamics. In parallel, confirming predictions made in various environments will support an iterative process that will strengthen the predictive power of the framework and improve its accuracy as a tool for generating testable hypotheses. Similarly, complementing the genomicsbased approaches used here with additional layers of 'omics information (mainly transcriptomics &amp; metabolomics) can further constrain the solution space, deflate the number of potential metabolic routes and yield more accurate predictions of GSMMs' performances5.&quot;</p><p>And we add in Line 520:</p><p>&quot;For these reasons, among others, the framework presented here is not intended to be used as a stand-alone tool for determining microbial function. The framework presented is designed to be used as a platform to generate educated hypotheses regarding bacterial function in a specific environment in conjunction with actual carbon substrates available in the particular ecosystem under study. The hypotheses generated provide a starting point for experimental testing required to gain actual, targeted and feasible applicable insights6,7. While recognizing its limitations, this framework is in fact highly versatile and can be used for the characterization of a variety of microbial communities and environments. Given a set of MAGs derived from a specific environment and environmental metabolomics data, this computational framework provides a generic simulation platform for a wide and diverse range of future applications.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>There are two main drawback approaches like the one described here, both related only partially to the authors' work yet with great impact in the presented framework. First, the usage of automatic GSMM reconstruction requires great caution. It is indicative of how the semicurated AGORA models are still considered reconstructions and expect the user to parameterize those in a model. In this study, CarveMe was used. CarveMe is a well-known tool with several pros [1]. Yet, several challenges need to be considered when using it [2]. For example, the biomass function used might lead to an overestimation of auxotrophies. Also, as its authors admit in their reply paper, CarveMe does gap fill in a way [3]; models are constructed to ensure no gaps and also secure a minimum growth. However, curation of such a high number of GSMMs is probably not an option. Further, even if FVA is way more useful than FBA for the authors' aim, it does not yet ensure that when a species secretes one compound (let's say metabolite A), the same flux vector, i.e. the same metabolic functioning profile, secretes another compound (metabolite B) at the same time, even if the FVA solution suggests that metabolite B could be secreted in general.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #2 for highlighting this key limitation of our analysis. Below and in the 'recommendations to authors' section we address these concerns.</p><p>Concerning the first point raised (models' accuracy) we have now clearly acknowledged in the text the limitations of using an automated GSMM reconstruction tool such as CarveMe. More generally, the framework applied here was built in order to meet the challenges of analyzing highthroughput data while acknowledging the inherent potential of introducing inaccuracies. Pros &amp; cons are now discussed.</p><p>On line 507 we write:</p><p>&quot;Moreover, the use of an automatic GSMM reconstruction tool (CarveMe8), though increasingly used for depicting phenotypic landscapes, is typically less accurate than manual curation of metabolic models9. This approach typically neglects specialized functions involving secondary metabolism10 and introduces additional biases such as the overestimation of auxotrophies11,12. Nevertheless, manual curation is practically non-realistic for hundreds of MAGs, an expected outcome considering the volume of nowadays sequencing projects.

However, as indicated by the reviewer, predicted fluxes do not necessarily co-occur (i.e., when a metabolite is secreted another metabolite is not necessarily secreted too), yet, they provide the full set of potential solutions (unlike the single solution provided by FBA). A possible strategy to reduce inflated predictions provided by FVA and further constrain the solution space (reduce the set of metabolic fluxes) can be the incorporation of additional `omics data layers, as for example was done in the work of Zampieri et al5.

To validate the ability of MCSM to capture trophic succession, we conducted an additional analysis testing whether it can track the well documented example of cellulose degradation - a multi-step process conducted by several bacterial strains. This example has been included in the manuscript to serve as a case study (i.e. positive control) for metabolic interactions occurring within the bacterial community (Supp. Fig. 7).</p><p>On line 357 we add:</p><p>&quot;To validate the ability of MCSM to capture trophic dependencies and succession, we further tested whether it can track the well-documented example of cellulose degradation - a multi-step process conducted by several bacterial strains that go through the conversion of cellulose and its oligosaccharide derivatives into ethanol, acetate and glucose, which are all eventually oxidized to CO24. Here, the simulation followed the trophic interactions in an environment provided with cellulose oligosaccharides (4 and 6 glucose units) on the 1st iteration (Supp. Table 3). The formed trophic successions detected along iterations captured the reported multi-step process (Supp. Fig.7).&quot;</p><p>&quot;Supplementary Figure 7.

Distribution of phyla of primary and secondary decomposers is denoted by pie charts. Though MAGs were not constructed for the original species as in Kato et al., among the primary consumers, species corresponding to the Acidobacteria (Acidobacteriales)13, Actinobacteria14, Bacteriodetes15, Proteobacteria (Xanthomonadales)16 and Verrucobacteria17 groups are found to be capable of degrading cellulose compounds via enzymatic mechanisms.&quot;</p><p>More generally, beyond the above addition, the relevance of the framework to the analysis of the data is discussed throughout the analysis (in the original version of the manuscript). We have scrutinized each of our observations in light of current available information and provided a corroborating evidence as well as a few discrepancies for multiple steps in the analysis. Examples include the following discussions:</p><p>On line 312, we discuss the biological relevance of taxonomic classes classified as primary versus secondary degraders</p><p>&quot;As in the full GSMM data set (Community bar, Fig. 3C), most of the species which grew in the 1st iteration belonged to the phyla <italic>Acidobacteriota</italic>, <italic>Proteobacteria,</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidota</italic>. This result concurred with findings from the work of Zhalnina et al, which reported that bacteria assigned to these phyla are the primary beneficiaries of root exudates18. Species from three out of the 17 phyla that did not grow in the first iteration - <italic>Elusimicrobiota, Chlamydiota</italic>, and <italic>Fibrobacterota,</italic> did grow on the 2nd iteration (Fig. 3C). Members of these phyla are known for their specialized metabolic dependencies. Such is the case for example with members of the <italic>Elusimicrobiota</italic> phylum, which include mostly uncultured species whose nutritional preferences are likely to be selective19.</p><p>At the order level, bacteria classified as <italic>Sphingomonadales</italic> (class <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>), a group known to include typical inhabitants of the root environment20, grew in the initial Root environment. In comparison, other root-inhabiting groups including the orders <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> and _Burkholderiales_20, did not grow in the first iteration. <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> and <italic>Burkholderiales</italic> did, however, grow in the second and third iterations, respectively, indicating that in the simulations, the growth of these groups was dependent on exchange metabolites secreted by other community members (Supp. Fig. 4).&quot;</p><p>On line 331, we provide support to the classification of specific metabolites as exchange molecules</p><p>&quot;Overall, 158 organic compounds were secreted throughout the MCSM simulation (from which 12 compounds overlapped with the original exudate medium). These compounds varied in their distribution and were mapped into 12 biochemical categories (Fig. 3D). Whereas plant secretions are a source of various organic compounds, microbial secretions provide a source of multiple vitamins and co-factors not secreted by the plant. Microbial-secreted compounds included siderophores (staphyloferrin, salmochelin, pyoverdine, and enterochelin), vitamins (pyridoxine, pantothenate, and thiamin), and coenzymes (coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and flavin mononucleotide) – all known to be exchange compounds in microbial communities21,22. In addition, microbial secretions included 11 amino acids (arginine, lysine, threonine, alanine, serine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, glutamate, isoleucine, and methionine), also known as a common exchange currency in microbial communities23. Some microbial-secreted compounds, such as phenols and alkaloids, were reported to be produced by plants as secondary metabolites24,25. Additional information regarding mean uptake and secretion degrees of compounds classified to biochemical groups is found in Supp. Fig. 5.&quot;</p><p>On line 432, we provide corroborative support to the classification of exudates as associated with beneficial/non beneficial root communities</p><p>&quot;Notably, the S-classified root exudates included compounds reported to support dysbiosis and ARD progression. For example, the S-classified compounds gallic acid and caffeic acid (3,4-dihidroxy-trans-cinnamate) are phenylpropanoids – phenylalanine intermediate phenolic compounds secreted from plant roots following exposure to replant pathogens26. Though secretion of these compounds is considered a defense response, it is hypothesized that high levels of phenolic compounds can have autotoxic effects, potentially exacerbating ARD. Additionally, it was shown that genes associated with the production of caffeic acid were upregulated in ARD-infected apple roots, relative to those grown in γ-irradiated ARD soil27,28, and that root and soil extracts from replant-diseased trees inhibited apple seedling growth and resulted in increased seedling root production of caffeic acid29.&quot;</p><p>On line 446, we provide a supporting evidence to the classification of secreted compounds as associated with beneficial/non beneficial root communities</p><p>&quot;Several secreted compounds classified as healthy exchanges (H) were reported to be potentially associated with beneficial functions. For instance, the compounds L-Sorbose (EX_srb__L_e) and Phenylacetaladehyde (EX_pacald_e), both over-represented in H paths (Fig. 5C), have been shown to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens associated with replant disease30,31.</p><p>Phenylacetaladehyde has also been reported to have nematicidal qualities32.&quot;</p><p>On line 453 we discuss the correspondence of specific exudate uptakes and compound secretions via specific subnetwork motifs (PM) and their literature/experimental evidence</p><p>&quot;Combining both exudate uptake data and metabolite secretion data, the full H-classified PM path 4-Hydroxybenzoate; GSMM_091; catechol (Fig. 4C; the consumed exudate, the GSMM, and the secreted compound, respectively) provides an exemplary model for how the proposed framework can be used to guide the design of strategies which support specific, advantageous exchanges within the rhizobiome. The root exudate 4-Hydroxybenzoate is metabolized by GSMM_091 (class <italic>Verrucomicrobiae</italic>, order <italic>Pedosphaerales</italic>) to catechol. Catechol is a precursor of a number of catecholamines, a group of compounds which was recently shown to increase apple tolerance to ARD symptoms when added to orchard6,33. This analysis (PM; Fig 4C), leads to formulating the testable prediction that 4-Hydroxybenzoate can serve as a selective enhancer of catecholamine synthesizing bacteria associated with reduced ARD symptoms, and therefore serve as a potential source for indigenously produced beneficial compounds.&quot;</p><p>Moreover, we perceive our analysis as a strategy for integrating high throughput genomic data into testable predictions allowing narrowing the solution space while acknowledging potential inaccuracies that are inherent to the analysis. We have revised the text in order to clearly acknowledge this limitation.</p><p>On line 497 we write:</p><p>&quot;The framework we present is currently conceptual.&quot;</p><p>On line 520 we write:</p><p>&quot;For these reasons, among others, the framework presented here is not intended to be used as a stand-alone tool for determining microbial function.

In parallel, confirming predictions made in various environments will support an iterative process that will strengthen the predictive power of the framework and improve its accuracy as a tool for generating testable hypotheses.

It's puzzling how to deal with such a great number of GSMMs that is for sure, especially when coming from such an environment as soil and the vast majority of their corresponding MAGs represent most likely novel taxa. One alternative approach for using CarveMe might be to use the rich medium as a medium to gap-fill during the reconstruction. In this case, the gene annotation scores that CarveMe calculates in its initial step, are used to prioritise the reactions selected for gap-filling. This would lead to a new series of challenges but might be a useful comparison with the current GSMMs of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Though indeed CraveMe includes a gap-filling option, here we have purposely avoided the gapfilling option as we aimed to adhere to genomic content of the corresponding genomes and to avoid masking their metabolic dependencies emerging due to their incompleteness.

However, it does not ensure that when a metabolite is being secreted, another does the same too. That could lead to an overrepresentation of secreted metabolites after each iteration. To my understanding, unbiased methods focusing on metabolite exchanges would be a much better alternative for such questions. Unbiased constraint-based methods are known for requiring essential computational requirements, yet when focusing on specific parts of the models, recent implementations support them. A great showcase of such techniques is presented in [2].</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, FVA solutions return all <italic>potential</italic> metabolic fluxes in GSMMs (ranges of all fluxes satisfying the objective function, which by default is set to biomass increase) but they do not ensure that all fluxes actually co-occur (i.e., when a metabolite is secreted necessarily another metabolite is secreted too). However, though FVA solutions do not necessarily ensure cooccurrence regarding secretion and uptake, they provide a broader metabolic picture (the full set of potential solutions), unlike the arbitrary single solution provided by FBA, which is limited in providing information about potential secretions and uptakes in a specific environment. Here, we tried to elucidate the connection between a specific environment (root exudates) and the growth and metabolic capabilities of native bacteria. To the best of our understanding, unbiased approaches (such as the one displayed in Wedmark et al.36) are not environment dependent but rather calculate all possible metabolic elements and routes within a metabolic network. Therefore, using FVA is well adapted to explore environment-dependent growth. The sensitivity of FVA predicted active fluxes to the environments is now also implied by Sup. Fig. 3B demonstrating the number of potential active fluxes is proportional to growth performances. In addition, inquiring all possible metabolic routes across a large dataset of hundreds of MAGS, is central to the current analysis, thus the easy implementation of FVA further justifies its use in the current study.</p><p>An alternative strategy to reduce inflated FVA predictions and further constrain the solution space of predicted active fluxes can be the incorporation of additional layers of `omics data, as for example was done in the work of Zampieri et al5.

Currently, the complexity of the soil community might impede or at least constrain a high coverage recovery of transcriptomic data, though future works utilizing additional layers of `omics data are expected to significantly reduce the number of potential solutions and thus improve the accuracy of GEMs predictions.</p><p>This is now discussed in the text.

As they state in line 293, Archaea may play an essential role in the community. Yet, among the high-quality MAGs only one corresponded to Archaea.
