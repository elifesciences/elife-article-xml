molecular mechanism in tumorigenesis has not been established. We used genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells with physiological telomerase expression to elucidate the mechanism by which these mutations contribute to human disease. Surprisingly, telomerase-expressing embryonic stem cells engineered to carry any of the three most frequent TERT promoter mutations showed only a modest increase in TERT transcription with no impact on telomerase activity. However, upon differentiation into somatic cells, which normally silence telomerase, cells with TERT promoter mutations failed to silence TERT expression, resulting in increased telomerase activity and aberrantly long telomeres. Thus, TERT promoter mutations are sufficient to overcome the proliferative barrier imposed by telomere shortening without additional tumor-selected mutations. These data establish that TERT promoter mutations can promote immortalization and tumorigenesis of incipient cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07918.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07918.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07918.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The bulk of the DNA in the human genome is divided between 23 pairs of chromosomes. The ends of these chromosomes contain a repetitive stretch of DNA known as a telomere. Every time a cell divides, a portion of the telomere is lost and can be restored by an enzyme called telomerase.</p><p>If the telomeres shorten below a critical length, the cell can no longer divide and eventually dies. Thus, long telomeres increase the number of times a cell can divide. In the majority of human cells—with the exception of stem cells—telomerase activity is absent due to the down regulation of the active protein component (called TERT) after birth. Therefore, the telomeres in these cells shorten after each cell division. However, 90% of human cancers have very high TERT activity, which enables them to divide continuously to drive tumor growth.</p><p>Genes are sections of DNA that code for proteins and other molecules. The start of a gene contains a region known as the promoter, which controls when and where in the body the gene is active. Cancer cells often contain mutations in the promoter of the gene that encodes TERT. However, it remains poorly understood how these mutations lead to the formation of tumors.</p><p>Chiba et al. have now used a technique called genome editing to introduce mutations that are commonly found in cancer cells into the promoter of the gene for TERT in human embryonic stem cells. Unexpectedly, these changes did not increase the activity of the telomerase enzyme in these cells, nor did they increase the length of the telomeres.</p><p>Chiba et al. next caused these genetically engineered stem cells to develop into more specialized cell types—such as nerve cells. These ‘differentiated’ cells normally silence the gene that encodes TERT, but the mutations prevented the gene from being silenced. This led to abnormally high levels of telomerase activity and long telomeres. The experiments also showed that TERT activity in these cells was similar to that found in cancer cells that can divide indefinitely.</p><p>Cells containing the promoter mutations were then injected into mice. The cells formed a mass of tumors that contained very long telomeres. These results together suggest that cancer-causing mutations in the gene for TERT stop this gene from being properly silenced in more specialized cells, and that this, on its own, can promote the formation of tumors. These findings are likely to underpin future efforts to treat cancers by targeting the expression and activity of the telomerase enzyme.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07918.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07918.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>telomerase TERT</kwd><kwd>immortalization</kwd><kwd>cancer mechanism</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd><kwd>tumor spectrum</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/CRISPR-associated systems 9 CAS9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hockemeyer</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hockemeyer</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 RCA196884A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiba</surname><given-names>Kunitoshi</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Joshua Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Vogan</surname><given-names>Jacob M</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Tina</given-names></name><name><surname>Hockemeyer</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TERT promoter mutations impair TERT silencing upon cellular differentiation and are sufficient to facilitate cellular immortalization without additional tumor selected changes, explaining why they are associated with a very specific tumor spectrum.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activation of telomerase is the critical step for the immortalization of more than 90% of all human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greider and Blackburn, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Counter, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 1994</xref>). Non-coding mutations in the promoter of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT) emerged recently as one of the most prevalent mutations in human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bojesen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Killela et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fredriksson et al.,2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weinhold et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, all TERT promoter mutations associated with cancer formation thus far generate novel binding sites for the ETS (E26 transformation-specific) family of transcription factors and are located close to the translational start site of TERT (e.g., −57A/C, −124C/T, and −146C/T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Transient transfection experiments using ectopic TERT Luciferase-reporter constructs suggest that TERT promoter mutations can increase TERT transcription by 1.5–2 fold when assayed in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). To date, the physiological events that select for these specific mutations are still unclear, as they have been mostly investigated for their impact in tumor cell lines that are already immortal, maintain telomere length, and have aberrant karyotypes. These tumor cell lines have sufficient telomerase activity to maintain an immortal phenotype, but so do tumor cells without these TERT promoter mutations. Thus, changes in telomerase levels and telomere length provide incomplete information regarding the functional differences between cells that do or do not carry TERT promoter mutations.</p><p>In untransformed human tissues, telomerase activity is restricted to embryonic cells and some adult stem cell or progenitor compartments due to transcriptional silencing of TERT upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gunes and Rudolph, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aubert, 2014</xref>). As a consequence, differentiated somatic cells undergo progressive telomere shortening with cell division, which limits their proliferative capacity and has thus been proposed as a tumor suppressor mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wright et al., 1996</xref>). Critically short telomeres are detected as sites of DNA damage leading to cell death or replicative senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palm and de Lange, 2008</xref>). Long-term inhibition of TERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herbert et al., 1999</xref>) or interference with telomerase recruitment to telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sexton et al., 2014</xref>) lead to cell death in telomerase-positive cancer and stem cells. Inversely, ectopic telomerase expression is sufficient to immortalize normal human fibroblasts by allowing them to bypass senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodnar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morales et al., 1999</xref>). Since the discovery of telomerase reactivation in cancer, many <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements and corresponding transcription factors have been suggested to contribute to the regulation of TERT in healthy cells and its aberrant expression in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greenberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ducrest et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin and Elledge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kyo et al., 2008</xref>). GWAS analysis identified a specific set of TERT promoter mutations in melanomas that all occur in a very small region close to the transcriptional start site and each results in novel putative TTCCGG- ETS binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). While ETS-factors are a large family of transcription factors that can recognize this binding site, recent data suggest that TERT promoter mutations are bound predominantly by GABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell et al., 2015</xref>). This specificity does not appear restricted to melanomas as the same TERT promoter mutations have emerged as a major driver in a multitude of human solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidenreich et al., 2014</xref>), including glioblastomas, medulloblastomas, carcinomas of the bladder, urothelial cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borah et al., 2015</xref>), thyroid and squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue, as well as in liposarcomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidenreich et al., 2014</xref>). Based on this tumor spectrum, TERT promoter mutations have been hypothesized to preferentially promote tumor progression in tissues with relatively low rates of self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Killela et al., 2013</xref>). Several studies have suggested that TERT promoter mutations can provide a biomarker to stratify human cancer subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidenreich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borah et al., 2015</xref>). However, the mechanism by which these mutations promote tumor formation is unknown. The key outstanding questions are: (1) whether TERT promoter mutations are sufficient to immortalize cells and (2) why TERT promoter mutations occur in specific tumors subtypes.</p><p>Here we address these questions by genetically engineering human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to carry the three most prevalent cancer-associated TERT promoter mutations in an isogenic background. The impact of these mutations was studied by measuring their effect on TERT expression, telomerase activity, and telomere length in stem cells as well as in differentiated cell types. We demonstrate that two out of three cancer-associated TERT mutations caused no effect and only the most prevalent promoter mutations mildly increased TERT levels in hESCs, which did not result in significantly increased telomerase activity. We find that increased TERT expression is not functionally linked to an increase in active telomerase, as TR, the telomerase RNA component, but not TERT is limiting in hESCs. However, the importance of these mutations in tumorigenesis becomes clear when hESCs are differentiated into normally telomerase-negative cells. Under these conditions all cancer-associated TERT mutations prevent repression of TERT, resulting in a retention of telomerase activity relative to wild-type differentiated cells. Ultimately, the resulting TERT expression led to aberrant telomerase enzymatic activity in terminally differentiated cells and abnormally long telomeres, thereby bypassing the telomere shortening tumor suppressor pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analyzing cancer-associated TERT promoter mutations in hESCs</title><p>We aimed to understand the molecular basis by which the cancer-associated TERT mutations impact telomerase biology. To address this question, we employed CAS9- (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated systems 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>) mediated genome editing to derive human pluripotent stem cells (WIBR#3) that carry TERT promoter mutations at the endogenous TERT locus. Initially we attempted conventional donor-based genome editing strategies with sgRNAs targeting sequences proximal to the targeting site. These attempts were however unsuccessful, likely due to the TERT promoter mutations being in a genomic region with ∼80% GC content. This non-random base composition does not allow for the design of specific sgRNAs without a large number of potential off-targets. We tested several sgRNAs in proximity to TERT promoter mutations and found them to be toxic to cells shortly after transfection into cancer cells and human primary fibroblasts. We overcame this challenge by employing a two-step targeting approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a first editing step we homozygously deleted a 1.5 kb region in the TERT gene using two sgRNAs that cut at positions −1462 and +67 relative to the first ATG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a second editing step we reintroduced the deleted region either with or without the promoter mutations into the endogenous TERT locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07918.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of isogenic TERT promoter mutation-containing hESCs reveals a modest increase of TERT expression only for the −124C/T mutation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the two-step approach used to genome-edit TERT promoter mutations in hESCs. First, TERT knock-out cell line (TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup>) that lacks 1.5 kb upstream and 66 bp downstream of the first ATG was established using two CAS9/sgRNAs (sg-1 and sg-15). Second, an sgRNA against the newly synthesized NHEJ-derived junction (−1462 and +67: sg1+15; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) were co-electroporated with donor plasmids containing the deleted regions with or without the cancer-associated TERT promoter mutations.

(<bold>D</bold>) Telomere restriction fragment assay of wild-type (WT), TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup>, and the targeted hESCs over a time course after targeting (day 0: first editing step, day 73: second editing). TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> #1 cells are telomerase-deficient, undergo telomere shortening and die around day 120 unless they regain telomerase activity through the second targeting step. At the first time point (day 101), the majority of the cells are untargeted TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> cells, therefore telomere length is heterogeneous and short. This short telomere length results in reduced hybridization intensity with the TTAGGG radioactive probe. In contrast at the second time point (day 129), uncomplemented TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> #1 died due to progressive telomere shortening and the targeted populations are enriched. In this targeted population the restoration of telomerase resulted in substantial telomere elongation and an overall increase in telomere signal intensity. 2 µg of genomic DNA after digestion with MboI and AluI were loaded in each lane. Quantification of the average telomere length signal is indicated at the bottom of the gel. Throughout all figures we refer to non-targeted wild-type WIBR#3 hESCs as WT.

As expected from our previous characterization of TERT<sup>−/−</sup> hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sexton et al., 2014</xref>), these cells proliferated normally for 3 to 4 months, followed by cell death due to progressive telomere shortening with no survivors after 140 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sexton et al., 2014</xref>). In a second targeting step we edited the newly formed genomic site with a specific sgRNA spanning the new junction (−1462 to +67) to reinsert and restore the deleted region with either the wild-type promoter or an altered region containing the most frequent cancer-associated TERT promoter mutations: −57A/C, −124C/T, or −146C/T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This complementation approach restored the TERT gene and cellular viability of targeted cells. Accordingly, cells with a restored TERT gene gradually outcompeted none-rescued parental TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> cells and lead to substantial telomere elongation by the time untargeted TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> hESCs had died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This complementation strategy therefore successfully generated hESCs that differed exclusively at the TERT locus by expressing TERT either from its wild-type promoter or from a promoter that contained one of the cancer-associated point mutations.</p><p>We first analyzed the impact of the TERT promoter mutations on TERT mRNA levels by qRT-PCR until cultures established stable TERT expression levels and all TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> had died (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This analysis revealed that the most frequent TERT mutation (−124C/T) resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in TERT expression when compared to the isogenic wild-type control. This increase is in agreement with previous reports that evaluated these mutations using Luciferase reporter constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Noticeably, the two other mutations did not result in similarly increased TERT expression in hESCs. We confirmed this finding for an independent TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and individual single cell-derived hemizygously targeted clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, the promoter mutation cell lines carrying the −124C/T mutation had elevated levels of TERT mRNA expression, without a equivalent increase in telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TR, but not TERT is limiting for telomerase in hESCs</title><p>A lack of a significant change in telomerase activity despite increased TERT levels in hESCs that carry the −124C/T mutations suggested that TERT mRNA levels are not rate-limiting for telomerase activity in hESCs. Similar observations were made previously for some tumor cell lines in which telomerase activity is limited by levels of TR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cristofari and Lingner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xu and Blackburn, 2007</xref>), and might explain the tissue-specific impact of TERT and TR mutations in patients with dyskeratosis congenita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batista et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armanios and Blackburn, 2012</xref>). Telomerase biogenesis is a complex biological process that has been shown in human pluripotent stem cells to depend on several activities that, when depleted, can become limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Batista et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batista and Artandi, 2013</xref>). To test the hypothesis that in wild type human pluripotent stem cells TR is the limiting factor for telomerase activity, we ectopically expressed TERT, TR, or both from the AAVS1 safe harbor locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hockemeyer et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The introduction of such transgenes into this locus in isogenic settings overcomes concerns of random integration of the transgene. Overexpression levels were verified by western and northern blotting and qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and quantitative analysis showed that TERT mRNA was overexpressed &gt;40 fold and TR levels by approximately 20 fold. TERT protein was detectable by immunoblotting when overexpressed, contrasted to the lack of detectable endogenous TERT protein. In addition, we determined telomerase activity levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>) and telomere length changes in hESCs 36 days after targeting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). TR overexpression strongly increased telomerase activity and led to rapid telomere elongation in hESCs, while overexpression of TERT alone did neither. However, when differentiated into fibroblasts or neural precursor cells (NPCs), we observed the inverse behavior. In this setting, telomerase activity levels were significantly increased when TERT was overexpressed while increased levels of TR did not affect telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This finding showed that in hESCs TERT levels were not limiting, and that increased TERT expression did not result in a significant increase of telomerase activity or telomere length. Hence, hESCs are unlikely to reveal the impact of the TERT promoter mutations. Therefore, observation of the effect of TERT promoter mutations requires the analysis of differentiated cells in which TERT down-regulation results in it becoming limiting for telomerase activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07918.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Telomerase activity is restricted by levels of TERT in differentiated cells while TR is limiting in wild-type hESCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Targeting schematic of GFP, 3XFLAG-TERT (F-TERT), TR, and F-TERT+TR overexpression from the AAVS1 locus in wild-type hESCs.

Although TERT expression was successfully down-regulated in cells with wild-type TERT promoter, all three promoter mutation lines retained significant levels of TERT expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This failure of TERT transcriptional silencing became apparent as early as 3 days after the induction of differentiation and accumulated into a fourfold increase in TERT expression in cells that carried the −57A/C or the −146C/T mutation and an 8–12-fold increase in cells in which transcription depended on the endogenous TERT promoter with the −124C/T mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). This failure to appropriately repress TERT transcription during EB differentiation became even more apparent when the cells were differentiated into fibroblast-like cells.

In contrast, fibroblasts with the cancer-associated promoter mutations showed high levels of TERT expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

To address this issue, we first generated NPCs using the highly robust dual SMAD inhibition protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>), establishing NPCs that can be maintained in culture for extended periods of time with low levels of telomerase expression. These NPCs can be further differentiated towards terminally differentiated non-proliferating post mitotic neurons that are characterized by the expression of the pan-neural marker proteins TUJ1 and NEUN. Independent of their genotype, all cells were able to differentiate into NPCs and neurons showing equal down-regulation of OCT4 expression and induction of neuronal marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).

For noncoding mutations identified by GWAS, this is a particular challenge. Here we were able to dissect how the most frequent noncoding mutations in human cancer exert their tumorigenic effect. We are able to do so because cancer genomics have identified candidate mutations, genome editing is facile and robust, and we tested the effects in an otherwise wild-type background, thus being able to attribute a phenotypic effect specifically to a single genetic change.</p><p>Using genome editing of the endogenous TERT locus we generated a panel of three hESC lines that differed exclusively at a single position in the TERT promoter associated with cancer. Analyzing the impact of these mutations in hESCs, we showed that the most frequent mutation, −124C/T, increased TERT mRNA levels in hESCs by about 2–3 fold. However, neither the −57A/C nor the −146C/T mutation led to an increase in TERT transcription, despite the fact that these mutations generate the same putative ETS-binding motif of TTCCGG. This suggests a strong positional effect between the location of the ETS mutation and the core transcription initiation machinery. The possibility of such context-dependent positional constraints between the TERT promoter mutations and the core transcriptional machinery is further supported by the fact that a single point mutation at position −89 (C/G, −31 bp upstream of the TSS) would result in the same TTCCGG sequence. The fact that this mutation has as of now not been reported to be associated with cancer despite it being between the −57 and −124 sites is likely due to the need of the core transcription factors to bind to this site. It is intriguing to speculate why all promoter mutations are located in close proximity to the TSS; it seems possible that TERT transcriptional regulation is closely linked with the core transcriptional machinery rather than regulated through the canonical positioning of transcription factors along an extended promoter. The experimental approach established in this study of genome editing the TERT promoter provides an experimental system to uncover <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that are necessary for telomerase expression in stem cells and its transcriptional regulation upon differentiation.</p><p>Increased expression of TERT mRNA in −124C/T containing hESCs did not lead to a significant increase in telomerase activity or pronounced telomere lengthening, establishing that in hESCs TR levels, but not TERT levels, are limiting for telomerase assembly and telomere lengthening. Therefore, immortal hESCs are as uninformative with regard to cancer-associated TERT mutations as immortal tumor tissue or cell lines. However, whereas upon differentiation wild-type hESCs efficiently silence TERT transcription, resulting in loss of telomerase activity and telomere shortening, the cancer-associated TERT promoter mutations were sufficient to maintain expression of TERT and resulted in telomerase activity levels comparable to immortal cancer cell lines. These experiments uncover that the underlying cancer-causing mechanism is likely a failure to repress telomerase upon differentiation into somatic cells. It is remarkable that TERT promoter mutations are sufficient to up-regulate TERT expression without additional cancer-selected changes in the genome such as increased levels of ETS factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>An explanation for the tumor spectrum of TERT promoter mutations</title><p>TERT promoter mutations are not frequently found in leukemias and colorectal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidenreich et al., 2014</xref>).

During the genesis of these tumors, telomere shortening might present a challenge at a later stage when cells have already outcompeted their neighbors.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07918.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model explaining the tumor spectrum associated with TERT promoter mutations.</title><p>Shown are the differential outcomes of a cell acquiring a cancer-associated TERT promoter mutation or a proliferation-inducing mutation dependent on telomere length of the cell. (<bold>A</bold>) In a cell with long telomeres and telomerase activity, a proliferation-promoting mutation will result in a strong proliferative advantage and can act as the tumor-initiating event. Cells with long telomeres arise from tissues that have a telomerase positive stem cell compartment such as the hematopoietic or intestinal system. In contrast, mutations in the TERT promoter do not provide a proliferative advantage, they are neutral and do not promote tumor formation. Cell states are depicted on the left; cells that acquire mutations are shown in red. A schematic depicting telomere length changes as a function of the number of cell divisions is shown on the right. The dashed line indicates the critical telomere length at which cells are subjected to the Hayflick limit and stop proliferating or die. The red line indicates the telomere length changes predicted for cells that acquire either a proliferation-promoting mutation (top) or a TERT promoter mutation (bottom). The blue line indicates the telomere length changes predicted for wild-type cells. Indicated is a case where telomere shortening is suppressed by the TERT promoter mutations. However, since these cell already have long telomeres and/or naturally express telomerase, telomeres in neither wild-type cells or cells acquiring a proliferation inducing mutation will shorten to the point that the cells are subjected to the Hayflick limit. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic as shown in (<bold>A</bold>) but for a telomerase negative cells with short telomeres. A proliferation-promoting mutation will also provide a growth advantage in telomerase-negative differentiated cells with short telomeres, however, these cells will enter replicative senescence or die. In contrast, a cell with short telomeres acquiring a TERT promoter mutation can bypass the Hayflick limit (dashed lines), immortalize, and outcompete its neighboring cells. Cell states are depicted on the left; cells that acquire mutations are shown in red. Schematic depicting telomere length changes as a function of the number of cell divisions is shown on the right.

In these cell types TERT promoter mutations will provide an immediate and strong proliferative advantage over neighboring cells. In this case telomerase activation occurs in cells in which telomerase is absent or low and which have an otherwise mostly intact genome. In these cells activating TERT promoter mutations will be present in most tumor cells and detected as a frequent and thus early event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that this model depicts the very extreme cases of a TERT-positive adult stem cell with long telomeres contrasted to the expected outcome of a TERT promoter mutation in a telomerase-negative cell with short telomeres. Likely this sharp distinction between canonical telomerase-positive stem cell compartments and telomerase-negative compartments is rather continuous in vivo<italic>.</italic> Telomerase expression, telomere length, and the number of cell divisions will differ between tissues and with age and therefore the benefit of the TERT promoter mutation will be complexly graded. Given this, it will be critical to determine exactly which cells of the human body are telomerase-positive, when and how telomerase is silenced upon differentiation, and how many divisions cells undergo in human tissue after becoming telomerase-negative.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Telomerase inhibition as a cancer treatment</title><p>Telomerase inhibition has been proposed as a target for cancer therapies. We demonstrate that TERT promoter mutations are sufficient to de-repress TERT, providing a potential target to inhibit TERT expression and telomerase activity.</p><p>In order to identify therapeutic approaches specific to these promoter mutations, a model system in which TERT is dysregulated solely by these mutations is necessary. Our model system fulfills this requirement and allows for a direct assessment of any potential inhibition by measuring TERT expression following differentiation. In contrast, this approach will be challenging in cancer cells, as TERT mRNA levels, telomerase levels, and telomere length vary dramatically regardless of whether they carry any of the TERT promoter mutations. Further mechanistic studies in such tumor cells are also challenged by the high frequency of concurrent TERT copy number variations, promoter polymorphisms, and cancer-associated dysregulation of factors implicated in TERT regulation such as MYC. As such, it will be challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of such an inhibitor due to these potentially compensatory effects arising from these misregulations. As such, it is imperative to test any potential therapeutic approach directed at these promoter mutations in a model system that only carries these mutations in an otherwise wild-type background, such as the model system described here. Specifically targeting the TERT promoter mutations is an attractive approach, as TERT promoter mutations are exclusive to the tumor cells and are not present in surrounding normal tissue. Therefore, any intervention that is targeted specifically against their mode of operation is expected to affect tumor cell survival, but not the telomerase-positive adult stem cells of the patient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>hESC culture</title><p>Genome-editing experiments were performed in WIBR#3 hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lengner et al., 2010</xref>), NIH stem cell registry # 0079.

Cells were sorted for GFP fluorescence 72 hr after electroporation. Single-cell derived hES colonies were isolated and their targeting was confirmed by Southern blotting and PCR followed by sequencing. 120 clones were analyzed and three homozygous targeted hESC lines (TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup>) were obtained. For the second targeting, px330 plasmids were designed with sgRNAs against the newly formed NHEJ-derived junction site in TERT<sup>Δ/Δ</sup> cells and electroporated with 35 µg of a repair plasmid that carried either the wild type TERT promoter element (wt) or the respective TERT promoter mutations (57A/C, 124 C/T, 146C/T).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom served as guest Reviewing editor. One of the peer reviewers, Steven Artandi, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers agree that this is an excellent and rigorously performed study providing a compelling and exciting narrative regarding the effects of highly recurrent mutations in the TERT promoter associated with many human cancers.</p><p>The manuscript addresses the 20-year old question of how telomerase is activated in human cancer. From the seminal work of Garraway and Kumar a few years ago, it is clear that one route is through mutations in the hTERT promoter that create ETS binding sites. It was proposed that ETS transcription factor augment expression of hTERT and indeed a 2-4 fold increase in expression was noted with the mutant promoter linked to luciferase in comparison with the wild type form of the promoter (transfection experiments in cancer cell lines). From work on dyskeratosis congenita, it is known that a 2-fold reduction in telomerase can have major impact but whether a mild increase could explain the tumorigenic potential of the mutations has not been established.</p><p>The current work examines the mechanism by which the promoter mutations act using a two-step CRISPR knockin approach in human ES cells and then studying the effect of the mutations on telomerase and telomere length maintenance upon differentiation. The striking observation is that the mutant promoter becomes resistant to the silencing that normally occurs upon ES cell differentiation. Thus, the promoter mutations act by abrogating the off-switch that normally ensures telomerase silencing, thwarting the telomere shortening program that limits tumorigenesis. These results and conclusions are highly significant to the cancer field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript examines the effect of TERT promoter mutations with respect to telomerase activity and telomere length. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows the hTERT expression is likely to continue to decrease after 15 days if it continues on the same trajectory. Is 15 days the right time point? It remains unclear whether these mutations have the capacity to shift the Hayflick limit or delay/bypass senescence. Do the authors have information on whether these fibroblasts are truly immortal?</p><p>2) The presentation of the model attempting to explain why TERT promoter mutations occur in certain tumor types, but not in others, could perhaps be more nuanced, and may be a little premature since additional TERT activating mutations may surface from further analysis in cancer that are currently thought to not fall in this category. Also, the authors draw a sharp distinction between “canonical telomerase-positive stem cell compartments” in which TERT promoter mutations would not be beneficial, and others in which they would confer selective advantage. Given our dearth of knowledge about the lineage hierarchy in many organs, these statements should perhaps be worded more cautiously. Also, it would be helpful the paper should contain a figure (or a figure adaptation) specifically depicting the frequency of TERT mutations across all human cancer types for the edification of the reader.

Do the authors have information on whether these fibroblasts are truly immortal</italic>?</p><p>The reviewers raise a very important point. The reviewers point out that hESCs that carry the TERT promoter mutation still down-regulate TERT levels upon differentiation. However, unlike wild-type cells, they fail to fully silence TERT levels in differentiated cells. As TERT levels do not seem limiting in hESCs the reduction of TERT levels is not directly proportional to telomerase activity, so that the residual TERT levels (5-9% compared to hESCs) in TERT promoter mutation-containing cells levels result in levels of telomerase that are equivalent to the levels found in immortal tumor cells. To address the reviewers’ concern that that TERT levels might further decrease and that TERT is fully silenced even in TERT promoter mutation-containing cells, we have now included additional RT-PCR data that analyze TERT levels 40 and 45 days after differentiation. Here, we find that all three TERT promoter mutation-containing cell lines also maintain TERT levels of about 5% compared to hESCs even at the late time points of differentiation and have long telomeres. We fully agree with the reviewers that TERT levels and telomere length maintenance are indirect measures for immortality and that it is not clear how many additional cellular divisions are ultimately granted by these additional TERT promoter mutations. We appreciate the reviewers’ concern that we are not directly testing immortalization and only provide indirect evidence.</p><p>Using these points, we have revised the Discussion appropriately.</p><p><italic>2) The presentation of the model attempting to explain why TERT promoter mutations occur in certain tumor types, but not in others, could perhaps be more nuanced, and may be a little premature since additional TERT activating mutations may surface from further analysis in cancer that are currently thought to not fall in this category.

We have revised the text so that it becomes clear that telomerase expression, telomere length, and number of cell divisions are expected to differ between tissues and that therefore the benefit for the TERT promoter mutation will be complexly graded. As the reviewers correctly point out, our model presents the extreme cases of a telomerase-negative differentiated cell with short telomeres compared to a telomerase-positive adult stem cell with long telomeres. Following the reviewers’ suggestion we now include an adaptation of a table that describes the frequencies with which TERT promoter mutations are found in different cancer types.</p></body></sub-article></article>
