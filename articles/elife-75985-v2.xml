There is an urgent need for clinically valuable and generalizable triage tools assisting the allocation of hospital resources, particularly in resource-limited countries. We developed and validate CODOP, a machine learning-based tool for predicting the clinical outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. CODOP was trained, tested and validated with six cohorts encompassing 29223 COVID-19 patients from more than 150 hospitals in Spain, the USA and Latin America during 2020–22. CODOP uses 12 clinical parameters commonly measured at hospital admission for reaching high discriminative ability up to 9 days before clinical resolution (AUROC: 0·90–0·96), it is well calibrated, and it enables an effective dynamic risk stratification during hospitalization. Furthermore, CODOP maintains its predictive ability independently of the virus variant and the vaccination status. To reckon with the fluctuating pressure levels in hospitals during the pandemic, we offer two online CODOP calculators, suited for undertriage or overtriage scenarios, validated with a cohort of patients from 42 hospitals in three Latin American countries (78–100% sensitivity and 89–97% specificity). The performance of CODOP in heterogeneous and geographically disperse patient cohorts and the easiness of use strongly suggest its clinical utility, particularly in resource-limited countries.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>While COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives, new variants, waxing immunity, unequal rollout and relaxation of mitigation strategies mean that the pandemic will keep on sending shockwaves across healthcare systems. In this context, it is crucial to equip clinicians with tools to triage COVID-19 patients and forecast who will experience the worst forms of the disease. Prediction models based on artificial intelligence could help in this effort, but the task is not straightforward.</p><p>Indeed, the pandemic is defined by ever-changing factors which artificial intelligence needs to cope with. To be useful in the clinic, a prediction model should make accurate prediction regardless of hospital location, viral variants or vaccination and immunity statuses. It should also be able to adapt its output to the level of resources available in a hospital at any given time. Finally, these tools need to seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows to not burden clinicians.</p><p>In response, Klén et al. built CODOP, a freely available prediction algorithm that calculates the death risk of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (https://gomezvarelalab.em.mpg.de/codop/). This model was designed based on biochemical data from routine blood analyses of COVID-19 patients. Crucially, the dataset included 30,000 individuals from 150 hospitals in Spain, the United States, Honduras, Bolivia and Argentina, sampled between March 2020 and February 2022 and carrying most of the main COVID-19 variants (from the original Wuhan version to Omicron). CODOP can predict the death or survival of hospitalized patients with high accuracy up to nine days before the clinical outcome occurs. These forecasting abilities are preserved independently of vaccination status or viral variant.</p><p>The next step is to tailor the model to the current pandemic situation, which features increasing numbers of infected people as well as accumulating immune protection in the overall population. Further development will refine CODOP so that the algorithm can detect who will need hospitalisation in the next 24 hours, and who will need admission in intensive care in the next two days. Equipping primary care settings and hospitals with these tools will help to restore previous standards of health care during the upcoming waves of infections, particularly in countries with limited resources.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>machine-learning</kwd><kwd>prediction</kwd><kwd>triage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Publication cost</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gómez-Varela</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The generalizability of <italic>CODOP</italic> in distinct world regions and its flexibility to reckon with the changing availability of hospital resources makes it a clinically useful tool potentially improving the outcome prediction and the management of COVID-19 hospitalized patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the first reported case in Wuhan at the end of 2019, COVID-19 has exerted extreme pressure on hospitals throughout the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the pandemic as the direct cause of more than six million deaths. Despite the decreased number of hospitalizations and deaths among vaccinated people, warning signs forecast a scenario with health systems under severe strains leading to a bigger number of COVID-19 related deaths. The appearance of viral variants that are more contagious and that carry a higher risk of hospitalization, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Twohig et al., 2022</xref>) the waning of the immune protection, the significant amount of infections in vaccinated individuals (breakthrough infections) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shen, 2022</xref>) together with their ability to transmit the virus, and the slow and unequal rollout of vaccines worldwide, support recent models showing that a vaccine-alone exit strategy will likely not be sufficient to contain further outbreaks and their consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Moore et al., 2021</xref>) At the time of submission of this study, many countries are reaching record-high numbers of infections, hospitalizations and deaths. This new pandemic wave depicts a worrisome prospect for resource-limited countries with similar or lower vaccination rates and with fewer clinical tools.</p><p>Prediction models that estimate the risk of death in hospitalized COVID-19 patients could be valuable both to clinicians and patients by assisting medical staff to stratify treatment strategies and by planning for the appropriate allocation of limited resources. Thus, numerous models have been developed to assist in triage decisions of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. However, independent evaluations have pointed out their lack of generalizability and their limited clinical use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wynants et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El-Solh et al., 2020</xref>) due to causes belonging to the ‘dataset shift’ problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Subbaswamy and Saria, 2020</xref>). Moreover, the heterogeneity of the host-pathogen interaction (what results in more than 60 disease subtypes of COVID-19 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeMerle et al., 2021</xref>) together with the fast evolution of the pandemic makes COVID-19 outcome prediction a challenging endeavour, especially if a profound evaluation using patient cohorts from geographically distinct regions is not performed. Finally, the effectiveness of these predictive models in patients with diverse immune protection (due to natural infection or vaccination) and patients infected by different Variants Of Concern (VOC) is unknown.</p><p>To address this need, we used the largest and the most geographically extended patient dataset to date for developing and extensively validating a simple yet clinically useful machine learning-based online model for doctors to predict mortality in COVID-19 patients at any time during hospitalization.

In model building only the training cohort was used and models were built using 10-fold cross-validation. In the feature selection stage of SIVS, 100 models were built and for each model selected variables were recorded. For reducing the number of features to as few as possible (therefore, increasing the easiness of use of CODOP), we tuned the weighting function in SIVS (called variable importance scoring) so that only features occurring in all of the 100 models were selected for the final model building stage. This method has shown to be very efficient, especially when the ratio of positive and negative outcomes is imbalanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klén et al., 2019</xref>). Lasso models were built in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">R Development Core Team, 2010</xref> (version 3.6.0) package glmnet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>) (version 4.1–1).

For converting numeric prediction into binary prediction, Youden’s J statistic was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Youden, 2006</xref>). For building the two online CODOP subtypes, we used alternative thresholds, which were selected to be the largest threshold value in the training cohort with a sensitivity of 95% for CODOP-Ovt and specificity of 95% for CODOP-Unt.

Thus, a clinically useful prediction tool needs to reckon with these dynamic scenarios for effectively assisting undertriage and overtriage decisions.</p><p>We developed and validated two subtypes of our predictor, CODOP-Ovt (from overtriage) and CODOP-Unt (from undertriage), intending to optimize the triage of patients at high risk of death upon arrival to the hospital and after their first blood analysis. CODOP-Ovt maximizes the negative predictive value or the detection of high-risk patients (high sensitivity) and it is meant for scenarios where overtriage is possible because hospital resources are not the main limitation. On the other side, CODOP-Unt maximizes the positive predictive value by trying to avoid the inclusion of false high-risk patients (high specificity) and it might be preferred in pandemic conditions when hospital resources are limited and undertriage needs to be considered.</p><p>Using the initial training cohort, CODOP-Ovt identified &gt;95% of the patients that finally died in hospital nine days before clinical resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These results strongly suggest that the online version of CODOP could represent a useful clinical tool in the triage decision protocols.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Discussion</title><p>The differential access to COVID-19 vaccines, the emergence of new viral variants of concern, the waning of the immune protection, and the relaxation of mitigation measurements anticipate a longer period of health systems under pressure due to an increasing number of COVID-19 patients, particularly in resource-limited countries. A conflagration-like scenario will likely be the final set of the pandemic for many nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kofman et al., 2021</xref>) As a result of an altruistic multicontinental effort, we developed and evaluated CODOP, a machine-learning-based online tool able to assist in triage decisions in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. CODOP uses 12 clinical parameters easy to collect in most hospitals. Its predictive performance among cohorts of patients with different geographical locations, vaccination statuses and infected by diverse VOCs, strongly suggests its generalizability and supports its potential for improving patient care during this pandemic.</p><p>CODOP satisfies the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Collins et al., 2015</xref>) (TRIPOD; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), follows the recently proposed MINimum Information for Medical AI Reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hernandez-Boussard et al., 2020</xref>) (MINIMAR; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and it has been successfully checked for the risk of bias and applicability using the Prediction model study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Moons et al., 2019</xref>) (PROBAST; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The use of such an early warning system as CODOP could potentially represent an important help in clinical decision-making including the prioritization of care and resource allocation. The novelty of the COVID-19 disease and its toll on the health systems has led to dozens of triage policies, many of them based on some form of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Raschke et al., 2021</xref>) In addition, several machine learning-based prediction tools have been developed during this pandemic. However, independent validation studies have dismissed the clinical utility of all these models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wynants et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El-Solh et al., 2020</xref>) and have indicated common pitfalls to be avoided such as small sample size, use of variables not easily measurable in most hospitals, and lack of external evaluation datasets gathered in geographically different cohorts, etc. To avoid this ‘dataset shift’ problem and aim to increase the generalization of CODOP, we set to satisfy the so-called stability property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Subbaswamy and Saria, 2020</xref>) For this we used an initial training and test cohorts encompassing 24,345 patients from more than 110 hospitals spread over Spain and the USA and gathered during three pandemic waves. Both the size, heterogeneity of the patient population (in terms of age range, ethnicity, comorbidities, etc.), and the myriad of clinical and analytical procedures performed during the pandemic, ensures a significant number of perturbations (shifts) in how the data were generated. This strategy seems to be supported by the stable performance of our predictor on the external online evaluation performed with a patient cohort gathered in 42 hospitals in three Latin American countries. Importantly, we demonstrate that the discriminative ability of CODOP is not hampered by the different immune protection status (either by infection or by vaccination) or by the type of VOC, which suggests that the inflammatory process underlying the clinical manifestations is similar in most of the hospitalized patients independently of their vaccination status or the type of VOC.</p><p>In addition to the characteristics of our cohorts, we hypothesized that the higher performance achieved by CODOP when compared to published mortality risk scores is due to the use of a group of biochemical parameters representing the main biological pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. A very common clinical manifestation in critical COVID-19 patients is composed of a deregulated immune response and a robust inflammatory reaction (known as ‘hypercytokinemia’ or ‘cytokine storm’), which ultimately leads to tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen and Quach, 2021</xref>) Recent reports show a downregulated type-I interferon response leading to an increase of neutrophils in severe COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). These findings go in line with our data showing alterations in several myeloid cells (eosinophils, monocytes) including an upregulation in the number of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Myeloid cells are crucial for mounting a successful immune response against viruses and for the existence of hypercytokinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bordon et al., 2013</xref>) The increased level of CRP and LDH in our dataset and their predictive value could represent easy-to-measure hallmarks of the exacerbated inflammatory response associated with a high risk of COVID-19-related death. These and other model features linked to thromboembolic complications (i.e. D-dimer and Platelets) and organ failure (i.e. Creatinine), could represent a warning signature easy to evaluate at early stages of the infection, even before failure in major functions can be monitored.</p><p>Several unique biomarkers have been suggested as surrogates for guiding clinical decisions in COVID-19 patients. As example, C-reactive Protein (CRP) is useful to recognize patients with an increased risk of mortality during hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stringer et al., 2021</xref>). However, the 12 parameter CODOP model has higher predictive performance than the CRP when analyzed as univariate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For other biomarkers (e.g. Interleukin 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coomes and Haghbayan, 2020</xref> or suPAR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Altintas et al., 2021</xref>), the elevated price of the analysis precludes its widely use in Emergency Departments, particularly in low-income countries. The advantage of a multi-parameter predictor like CODOP is based on its ability to represent the myriad of pathophysiological alterations (not only immune dysregulation) occurring during the evolution of the COVID-19 what might be the base for its good predictive capacity in a very diverse population. Further, CODOP is based on quantitative parameters that are very easy to obtain during the first examination of the patient. Of note, we analyzed the role of twelve patient comorbidities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in the performance of CODOP. Interestingly, while six comorbidities were chosen together with the same 12 biochemical parameters, their addition to CODOP did not improve its discriminative ability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The impossibility to evaluate this model with the six comorbidities in the external test and evaluation cohorts (due to the lack of these variables) made us decide not to include them in the final online predictor.</p><p>The quality, availability, and consistency of biomedical data make reproducibility very challenging for machine learning tools applied to health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McDermott et al., 2021</xref>) (MLH). The reproducibility of MLH is of critical importance as predictions can affect human health care. Careful analysis indicates that CODOP fulfils the main performance criteria reached in other machine learning subfields when analysing the three main reproducibility principles. In comparison to previous studies, CODOP excels in the ‘Conceptual Reproducibility or Replicability’ due to the use of geographically spread cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McDermott et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The overall performance of CODOP has inherent limitations, some of them generalizable to any MLH. On the one side, the use of training and test datasets with a high degree of perturbations (see above) adds several sources of variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aarsand et al., 2019</xref>): pre-analytical due to differences in blood sampling, analytical due to different laboratory protocols, intra- and inter-individual, and inter-hospital and geographical differences in clinical practices. As an additional factor, the high diversity of COVID-19 encompassing more than 60 disease subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeMerle et al., 2021</xref>) sets a limitation in terms of the discriminability ability and the overall clinical utility of any MHL. In contrast to other predictors, CODOP does not take into account the level of care received by each patient (e.g. ICU versus basic care), which influences the outcome of the patient and perturbs the discrimination ability of CODOP (as predictions are made with the data from blood analyses at hospital admission).</p><p>The proposed objective of CODOP is not to indicate a specific clinical treatment or decision (e.g. yes/no admission to ICU), but rather to inform physicians about the monitoring needs of patients (i.e. a higher death risk score suggests a closer monitorization of the patient). In this line, the analysis of a small court of patients (belonging to the Test 4 and the Argentinian COVID-19 Network cohorts) shows that CODOP is less effective for predicting the admission of a patient to the ICU or the need for mechanical ventilation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1t</xref>). Larger and more geographically diverse datasets are needed to find other parameters that could be the bases to better predict these clinical outcomes. Based on the ability of CODOP to stratify the severity of patients, CODOP could be an interesting tool to increase the number of expected critical events, therefore potentially reducing the sample size calculation. In the same line, CODOP could be useful for the analysis of observational studies.</p><p>The clinical utility of MHL has to take into account the changing pressure supported by hospitals during the successive pandemic waves. Our data support the strategy of using either CODOP-Unt or CODOP-Ovt as an effective first-line triage tool in the overall clinical decision procedure. We expect that future participation of more institutions from regions non-represented in our study (Africa, Asia) will improve the reproducibility and overall clinical utility of CODOP supporting subgroup-specific predictions (e.g. based on underlying comorbidities or ethnical background).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Data sharing</title><p>The raw patient data used in this study are not freely available due to legal restrictions of the ethical committees of the different hospitals.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jos Van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jesus Bermejo-Martin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The figures in the core of the manuscript are much influenced from the IT output and may generate ambiguity to the non-expert clinician to which the study is addressed. Figure 3A does not offer much. Figure 3B should make clear that high-risk and low-risk refers to the probability provide by the machine output.</p><p>– Supplementary Table 1 should move to the core of the text.</p><p>– The authors need to explain how the algorithm is applied in real life and the time to result. Information is also needed on how user-friendly this approach is.</p><p>– Can the authors provide some analysis if this risk identification approach surrogates for some specific treatment?</p><p>– The authors chose only age and laboratory parameters; they should explain why no comorbidities were considered for the model. Second, it would be interesting to provide information about how the model performs with other adverse outcomes except for mortality, such as intubation and ICU admission.</p><p>– The authors should discuss more about advantages/disadvantages of the model compared to single biomarkers of prediction (CRP, Il-6, sUPAR), some of which have been already used not only to predict but also to guide COVID-19 treatment (like sUPAR).</p><p>– The authors developed two sub-models, CODOP-OVT and CODOP-Unt to be applied in two different contexts depending on the degree of pressure on the hospitals attending COVID-19 patients. In this particular regard, the performance of CODOP-Unt regarding sensibility is far to be acceptable for real applications in clinical practice. In consequence, I do not understand what CODOP-Unt could be useful for, in reality. Can the authors comment on this point?</p><p>– Although the authors propose CODOP mostly to predict mortality and decide resources allocation, given the good performance of CODOP to stratify severity, it could also be useful in the design of clinical trials to include patients with similar severity in both the placebo or test groups. CODOP could serve thus as a kind of predictive enrichment tool in this scenario. Please discuss.</p><p>– The work was developed in the pre-omicron era. Although multi-level, multinational validation of CODOP seems to ensure their potential application in this scenario, do the authors think that its performance could be affected by Omicron?</p><p>– How the progressive extension of vaccination could affect the performance of CODOP, since vaccination could alter disease severity at clinical presentation?</p><p>– I would suggest a sub-analysis depending on the vaccinations status, if available, or at least a comment considering the percentage of vaccination in the involved countries in the time when CODOP was derived.</p><p>– It would be interesting to evaluate the performance of CODOP separately in men and women.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75985.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The figures in the core of the manuscript are much influenced from the IT output and may generate ambiguity to the non-expert clinician to which the study is addressed.

As indicated in the manuscript (page 8), the web application includes a detailed description of the CODOP project and instructions on how to use the prediction tool.</p><p>In short, CODOP offers an easy-to-use framework with the following steps:</p><p>a) The user has the opportunity to choose between CODOP-Ovt and CODOP-Unt in order to adjust for the clinical context (i.e., availability of resources).</p><p>b) The user introduces the values of the 12 variables either manually in the provided table (this is an option offered if the user would like to predict the death risk of a few patients), or by uploading a previously-prepared data table (this is an option offered for users that would like to predict the death risk of many patients). As a result, a binary prediction (high or low risk of death) is generated.</p><p>c) Following, a table with the original uploaded data plus the new predictions is created and can be downloaded in several formats.</p><p>Our performance tests indicate that predictions are obtained in less than 2 seconds (Page 8 of the revised version).</p><p>Finally, the web calculator does not store any patient information (therefore, fulfilling the GDPR) and has been tested with several Internet navigators on different operative Systems (Supplementary file 1l of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Can the authors provide some analysis if this risk identification approach surrogates for some specific treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>The predictive score provided by CODOP is useful for a detailed and continue monitoring of the disease due to its good predictive performance and its dependency on simple data that is easy to obtain when the patient is admitted. Thus, the proposed objective of CODOP is not to indicate a specific treatment, but rather to inform physicians about the monitoring needs of patients (i.e., a higher death risk score suggests a closer monitorization of the patient).</p><p>We now comment on this point in the Discussion section (highlighted in yellow on page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors chose only age and laboratory parameters; they should explain why no comorbidities were considered for the model.</p></disp-quote><p>The main reasons for solely considering laboratory parameters were the following:</p><p>1) The information regarding comorbidities was not available for all datasets included in this study. While this information was available for the SEMI-COVID dataset, it was not present in the external datasets (online validation datasets from Latin America and New York) that were key for the validation of CODOP.</p><p>2) Although not mentioned in the manuscript, we used the SEMI-COVID dataset for testing the influence of several comorbidities together with the whole panel of laboratory parameters indicated in the study. The following comorbidities were considered during the model building process: Diabetes, Cardiomyopathy, EPOC, Dementia, Hypertension, Stroke, Asthma, Cancer, Hyperlipidemia, Chronic Kidney Disease, Chronic Renal Disease, and Sleep Apnea. From these, only Cardiomyopathy, Stroke, EPOC, Dementia, Cancer, and Chronic Kidney Disease were selected after 100 iterations (see Model building procedure in Material and Methods). However, the performance of CODOP is similar when comparing a CODOP model with or without these 6 comorbidities (AUROC 0.893 vs. 0.889, respectively).</p><p>We now present these data in the revised version of the manuscript (Supplementary file 1r and 1s) and discuss the potential reasons and implications in the Discussion section (highlighted in yellow on pages 9-10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, it would be interesting to provide information about how the model performs with other adverse outcomes except for mortality, such as intubation and ICU admission.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><p>Neither ICU admission nor intubation data were present in the SEMI-COVID dataset that was made available to us.</p><p>To answer the reviewer’s request, we have incorporated three new datasets from the 12 de Octubre Hospital, the Costa del Sol Hospital, and the Argentinian COVID-19 Network database – all of them having information regarding admission to the ICU and the need of mechanical ventilation (MV). In total, these new datasets added 7198 new patients to our study, which were hospitalized from 2021-22 in 39 health centers.</p><p>For the sake of simplicity, we have combined the two Spanish datasets and named Test 4.</p><p>CODOP continues to have good performance for predicting in-hospital death, similarly to the datasets presented in the previous version of the manuscript (AUROC: 0.81 for Test 4 and 0.79 for the Argentinian COVID-19 Network database). However, CODOP it is less effective for predicting ICU admission (AUROC: 0.53 for Test 4 and 0.70 for the Argentinian COVID-19 Network database) and the need for MV (AUROC: 0.60 for Test 4 and 0.65 for the Argentinian COVID-19 Network database).</p><p>We now present these new data in the revised version of the manuscript (Supplementary file 1t) and commented in the Discussion section (highlighted in yellow on page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should discuss more about advantages/disadvantages of the model compared to single biomarkers of prediction (CRP, Il-6, sUPAR), some of which have been already used not only to predict but also to guide COVID-19 treatment (like sUPAR).</p></disp-quote><p>Several unique biomarkers have been suggested as surrogates for guiding clinical decisions in COVID-19 patients. Generally, the main drawbacks of these studies are the lack of validation in different populations/health systems and/or the limited clinical utility due to other factors, particularly in low-income countries (i.e., elevated price of the test). The advantage of CODOP is that it has a good predictive capacity in a very diverse population and it is based on parameters that are very easy to obtain during the first examination of the patient (at least in all the hospitals from the countries that validated CODOP).</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, C-reactive Protein (CRP), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), or suPAR are useful to recognize patients with increased risk of mortality during hospitalization (Stringer et al., Coomes et al., Altintas et al.). CRP is one of the variables incorporated in CODOP. However, the 12 parameter CODOP model has higher predictive performance than the CRP when analyzed as univariate (see Supplementary Table 3 of the revised manuscript). In our opinion, the better performance of such a multi-parameter predictor is based on the ability to better represent the myriad of pathophysiological alterations (not only immune dysregulation) occurring during the evolution of the COVID-19.</p><p>The IL-6 and suPAR are biomarkers associated with adverse outcomes, too. Our clinical collaborators confirmed that none of them is normally used in their Emergency Departments mainly due to their elevated price.</p><p>Following the suggestion from the reviewer, we have included a new paragraph in the Discussion section (highlighted in yellow on page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors developed two sub-models, CODOP-OVT and CODOP-Unt to be applied in two different contexts depending on the degree of pressure on the hospitals attending COVID-19 patients. In this particular regard, the performance of CODOP-Unt regarding sensibility is far to be acceptable for real applications in clinical practice. In consequence, I do not understand what CODOP-Unt could be useful for, in reality. Can the authors comment on this point?</p></disp-quote><p>During this pandemic, it has not been always possible to provide appropriate resources/treatment for all patients – a situation reached in limited resource places, particularly. In this scenario, undertriage was necessary. As a consequence, some patients at high risk of death will not receive adequate treatment. A predictive tool that could maximize the utilization of scarce resources will have a clear benefit.</p><p>For this reason, and as a request from some of our collaborators in Latin America, we set up CODOP-Unt for optimizing the identification of patients with the lowest risk of death (therefore, not being ranked as high priority patients for the use of limited resources). CODOP-Unt maximizes the positive predictive value by trying to avoid the inclusion of false high-risk patients (high specificity) and it might be preferred in pandemic conditions when hospital resources are limited and undertriage needs to be considered. As a result of maximizing the specificity, the sensitivity is significantly reduced.</p><p>We believe that CODOP-Unt could be considered as an additional tool in the final triage decisions together with other standardized parameters included in the current triage protocols of each hospital.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Although the authors propose CODOP mostly to predict mortality and decide resources allocation, given the good performance of CODOP to stratify severity, it could also be useful in the design of clinical trials to include patients with similar severity in both the placebo or test groups. CODOP could serve thus as a kind of predictive enrichment tool in this scenario. Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><p>We totally agree with the reviewer – CODOP could be an interesting alternative to randomization in the design of clinical trials for including patients with similar severity in both the placebo and test groups. Additionally, using CODOP to include patients with higher severity in a clinical trial will increase the number of expected critical events, therefore potentially reducing the sample size calculation. Another interesting possibility is the application of CODOP in observational studies.</p><p>We now discuss these possibilities in the Discussion section (highlighted in yellow on page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The work was developed in the pre-omicron era. Although multi-level, multinational validation of CODOP seems to ensure their potential application in this scenario, do the authors think that its performance could be affected by Omicron?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important point, which has prompted us to look for new data on patients infected with Omicron.</p><p>The newly incorporated dataset Test 4 (please, see above) encompass the whole Δ wave and more than two months of the Omicron (BA.1) wave in Spain (from Dec 15<sup>th</sup>, 2022 until Feb 27th, 2022). Our analysis (a total of 1728 patients for Δ and 1010 patients for Omicron) shows that CODOP is equally predictive as for the previous Variants Of Concern (AUROC: Δ 0.79, Omicron 0.82).</p><p>We now present these new data in the revised version of the manuscript (highlighted in yellow in page 7, new Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Supplementary file 1d and Supplementary file 1e), as well as discussing the potential reasons and implications (highlighted in yellow on page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How the progressive extension of vaccination could affect the performance of CODOP, since vaccination could alter disease severity at clinical presentation?</p><p>– I would suggest a sub-analysis depending on the vaccinations status, if available, or at least a comment considering the percentage of vaccination in the involved countries in the time when CODOP was derived.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><p>The information about the vaccination status was not was present in any of the datasets that were available to us.</p><p>To evaluate the predictive performance of CODOP in the vaccinated population we analyzed the newly incorporated datasets Test 4 (accounting for a total of 310 and 125 vaccinated patients with at least two or three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, administered before hospital admission). Our data show that CODOP is similarly effective in predicting in-hospital mortality independently of the vaccination status of the patient.</p><p>These results suggest that, despite the reported benefit of vaccination in decreasing COVID-19 mortality at the population level, the inflammatory process underlying the clinical manifestations in a percentage of vaccinated patients are comparable to non-vaccinated patients.</p><p>We now present these new data in the revised version of the manuscript (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2 and Supplementary file 1d; Of note: the step-wise appearance of the ROC curves in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 is typical when a low number of patients is included in a dataset) and comment on the potential reasons and implications in the Discussion section (highlighted in yellow on page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be interesting to evaluate the performance of CODOP separately in men and women.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion.</p><p>A new analysis demonstrates a similar performance of CODOP in men (N=9127, AUROC=0.883 (0.877-0.888)) and women (N=6775, AUROC=0.893 (0.888-0.905)), which goes in line with the not selection of Sex as predictive parameter during our model building process (Supplementary file 1a).</p></body></sub-article></article>
