How the subcellular architecture of the growing axon sustains the requirements for such rapid build-up of cellular constituents has remained elusive. Human axons have been particularly poorly accessible to imaging at high resolution in a near-native context. Here, we present a method that combines cryo-correlative light microscopy and electron tomography with human cerebral organoid technology to visualize growing axon tracts. Our data reveal a wealth of structural details on the arrangement of macromolecules, cytoskeletal components, and organelles in elongating axon shafts. In particular, the intricate shape of the endoplasmic reticulum is consistent with its role in fulfilling the high demand for lipid biosynthesis to support growth. Furthermore, the scarcity of ribosomes within the growing shaft suggests limited translational competence during expansion of this compartment. These findings establish our approach as a powerful resource for investigating the ultrastructure of defined neuronal compartments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>CLEM</kwd><kwd>cerebral organoids</kwd><kwd>cryo-ET</kwd><kwd>axons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_1201/9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lancaster</surname><given-names>Madeline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC STG 757710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lancaster</surname><given-names>Madeline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_1201/8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kukulski</surname><given-names>Wanda</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wozny</surname><given-names>Michael R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining cerebral organoid technology with cryo-correlative microscopy reveals the organization of cytoskeleton, membrane compartments, and protein synthesis machinery contributing to the rapid expansion of developing human axons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian neurons are uniquely specialized cells. With an elaborate tree-like structure and elongated shape, sometimes up to a meter in length in adult humans, they have the highest surface area to volume ratio of any cell in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Winkle and Gupton, 2016</xref>). Neurons are also extremely polarized, with structurally and functionally distinct axonal and dendritic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartlett and Banker, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bray, 1973</xref>). While dendrites receive signals, the axon transmits the electrical signal to downstream targets. It is this directional relay, together with the specific topology of axonal connections and their bundling in defined tracts, that allows for information transfer, and ultimately cognition. The formation of such long-range tracts depends upon the coordinated growth of thousands and even millions of immature axons, often over great distances.</p><p>How the axon achieves such remarkable elongation remains to be determined, but its subcellular architecture is likely to reflect unique requirements for growth. For example, the organelle composition of the developing axon must be such that the neuron, without going through cell division, can undergo size increase rates akin to rapidly dividing cancerous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith, 2009</xref>). How are cellular compartments and the cytoskeleton organized within the rapidly extending axon? Does the subcellular organization provide the means to understand the supply of lipids and proteins, necessary for the increase in axon surface area during growth? These are some of the outstanding questions that nanometer-scale insights could help to address.</p><p>The cellular organization of different neuronal compartments, including the axon, has been studied by electron microscopy (EM) since its earliest days on fixed nervous tissue from rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Palay, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palay and Palade, 1955</xref>). Volumetric EM techniques have enabled 3D reconstructions of the arrangement of cells within native nervous tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">White et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wanner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Such large-scale approaches provide ‘connectomics’ information on the nervous systems of small animals such as nematodes, fly, and fish larvae. Recently, a study of subcellular details in fixed post-mortem human brain slices made use of correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) and electron tomography (ET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shahmoradian et al., 2019</xref>). Although these studies revealed many ultrastructural features, the resolution and interpretability of classical preparation methods are restricted by limited sample preservation.</p><p>In comparison to chemical fixation, high-pressure freezing followed by freeze-substitution was shown to result in improved preservation of mouse nervous tissue, highlighting the importance of cryo-fixation for a more accurate interpretation of ultrastructural details (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>). The combination of cryo-fixation with EM imaging at cryogenic temperatures is particularly suited to preserve the fine structure of neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lučić et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-Busnadiego et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zuber et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, recent methodological advances in cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging have enabled in situ structural studies of protein complexes within their cellular context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O’Reilly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tegunov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allegretti et al., 2020</xref>). These methods can be applied to mammalian neuronal cell cultures to provide unprecedented views of their macromolecular architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bäuerlein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Trinkaus et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains challenging to unequivocally identify axons in primary neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartlett and Banker, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bray, 1973</xref>) because the cells are dissociated from their tissue context, and therefore exhibit intermixed axons and dendrites. Furthermore, ultrastructural analysis of human axons within the near-native context of cryo-preserved tracts would be invaluable for understanding neurodevelopment, nerve damage, and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanquie and Bradke, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Cerebral organoids provide the opportunity to study aspects of human neuronal physiology within the context of a complex 3D cellular milieu mimicking the architecture of the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lancaster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quadrato et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, we developed an optimized air-liquid interface slice culture paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giandomenico et al., 2019</xref>) that enables long-term culture of cerebral organoids and promotes the establishment of axon tracts, consisting of dozens or, in thicker tracts, even up to thousands of individual axons bundled together, able to form functional connections. While the cell bodies are part of the organoid tissue, corticofugal (deep-layer identity) axon tracts project over long distances of several millimeters from the organoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giandomenico et al., 2019</xref>), effectively segregating the axons from dendrites and somata. This feature, combined with the ability to derive cerebral organoids from human cells, makes this method a promising route to examining the cell biology and molecular structure of human axons.</p><p>Here, we present a workflow that combines air-liquid interface cerebral organoid (ALI-CO) culture with cryo-CLEM to study the subcellular architecture of developing human axons in a context closely mimicking in vivo. Cryo-CLEM offers unambiguous identification of fluorescent cells, or individual cellular compartments, combined with high-resolution cryo-EM imaging of the same, near-natively preserved sample to reveal its underlying molecular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lučič et al., 2013</xref>). We adapted this technology to observe the behavior of growing human axons within tracts in real time followed by electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) of the same axons with high structural preservation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first examined in detail axon growth behaviors of ALI-COs. Thick tracts that exited the ALI-COs stained positive for the pan-axonal marker SMI312 and negative for the dendritic marker MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This, together with their length and physical distance from neuronal cell bodies within the organoid, consolidated that these tracts comprise almost exclusively axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To monitor growth, we next expressed a farnesylated membrane-targeted GFP (fGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lancaster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giandomenico et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) in a subset of cells within the organoid slices. As a result, tracts contained a mixture of unlabeled and fluorescently labeled axons, which extended rapidly within the tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). We measured the extension speed for individual fluorescently labeled axons over several hours to be an average of 691 nm/min, with a peak pace of nearly 3000 nm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The average speed we observed is comparable to previous reports of chicken dorsal-root ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ketschek et al., 2007</xref>). Intrigued by the dynamicity of axon pathfinding, we sought to establish an approach that would allow us to examine the subcellular organization that underlies this cellular behavior.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Targeting fluorescently labeled axons within tracts from human cerebral organoids by correlative light and electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-CLEM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence of an air-liquid interface cerebral organoid (ALI-CO) stained for the pan-neuronal marker TUBB3 and the pan-axonal marker SMI312.

Grids on which axon tracts approached the center were detached from the organoid slice using a biopsy punch and immediately cryo-fixed by plunge-freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Detachment and plunge-freezing were coordinated between two experimenters who sequentially handled the grids, to keep the time from detachment until completed cryo-fixation as short as possible and within less than 20 s (see Materials and methods). To specifically target fGFP<sup>+</sup> axons within tracts by cryo-ET we used cryo-CLEM, imaging each grid both by cryo-fluorescence microscopy (cryo-FM) and cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Fluorescent signals of individual tracts could be correlated to cryo-EM overviews by using landmark features on the grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H,I</xref>). This allowed us to distinguish fGFP<sup>+</sup> axons within the tracts from axons that were positive only for SiR-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H,II</xref>). We then imaged fGFP<sup>+</sup> axons by cryo-ET, targeting specific segments of individual axons within axon tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H,III</xref>). This approach allowed us to establish a direct link between cellular behavior observed live and cellular ultrastructure (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>).</p><p>In our cryo-ET data, cellular structures such as protein assemblies and membranes were preserved to a high level of detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed unbranched, longitudinally aligned actin filaments, recognizable by their characteristic thickness of 7–9 nm and an apparent pitch of 5–6 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egelman et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, orange arrows). Microtubules revealed their individual protofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, magenta arrows), as well as numerous intraluminal protein densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garvalov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foster et al., 2021a</xref>). Microtubule bundles were often so dense as to seemingly pose constraints on microtubule-based transport. We observed mitochondria within these bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, green arrows), suggesting that dynamic rearrangements are required to allow sufficient space for vesicles and organelles to pass. We also found filaments of about 10 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, brown arrows). These dimensions match those of neurofilaments (NFs) such as NF-L, NF-M, and NF-H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Malka-Gibor et al., 2017</xref>), which serve as signature markers for axons. Our tomograms also revealed coated and uncoated vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, yellow arrows, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, we frequently observed large expanses of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternae, which extended into thin membrane tubules tightly associated with microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, cyan arrows). We also observed membrane contact sites between ER-mitochondria and ER-plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, white arrows).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cryo-ET reveals subcellular features of developing human axon tracts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-tomograms reveal bundles of unbranched, longitudinally aligned actin filaments, recognizable by actin subunit arrangement (orange arrows), microtubules filled with lumenal densities, microtubule protofilaments (purple arrows), mitochondria (green arrows) embedded in microtubule bundles, potential neurofilaments (brown arrows), vesicles carrying protein cargo (yellow arrow), endoplasmic reticulum (cyan arrows) closely associated with microtubules.

Because only a subset of cells expressed fGFP, most tracts contained a large proportion of unlabeled, GFP negative axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel). By this approach, GFP-negative axons could be imaged on the same EM grid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panels), simplifying the acquisition of control data as well as making comparison more reliable by removing grid-to-grid variability as a source of unspecific differences. We did not observe any obvious ultrastructural differences between fGFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP negative axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To highlight the ultrastructural complexity, we segmented key cellular elements of a fGFP<sup>+</sup> axon volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, bottom panel and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>).</p><p>The 40 tomograms we collected comprised unlabeled axons as well as axons expressing either fGFP, GFP-tagged human L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) or GFP-tagged extended-synaptotagmin isoform 1 (ESYT1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). We overexpressed L1CAM, which is involved in axon-axon contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siegenthaler et al., 2015</xref>), and ESYT1, involved in lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>), as possible modulators of tract formation and axon elongation. Next, we analyzed potential changes in subcellular structure upon L1CAM-GFP or GFP-ESYT1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). We compared cell-cell contacts formed between individual axons in tracts from ALI-CO slices expressing fGFP with tracts from ALI-CO slices overexpressing the cell adhesion molecule L1CAM. While the separation between plasma membranes of adjacent axons within tracts was remarkably narrow, we found no significant difference between cell-cell contacts from fGFP and L1CAM-GFP overexpressing ALI-COs (fGFP: mean = 5.63 nm, SD = 0.65 nm, N = 25 and L1CAM-GFP: mean = 5.29 nm, SD = 0.58 nm, N = 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). We also compared the occurrence of ER-plasma membrane contact sites in axons from ALI-CO slices expressing fGFP with axons from ALI-CO slices overexpressing the ER-plasma membrane contact site protein GFP-ESYT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernández-Busnadiego et al., 2015</xref>). The frequency with which we observed such contact sites was similar in both data sets (86 % of fGFP tomograms (N = 22) and 90 % of GFP-ESYT1 tomograms (N = 10) contained at least one instance in which the ER was within approximately 30 nm distance from the plasma membrane) (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>). We cannot exclude that there may be subtle unanticipated phenotypes associated with other, specific structures, nor that more severe phenotypes could be masked by the mosaic nature of the bundles, with wild-type axons possibly driving growth of axons expressing the transgene. Nonetheless, the intactness of the subcellular organization suggests that in principle our approach allows one to assess the impact of gene manipulation on cellular ultrastructure without technical knock-on effects.</p><p>We next set out to analyze the observed cellular structures in more detail. For that, we pooled the tomograms of the three data sets. First, we investigated the localization of vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While most vesicles appeared free in the cytosol, approximately 17 % were associated with microtubules and 14 % with actin (N = 290, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The vesicles had mean diameters of about 50 nm (52.00 nm, SD = 19.42 nm, N = 200 for free vesicles; 50.92 nm, SD = 16.70 nm, N = 49 for MT associated vesicles, and 52.18 nm, SD = 17.84 nm, N = 41 for actin associated vesicles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These sizes are similar to vesicles in axons of mouse dorsal root ganglia neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foster et al., 2021b</xref>). Although we did not determine the origin and identity of the vesicles, their distribution suggests that at least a subset could correspond to secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gumy et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>A defining feature of axon identity is the parallel arrangement of bundled microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burton, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heidemann et al., 1981</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine the polarity of individual microtubules in tomograms using subtomogram averaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We used axial views of each microtubule average to determine the handedness and thus polarity of the microtubule based on the tilt of its protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sosa and Chrétien, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). This analysis showed that the majority of bundles had a uniform, parallel microtubule arrangement, further confirming axon identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Because it is difficult to trace the complete length of individual axons on the EM grid and growth was not necessarily uni-directional, we could not unambiguously determine the microtubule orientation relative to the axon leading edge. In total, we analyzed between three and nine microtubules in nine tomograms by subtomogram averaging. While the protofilament tilts could be determined unambiguously in a subset of five axon tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), the number of protofilaments could be determined for 28 individual microtubules. In some cases, the close proximity to other microtubules in larger bundles and the anisotropic resolution of the tomographic data prevented analysis of the protofilament number. We found that the majority of microtubules consisted of 13 protofilaments, while 2 microtubules had 12 protofilaments (N = 28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that the microtubule organization we observed was influenced or stabilized by labeling with SiR-tubulin in the subset of experiments where this labeling was performed, 13 protofilaments have been suggested before to be the predominant molecular architecture of microtubules in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaaban and Brouhard, 2017</xref>). We calculated a 3D subtomogram average from 16 of the 13-protofilament microtubules, which revealed the typical 4 nm repeat of individual tubulin subunits along the protofilaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amos and Klug, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nogales et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cytoskeletal and membrane architecture of developing axon shafts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Axial views of subtomogram averages reveal the polarity of each microtubule (MT) shown in B.

At average growth rates of 691 nm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the demand of membrane and lipid molecules must be high. Using the plasma membrane as a proxy to estimate the amount of newly synthesized membrane, we segmented the plasma membrane in tomograms and estimated the surface area of individual axon shafts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, see also Materials and methods). Each micrometer of length on average corresponded to approximately 1.24 × 10<sup>6</sup> nm<sup>2</sup> of plasma membrane area (SD = 7.3 x 10<sup>5</sup> nm<sup>2</sup>, N = 14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The broad distribution reflects the variability between the thinnest parts of axon shafts and axonal varicosities. Because each µm<sup>2</sup> of membrane contains approximately 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberts et al., 2002</xref>), corresponding to five lipid molecules/nm<sup>2</sup>, we estimated the lipid supply to the plasma membrane required to sustain the average growth rate of an axon as approximately 4.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> lipid molecules/min. This massive influx of new phospholipids into the plasma membrane points to a unique requirement for lipid biosynthesis and transfer.</p><p>The ER is the major organelle for lipid biosynthesis. We therefore examined ER ultrastructure to assess whether it may help explain how the unique lipid requirements of the growing axon are supported. Large flattened cisternae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>) were reminiscent of the ER observed in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schrod et al., 2018</xref>). We further found tubular segments of axonal ER that were remarkably narrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). At their thinnest outer diameter, the ER tubules in axon shafts measured on average 10.8 nm (SD 2.0 nm, 82 measurements), which is narrower than previously observed in mouse axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Terasaki, 2018</xref>). For comparison we measured the thinnest ER tubules in HeLa cells and found them to be about twice the diameter (20.4 nm, SD 3.2 nm, 24 measurements) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). Some of the axonal ER tubules had a local outer diameter of less than 10 nm. Considering that this measurement includes the bilayer thickness, this implies that these ER tubules of human axons contain hardly any lumenal space, likely posing constraints on diffusion of ER proteins. The observation that the ER is depleted of lumen whilst adopting highly curved tubular shapes indicates high local membrane surface-to-ER volume ratios, and suggests that the axonal ER structure may be a consequence of maximized synthesis of lipids, produced to sustain high growth rates during axon lengthening.</p><p>We anticipated the extending axon to require not only lipids but also proteins for maintaining functionality during elongation. We thus examined the presence of protein synthesis machinery in the elongating axon shafts. While it is known that mature axons do not display extensive Nissl bodies, indicating low ribosomal RNA content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Angevine, 2002</xref>), we reasoned that developing axons, due to their growth state, could have different protein biosynthesis requirements and hence composition. Furthermore, cellular cryo-ET provides the resolution to detect ribosomes, and to even distinguish between monosomes and polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brandt et al., 2010</xref>), making it a powerful method for direct detection of the protein synthesis machinery. It was therefore noteworthy that we observed a scarcity of potential ribosomes within our tomograms of growing axon shafts. In contrast, we readily identified a large number of ribosomes based on their size, shape and high contrast in tomograms of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ader et al., 2019</xref>) and of other neuronal processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In order to assess the occurrence of ribosomes quantitatively, we counted ribosome-like particles, both cytosolic and membrane-bound, and found on average two particles per µm<sup>3</sup> in axon shafts (SD = 3 particles, n = 31 tomograms), 589 particles per µm<sup>3</sup> in other neuronal processes (SD = 344 particles, n = 4 tomograms), and 2314 particles per µm<sup>3</sup> in HeLa cells (SD = 977 particles, n = 5 tomograms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The local ribosome concentration in axon shafts is thus less than 3.5 nM, about 1000-fold lower than in HeLa cells. The ribosome-like particles found in tomograms of axon shafts had an average diameter of 26.8 nm (SD = 3.7, N = 27), in agreement with the dimensions of human ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anger et al., 2013</xref>). 11 of them were in close proximity to ER membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Thus, the large amounts of axonal ER had a minute number of ribosomes attached, supporting the idea that the ER has a primary function in lipid metabolism rather than protein synthesis. To validate these findings by an approach that would allow analysis of axons as well as dendrites within the same preparation, we tested for the presence of five distinct ribosomal proteins in neurons from dissociated organoids by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In agreement with the cryo-ET data, axon shafts identified as SMI312<sup>+</sup>/MAP2<sup>-</sup> showed significantly lower ribosomal signal than dendrites (SMI312<sup>-</sup>/MAP2<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The shaft of the growing axon is scarcely populated by ribosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of ribosomes observed in cryo-tomograms of axon shafts from ALI-COs, of other cellular processes from ALI-COs, and of HeLa cells.

Such dissociated neurons exhibit a random pattern of neurites, where axons typically grow along dendrites and do not form the directed long-range tracts seen in the context of tissue. Additionally, the growth state of axons and their developmental stage (i.e. axon pathfinding vs. synaptogenesis) in dissociated primary cultures are not always clear. Moreover, cryo-EM of human neurons has so far remained out of reach. We demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by the combination of human cerebral organoids with cryo-CLEM. Because this approach requires axons to extend from the edge to the center of the grids, most of the analyzed cell areas corresponded to relatively mature pathfinding axons, which had elongated for 1–2 mm over the course of 10–14 days, during which the axon initial segment, shaft and growth cones have established. Although we cannot exclude that a fraction of the regions imaged by cryo-ET were in the process of retraction or corresponded to axon branches, their position near the grid center indicates they had undergone axonal outgrowth. Thus, this approach allows for visualization of the intracellular landscape of axon shafts, an understudied region of actively growing human axons, unambiguously identified and in an environment that mimics the physiological context of an axon tract.</p><p>Our method of combining organoid technology with cryo-ET enabled us to visualize architectural characteristics of growing axon shafts that can help to explain their unique behaviors. The organization of the cytoskeleton, in particular the dense microtubule bundles, likely reflects the importance of mechanical properties, such as rigidity, and of cytoskeletal transport for projection of axons over long distances. Growing axon shafts also appear to contain exclusively smooth ER, similarly to mature nervous tissue depicted in textbook electron micrographs. We observed an intricate ER morphology with extremely narrow tubules, which were half the diameter previously observed in mature mouse axons by serial-section EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Terasaki, 2018</xref>). Such ER morphology with minimal ER lumen volume suggests a role primarily in lipid biosynthesis to provide membrane material. In addition, we observed membrane contact sites between the ER and the plasma membrane, likely representing sites for transfer of newly synthesized lipid molecules, as lipid flux is a major function of membrane contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Levine, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Prinz, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the tight association of the ER with microtubules could reflect attachment needed to pull the ER along the extending axon. Alternatively, this arrangement could represent piercing of ER cisternae by microtubules that grow quickly along the extending axon. These structural features of axonal ER may explain how axons acquire their unique surface area-to-volume ratio through lipid supply during elongation.</p><p>Quantification of ribosome occurrence in the axon shaft provides an estimate of the potential for local protein biosynthesis. Previous EM studies have reported clusters of ribosomes in the axon initial segment and growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartlett and Banker, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tennyson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamada et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bunge, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steward and Ribak, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koenig et al., 2000</xref>). Mature presynaptic termini were shown to harbor ribosomal components, consistent with the presence of a distal ribosome pool, and metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated presynaptic protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hafner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shigeoka et al., 2016</xref>). Within the extending axon shaft, the presence of an active pool of ribosomes is less clear. In contrast to the known hallmarks for identifying pre- and post-synaptic compartments, axon shafts are not easily identified through defining structural features; they can be mistaken for thin dendrites and therefore their ultrastructural features, especially during development, have remained poorly described. Our work demonstrates that the experimental setup described here allows one to confidently ascribe observations to axon shafts and, in principle, other axonal compartments within a neuronal tissue context. Our findings reveal that the shafts of developing axons specifically exhibit low ribosome numbers. Thus, in the early stages of neurodevelopment, during axon pathfinding, the axon shaft differs from dendrites in that it displays reduced ribosome levels.</p><p>These observations complement previous findings of local translation at growth cones and presynaptic termini, and suggest that different regions of the axon can exhibit very different supramolecular landscapes. We therefore propose a refined model in which biological processes in the axon initial segment, the growth cone, and presynaptic termini rely on local translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartlett and Banker, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yamada et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tennyson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bunge, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steward and Ribak, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koenig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hafner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shigeoka et al., 2016</xref>), while the axon shaft during growth is depleted of translational machinery and thus displays limited capacity for new protein synthesis. Furthermore, because protein synthesis in the growth cone was previously shown to be used primarily for navigation and not for extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Campbell and Holt, 2001</xref>), ribosomal depletion along the shaft might represent a mechanism to desensitize this structure to exogenous guidance cues and ensure correct wiring.</p><p>Overall, these findings demonstrate that the combination of cryo-CLEM and human cerebral organoid technology is a powerful method to address the cell biology and architecture of its compartments. Conceptually this approach is not limited to axons and could be extended to other organoid-derived cell types as long as the preparation allows sample vitrification. For instance, this methodology could potentially be applied to blood vessel organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wimmer et al., 2019</xref>) to study ultrastructural aspects of vasculature development and vasculopathy, since, like neurons, the developing vasculature extends long, thin structures that would be amenable to vitrification in the same manner. Furthermore, a declination of this approach could take advantage of the organoid system to generate defined cell types difficult to isolate from primary samples. For example, one could place neural crest organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foltz et al., 2021</xref>) in close proximity to EM grids to capture neural crest cells and study their ultrastructure during migration and differentiation into different neural crest cell derivatives. Such an approach, in combination with thinning of the cells by cryo-focussed ion beam milling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mahamid et al., 2016</xref>), would provide a way to perform cryo-EM studies on physiologically relevant migratory cell types.</p><p>In conclusion, the combination of cerebral organoid technology and cryo-ET provides a window into the architecture of the human axonal compartment. This experimental setup could be extended to other organoid systems. We believe this methodology holds the potential to further our understanding of neuronal development, neurodegeneration and nerve injury.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H9 hESC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.282.5391.1145">10.1126/science.282.5391.1145</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">hPSCReg ID: WAe009-A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HeLa control</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">other<break/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line stably expressing Fsp27-GFP from tet-inducible promoter.

Organoids were resuspended in dissociation solution and subject to 4 × 5 min incubation steps in an incubator at 37 ° C; after the first 5 min the organoids were resuspended by flicking the tube, after 10 min the organoids displayed a fluffy appearance and were pipetted up and down once, then broken into cell clumps. After 15 min the cell clumps were resuspended by pipetting up and down 3–5 times, and then 10 more times after an additional 5 min incubation. Dissociation was stopped by addition of an equal volume of maturation medium (Stem Cell Technologies, 08570). The cell suspension was passed through a 70 µm nylon cell strainer (Corning, 352350). A small aliquot was taken for a live cell count and the remaining cell suspension was spun down at 300 x g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in SFSC medium and 50,000 cells were seeded into each well of 8 well Lab-Tek II glass chamber slides (Nunc, 154534) for immunofluorescence preparation.

Confocal images of SiR-tubulin stained organoids were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 710 upright system at 10 x (0.3 NA) magnification. The time course of fGFP<sup>+</sup> axon growth on grids was acquired on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope using a 10 x (0.3 NA) objective and a pixel size of 830 nm. Samples were incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> in 35 mm Easy-Grip tissue culture dishes (Corning, 353001). The microscope objective was aligned to the center of the grid and 4 × 4 tiled-images were acquired approximately every 12 hr. For measurement of axon growth rates, live FM movies of ALI-COs were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 710 and Zeiss LSM 780 inverted microscope using a 10 x (0.3 NA) objective and a pixel size of 1.384 µm. Samples were incubated at 37 °C and 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> in 35 mm Easy-Grip tissue culture dishes (Corning, 353001) and images were acquired every 12 min. The manual tracking plugin in ImageJ was used to track the position of individual growth cones throughout the movie frames (Fabrice Cordelires, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/track.html">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/track/track.html</ext-link>). The time interval was set to 12 min and the x/y calibration to 1.3837 µm. For immunofluorescence analysis of ribosomal subunit distribution in axons and dendrites, dissociated human neurons were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope at 60 x (1.4 NA oil) magnification. The main criterion for fluorescence image acquisition was the presence of both MAP2<sup>+</sup>/SMI312<sup>-</sup> dendrites and MAP2<sup>-</sup>/SMI312<sup>+</sup> axons within the field of view. ImageJ was used for analysis and the mean gray value of the ribosomal protein of interest along the length of two axons and two dendrites per image were measured. Axons were identified as SMI312<sup>+</sup>/MAP2<sup>-</sup> or, due to antibody incompatibility, in the case of S6 as GFP<sup>+</sup>/MAP2<sup>-</sup> processes. Dendrites were identified as MAP2<sup>+</sup> processes. The ribosomal proteins imaged include: RPL8, RPS10, RPS16, RPS26, and S6. For each of these targets, the average mean gray value was calculated across axonal and dendritic segments and a Mann-Whitney unpaired two-tailed test was used for statistical comparison between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Electron cryo-microscopy (Cryo-EM) sample preparation</title><p>After 4–7 days, the ALI-COs started to display escaping processes and were thus considered ready for grid placement. Quantifoil R2/2 or R3.5/1 200 mesh Au grids with carbon film (Quantifoil) were coated with 0.01 % poly-L-ornithine solution (Sigma Aldrich, P4957) overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the grids were further coated with a solution of 10–20 µg/ml Laminin (Sigma Aldrich, L2020) and 0.001 % Fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich, F0895) in ultrapure water at room temperature for 4 hr. Organoid sections were inspected on an EVOS FL inverted microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) by brightfield or GFP fluorescence. The grids were placed at sites where single escaping processes could be seen by brightfield or near the fluorescent foci. Cryo-EM grids were blotted with Whatman filter paper grade 1 (GE Healthcare) and placed in direct contact with the edge of the organoid section. Importantly, the edge of the grid was juxtaposed to that of the organoid section, but not covered by it. Growth of the processes could be monitored daily based on GFP fluorescence. In some experiments, after approximately 2 weeks, SiR-tubulin (Spirochrome, CY-SC002) was applied dropwise on top of the grids to visualize all axon tracts. The grids were deemed ready for freezing earliest after 10–14 days, or once the axons reached an area within approximately five grid squares distance from the grid center. Immediately prior to plunge-freezing, the grids were hydrated by applying media dropwise using a controlled oral-suction pipetting apparatus and glass capillaries. This step was crucial to reduce desiccation of neuronal processes during blotting of the EM grids. Tracts on EM grids were detached from their cell bodies using a 3.5 mm disposable biopsy punch (Integra, 33–33) and immediately collected with an L5 clamp style thin-tip tweezer (Dumont, 72882-D), then backside blotted for 5–10 s with Whatman filter paper grade 1 (GE Healthcare) and vitrified in liquid ethane using an in-house built manual plunger. To minimize the time between detachment and cryo-fixation to less than 20 s, the procedure was carried out sequentially by two experimenters that worked next to one another; the first experimenter detached the grids from the organoid slice and handed the grids directly to the second experimenter who performed the blotting and plunge freezing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cryo-fluorescence microscopy (Cryo-FM)</title><p>The grids were screened for ice thickness and fluorescent signals within axon tracts by cryo-FM with the Leica EM cryo-CLEM system.

The microscope stage was cooled to –195 °C and the room was humidity controlled (below 25 %). A 2.0 × 2.0 mm montage of each grid was taken of the green (1 s, 30 % intensity), brightfield channel (30 ms, 70), and optionally of the far-red channel (1 s, 30 % intensity). Individual z-stacks of grid squares of interest were acquired in 1 µm steps to cover the full range of fluorescent signals. Correlation of fluorescent axon tracts on cryo-EM grid square maps was done in Icy using the ec-CLEM plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paul-Gilloteaux et al., 2017</xref>) using landmark features and carbon film holes in cryo-FM and cryo-EM images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Preparation and focused ion beam (FIB) milling of control HeLa cells</title><p>Control HeLa cell samples were prepared as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ader et al., 2019</xref>.

Sixteen hr post-induction, HeLa cells were stained for 1 hr with LipidTOX Deep Red dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, H34477). Subsequently, grids were manually backside blotted with Whatman filter paper grade 1 and immediately vitrified in liquid ethane using an in-house built manual plunger. Thin lamellae were generated by cryo-FIB milling performed with a Scios DualBeam FIB/SEM (FEI) equipped with a Quorum stage (Quorum, PP3010T) in a procedure similar to the one described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schaffer et al., 2015</xref>. Prior to milling, grids were coated with organometallic platinum using a gas injection system for 30 s at 13 mm working distance and 25° stage tilt. The electron beam was used for locating the cells of interest at 5 kV and 13 pA beam current and for imaging to check progression of milling at 2 kV and 13 pA beam current. Milling was performed with stepwise reduction of the ion beam current (from 30 kV, 1 nA to 16 kV, 23 pA) while changing the stage tilt as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoffmann et al., 2019</xref>).

The preservation of axon tracts on individual grids squares was examined on images acquired at pixel sizes of 6.3 nm or 6.0 nm, respectively. Cryo-ET data acquisition was done using SerialEM on a Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher) equipped with a Quantum energy filter and a K2 direct electron detector (Gatan) operated in counting mode. Montaged images of the central part of the grid were acquired in linear mode with 171 nm pixel size. Montages of individual grid squares with axon tracts or lamellae of HeLa cells were taken with 5.1 nm pixel size. These montages were used for correlation to fluorescent axon tracts, based on landmark features using the ec-CLEM plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paul-Gilloteaux et al., 2017</xref>) within the Icy software.

The target dose rate was kept around 4 e<sup>-</sup>/px/s on the detector. The energy filter slit width was set to 20 eV. Tilt images were acquired as three or four frames with approximately 1 e<sup>-</sup>/A<sup>2</sup> dose per tilt image. The nominal defocus for all tilt series was set to –5 µm. The frames of tilt series images were aligned with IMOD alignframes. The tilt series were aligned in IMOD using patch tracking and then reconstructed at a pixel size of 7.1 Å or 7.4 Å as backprojection tomograms with SIRT-like filter corresponding to 10 iterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mastronarde, 1997</xref>). To improve visibility for representation in figures, gaussian filtering was applied to the shown tomographic slices.

Membrane surfaces were segmented manually, followed by extensive smoothening and simplification. Microtubules and actin filaments were first modeled as tubes in IMOD and then imported as tubular volumes into Amira. Within the segmented volumes of individual membrane objects and cytoskeleton objects, grey value-thresholding was used for a second segmentation step to eventually depict only high-density voxels within the objects of interest. Note that the segmentation model is inverted along the z-axis relative to the original tomogram. <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref> was generated by first selecting a region of interest in a cryo-ET slice, which is presented in the final movie frame, followed by identifying and aligning images obtained from the previous successive imaging steps of fluorescent live imaging, cryo-FM, and electron tomography. Each acquired image was then used to generate a stack of progressive magnification into the region of interest using an ImageJ macro (zoom_movie_ImageJ_v2) written by Eugene Katrukha and provided through GitHub Gist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katrukha, 2021</xref>). All stacks were then converted and concatenated into a single movie.</p><p>The membrane distance at cell-cell contact sites was measured for a total of 34 contacts, in which the plasma membranes were perpendicular to the x,y plane of the tomogram and contacting each other over a distance of at least 0.5 µm. 5–17 measurements, at a spacing of approximately 100 nm, were taken between the two extracellular leaflets of the plasma membrane bilayers for each contact area. Significance was tested with unpaired t test in Graphpad Prism.</p><p>The occurrence of ER-plasma membrane contact sites was assessed by visual inspection. Wherever the ER was found close to plasma membrane oriented perpendicular to the x,y plane of the tomogram, the distance between the two membranes was measured in IMOD and when it was less than 30 nm, the instance was counted as a membrane contact site. A large part of the plasma membrane however is oriented roughly parallel to the x,y plane of the tomogram and thus not directly visible because of the missing wedge. In these cases, we considered the boundaries between visible cellular material and the void in the top and bottom part of the tomograms to correspond to the surface of the cell. ER which was clearly recognizable less than 30 nm away from this boundary was considered an ER-plasma membrane contact site. Depending on the orientation of the ER membrane, however, the missing wedge affected its visibility as well and rendered the estimation of the distance to the plasma membrane impossible. Therefore, this approach only detects most obvious ER-plasma membrane contact sites.</p><p>The microtubule directionality was determined from the radial tilt of protofilaments in averages from individual microtubules. Points along individual microtubules were clicked along their center to create a contour. Overlapping subvolumes were extracted along each contour and averaged together using a cylindrical mask and one individual subtomogram as a reference in PEET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nicastro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heumann et al., 2011</xref>). Microtubule directionality was determined from axial views of individual subtomogram averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sosa and Chrétien, 1998</xref>). The number of protofilaments for individual microtubules was determined from axial views of subtomogram averages only when the quality of subtomogram averaging resulted in clear separation of the individual protofilaments. In some cases, analysis of subtomogram averaging was not possible due to the microtubule orientation and the anisotropic resolution of the tomograms, the signal-to-noise ratio of the final tomogram or the proximity to other microtubules within larger bundles. A subtomogram average was generated from overlapping subvolumes of 16 individual 13 protofilament microtubules using a cylindrical mask and the average of an individual microtubule average as a reference in PEET. Fourier shell correlation (FSC) was calculated in PEET using the calcFSC function. The FSC curve was plotted in Graphpad Prism using the resulting values, the frequency shells and the pixel size. A line profile along an individual protofilament of the microtubule average was generated in ImageJ and visualized using Graphpad Prism.</p><p>To measure the plasma membrane surface area of axon shafts, the plasma membrane boundaries of individual axons were segmented in tomograms at bin 10 that were rotated around the x-axis (to see x,z virtual slices). As explained for the analysis of membrane contact site occurrence, due to the missing wedge, the plasma membrane parallel to the x,y plane of the tomogram is not directly visible. However, the reconstructed tomographic volume contains the whole thickness of the cell, hence the boundary between cellular material and void corresponds to the surface of the cell. The surface of the cell is recognizable in the binned x,z virtual slices, and was therefore used as a proxy for the plasma membrane. Axon segments were only analyzed if they were fully contained throughout the tomogram volume. Segmentations and surface area measurements were performed in IMOD. Each measurement was normalized to the individual axon length.</p><p>The ER diameter of the thinnest ER tubules contained in the axon and HeLa datasets were measured in IMOD as the distance between two points on the cytosolic edge of the membrane of each ER tubule. Significance was tested with Welch’s t test in Graphpad Prism.</p><p>Ribosome-like particles were identified visually on the basis of their size, shape, and contrast in the axon tomograms, in reference to other tomograms of eukaryotic cells that contained polysomes and monosomes. Vesicle and ribosome-like particle diameters were measured along their longest axis, in tomographic slices in IMOD. Multivesicular bodies and organelles larger than 200 nm in diameter were excluded from the vesicle analysis. To better visualize the topographic distribution of the ribosome-like particles, example volumes of 0.05 µm<sup>3</sup> from cytosolic areas of the tomograms are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, in which the position of each ribosome-like particle is illustrated by a sphere with 30 nm diameter. ‘Other processes’ comprised four tomograms containing high numbers of ribosomes. These tomograms were acquired at the edge of the EM grid, which is in close proximity to the cell bodies of the organoid slice and part of isolated processes rather than bundles. Additionally, two of these tomograms were acquired at the ending of a process. For these reasons, we interpreted them as representing cellular processes other than axonal tracts, excluded these four tomograms from the ribosome analysis on axon shafts and instead classified them as ‘other processes’. The number of ribosome-like particles found within each tomogram was normalized to the tomographic volume. The tomographic volume was estimated from the x,y dimensions of tomograms. The z dimensions were estimated at the tomogram center. Using Avogadro’s number, the average molar concentration of ribosome-like particles within the tomograms of the axon tracts was calculated. Due to the permissive assignment and quantification accounting for their scarcity, it cannot be excluded that some of the ribosome-like particles identified in the axon shaft may actually correspond to other protein complexes. Thus, the calculated concentration in axon shafts is likely an overestimate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>MAL is an inventor on several patents related to cerebral organoids, is co-founder and scientific advisory board member of a:head bio, and on the scientific advisory board of the Roche Institute for Translational Bioengineering</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>File names of the cryo-ET data deposited on EMPIAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iudin et al., 2016</xref>), and the corresponding numbers given to the respective tomogram snapshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70269-supp1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70269-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Representative electron tomograms are deposited at the Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB); entries EMD-13195 for fGFP, EMD-13196 for L1CAM-GFP and EMD-13197 for GFP-ESYT1.

Reviewer 2 suggests to perform subtomogram averaging of ribosomes, this is quite easily done and it would provide evidence for the claimed potential of determining molecular structures with the methodology presented here, so it would be good to include if possible. Also, please include more controlled quantifications throughout, as suggested by reviewer 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned down the claims of molecular achievements, as requested, in all instances it was mentioned, as well modified the title, to reflect these changes.</p><p>We appreciate the suggestion to perform subtomogram averaging (STA) of ribosomes as a way of providing evidence for the potential of the methodology and, as Reviewer 2 suggests, as a way of confirming the identity of ribosome-like particles. This would be an excellent addition, but precisely because axons are so ribosome-sparse (we have only identified less than 30 ribosome-like particles in 31 cryo-ETs of axons) STA of so few putative ribosomes is unlikely to provide any appreciable improvement in resolution or reveal further details beyond the size and shape of the average particle. Hence it may tell us that the <italic>average particle</italic> is likely a ribosome, but it won’t confirm the identity of the individual particles included in the average, especially since classifications or sorting of the data set will not be possible with such a small number of particles. We have therefore addressed the two points meant to be addressed by this suggestion separately, as follows:</p><p>Firstly, to highlight the potential of the methodology to visualize molecular structures, we have included a more extensive analysis of the structure of microtubules. We found that the majority of microtubules in the growing axons consists of 13 protofilaments. We calculated a 3D subtomogram average of the microtubules with 13 protofilaments, which reveals the repetitive arrangement of individual tubulin molecules along the protofilaments. These results are shown in new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1. We believe that these results could form the basis for other researchers to perform a targeted structural analysis of specific features of interest on microtubules. To facilitate such potential follow-up work, we have deposited on EMPIAR the complete set of raw images from tilt series acquired on growing axons. In addition, this data also demonstrates the utility of the approach for gaining insight into molecular structure of other subcellular axonal structures.</p><p>Secondly, to assign ribosome-like particles more confidently, we assessed the sizes of individual particles. The diameters were on average 27 nm, ranging from 22 to 36 nm, in good agreement with the dimensions of human ribosomes viewed from various angles (Anger A.M. <italic>et al.,</italic> Nature 2013, EMD-5592). This new data is shown in Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B. We are therefore confident that the majority of the particles we counted are indeed ribosomes.</p><p>Importantly, we would like to point out that our conclusion is that growing axon shafts contain very few ribosomes. The potential that our counts overestimate the number of ribosome due to false positives does not endanger that conclusion. The concentrations of ribosomes we provide are meant to highlight the large difference in ribosome occurrence between axon shafts and HeLa cells. Our counts may overestimate the number of ribosomes in axon shafts and underestimate the numbers in HeLa cells (because there are so many, we might have missed some). In either case, however, the conclusion would in fact be more strongly supported rather than weakened.</p><p>In addition, we provide a gallery of all the ribosome-like particles that we have found in growing axon shafts, as well as a quantification of their localization (cytosolic vs. ER-bound) (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A and C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Discuss in more depth how this methodology can be further expanded to systems different from neurons (i.e. other organoids, pathological systems).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a paragraph in the discussion discussing the potential application of our methodology to other systems. For instance, we discuss that it would be possible to study other elongating tissue structures, such as the developing vasculature, or organoid-derived cell types that exhibit migratory patterns and that would otherwise be difficult to culture, such as neural crest cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewer 1 provides a list of specific comments that should be considered in a revised submission.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see below for details on how we addressed the specific comments of Reviewer 1 as well as the other Reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Regarding the quantification of plasma membrane surface area. The authors present the measurements as absolute, when cryo-tomography data suffers from a missing wedge artefact that makes segmentation of all surfaces of objects highly challenging. How all the membrane surface was accurately segmented should be explained, or it should be discussed if the measurements are intended as best estimates rather than absolute.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Indeed, our measurements of plasma membrane surface area are estimates and not intended to be absolute values. It is correct that the segmentation of membrane areas that are oriented perpendicular to the optical axis is extremely difficult because membranes in that orientation are essentially not visible in tomographic reconstructions. However, the surface of the imaged cellular volume is visible in x,z or y,z-views of the tomograms. As the axons are imaged without any thinning, we assume that the visible surface of the imaged cellular volume is a good proxy for the position of the plasma membrane of the axon.</p><p>We have adjusted the relevant sentence in the main text to read:</p><p>“we segmented the plasma membrane in tomograms and estimated the surface area of individual axon shafts (Figure 3F, see also Materials and methods). Each micrometer of length on average corresponded to approximately 1.24 x 10<sup>6</sup> nm<sup>2</sup> of plasma membrane area (SD = 7.3 x 10<sup>5</sup> nm<sup>2</sup>, N = 14) (Figure 3G).”</p><p>In the Materials and methods section, we provide a detailed description of the approach:</p><p>“To measure the plasma membrane surface area of axon shafts, the plasma membrane boundaries of individual axons were segmented in tomograms at bin 10 that were rotated around the x-axis (to see x,z virtual slices). As explained for the analysis of membrane contact site occurrence, due to the missing wedge, the plasma membrane parallel to the x,y plane of the tomogram is not directly visible. However, the reconstructed tomographic volume contains the whole thickness of the cell, hence the boundary between cellular material and void corresponds to the surface of the cell. The surface of the cell is recognizable in the binned x,z virtual slices, and was therefore used as a proxy for the plasma membrane.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) L1CAM-GFP or ESYT1-GFP overexpression were interesting experiments, but quantitative evidence should be presented to support the conclusion of no differences with GFP wild-types.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included quantitative analyses, according to the anticipated function of the two overexpressed proteins. For axons from L1CAM-GFP overexpressing organoids, we measured whether the distance between the plasma membranes of adjacent axons is altered compared to axons from fGFP expressing organoids. These data are shown in Figure 2 —figure supplement 5. In axons from GFP-ESYT1 overexpressing organoids, we assessed the occurrence of ER-plasma membrane contact sites as compared to fGFP data. This analysis includes additional, representative examples of ER-plasma membrane contact sites in Figure 2 —figure supplement 6 and quantification reported in the results. In both cases, we found no difference. These results are described as follows:</p><p>“We compared cell-cell contacts formed between individual axons in tracts from ALI-CO slices expressing fGFP with tracts from ALI-CO slices overexpressing the cell adhesion molecule L1CAM. While the separation between plasma membranes of adjacent axons within tracts was remarkably narrow, we found no significant difference between cell-cell contacts from fGFP and L1CAM-GFP overexpressing ALI-COs (fGFP: mean = 5.63 nm, SD = 0.65 nm, N = 25 and L1CAM-GFP: mean = 5.29 nm, SD = 0.58 nm, N = 9) (Figure 2 —figure supplement 5). We also compared the occurrence of ER-plasma membrane contact sites in axons from ALI-CO slices expressing fGFP with axons from ALI-CO slices overexpressing the ER-plasma membrane contact site protein GFP-ESYT1 (Fernández-Busnadiego et al., 2015). The frequency with which we observed such contact sites was similar in both data sets (86% of fGFP tomograms (N = 22) and 90% of GFP-ESYT1 tomograms (N = 10) contained at least one instance in which the ER was within approximately 30 nm distance from the plasma membrane) (examples in Figure 2 —figure supplement 6). We cannot exclude that there may be subtle unanticipated phenotypes associated with other, specific structures, nor that more severe phenotypes could be masked by the mosaic nature of the bundles, with wild type axons possibly driving growth of axons expressing the transgene. Nonetheless, the intactness of the subcellular organization suggests that in principle our approach allows one to assess the impact of gene manipulation on cellular ultrastructure without technical knock-on effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The paper could benefit from some experimental expansion. Could it be quantified where ribosomes are located relative to other organelles? Although ER minimum dimensions are thin relative to other cells, what about the maximum and average dimensions and quantity? Can ER relationships with different organelles and membrane be quantified? Is there anything different in human neurons compared to rodent ones? Would it be possible to show more vesicle examples, or even quantify the size ranges? Are vesicles associated with particular structures, i.e microtubules?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these suggestions. We have done several additional analyses.</p><p>– We have quantified whether ribosomes are cytosolic or bound to ER, and we included a gallery of all axonal ribosomes we observed within their subcellular environment (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1) (see response to essential revisions point 2).</p><p>– We have quantified the occurrence of ER-plasma membrane contact sites (see response to major point 2).</p><p>– We have done various analyses on vesicles, as suggested (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). We provide an image gallery to show more example vesicles. We assessed whether vesicles were associated with microtubules, actin or whether vesicles appeared free in the cytosol. Finally, we measured the diameters of vesicles and compared the sizes of free vesicles and those associated with microtubules or actin. These results are described in an additional paragraph as follows:</p><p>“First, we investigated the localization of vesicles (Figure 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). While most vesicles appeared free in the cytosol, approximately 16% were associated with microtubules and 14% with actin (N=298, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). The vesicles had mean diameters of about 50 nm (52.00 nm, SD = 19.42 nm, N = 200 for free vesicles; 50.92 nm, SD = 16.70 nm, N = 49 for MT associated vesicles, and 52.18 nm, SD = 17.84 nm, N = 41 for actin associated vesicles) (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1C). These sizes are similar to vesicles in axons of mouse dorsal root ganglia neurons (Foster et al., 2021b). Although we did not determine the origin and identity of the vesicles, their distribution suggests that at least a subset could correspond to secretory vesicles (Gumy et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript could be supplemented by a comparison with findings from other methods. I am not an expert on axon development, but one might think of data from recent FIB/SEM approaches or from conventional electron microscopy studies, and I am not thinking of the mid-1950s papers that have already been cited here. This would allow even the non-expert to properly appreciate the findings presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that recent EM developments, such as FIB-SEM imaging, have contributed immensely to understanding the architecture of neuronal cells. We have therefore expanded our introduction to discuss the advances made by various imaging approaches.</p><p>Furthermore, we discuss the concrete example of very narrow ER diameter measurements, which has been previously described by FIB-SEM imaging. Our measurements show that the ER is much narrower than previously found by FIB-SEM imaging (Terasaki et al., 2018). This does not mean the FIB-SEM measurements are wrong (it could be different in different cell systems), but the narrow diameters we measure could not have been accurately measured with the resolution of the FIB-SEM or any other EM method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also think that the &quot;molecular&quot; can be scaled down a bit, i.e. page 5, line 126-146 the only molecular is &quot;numerous intraluminal particles&quot; that remain to be investigated here, everything else are easily identifiable structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now replaced the term ‘molecular’ in all relevant instances, including the title.

Does the subcellular organization provide the means to understand the supply of lipids and proteins, necessary for the increase in axon surface area during growth?”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding &quot;ribosomes&quot;, I would add a rough subtomogram analysis, which should be straightforward enough.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential revisions point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Although the authors describe a new methodology in this manuscript, but it lacks sufficient novelty and impact for publication in eLife. It will be great if the authors can demonstrate that this technique can be applied to other cell types/tissues or under different physiological or pathological conditions. This will make the work more impactful and not limit it to studying cerebral organoids or neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential revisions point 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
