One limitation of phage therapy is the ease at which bacteria can evolve resistance. Negative effects of resistance may be mitigated when resistance results in reduced bacterial growth and virulence, or when phage coevolves to overcome resistance. Resistance evolution and its consequences are contingent on the bacteria-phage combination and their environmental context, making therapeutic outcomes hard to predict. One solution might be to conduct ‘in vitro evolutionary simulations’ using bacteria-phage combinations from the therapeutic context. Overall, our aim was to investigate parallels between in vitro experiments and in vivo dynamics in a human participant. Evolutionary dynamics were similar, with high levels of resistance evolving quickly with limited evidence of phage evolution. Resistant bacteria—evolved in vitro and in vivo—had lower virulence. In vivo, this was linked to lower growth rates of resistant isolates, whereas in vitro phage resistant isolates evolved greater biofilm production. Population sequencing suggests resistance resulted from selection on de novo mutations rather than sorting of existing variants. These results highlight the speed at which phage resistance can evolve in vivo, and how in vitro experiments may give useful insights for clinical evolutionary outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>phage therapy</kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd><kwd>trade - offs</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N0137941/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castledine</surname><given-names>Meaghan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CH160068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buckling</surname><given-names>Angus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000270</institution-id><institution>Natural Environment Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NE/S000771/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buckling</surname><given-names>Angus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Royal Higher Institute for Defence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HFM 19-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merabishvili</surname><given-names>Maya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/T014342/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friman</surname><given-names>Ville-Petri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parallel evolutionary dynamics were found in vivo and in vitro, showing that laboratory studies can be predictive of certain phenotypic outcomes of clinical phage therapy (phage-mediated decolonization).</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>By 2050, as many as 10 million people may die annually from antimicrobial-resistant infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">WHO, 2019</xref>). To combat this threat, phage therapy is being increasingly researched as a complement to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abedon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwiatek et al., 2020</xref>). Phage therapy uses viruses (phage) that infect pathogenic bacteria to clear infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwiatek et al., 2020</xref>). Phage therapy has several advantages to antibiotics by being species-specific (thus not harming beneficial microbiota) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koskella and Meaden, 2013</xref>) and self-amplifying at infection sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Górski et al., 2015</xref>). A major consideration with the use of therapeutic phages is the ease and speed (sometimes within hours) at which bacteria can evolve resistance, which can greatly limit the therapeutic potential of phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jariah and Hakim, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Torres-Barceló, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Torres-Barceló and Hochberg, 2016</xref>). However, phages may contribute to reducing the severity of infections even after resistance evolves. First, phage can sometimes evolve to overcome this resistance (i.e., bacteria-phage coevolution) and so they may continue lowering bacterial densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gandon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hampton et al., 2020</xref>). Second, resistance can trade-off against bacterial growth rates and virulence; as the alteration or loss of bacterial surface structures, typically associated with phage resistance, can affect other fitness-related phenotypes such as nutrient uptake, biofilm formation, and binding of host receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mangalea and Duerkop, 2020</xref>). Predicting the evolutionary outcome of phage therapy is therefore of crucial importance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedon, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Bacteria-phage dynamics and its consequences for phage therapy are highly context-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gandon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hampton et al., 2020</xref>). Both human clinical and animal models studies report a range of outcomes with differing phage therapy success, and differences in the extent of resistance evolution and associated costs and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abedon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brix et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwiatek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leitner et al., 2021</xref>). One solution to better understand the outcome of in vivo therapy is to conduct controlled in vitro experiments with the relevant organisms. However, while most of our understanding of the ecology and evolution of bacteria-phage interactions comes from highly controlled in vitro environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gandon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hampton et al., 2020</xref>), we do not know how well in vitro dynamics mirror in vivo dynamics quantitatively or even qualitatively.</p><p>There are good reasons to expect the outcomes may be very different. In vivo environments are expected to be more stressful for bacteria owing to limiting resources, presence of immune cells, and competing microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Everest, 2007</xref>). Consequently, these conditions may differ significantly from studies of bacteria-phage coevolution in nutrient-rich microcosms which could drive differences in (co)evolutionary dynamics and associated trade-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gandon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hampton et al., 2020</xref>). In order to evolve phage resistance, bacteria must have sufficient mutation supply, which will primarily be determined by population size and gene flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gandon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hampton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morgan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pal et al., 2007</xref>). Smaller population sizes in vivo may therefore limit resistance. Moreover, resistance costs and trade-offs may be greater as a consequence of the additional selection pressures facing bacteria, which may limit selection for resistance, making it easier for phage to overcome resistance, or reduce growth rates and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buckling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scanlan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Consequently, the main aim of this research was to determine how well in vitro bacteria—phage coevolutionary dynamics mirror dynamics in a clinical context. As a starting point, we followed bacteria-phage coevolutionary dynamics during a phage-mediated decolonization trial in parallel with the dynamics between the same bacteria and phage in vitro. The nasal cavity can act as a source of infection, notably from highly drug-resistant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> when patients undergo hospitalization and are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mainz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wertheim et al., 2004</xref>). The trial was conducted to try and decolonize intensive care (ICU) patients with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, using a phage cocktail prior to antibiotic treatment in the prevention of ICU infections with these pathogens. Mucirocin (trade name Bactroban) and chlorhexidine are routinely used for nasal decolonization in such contexts, but extensive use of these agents has led to resistance and new nasal antiseptics need to be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edgeworth, 2011</xref>). We focused on a single patient, in which we could detect <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at the beginning of the trial and both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and phage during treatment. Decolonization of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was ultimately successful in this patient. We used the pre-treatment <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates and evolved these populations in vitro in the absence and presence of treatment phages. We measured bacteria-phage (co)evolution and while we found extensive resistance evolution both in vivo and in vitro, we only found evidence of limited phage infectivity evolution in vitro. We determined the consequences of resistance, with respect to virulence, and the possible mechanisms linking this resistance-virulence trade-off using phenotypic (growth rate and biofilm assays) and metagenomic analyses for the in vivo and in vitro populations. As we only had access to samples from a single patient, we did not have a control group to understand the impact of phage application frequency in vivo. However, we were able to simulate this in our in vitro experiments, where we included two phage treatments: one where phages were added repeatedly (mimicking multiple phage doses during in vivo phage treatment) and one where phage was added once (single dose at the start of the experiment). By comparing these treatments with the in vivo treatment, we were able to gain further insight into how multiple phage doses may affect phage therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Resistance and infectivity (co)evolution</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>In vivo</title><p>Resistance to phage can evolve via de novo mutations or selection on preexisting resistance and we therefore tested the resistance of ancestral bacterial isolates to ancestral phage and pooled phage isolates isolated in vivo. Of the 24 ancestral isolates isolated in vivo at day 0, 23 were susceptible to both the ancestral phage (14–1 and PNM) while one was resistant to 14–1 but susceptible to PNM. All ancestral bacteria were susceptible to phage isolated from the patient during and after decolonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We considered whether bacteria and phage coevolved in vivo using time-shift assays to determine changes in resistance and infectivity through time. After 2 days, we saw evidence of resistance evolution, with more than half of bacterial isolates being resistant to ancestral phage. One of the two isolates isolated at day 4 was phage resistant and no <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was detected from nasal swabs after this time point. Although both bacterial populations from days 2 and 4 showed observationally higher phage resistance (87.5% day 2, 100% day 4) against day 2 phage, this was nonsignificantly different to resistance shown to ancestral phage and phage from days 4 and 7 (Tukey HSD: p&gt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This nonsignificance is likely due to low statistical power from limited clonal numbers (only eight isolates from day 2) and the consistency of resistance levels in bacterial populations from day 2 (apart from resistance to contemporary phage). Overall, results showed equal levels of phage resistance over time in vivo. The absence of changes in phage infectivity through time did not warrant further investigation of the population dynamics of the two inoculated phages.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Time-shift assays of bacterial evolution and phage during phage therapy.</title><p>The proportion of phage resistant bacterial isolates from (<bold>a</bold>) ancestral (pre-phage therapy, “Anc.”), and days 2 (T1) and 4 (T2) of in vivo (clinical) phage therapy (n=8) tested against ancestral phage (‘anc.’: 14–1 and PNM) and phage isolates from days 2 (T1), 4 (T2), and 7 (T3).

Levels of phage resistance were comparable in vivo and in vitro with limited phage infectivity evolution occurring only in vitro. While bacteria went extinct in vivo, they persisted with phage in vitro, suggesting that in vitro experiments may be more important in predicting evolutionary than clinical outcomes. Additionally, phage resistance was associated with trade-offs with virulence and bacterial growth and similar mutations or genetic variants could explain these parallel evolutionary changes in both ecological contexts.</p><p>Parallel evolution is promising for future clinical work in which the trajectory of bacteria and phage (co)evolution may be predicted for individual patients. Given the difference in environments between that of a laboratory and human nasal cavity, it was surprising that evolution was so similar. The nasal cavity would have been more nutrient limited and spatially heterogenous and such conditions have been shown to change bacteria-phage interactions compared to evolution in high-nutrient laboratory growth medium (e.g., Luria broth [LB]). For instance, bacteria-phage coevolution is altered in soil compared to growth medium because of increased costs of resistance in the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gómez and Buckling, 2011</xref>); and in plant leaves, bacteria and phage have failed to evolve while otherwise coevolving in the laboratory due to lower bacteria—phage contact rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hernandez and Koskella, 2019</xref>). Other media types can be used in vitro to replicate in vivo conditions more close (e.g., sputum media) than LB used here which may be more appropriate for other infection types such as those infecting lungs of cystic fibrosis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Palmer et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Rapid phage resistance has been highlighted as a concern for phage therapy development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Torres-Barceló, 2018</xref>) and was found in this case study. Without ongoing reciprocal phage evolution, phage resistance is likely to lead to regrowth of bacteria during infections; this has been found in a few case studies but has been combatted by selecting a different phage (single or cocktail) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aslam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schooley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhvania et al., 2017</xref>). That many de novo mutations—as well as selection on existing variation—occurred during bacteria-phage coevolution in vitro and many were also found in vivo (77% of variants observed in vivo also evolved de novo during in vitro coevolution) further highlights the fact that stressful in vivo conditions do not prevent bacteria evolving resistance to phage. However, phage resistance was found to have growth rate costs which may further explain why some isolates remained sensitive to phage, and why decolonization was ultimately successful. The natural nasal microbiota, and host immunity, may have further contributed to this success by outcompeting slower growing phage resistant isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Bacteria did not go extinct in our in vitro experiments which may be reflective of differences in environmental conditions such as nutrient availability and interspecies competition.</p><p>Resistance-virulence trade-offs have been found in previous in vitro animal models and clinical studies and are expected to improve treatment success in spite of phage resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oechslin, 2018</xref>). Phage resistance however is not always costly and likely depends on the genetic background of the bacteria and phage, as well as the environmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meaden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Houte et al., 2016</xref>). The absence of clear links between resistance phenotypes and growth rate within our in vitro treatments, despite clear between-treatment effects, is presumably because the cultures were initiated with genetically diverse clinical isolates, rather than a single ancestral clone. Ultimately, phage resistance was beneficial in controlling the pathogen in this case study and such benefits could have led to treatment success.</p><p>Population genomics of the isolates in vivo and in vitro revealed parallel genomic changes and the effects of phage selection at a molecular level. In line with previous studies, phage selection accelerated molecular evolution which resulted in populations being more diverged from their ancestral pool than control isolates (in vitro) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pal et al., 2007</xref>). This suggests that phage placed strong selection on bacteria and this further resulted in mutator strains (<italic>mutS</italic> genotype), especially where phage was added repeatedly in vitro and in vivo, that likely accelerated the rate of evolution further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>). Between both in vivo and in vitro results, mutations selected by phage gave insight into potential mechanisms of resistance. In particular, mutations to <italic>mreD</italic> and <italic>mreC</italic> were encoded for cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cabeen and Jacobs-Wagner, 2005</xref>) while missense mutations at <italic>flgK</italic> and <italic>flgL</italic> probably resulted in flagella loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Macnab, 2003</xref>). The result of these mutations was likely reduced cell surface area which reduces the probability of phage absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dennehy and Abedon, 2021</xref>). <italic>pilB</italic> mutations were also selected which is likely a surface mutation to prevent PNM (a pilus binding phage) from attaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ceyssens et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Strong genotype-phenotype links were difficult to distinguish as a high number of the same mutations or existing variants were selected upon both in vivo and in vitro, and no unique candidate genes were obvious to explain phenotypic differences (i.e., growth rate and biofilm production). Flagella and <italic>mreC</italic> mutations are associated with increased biofilm production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Whiteley et al., 2001</xref>) and as they were found in the in vitro isolates, this may suggest a generalistic phage defence strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harper et al., 2014</xref>). However, as these same mutations were found in vivo, without increases in biofilm production, strong genotype—phenotype links are unclear. Surface mutation is a common form of phage resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Houte et al., 2016</xref>) but here it appears coupled with mechanisms that prevent absorption more generally; combined, these strategies could have reduced bacterial growth and/or virulence by impairing swarming motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haiko and Westerlund-Wikström, 2013</xref>). Motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alseth et al., 2019</xref>) and resource-use assays (using Biolog plates) may have provided some stronger genotype-phenotype correlations, but this was beyond the scope of this work. In contrast, other studies using the same phage but <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA01 instead reported mutations predominantly at pilus and LPS receptors, showing that greater selection is placed on specific phage resistance strategies at phage binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wright et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wright et al., 2018</xref>). Our results highlight the importance of genetic background, and hence the use of clinical isolates over laboratory clones, in determining evolutionary trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Betts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">León and Bastías, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rossitto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Houte et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>How phages were applied in vitro had an impact on phage resistance. Although we observed a greater number of mutations where phages were added repeatedly (mimicking multiple phage doses), the proportion of resistant bacteria (resistance to contemporary phage) at the end of the experiment was significantly lower (61.5%) compared to where phages were just added at the start of the experiment (90%). That resistance of evolved bacteria to the ancestral phages (~90%) did not differ between treatments suggests that differences in resistance to evolved phages were caused by phage infectivity evolution in the repeated phage treatment. This infectivity evolution occurred before the first time point, with no subsequent changes, and was presumably the result of greater mutation supply rate in this repeated phage application treatment. It is interesting that although this ‘repeated’ treatment mimics clinical methods more closely, these same patterns were not observed in vivo. However, as bacteria went extinct in vivo, it is likely phage generations were fewer which may have restricted phage evolution in the lower resource environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lopez-Pascua and Buckling, 2008</xref>). Multiple (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manohar et al., 2018</xref>) and higher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barrow et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biswas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Debarbieux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Merril et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sunagar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vinodkumar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wills et al., 2005</xref>) phage doses have been shown previously to decrease morbidity and mortality in animal models. Our results build upon this work to show that maintaining high phage titers may have a positive effect in reducing resistant populations despite increasing the strength of selection for resistance.</p><p>Although our results suggest that the results of laboratory studies may parallel phage resistance—virulence trade-offs during in vivo phage therapy, there a number of important caveats. First, our in vivo results are based on that of a single patient which limits the generalizability of our results. Nevertheless, our replicated in vitro experiments agreed with our in vivo findings, which provide strength behind our conclusions. Second, our in vitro—in vivo results were comparable with regards to the direction of change, but absolute effect sizes were greater in vitro. For instance, we observed a higher proportion of phage resistant isolates in vitro that were also far less virulent than isolates found in vivo. Therefore, it may be expected that phenotypic changes will be exaggerated in vitro. These parallels were further dependent on the different underlying mechanisms (biofilm formation or growth rate) mediating the resistance-virulence trade-off having the same knock-on phenotypic outcomes. Had different environments selected for different phage resistance strategies, this may have resulted divergent phenotypic outcomes for virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alseth et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, as this patient had a nasal colonization, the role of the adaptive immune system would have been heavily reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ooi et al., 2008</xref>). The immune system has the potential to improve phage therapy success by synergistically killing bacteria with phage which may diminish the potential for phage resistance by reducing bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leung and Weitz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Roach et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, immune cells may kill phage and therefore prevent phage acting on bacterial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Belleghem et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the nasal cavity has a diverse microbiome that may have contributed to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> decolonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumpitsch et al., 2019</xref>). The role of the microbiome will differ in infection type, with gut and respiratory infections potentially having a greater microbiome effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumpitsch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lloyd-Price et al., 2016</xref>) while septic infections may have a greater immune system effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Belleghem et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is important to compare laboratory vs in vivo phage therapy in a number of infection types. The genomic background of the bacteria may further affect how sensitive its resistance strategies are to the environment it is in as more costly resistance strategies are more likely to be selected in vitro than in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Houte et al., 2016</xref>). This encompasses not only genetic variation within species but also differences between species that may differ in infection sites, immune responses, virulence and sensitivity to phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abedon, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doffkay, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Houte et al., 2016</xref>). Further work using isolates from case studies and clinical trials will give an insight into the predictability of bacteria and phage evolution from laboratory to in vivo studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient information, bacteria, and phage strains and phage-bacteria evolution in vivo</title><p>Bacterial isolates were sampled from a patient as part of a clinical trial in Brussels, Belgium. The patient (85 years old, male) had been admitted to an ICU in 2015 for treatment of burns (10% body area). Independent of his burns, a nasal colonization of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> was observed. Here, the patient was treated every day with a three-phage cocktail (BFC-1) for 5 days, which consisted of two phages (14–1 and PNM) that could lytically infect <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The phage cocktail included a third phage that specifically infects <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacterium, but this bacterium was not detected in this patient.

Swabs of both nasal cavities were taken on day 0 (commencement of phage therapy), 2, 4, 7, and 13 and frozen at –80℃ in lysogeny broth containing 20% glycerol. Individual <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates were obtained by plating swabs onto cetrimide selection plates. Colonies were picked and inoculated into LB and grown overnight, shaking at 180 rpm, at 37℃ to achieve high cell densities. Additionally, swabs were soaked in LB broth to amplify phage overnight in the same conditions. Phage was isolated from overnight cultures via chloroform extraction: 100 µl of chloroform was added 900 µl of culture, vortexed, and then centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 1 min); the supernatant was isolated and stored at 4°C. Culture samples were frozen in 80% glycerol (final concentration 40%) at –80℃. Spot assays on lawns of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> P573 (a phage susceptible control strain) confirmed the presence of phage at all time points.

We used two treatments: (1) phage added ‘once’, at the start of the experiment, and (2) phage added at every second transfer (‘repeated’ treatment). The repeated phage treatment aimed to emulate the conditions of the clinical trial (while preventing the buildup of too many ancestral phages in the ‘closed’ in vitro system) and the ‘once’ condition was used to assess whether repeated doses change the observed dynamics. The phages were identical to the two lytic phages (14–1 and PNM) used in the clinical trial. A control group in which bacteria evolved in the absence of phage was set up and there were six biological replicates in the control and each phage treatment.</p><p>Prior to experimental setup, in vivo ancestral isolates (n=24, same isolates as day 0) were individually amplified in LB media and cultured at room temperature for 2 days. Cell densities were estimated via optical density (wavelength 600 nm; OD<sub>600</sub>) measures. Cultures were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 3 min), the supernatant removed, and resuspended in M9 buffer to equalize cell densities. These were added to a master-mix in which isolates were equally represented in equal ratio (total 10<sup>8</sup> CFUs/ml; ~4×10<sup>6</sup> CFUs/ml of each isolate). 100 µl of master-mix (10<sup>7</sup> CFUs; ~4×10<sup>5</sup> CFUs per isolate) was inoculated into 5 ml LB media. 100 µl of phage was added to treatment microcosms at a total multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. Microcosms were cultured, shaken (180 rpm), at 37℃. 1% transfer (50 µl culture into 5 ml LB) took place every 2 days for a total of 12 days. At each transfer, culture samples were frozen in glycerol, and in the phage treatments, phages were extracted as described previously. Cultures were diluted and plated from frozen stocks onto LB agar and incubated for 2 days at 37°C. From each biological treatment replicate and time point (days 4, 8, and 12), 16 bacterial colonies were picked (96 total colonies) for time-shift assays to measure coevolutionary changes.

If bacteria and phage coevolved, both bacteria and phage would show significant changes in resistance and infectivity, respectively, through time. Increases in resistance and infectivity would be indicative of arms race dynamics, while nondirectional changes would be indicative of fluctuating selection dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lopez Pascua et al., 2014</xref>). Infectivity/resistance was determined by spot assays in which 100 µl of overnight bacterial cultures was added to 5–8 µl soft LB agar overlay and 5 µl of each ancestral phage, or evolved phage mixture, was spotted onto the overlay. For in vivo isolates, ancestral isolates (isolated pre-phage therapy) and bacterial isolates from days 2 to 4 were tested against the phage clonal isolates from days 2, 4, and 7. A bacterial isolate was scored as susceptible (1=susceptible, 0=resistant) if at least 1 of the 12 clonal phage isolates could infect. For in vivo analyses, each isolate was treated as an individual biological replicate. In vitro isolates from days 4, 8, and 12 were tested (16 colonies per time point) against phage populations isolated from each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Each treatment replicates from each time point were defined as biological replicates, while clonal isolates are biological replicates nested within each treatment replicate.

As few isolates remained phage susceptible (n=3), these were pooled with phage resistant isolates to determine a change in virulence from pre- (ancestral, n=24) to post-phage treatment (n=8).

This is especially pertinent as the experiment did not start from a clonal population, rather from 24 isolates (which included an isolate that was resistant to one phage). At the end of the experiment, we picked 24 isolates, extracted DNA from isolates individually, and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on pools of the bacterial isolates that were isolated from each replicate (pool-seq). Total DNA extraction (19 pooled-isolate samples) was performed using the ‘Qiagen QIAmp DNA Mini Kit’ following the manufacturer’s instructions. An Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer was used to generate 250-bp paired reads from a 500-bp insert library.</p><p>Reads were trimmed for the presence of Illumina adapter sequences and for quality scores below 10 using <italic>TrimGalore</italic> (v0.6.4_dev, powered by <italic>Cutadapt</italic>). <italic>TrimGalore</italic> also removed any paired-end reads when one of the paired-end reads was shorter than 20 bp.

Variants were identified using <italic>freebayes</italic> (v1.3.2-dirty) with ploidy set to 24 (<italic>-p 24</italic>) and we assumed pooled samples with a known number of genome copies (<italic><monospace>--pooled-discrete</monospace></italic>).

We then only kept variants that had different frequency than the ancestor (&gt;1/24 difference in frequency). To identify significant differences in genetic variants (SNPs and indels) between treatments, we first filtered unique that were present in at least three replicates of any treatment. This identified 960 potential variants. We then performed a Wilcoxon test on each variant, with frequency as the response variable and treatment (control, phage added once, and phage added repeatedly) as the predictor. Significant genetic variants were identified if the adjusted p value (<italic>fdr</italic> method) was &lt;0.05. Of these significant changes, 160 were existing genetic variants and 120 were novel mutations. We then checked where each variant was in the genome and only retained variants that occurred in a gene.

In vivo isolates from day 4 were excluded as their small sample size (n=2) prevented model convergence. For in vivo isolates: infection (1=susceptible, 0=resistant) was analyzed against phage time point (fixed effect) with a binomial error structure. A random effect of ‘isolate’ was included to account for the same bacterial isolate being used in infectivity assays across each phage time point. For in vitro analyses, the proportion of isolates infected was analyzed against fixed effects of phage and bacterial time points with separate models for each phage treatment. To see if there were any differences in phage resistance to ancestral phage or in vitro phage isolates at the end of the experiment, the proportion of isolates infected was analyzed against fixed effects of phage treatment and phage type (ancestral or end-point phage).

For all models, we fit a proportional hazards model with an M-splines baseline hazard. Models were ran for 3000 iterations and three chains were used with uninformative priors. Model convergence was assessed using Rhat values (all values were 1) and manually checking chain mixing. For all models, log hazards were estimated for each treatment value and HRs were calculated as the exponential of the difference between two log hazards. A HR below 1 indicates a decrease in virulence compared to the baseline treatment, with a value above 1 indicating an increase in virulence. Median HRs with 95% credible intervals that do not cross 1 indicate a significant difference in virulence between the two factors.

Biofilm production was used as the response variable and explained with interacting fixed effects of treatment and phage resistance, while treatment replicate was included as a random effect.

For in vitro isolates, growth rate was analyzed against treatment and resistance in a linear mixed-effects model with a random effect of treatment ‘replicate.’ Growth rates of isolates pre- and post-phage treatment, and resistant and susceptible in vivo isolates were compared using 95% CIs that were estimated using a nonparametric bootstrap.</p><p>To explore genetic differences of in vitro isolates, we calculated several commonly used metrics using the frequency data of the 50 variants in known genes that differed significantly between our treatments: (1) the genetic distance from the ancestral population, calculated as the sum of the difference of the proportion of each SNP/indel in each population from the ancestral proportion; (2) the number of unique de novo SNPs/indels in each population; (3) alpha diversity, calculated using a modified version of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, such that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, where i is the position of each SNP/indel, p is the proportion of the SNP/indel, and <italic>q</italic> is 1–p. This is equivalent to expected heterozygosity. Differences between these metrics were analyzed using linear models. To test whether consistent genetic differences occur within treatments, we performed nonmetric multidimensional scaling on the Euclidean distance matrix of SNPs/indels and their proportions in each population using ‘<italic>metaMDS</italic>’ in the R package ‘<italic>vegan.</italic>’ Nonmetric multidimensional scaling aims to collapse information from multiple dimensions (i.e., from different populations and multiple SNPs/indels per population) into just a few, allowing differences between samples to be visualized and interpreted. Permutational ANOVA tests were run using ‘<italic>vegan::adonis,</italic>’ with Euclidean distance as the response term and treatment as the predictor variable with 9999 iterations. Changes in beta-diversity were examined using ‘<italic>vegan::betadisper</italic>’ based on the same response and predictor variables as in the PERMANOVA.</p><p>For the in vivo sequencing, we looked for the presence of variants found to be significant in vitro in the in vivo isolates. To see if any of the genetic changes could explain differences in phenotypes of the isolates, we used nonmetric multidimensional scaling as described previously. Phenotypic traits of the isolates (virulence, growth rate, resistance profile, and biofilm production) were then mapped onto the resulting NMDS plot to see whether observed genetic changes correlated with any changes in phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data cleaning</title><p>Before growth rate analyses, data points from the first 2.5 hr were removed as a sharp increase in OD was observed before lag phase independent of exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In the in vitro data set, one replicate in the control and one in the susceptible treatments were found to be outliers that significantly impacted data analysis. In the susceptible treatment, the outlier (711) had a value 2.9× greater than the group mean (246.9) and this was 2.7× greater than the next nearest value (266.1). Similarly, in the control group, the outlier (708.6) had a value 2.26× greater than the group mean (313.5) and this was 2.5× greater than the next nearest value (278). We subsequently determined the impact of these values individually and when together on model output by sequentially removing these from the data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp4">Supplementary files 3 and 4</xref>). Resistance was significant regardless of outlier removal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) as were comparisons between resistant and susceptible groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Although treatment became significant when the susceptible outlier was removed, all Tukey-HSD comparisons were nonsignificant. The only change detected in Tukey HSD comparisons was that between the single resistant and susceptible isolates which was found when the susceptible and both outliers were removed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The decolonisation study protocol was approved by the Leading Ethics Committee of the &quot;Université Catholique de Louvain&quot; (Avis N°: B-403201111110).

infections, there are questions about the ease at which bacteria evolve phage resistance. To examine this, Castledine et al. cultured a set of bacterial isolates from a patient pre- and during phage therapy and also experimentally evolved a mixture of the bacterial isolates from the patient in the absence or presence of phage in vitro. Overall, the authors observed similarities between the evolutionary outcomes (genomic and phenotypic) in the patient and in vitro.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73679.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Storz</surname><given-names>Gisela</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.09.06.459069">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.06.459069v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz serving as Reviewing and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers thought this study was a strong candidate for <italic>eLife</italic> but suggest important edits and additional genomic analysis to improve the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The title is difficult to parse. Perhaps change to: &quot;Parallel evolutionary responses by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> to phage therapy in vivo and in vitro lead to enhanced phage resistance and loss of virulence&quot;.</p><p>2. Line 79-80 this wording is slightly odd. Do you mean that the supply of genetic variation is determined by population size and gene flow?</p><p>3. Line 103 there is something up with the hyphens/dashes here. I think perhaps you are using the wrong symbol?</p><p>4. Line 131-132 this requires a citation e.g. Wright et al. 2018.</p><p>5. Figure 1. I find this figure difficult to understand; I can't understand why you use different formats for A versus B/C or why you have a line connecting the ancestral phages to the in vivo isolated phages in panel A? The simplest fix would be to change panel A to match the format of panel B/C.</p><p>6. Virulence assays: do these test virulence or the ability to establish acute infection i.e. did you sample bacteria from the waxmoth at the end to see if they did indeed establish infection?</p><p>7. Phenotype-genotype correlations: another caveat here is that you tested a limited number of phenotypes; adding motility, resource use etc. would have been interesting and are known to be affected by phage resistance.</p><p>8. Line 621 these references don't really support the statement about molecular evolution as neither did any sequencing? Perhaps Betts et al. Science 2018 would be better?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This work is a nice contribution to the literature on understanding bacteria-phage interactions in different conditions. Below I have included some questions that remained for me after reading the manuscript, and specific suggestions for improving clarity.</p><p>1. In general, I often found it hard to follow where isolates were coming from for the different assays. An overview schematic/diagram figure might help clarify.</p><p>2. I thought it was particularly interesting that evolutionary similarities were found using LB as the in vitro media (and not a media type meant to replicate the in vivo environment). Could be interesting to highlight or at least mention in the discussion.</p><p>3. Line 124: &quot;The phage cocktail included a third phage that specifically infects <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacterium but was not detected in this patient.&quot; Was S. aureus or the third phage not detected in the patient? The language is unclear to me.</p><p>4. Line 149: Could the authors comment on why the &quot;repeated&quot; treatment was done using added phage every two transfers, with the transfers occurring two days apart? I am curious why this was chosen rather than applying phage daily as was done in vivo.</p><p>5. Line 162: An MOI of 0.5 was used in vitro – is there any idea/estimate of whether this was similar to what was applied in vivo?</p><p>6. Lines 184-186: I am curious about what the results would look like if the bacterial resistance/susceptibility data were not condensed to this binary metric (given that the authors have access to this information!). Is there any relationship between # of phages an isolate is resistant to and the other traits measured in this study?</p><p>7. Line 191: Could the authors comment more on the relevance of this model for virulence in humans (possibly in the discussion)?</p><p>8. Line 368: &quot;In subsequent tests of phage resistance to phage isolates isolated in vivo&quot; I found this wording unclear.</p><p>9. Line 374: Is &quot;7&quot; meant to be &quot;4&quot;?</p><p>10. Line 383 Figure 1: The text is written mostly in terms of bacterial resistance, but the y-axis in this figure is plotting susceptibility. I think it would be easier to follow if the y-axis is proportion resistant.</p><p>11. Line 403: &quot;there was a significantly higher proportion of phage resistant bacteria in the treatment where phages were added once compared to when phages were added repeatedly&quot; I think as written this is a little misleading – I am assuming (although not sure) that this is comparing proportion of T3 bacterial resistance to the T3 phages from the different treatments (which are different sets of phages). When comparing resistance to the same phages (e.g. the ancestral phages as shown in Figure 1b and 1c), bacteria from the &quot;repeated&quot; treatment have similar or even possibly higher levels of resistance.

The title is difficult to parse. Perhaps change to: &quot;Parallel evolutionary responses by <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> to phage therapy in vivo and in vitro lead to enhanced phage resistance and loss of virulence&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this title could have been more accessible and have changed this to, “Parallel evolution of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> phage resistance and virulence loss in response to phage treatment in vivo and in vitro”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 79-80 this wording is slightly odd. Do you mean that the supply of genetic variation is determined by population size and gene flow?</p></disp-quote><p>Here, we intended to convey that mutation supply is dependent on resources as this facilitates a rapid growth rate and, you rightly state, supports a large population size – as such there is a greater number of random mutations. This sentence has been clarified on line 87:</p><p>“In order to evolve phage resistance, bacteria must have sufficient mutation supply, which will primarily be determined by population size and gene flow (Gandon et al., 2008; Hampton et al., 2020; Morgan et al., 2010, 2005; Pal et al., 2007).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 103 there is something up with the hyphens/dashes here. I think perhaps you are using the wrong symbol?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this, these symbols have been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 131-132 this requires a citation e.g. Wright et al. 2018.</p></disp-quote><p>This citation has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 1. I find this figure difficult to understand; I can't understand why you use different formats for A versus B/C or why you have a line connecting the ancestral phages to the in vivo isolated phages in panel A? The simplest fix would be to change panel A to match the format of panel B/C.</p></disp-quote><p>As in vivo samples follow individual bacterial clones, observed data points in panel A would have a value of 0 or 1. In contrast, for our in vitro work we were able to sample multiple bacterial clones from individual treatment replicates to give an average resistance level for each replicate. We aimed to show as much consistency as possible between the panels by showing the mean levels of resistance for each bacterial population to phage. Lines do not connect ancestral to other phage time’s in panels B and C as ancestral levels of resistance were measured using a separate population of bacterial clones isolated at the end of the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Virulence assays: do these test virulence or the ability to establish acute infection? i.e. did you sample bacteria from the waxmoth at the end to see if they did indeed establish infection?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not sample bacteria at the end of infection, but our measure of virulence is consistent with classic definition, <italic>i.e.</italic>, increased host mortality resulting from parasite infection (May and Anderson 1990). We have clarified this in the methods (lines 593-594).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Phenotype-genotype correlations: another caveat here is that you tested a limited number of phenotypes; adding motility, resource use etc. would have been interesting and are known to be affected by phage resistance</p></disp-quote><p>We have now highlighted these as other potential phenotypes that could have also been measured (lines 436-439). We have also stated this was beyond the scope of this work owing to the volume of data presented and we do not think these assays would not change the conclusions significantly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 621 these references don't really support the statement about molecular evolution as neither did any sequencing? Perhaps Betts et al. Science 2018 would be better?</p></disp-quote><p>Although Pal et al. (2007) and Morgan et al. (2010) did not do sequencing, they showed phage select for mutator strains of bacteria which are shown to accelerate molecular evolution. We have added Betts et al. (2018) as further support for this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This work is a nice contribution to the literature on understanding bacteria-phage interactions in different conditions. Below I have included some questions that remained for me after reading the manuscript, and specific suggestions for improving clarity.</p><p>1. In general, I often found it hard to follow where isolates were coming from for the different assays. An overview schematic/diagram figure might help clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is challenging to follow and have included a figure (Figure 6) to clarify how colonies evolved in vitro were isolated for each assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I thought it was particularly interesting that evolutionary similarities were found using LB as the in vitro media (and not a media type meant to replicate the in vivo environment). Could be interesting to highlight or at least mention in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now highlighted this on lines 382-384.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 124: &quot;The phage cocktail included a third phage that specifically infects <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacterium but was not detected in this patient.&quot; Was S. aureus or the third phage not detected in the patient? The language is unclear to me.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for the confusion. Here, we meant to indicate the bacteria (<italic>S. aureus</italic>) and this has been edited for clarity 509-510.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Line 149: Could the authors comment on why the &quot;repeated&quot; treatment was done using added phage every two transfers, with the transfers occurring two days apart? I am curious why this was chosen rather than applying phage daily as was done in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We struggled with this decision. Our rationale was that phage would be rapidly lost from the nasal cavity (immunity, breathing, dispersal of mucous), while the in vitro environment is a closed system. We were concerned about obscuring any phage evolution in the latter by continually flooding the system with large numbers of ancestral phages. As a result, we chose to apply phage every second day in vivo (now clarified on lines 536-537).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 162: An MOI of 0.5 was used in vitro – is there any idea/estimate of whether this was similar to what was applied in vivo?</p></disp-quote><p>It is unfortunately too difficult to accurately estimate <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> densities from a single swab or even the actual amount of phage that successfully settled in the respiratory tract from a nebuliser. However, the aim was to establish a relatively high MOI in vivo with a phage density of 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/mL in the nebuliser solution.</p><p><italic>6. Lines 184-186: I am curious about what the results would look like if the bacterial resistance/susceptibility data were not condensed to this binary metric (given that the authors have access to this information!). Is there any relationship between # of phages an isolate is resistant to and the other traits measured in this study?</italic></p><p>Unfortunately, while this would be interesting to investigate, we do not have access to this information – bacterial resistance was measured as a binary variable (using spotting assays) against phage populations at each time point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Line 191: Could the authors comment more on the relevance of this model for virulence in humans (possibly in the discussion)?</p></disp-quote><p>Waxmoth larvae lack the adaptive immune system of vertebrates, including humans, but it is argued that similarities in innate immune systems allow to be a comparable model for acute infections. As the infection in our study was a nasal colonisation, lacking adaptive immune system involvement, we believe this is an appropriate model for virulence. We have highlighted this on lines 591-593.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 368: &quot;In subsequent tests of phage resistance to phage isolates isolated in vivo&quot; I found this wording unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, we have clarified this wording (lines 131-132).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Line 374: Is &quot;7&quot; meant to be &quot;4&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Line 383 Figure 1: The text is written mostly in terms of bacterial resistance, but the y-axis in this figure is plotting susceptibility. I think it would be easier to follow if the y-axis is proportion resistant.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this would match with the text more closely and have adjusted the figure to proportion resistant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Line 403: &quot;there was a significantly higher proportion of phage resistant bacteria in the treatment where phages were added once compared to when phages were added repeatedly&quot; I think as written this is a little misleading – I am assuming (although not sure) that this is comparing proportion of T3 bacterial resistance to the T3 phages from the different treatments (which are different sets of phages). When comparing resistance to the same phages (e.g. the ancestral phages as shown in Figure 1b and 1c), bacteria from the &quot;repeated&quot; treatment have similar or even possibly higher levels of resistance. Note this was also written similarly in lines 650-651.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this could be confusing or misleading. We have clarified on lines 167 and 448 that this difference is where resistance is measured to contemporary phage populations. As the contemporary phage population is the active infecting population of phage, we would argue this is the most informative measure of phage resistance to report at the end of the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12.

We think that it is more appropriate to separate the boxplots by treatment, both because this is what was manipulated and for consistency with other figures. The different symbols for susceptible and resistant isolates make the difference in biofilm production clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Line 602-603: &quot;That resistance emerged predominantly by de novo mutations and not selection on existing variation&quot; how exactly was this concluded?</p></disp-quote><p>There were many more de novo mutations in the in vitro phage treatments than the no phage control had 5-10 times more de novo mutations than control populations, suggesting de novo mutations were an important determinate of phage resistance. We have clarified this on lines 352-354.</p><p>“In total, 31 of 50 genetic changes (62%) in vitro were found in vivo.
