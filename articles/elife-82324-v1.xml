In the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway, it has been proposed that ATR is recruited to RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) by direct ATRIP-RPA interaction. However, it remains elusive how ATRIP is recruited to ssDNA in an RPA-independent manner. Here, we provide evidence that APE1 directly associates ssDNA to recruit ATRIP onto ssDNA in an RPA-independent fashion. The N-terminal motif within APE1 is required and sufficient for the APE1-ATRIP interaction in vitro and the distinct APE1-ATRIP interaction is required for ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA and the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. In addition, APE1 directly associates with RPA70 and RPA32 via two distinct motifs. Taken together, our evidence suggests that APE1 recruits ATRIP onto ssDNA in an RPA-dependent and -independent manner in the ATR DDR pathway.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATR</kwd><kwd>APE1</kwd><kwd>RPA</kwd><kwd>ATRIP</kwd><kwd>ssDNA</kwd><kwd>DDR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA225637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Shan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03CA270663</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Shan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21ES032966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Shan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010942</institution-id><institution>University of North Carolina at Charlotte</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Seed grants</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Shan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Distinct interactions of AP endonuclease 1 with single-stranded DNA gaps and ATRIP and RPA protein complex address an outstanding question in the field of genome integrity regarding how ATR/ATRIP complex recruits onto damage site for ATR DNA damage response signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathways such as ATR-Chk1 and ATM-Chk2 are activated by DNA replication stress or different DNA damage to coordinate DNA repair with cell cycle as well as apoptosis and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Branzei and Foiani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harper and Elledge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harrison and Haber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Su, 2006</xref>). In response to stalled DNA replication forks and different DNA lesions including DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-strand breaks (SSBs), ATR DDR can be recruited to and activated by RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) derived from functional uncoupling of MCM helicase and DNA polymerase activities, DSB end resection in the 5'â3' direction, or SSB end resection in the 3'â5' direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ciccia and Elledge, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MarÃ©chal and Zou, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shiotani and Zou, 2009</xref>). ATR activation also requires several mediator proteins such as ATRIP, TopBP1, and the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 (9-1-1) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Delacroix et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kumagai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yan and Michael, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>). Activated ATR kinase then phosphorylates a variety of substrates such as Chk1, among others, and phosphorylated Chk1 is the activated version of Chk1 kinase to regulate cell cycle progression and often serves as an indicator of ATR DDR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Sanchez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matsuoka et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Since the discovery of ATRIP in ATR DDR pathway about 20 years ago, it has been an active subject of studies regarding how the ATR-ATRIP complex is recruited to ssDNA and activated by ATR activator/mediator proteins to maintain genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cortez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>). Earlier studies from several groups using human and yeast cells as well as <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts have revealed independently that ATR and ATRIP associate with each other into a tight complex and that the direct ATRIP recognition and interaction with RPA-ssDNA is essential for the recruitment of ATR to ssDNA regions at sites of DNA damage for ATR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Unsal-KaÃ§maz and Sancar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>). However, the RPA requirement of ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA for ATR DDR activation is sort of questioned by several follow-up reports demonstrating that ATR-ATRIP complexes can bind to ssDNA in an RPA-independent manner in vitro, and that the low affinity RPA-independent recruitment of ATRIP to ssDNA is mediated by an unknown protein in mammalian cell nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bomgarden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2005</xref>).

Recent pre-clinical and clinical studies have shown encouraging finding of APE1 inhibitor APX3330 in anti-cancer therapy in solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caston et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shahda et al., 2019</xref>). Our recent studies have demonstrated that the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway is activated by hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative DNA damage and defined plasmid-based SSB structures in <italic>Xenopus</italic> high-speed supernatant (HSS) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Willis et al., 2013</xref>). To promote the ATR DDR activation, APE1 initiates the 3'â5' end resection at SSB sites to generate a short ~1â3 nt-ssDNA gap via its exonuclease activity, followed by PCNA-mediated APE2-dependent SSB end resection continuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). This APE1/2-mediated two-step processing of SSBs generates a longer stretch of ssDNA (~18â26 nt) coated by RPA, leading to the assembly of the ATR DDR complex (ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, and 9-1-1 complex), subsequent ATR DDR activation, and eventual SSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hossain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether APE1 plays a direct role in the ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA via a non-catalytic function in the presence and/or absence of RPA for the ATR DDR pathway.</p><p>Here, we provide direct evidence that in addition to its exonuclease-mediated function, APE1 plays a direct role in the recruitment of ATRIP to ssDNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and in in vitro reconstitution system with purified proteins. The N-terminal motif of APE1 is required for its direct association with ssDNA in vitro, and such APE1-ssDNA interaction can be enhanced by RPA. Importantly, APE1 directly interacts with ATRIP and recruits ATRIP to ssDNA with the absence of RPA in vitro. A mutant APE1 deficient for ATRIP interaction but proficient for ssDNA association could not recruit ATRIP onto ssDNA in the presence of endogenous RPA in APE1-depleted <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. Similar to wild type APE1, a nuclease mutant APE1 still recruits ATRIP onto ssDNA in APE1-depleted HSS, suggesting that APE1âs role in ATRIP ssDNA recruitment is not dependent on its nuclease activity. APE1 directly associates with RPA in vitro via two distinct motifs within APE1. Notably, the RPA-interaction-deficient APE1 had no effect on the ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. Overall, the data in this study demonstrating that APE1 is required for ATRIP recruitment to RPA-coated ssDNA for ATR DDR activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, and that APE1 directly associates with and recruits ATRIP to ssDNA in the absence of RPA in vitro. These findings thus support a previously uncharacterized critical non-catalytic function of APE1 for direct ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA independent of RPA for the ATR DDR pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>APE1 is required for the recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA in the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts</title><p>Our recent studies have revealed that APE1 plays an important role in the defined SSB structure-induced ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway via its 3'â5' exonuclease activity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). This APE1-mediated initiation of 3'â5' SSB end resection (~1â3 nt-ssDNA gap) will be followed by APE2 recruitment and activation to continue SSB end resection, generating a longer stretch of ssDNA (~18â26 nt-ssDNA) coated by RPA for subsequent assembly of an ATR checkpoint protein complex including ATR-ATRIP, TopBP1, and 9-1-1 complex to activate ATR DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Willis et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to the 3'â5' SSB end resection initiation, we are interested in whether APE1 plays other roles such as non-catalytic function in the ATR DDR pathway. To test this question directly, we chose to utilize a defined plasmid DNA with a 1â3 nt small ssDNA gap structure (designated as Gap plasmid) in vitro as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2018</xref>), and tested whether APE1 is still required for the ATR DDR in response to this Gap plasmid in HSS (top of the panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, the defined Gap plasmid (âGapâ), but not control plasmid (âCTLâ) triggered Chk1 phosphorylation, suggesting the activation of the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway by the defined Gap plasmid in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, the Gap plasmid-induced Chk1 phosphorylation was still impaired in APE1-depleted HSS system (âextractâ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that APE1 may play an additional non-catalytic function in the ATR DDR pathway. To further define the additional role of APE1 in ATR DDR activation, we isolated the DNA-bound fractions from the HSS and examined the abundance of checkpoint proteins via immunoblotting analysis. Although the recruitment of RPA70 and RPA32 to the Gap plasmid was slightly reduced when APE1 was depleted from the HSS (âDNA-boundâ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the presence of RPA70 and RPA32 on Gap-plasmid DNA suggests that the gap structure can be further processed by APE2 in the APE1-depleted HSS, consistent with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, the recruitment of ATRIP onto Gap plasmid was significantly compromised in APE1-depleted HSS, suggesting that APE1 plays a more direct role in ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA regions in the defined Gap plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>AP endonuclease 1 (APE1) is required for the recruitment of ATRIP to RPA-coated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CTL (control) or Gap plasmid was added to Mock- or APE1-depleted high-speed supernatant (HSS) and incubated for 30 min.

We chose to test two 100 bp-dsDNA structures with either 30 nt- or 80 nt-ssDNA gap covalently linked with 5'-biotin on top strand (designated as â30 nt gapâ and â80 nt gapâ) for subsequent streptavidin magnetic bead-bound isolation and analysis from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (top of the panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When equal moles of dsDNA with 30 nt or 80 nt-ssDNA gap were added to HSS, more RPA70 and RPA32 as well as APE1 and ATRIP are recruited to the 80 nt-ssDNA gap and Chk1 phosphorylation was also enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This enhanced Chk1 phosphorylation is likely due to increased RPA complex recruitment onto the 80 nt-ssDNA gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Whereas APE1 depletion led to compromised Chk1 phosphorylation, the recruitment of ATRIP but not RPA70 nor RPA32 was compromised in APE1-depleted HSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Our observations so far suggest that APE1 is important for the recruitment of ATRIP onto RPA-coated ssDNA and Chk1 phosphorylation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS.</p><p>To re-evaluate the role of RPA in the recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps, we performed RPA depletion experiment in HSS and characterized the phenotype of RPA depletion in ATRIP recruitment and ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway. With anti-RPA antibodies, majority of the endogenous RPA protein complex, if not all, was immunodepleted from HSS (extract panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), and such RPA depletion led to almost no binding of RPA protein complex (RPA70 and RPA32) onto the defined ssDNA gaps and impairment of the ssDNA-induced Chk1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Whereas RPA deletion did not decrease the recruitment of APE1 onto ssDNA gaps, the recruitment of endogenous ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps (30 nt and 80 nt) was impaired in RPA-depleted HSS (bead-bound panel and quantification panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). We noted that anti-RPA antibodies co-depleted some endogenous ATRIP protein from HSS, but had almost no co-depletion of endogenous APE1 protein in HSS (Lanes 1â3 vs Lanes 4â6 in extract panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This co-depletion of endogenous ATRIP protein is similar to a previous observation by the Dunphy group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2005</xref>), and may suggest a tight complex formation between endogenous ATRIP and RPA protein complex in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. Our quantifications of ssDNA-bound ATRIP normalized to available ATRIP protein in HSS showed that RPA depletion almost had no effect on ATRIPâs binding to the 30 nt-ssDNA gap, and only mildly decreased the binding of ATRIP (~20%) to 80 nt-ssDNA gap (quantification panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). These observations suggest that the recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps is RPA-dependent and RPA-independent in the HSS system.</p><p>Because ssDNA gaps have been widely accepted as a central platform for protein recruitment and activation of the ATR/Chk1 DDR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MarÃ©chal and Zou, 2015</xref>), we are prompted to evaluate the role of APE1 in the ATR/Chk1 DDR pathway in cultured cells. Hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative DNA damage triggered Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser345 and Ser317 in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, suggesting the activation of ATR DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Notably, siRNA-mediated APE1 knockdown of human APE1 in U2OS cells compromised the hydrogen peroxide-induced Chk1 phosphorylation, suggesting that APE1 is important for the ATR/Chk1 DDR in cultured human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Our observation here is consistent with two prior studies showing that APE1 is important for the ATR DDR pathway activation in response to oxidative DNA damage in human cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and PANC1 cells, and ultraviolet damage in non-dividing nucleotide excision repair-deficient (i.e. XPC<sup>-/-</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vrouwe et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Next, to determine whether APE1 plays any direct role in the RPA-dependent ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA gaps, we tested whether His-tagged ATRIP recombinant protein can be recruited to 30 nt- or 80 nt-ssDNA gap in vitro in the absence or presence of equal moles of recombinant RPA complex. Consistent with previously reported RPA-dependent ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>), 30/80 nt-ssDNA coated with RPA70 and RPA32 significantly enhanced the recruitment of His-ATRIP in vitro, although almost no binding of ATRIP onto ssDNA (30 nt and 80 nt) was observed in the absence of recombinant RPA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We noticed more binding of His-ATRIP onto 80 nt-ssDNA gap compared with 30 nt-ssDNA gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, the recruitment of His-ATRIP onto 30 nt- and 80 nt-ssDNA was similar to each when same amount of ssDNA gap structures was coupled to beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of GST-APE1 but not GST protein increased the recruitment of His-ATRIP onto ssDNA with the presence of His-RPA complex in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It is worth noting that the presence of GST-APE1 had almost no noticeable effect on the recruitment of His-RPA70 and His-RPA32 to ssDNA gap structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, the presence of GST-APE1 but not GST increased the recruitment of endogenous ATRIP but not endogenous RPA70/RPA32 to ssDNA gap structures in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Whereas RPA itself is sufficient for ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA in vitro, our observations here suggest that APE1 may stimulate the RPA-dependent ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA in vitro. Alternatively, it is possible that APE1 may play an additional but direct role in the recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA in vitro that is independent of RPA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>APE1 recognizes and binds with ssDNA directly in a length-dependent manner in vitro</title><p>Although APE1 is known as a DNA repair protein to specifically recognize and process AP site, it remains unclear whether and how APE1 interacts with ssDNA. To identify the possible direct role of APE1 in ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA, we first performed systematic analysis of APE1 association with ssDNA. Our bead-bound experiments showed that GST-APE1 but not GST was recruited onto 30 nt- and 80 nt-ssDNA gap structures in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref>). We also determined that GST-APE1 but not GST was recruited onto beads coupled with 70 nt-ssDNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrated that GST-APE1 but not GST was recruited to beads coupled with 40 nt-, 60 nt-, and 80 nt-ssDNA, but not 10 nt- nor 20 nt-ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, the longer ssDNA is, the more GST-APE1 is recruited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Intriguingly, AA101-316 but not AA35-316 GST-APE1 associated with ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We speculate that the fragment of AA35-100 within APE1 may somehow inhibit the APE1-ssDNA association due to a currently unknown mechanism. In addition, our electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) revealed that WT GST-APE1 but not GST formed protein-ssDNA complex in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Notably, neither AA35-316 nor AA1-34 GST-APE1 formed protein-ssDNA complex in EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Notably, AA101-316 GST-APE1 was recruited to 30 nt- and 80 nt-ssDNA gap structures but could not recruit ATRIP to ssDNA, due to deficiency in ATRIP association (Lanes 7â9 in âbead-boundâ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These observations strongly support that APE1 interacts with ssDNA via its AA1-34 fragment and recruits ATRIP onto ssDNA via its AA1-100 in in vitro reconstitution systems, and that such APE1-mediated ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA is independent of RPA.</p><p>To test the biological significance of APE1-mediated ATRIP onto ssDNA, we performed rescue experiments in APE1-depleted HSS. WT GST-APE1 but not AA101-316 GST-APE1 rescued the recruitment of endogenous ATRIP onto 30 nt- and 80 nt-ssDNA gap structures and subsequent Chk1 phosphorylation, although endogenous RPA70 and RPA32 as well as WT/AA101-316 GST-APE1 associated with ssDNA gap structures in APE1-depleted HSS (compare Lanes 4â6 and Lanes 7â9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This observation indicates the significance of the APE1-ATRIP interaction for ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA and subsequent ATR DDR pathway activation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. In addition, we performed rescue experiment by adding back AA35-316 GST-APE1 in APE1-depleted HSS system, compared with WT GST-APE1. Our result showed that AA35-316 GST-APE1 was deficient for the interaction with ssDNA gaps and ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA gaps, and subsequent defective Chk1 phosphorylation in APE1-depleted HSS system, although WT and AA35-316 GST-APE1 were added to APE1-depleted HSS at the similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, ssDNA-coated endogenous RPA protein complex could not recruit AA35-316 GST-APE1 and endogenous ATRIP onto ssDNA in APE1-depleted HSS, although AA35-316 GST-APE1 is proficient for the interaction with ATRIP and RPA protein in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). All these observations indicate that APE1âs ssDNA binding capacity and ATRIP interaction are important for both RPA-dependent and RPA-independent ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA and the ATR/Chk1 in the HSS system.</p><p>In light of the significance of APE1 and its 3'â5' exonuclease in the initial end resection of defined SSB structures and subsequent ATR DDR pathway in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2020</xref>), we sought to test whether APE1âs catalytic function plays a vital role in the direct ATRIP regulation and chose to use ED GST-APE1 lacking 3'â5' exonuclease and AP endonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2AâB</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2020</xref>).

This observation suggests that APE1âs nuclease activity is dispensable for its direct recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA gap structures and subsequent ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway activation in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system. Together, these findings demonstrate that APE1 directly associates with and recruits ATRIP onto ssDNA in vitro and that APE1 recruits ATRIP onto ssDNA via a non-catalytic function to promote the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway activation in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>APE1 interacts with RPA70 and RPA32 via two distinct binding motifs</title><p>We have shown that APE1 depletion and RPA depletion led to deficiency or impairment in the recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we sought to determine whether APE1 interacts with RPA directly, and, if so, whether RPA plays a role for APE1-mediated ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA for ATR DDR in the HSS system. Due to the significant role of RPA in the recruitment of ATR direct activators such as TopBP1 and ETAA1 to ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acevedo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lyu et al., 2019</xref>), it is not technically feasible to test whether RPA depletion directly or indirectly affects the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway in the HSS system due to potential defective APE1-mediated ATRIP recruitment. Our strategy is to identify RPA-interaction motifs within APE1 in vitro, and to determine whether a mutant APE1 deficient in RPA interaction still recruits ATRIP onto ssDNA in the HSS system.</p><p>First, we tested the possibility that recombinant GST-APE1 might interact with purified recombinant His-RPA complex (RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14) by protein-protein interaction assays.

Almost no noticeable effects were observed for the interaction of ED, DA, and CA GST-APE1 with His-RPA70, suggesting that the E95, D209, D306, C92, and C98 residues in APE1 are not critical for ATRIP interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Domain dissection experiments revealed that AA35-316 and AA1-100 GST-APE1 associated with His-RPA70 in a similar capacity to WT GST-APE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The binding to His-RPA70 was decreased but nevertheless not completely eliminated in other deletion fragments of GST-APE1 tested (i.e. AA101-316, AA1-34, AA35-100, AA101-200) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

To determine whether these two possible RPA-binding motifs within APE1 are important for RPA association, we generated single mutant in RBM1 (D69A, designated as RBM1-M) or RBM2 (E148A-E149A, designated as RBM2-M) or in combination (D69A-E148A-E149A, designated as RBM-DM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). GST pulldown assays showed that RBM-DM GST-APE1 was defective for interaction with His-RPA70 and His-RPA32 in vitro, although RPA association was mildly impaired in single mutant RBM1-M and RBM2-M GST-APE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). However, neither of the RPA-binding mutants within APE1 affected its association with His-ATRIP protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Our observations here suggest that APE1 directly interacts with RPA70 and RPA32 in vitro using two previously uncharacterized distinct motifs within APE1 (i.e. RBM1 and RBM2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Our earlier result showed that APE1 depletion led to defective ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA at gap structures and Chk1 phosphorylation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

It is interesting to test whether the RPA-dependent ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA and APE1-dependent ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA is potentially competitive or cooperative. Using in vitro pulldown assays with beads coupled with 80 nt-ssDNA gap, we found that the presence of both His-RPA protein complex and GST-APE1 protein increased the recruitment of His-ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps, compared with each protein individually (Lane 4 vs Lane 2 or 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3Eâ3F</xref>).

In Mode #2, APE1 protein can interact with ATRIP that is not in complex with RPA protein complex, and recruits ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps independent of RPA in HSS.

Whereas the concentration of <italic>Xenopus</italic> APE1 protein in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg was estimated to be ~1.5 Î¼M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">WÃ¼hr et al., 2014</xref>), the concentration of hAPE1 protein in HEK293T cells was estimated to ~2.8 Î¼M (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://opencell.czbiohub.org/gene/ENSG00000100823">https://opencell.czbiohub.org/gene/ENSG00000100823</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">WiÅniewski et al., 2014</xref>). Considering most APE1 protein is localized inside of the nucleus of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li and Wilson, 2014</xref>), the observed APE1 affinity and interaction with ssDNA in our in vitro EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) are physiologically relevant. Notably, the APE1-ssDNA interaction is critical for the recruitment of ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps in vitro and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts for ATR DDR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A previous study has demonstrated that APE1 can incise the AP site within ssDNA in a sequence- and secondary-structure-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fan et al., 2006</xref>). Although this finding implies that that APE1 may associate with ssDNA, the molecular determinant of APE1 for ssDNA interaction is elusive. A more recent study using EMSA has determined that a 22 nt-ssDNA structure is sufficient for a stable hAPE1-ssDNA complex formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bazlekowa-Karaban et al., 2019</xref>), which is in line with our estimated ssDNA gap size (~18â26 nt) for APE1 recruitment and ATR DDR activation in response to defined SSB structures in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, a structural biology preprint study has shown that the critical residues in active sites (e.g. Y171, D210, N212, H309) and DNA intercalating residue R177 of hAPE1 are important for the formation and/or stabilization of the hAPE1-ssDNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoitsma et al., 2022</xref>), which is supportive of our observation on the AA101-316 APE1 interaction with ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, mouse APE1 was shown to interact with 20 nt-ssDNA and -dsDNA for exonucleolytic cleavage in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Although it remains unknown how the NT34 motif of APE1 contributes to ssDNA interaction and its 3'â5' exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2CâD</xref>), this is reminiscent of the regulation of APE2 3'â5' exonuclease by its C-terminal Zf-GRF interaction with ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wallace et al., 2017</xref>). It has been reported that hAPE1 N-terminal domain is important for ssRNA interaction and RNA metabolism as well as biomolecular condensates formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fantini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Future studies are needed to determine how exactly APE1 N-terminal motif and/or EEP domain contributes to ssDNA interaction.</p><p>It is an outstanding question in the field of ATR DDR regarding how exactly ATRIP protein is recruited onto ssDNA gaps in an RPA-dependent and/or -independent manner. We have elucidated in this study that the NT100 motif of APE1 is required and sufficient for ATRIP interaction in in vitro protein-protein interaction assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and that the APE1-ATRIP interaction is essential for the recruitment of recombinant ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps in in vitro reconstitution system and endogenous ATRIP protein to ssDNA gaps in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3CâD</xref>). Our observations support the critical role of the APE1-ATRIP interaction in the APE1-dependent ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA gaps. For the Mode #1 APE1- and RPA-dependent recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps, we hypothesize that an unknown Protein X may negatively regulate ATRIP binding to RPA complex, especially RPA70 N-terminal domain, which has been involved in the recruitment of several DDR proteins to ssDNA such as ETAA1, Mre11, Nbs1, Rad9, p53, and PRIMPOL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhat and Cortez, 2018</xref>). APE1 protein may reverse or counteract with such inhibitory effect of Protein X in the recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA. Alternatively, APE1 NT100 motif interacts with ATRIP and RPA70, which may be required for the conformation change and/or stabilization of ATRIP-RPA-ssDNA in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Future studies will test these different scenarios.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time showing that APE1 directly associates with RPA via its two distinct motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A previous study mentioned that His-tagged hAPE1 protein did not associate with purified untagged RPA protein using Ni-NTA-bead-based pulldown assays in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fan et al., 2006</xref>). Although we canât explain the discrepancy with our result, we speculate that this may be due to different pulldown methods and optimized experimental conditions. The two RPA-bindings motifs within APE1 bind to RPA70 and RPA32, which is similar to the recently characterzied ETAA-RPA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haahr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Although RPA interaction is needed for the recruitment of ATR activator proteins ETAA1 and TopBP1 to damage sites and ssDNA for ATR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acevedo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bass et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haahr et al., 2016</xref>), our findings suggest that APE1 can associate with ssDNA and interacts and recruits ATRIP onto ssDNA in an RPA-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). In addition, recent studies using mammalian cells have shown that APE1 and RPA can form biomolecular condensates independently in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Spegg et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, it is interesting to test in the future whether the APE1-RPA interaction may play a role in biomolecular condensate formation on ssDNA gaps.</p><p>Taken together, our findings in this study have elucidated distinct mechanisms of how APE1 contributes to the ATR DDR pathway activation via non-catalytic functions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Akira Shinohara as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In addition to the Essential Revisions, please address also the other reviewers' comments. If you think the experiments suggested are not reasonable, please provide relevant arguments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. It is very important to re-evaluate the role of RPA in the ATRIP recruitment to ssDNAs in in vitro <italic>Xenopus</italic> high-speed supernatant (HSS) by depleting RPA (and both RPA and APE1, if still ATRIP binding in the absence of RPA) from the HSS. In this experiment, the authors would be able to nicely show RPA-independent (APE1-dependent) ATRIP binding to the gapped DNAs.</p><p>2. To evaluate the role of APE1 in the ATR signaling in vivo, the authors need to analyze Chk1 phosphorylation or other ATR activation marker(s) in APE1-siRNA depletion experiments in a cell line (or a deletion mutant of yeast if the mechanism is conserved) with exposures to chemicals which induce gapped ssDNAs such as H2O2.</p><p>3. It is essential to quantify all biochemical results with proper statistics and to mention the reproducibility for all in vitro and future in vivo experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper needs some additional work to validate the main conclusion and should show the quantification of all biochemical results.</p><p>1. Figures 1A, B and Figure 4D clearly showed that APE1-depletion from the extract does not induce ATRIP-binding to ssDNA substrates and, as a result, impairs Chk1-phosphorylation even in the presence of RPA on the ssDNAs. This strongly suggests that RPA-binding to ssDNAs is NOT sufficient for ATRIP-recruitment (and ATR activation) on the ssDNAs at least in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system, implying, a new role of RPA in ATR-activation other than the simple recruitment of ATRIP; the cooperation with APE1. A simple idea is that RPA directly recruits APE1, and then APE1 recruits ATRIP &quot;without&quot; direct interaction with ssDNA, rather a model proposed in Figure 5B with a negative regulator &quot;X&quot;, which partly comes from complicated regulation of APE1 binding to the DNAs with a negative regulation by 35-100 aa region of the protein. To approve or deney the possibility and further elucidate the role of DNA binding of APE1 in the checkpoint activation, it is critical to test the role of APE1 DNA binding in ATR/CHK1 signaling by examining AA35-316 for Chk1 activation in APE-depleted <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts as shown in Figure 3D.</p><p>2. It is important to check the binding of ATRIP to ssDNA in the presence of both APE1 and RPA by checking the effect of differential ratios of APE1 and RPA on in vitro binding of ATRIP to the ssDNA as shown in Figures 1C and 3C. The authors can address whether the abilities of the two proteins to recruit ATRIP to the ssDNA is competitive or cooperative or independent.</p><p>3. RBM1 in APE1 shows sequence similarity to an N-terminal region of ATRIP for RAP70N (OB-F of RPA70) binding. If so, the RBM1 of APE1 and the ATRIP region should show competitive bindings to RPA70N.

As depicted in the model in Figure 5B, the main role of APE1 in promoting ATR activation in HSS extracts seems to be to counteract a putative inhibitor of ATRIP recruitment. However, there is no data in the paper showing that this role is linked to the RPA-independent mechanism of ATRIP recruitment. It is suggested to remove &quot;RPA-independent manner&quot; from the title.</p><p>2. An important experiment missing is to test the effect of RPA on APE1-dependent ATRIP recruitment. In the in vitro experimental setting, the authors should compare absence versus presence of RPA to address if the addition of RPA strongly enhances ATRIP recruitment when APE1 is present.</p><p>3. The authors never discuss the importance of APE1 for ATR activation in different contexts and different lesion types. Is the role of APE1 in promoting ATRIP recruitment broadly required for ATR activation? If so, one would predict that cells lacking APE1 should exhibit deficient ATR signaling in response to several types of genotoxins (and is that the case?). If not, then how do the authors explain the central importance of APE1 in ATRIP recruitment in their system given that ssDNA is a general trigger of ATR signaling?</p><p>4. In Figures 1A and 1B, APE1 depletion completely blocked ATRIP recruitment to Gap plasmids and dsDNA containing 30nt and 80nt ssDNA gaps. These results indicated that APE1 is essential for the recruitment of ATRIP onto RPA-coated ssDNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS and RPA cannot bind ATRIP without the presence of APE1. However, this explanation conflicts with the proposed model in Figure 5A, in which RPA is able to recruit ATRIP without APE1. As such, the working model in Figure 5A is not supported by the HSS experiments performed in Figure 1. The authors need to clarify this point of confusion, which is probably attributed to the model in Figure 5A being based only on in vitro data.</p><p>5. In Figure 1D the authors claim that APE1 increases the recruitment of ATRIP, however, such an increase in recruitment is not obvious from the presented blot, and careful quantitation (with replicates and statistics) should be presented to support the claim.</p><p>6. In Figures 2B and 2C, the authors show that APE1-ssDNA association occurs in a length-dependent manner in vitro, where no ssDNA shorter than 30nt is shown to interact with APE1. However, this is in conflict with Figure 1A, in which Gap plasmid resected to reveal 18-26nt of ssDNA (refer to line 129) is still able to robustly interact with APE1. The authors should address this discrepancy.</p><p>7. The concentrations of APE1 proteins used for EMSA assay should be disclosed to show the binding affinity of APE1 and ssDNA.

It is very important to re-evaluate the role of RPA in the ATRIP recruitment to ssDNAs in in vitro <italic>Xenopus</italic> high-speed supernatant (HSS) by depleting RPA (and both RPA and APE1, if still ATRIP binding in the absence of RPA) from the HSS. In this experiment, the authors would be able to nicely show RPA-independent (APE1-dependent) ATRIP binding to the gapped DNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We performed RPA depletion in HSS and added additional paragraph in the revised manuscript to describe the new data (Page 7 Line 165-184):</p><p>âTo re-evaluate the role of RPA in the recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps, we performed RPA depletion experiment in HSS and characterized the phenotype of RPA depletion in ATRIP recruitment and ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway. With anti-RPA antibodies, majority of the endogenous RPA protein complex, if not all, was immunodepleted from HSS (Extract panel, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A), and such RPA depletion led to almost no binding of RPA protein complex (RPA70 and RPA32) onto the defined ssDNA gaps and impairment of the ssDNA-induced Chk1 phosphorylation (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). Whereas RPA deletion did not decrease the recruitment of APE1 onto ssDNA gaps, the recruitment of endogenous ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps (30nt and 80nt) was impaired in RPA-depleted HSS (Bead-bound panel and quantification panel, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). We noted that anti-RPA antibodies co-depleted some endogenous ATRIP protein from HSS, but had almost no co-depletion of endogenous APE1 protein in HSS (Lanes 1-3 vs Lanes 4-6 in Extract panel, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). This co-depletion of endogenous ATRIP protein is similar to a previous observation by the Dunphy group (Kim et al., 2005), and may suggest a tight complex formation between endogenous ATRIP and RPA protein complex in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. Our quantifications of ssDNA-bound ATRIP normalized to available ATRIP protein in HSS showed that RPA depletion almost had no effect on ATRIPâs binding to the 30nt-ssDNA gap, and only mildly decreased the binding of ATRIP (~20%) to 80nt-ssDNA gap (quantification panel, <italic>Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</italic>). These observations suggest that the recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps is RPA-dependent and RPA-independent in the HSS system.â</p><p>Our finding in Figure 1B have shown that APE1 is required for almost all ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA gaps in HSS system. This observation is further supported our quantification of ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA gaps normalized to total ATRIP in extract from three independent repeated experiments (Lane 2 vs Lane 5, Lane 3 vs Lane 6, quantification panel, <italic>Figure 1B</italic>). The combined data from Figure 1B and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A suggest two modes of ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA gaps in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS: (#1) APE1-dependent and RPA-dependent; and (#2) APE1-dependent but RPA-independent, which is illustrated in revised <italic>Figure 5B</italic>. In mode #1: RPA interacts with ATRIP protein and recruits ATRIP onto RPA-ssDNA in HSS; however, this mode #1 may be inhibited by a currently uncharacterized Protein X in HSS, and such inhibitory effect by Protein X can be reversed by APE1. In Mode #2, APE1 can interact with ATRIP that is not in complex with RPA protein complex, and recruits ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps independent of RPA in HSS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To evaluate the role of APE1 in the ATR signaling in vivo, the authors need to analyze Chk1 phosphorylation or other ATR activation marker(s) in APE1-siRNA depletion experiments in a cell line (or a deletion mutant of yeast if the mechanism is conserved) with exposures to chemicals which induce gapped ssDNAs such as H2O2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the suggestion. In our recently published paper (<italic>Nucleic Acids Res</italic>, 2022, 50: 10503-10525, PMID: 36200829), we have demonstrated evidence showing that siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous APE1 significantly reduced Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser345 in human breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 and human pancreatic cancer cell PANC1 cells. Another prior study also shows the role of APE1 in ATR DDR activation in response to UV damage in nucleotide excision repair-deficient cells (J Cell Sci, 2011, 124: 435-446, PMID: 21224401). In this revised manuscript for <italic>eLife</italic>, we provide additional evidence using human osteosarcoma cells U2OS cells and show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of human APE1 impaired the H2O2-induced human Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser345 and Ser317. We added a new paragraph describing this new data in our revised manuscript (Page 7-8, Line 185-196):</p><p>âBecause ssDNA gaps have been widely accepted as a central platform for protein recruitment and activation of the ATR/Chk1 DDR pathway (Cimprich and Cortez, 2008; Marechal and Zou, 2015), we are prompted to evaluate the role of APE1 in the ATR/Chk1 DDR pathway in cultured cells. Hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative DNA damage triggered Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser345 and Ser317 in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, suggesting the activation of ATR DDR (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B). Notably, siRNA-mediated APE1 knockdown of human APE1 in U2OS cells compromised the hydrogen peroxide-induced Chk1 phosphorylation, suggesting that APE1 is important for the ATR/Chk1 DDR in cultured human cells (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B). Our observation here is consistent with two prior studies showing that APE1 is important for the ATR DDR pathway activation in response to oxidative DNA damage in human cancer cells MDA-MB-231 and PANC1 cells, and UV-damage in non-dividing nucleotide excision repair-deficient (i.e., XPC<sup>-/-</sup>) cells (Li et al., 2022; Vrouwe et al., 2011).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Figures 1A, B and Figure 4D clearly showed that APE1-depletion from the extract does not induce ATRIP-binding to ssDNA substrates and, as a result, impairs Chk1-phosphorylation even in the presence of RPA on the ssDNAs. This strongly suggests that RPA-binding to ssDNAs is NOT sufficient for ATRIP-recruitment (and ATR activation) on the ssDNAs at least in the Xenopus HSS system, implying, a new role of RPA in ATR-activation other than the simple recruitment of ATRIP; the cooperation with APE1. A simple idea is that RPA directly recruits APE1, and then APE1 recruits ATRIP &quot;without&quot; direct interaction with ssDNA, rather a model proposed in Figure 5B with a negative regulator &quot;X&quot;, which partly comes from complicated regulation of APE1 binding to the DNAs with a negative regulation by 35-100 aa region of the protein. To approve or deney the possibility and further elucidate the role of DNA binding of APE1 in the checkpoint activation, it is critical to test the role of APE1 DNA binding in ATR/CHK1 signaling by examining AA35-316 for Chk1 activation in APE-depleted <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts as shown in Figure 3D.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reasoning and suggestion from this Reviewer. Following the suggestion, we performed the rescue experiment in APE1-depleted HSS, and the below description of the result (Page 10-11, Line 281-291):</p><p>âIn addition, we performed rescue experiment by adding back AA35-316 GST-APE1 in APE1-depleted HSS system, compared with WT GST-APE1. Our result showed that AA35-316 GST-APE1 was deficient for the interaction with ssDNA gaps and ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA gaps, and subsequent defective Chk1 phosphorylation in APE1-depleted HSS system, although WT and AA35-316 GST-APE1 were added to APE1-deplted HSS at the similar levels (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1). Furthermore, ssDNA-coated endogenous RPA protein complex could not recruit AA35-316 GST-APE1 and endogenous ATRIP onto ssDNA in APE1-depleted HSS, although AA35-316 GST-APE1 is proficient for the interaction with ATRIP and RPA protein in vitro (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1). All these observations indicate that APE1âs ssDNA binding capacity and ATRIP interaction are important for both RPA-dependent and RPA-independent ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA and the ATR/Chk1 in the HSS system.â</p><p>These new data seem do not support the sequential RPA-APE1-ATRIP recruitment model suggested by the reviewer. Our in vitro reconstitution systems in the absence of RPA protein complex have shown that recombinant His-ATRIP protein was not recruited onto ssDNA gaps by the ssDNA-binding-deficient but ATRIP-binding proficient AA35-316 GST-APE1, or the ssDNA-binding-proficient ATRIP-binding-deficient AA101-316 GST-APE1 (Figure 3C). Furthermore, AA101-316 GST-APE1 was able to associate with ssDNA gaps but could not recruit endogenous ATRIP onto ssDNA in the presence of ssDNA-coated RPA (Figure 3D). All these data are in line with the model proposed in Figure 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is important to check the binding of ATRIP to ssDNA in the presence of both APE1 and RPA by checking the effect of differential ratios of APE1 and RPA on in vitro binding of ATRIP to the ssDNA as shown in Figures 1C and 3C. The authors can address whether the abilities of the two proteins to recruit ATRIP to the ssDNA is competitive or cooperative or independent.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the suggestion. However, the suggested experiment would provide an insight into whether the RPA-dependent ATRIP recruitment and APE1-dependent ATRIP recruitment are competitive or cooperative, only when both RPA and APE1 donât interact with each other. We have shown that APE1 interacts with RPA in vitro (Figure 4), and that RPA protein complex and APE1 protein can recruit ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps independently (Figure 1C and 3C). To test any potential relationship between the two types of ATRIP recruitment, we performed extra experiment to directly compare the ATRIP recruitment onto 80nt-ssDNA gaps in vitro when individual protein is present or when both proteins are present and added the description (Page 13, Line 364-377):</p><p>âWe have shown that both RPA complex and APE1 protein can recruit recombinant ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps independently in vitro (Figures 1C and 3C), and that APE1 and RPA complex interact with each (Figure 4). It is interesting to test whether the RPA-dependent ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA and APE1-dependent ATRIP recruitment to ssDNA is competitive or cooperative. Using in vitro pulldown assays with beads coupled with 80nt-ssDNA gap, we found that the presence of both His-RPA protein complex and GST-APE1 protein increased the recruitment of His-ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps, compared with each protein individually (Lane 4 vs Lane 2/3, Figure 4âfigure supplement 3E-3F). Interestingly, it seems there is no significance for the recruitment of His-ATRIP onto ssDNA when both proteins are present compared with the sum of when individual protein is present (Lane 4 vs (Lane 2 + Lane 3), Figure 4âfigure supplement 3E-3F). Our observation suggests that the RPA-mediated and APE1-mediated ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA is neither cooperative with each other nor competitive/exclusive to each other at least in in vitro reconstitution system under our experimental conditions.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. RBM1 in APE1 shows sequence similarity to an N-terminal region of ATRIP for RAP70N (OB-F of RPA70) binding. If so, the RBM1 of APE1 and the ATRIP region should show competitive bindings to RPA70N. This should be examined by competitive pull-down assay using purified APE1, ATRIP-N-terminal region, and RPA70N.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the suggestion. We have shown in Figure 4 that RBM1 within APE1 is important for interaction with RPA complex and likely through RPA70. However, it has not been determined whether APE1 RBM1 is sufficient for the interaction with RPA70N. Second, AA1-100 His-APE1 containing the RBM1 motif is sufficient for the interaction with His-ATRIP in vitro (Figure 3A), suggesting that the NT100 domain of APE1 directly interacts with ATRIP. In addition, it remains controversial whether and how the N-terminal domain or other internal domains within ATRIP mediate its interaction with the RPA protein complex and/or RPA on ssDNA (Ball et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2005; Namiki and Zou, 2006). How APE1 NT100 motif engages ATRIP and RPA70 interactions and the recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA warrants further investigation. We re-wrote a paragraph relevant to the APE1 interaction with ATRIP and RPA in the Discussion section (Page 16, Line 454-469).</p><p>âIt is an outstanding question in the field of ATR DDR regarding how exactly ATRIP protein is recruited onto ssDNA gaps in an RPA-dependent and/or -independent manner. We have elucidated in this study that the NT100 motif of APE1 is required and sufficient for ATRIP interaction in in vitro protein-protein interaction assays (Figure 3A), and that the APE1-ATRIP interaction is essential for the recruitment of recombinant ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps in in vitro reconstitution system and endogenous ATRIP protein to ssDNA gaps in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (Figure 3C-3D). Our observations support the critical role of the APE1-ATRIP interaction in the APE1-dependent ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA gaps. For the Mode #2 APE1- and RPA-dependent recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps, we hypothesize that an unknown Protein X may negatively regulate ATRIP binding to RPA complex especially RPA70 N-terminal domain, which has been involved in the recruitment of several DDR proteins to ssDNA such as ETAA1, Mre11, Nbs1, Rad9, p53, and PRIMPOL (Bhat and Cortez, 2018). APE1 protein may reverse or counteract with such inhibitory effect of Protein X in the recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA. Alternatively, APE1 NT100 motif interacts with ATRIP and RPA70, which may be required for the conformation change and/or stabilization of ATRIP-RPA-ssDNA in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (Figure 5B). Future studies will test these different scenarios.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In addition, our data in Figure 4âfigure supplement 3A-3D suggest that recombinant RPA protein complex increased the binding of APE1 protein onto ssDNA (40, 60, and 80nt), and that the RPA-APE1 interaction is important for the stimulated APE1 binding to ssDNA.</p><p>Our data in this study show that APE1 protein can associate with 30nt- and 80nt- ssDNA regions within defined gapped DNA structures and defined ssDNA structure (40, 60, and 80nt) (Figure 2). Consistent with our observations, other studies have shown that 22nt-ssDNA is sufficient for a stable hAPE1-ssDNA complex formation in in vitro EMSA assays and that hAPE1 associates with ssDNA regions at stalled DNA replication forks in vitro (Bazlekowa-Karaban et al., 2019; Hoitsma et al., 2022). Furthermore, mouse APE1 was shown to interact with 20nt-ssDNA and -dsDNA for exonucleolytic cleavage in vitro (Liu et al., 2021). Although we canât exclude the possibility that APE1 may associate with other distinct DNA and/or RNA structures, our findings in this manuscript suggest that APE1 recognizes ssDNA and recruits ATRIP (and potentially the tight ATR/ATRIP complex) onto ssDNA for the activation of ATR DDR pathway.</p><p>The ATR DDR pathway activation by the annealing synthetic oligonucleotides dA<sub>70</sub>/dT<sub>70</sub> in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts was first characterized by the Dunphy group in 2000 (Kumagai and Dunphy, 2000). However, later studies have shown that the model dA<sub>70</sub>/dT<sub>70</sub> system also triggers ATM DDR activation, which requires TopBP1 and the MRN complex (Yoo et al., 2007; Yoo et al., 2009). Furthermore, the exact structures of the model dA<sub>70</sub>/dT<sub>70</sub> system (e.g., 70bp dsDNA with blunt end, 5â-junction ssDNA/dsDNA, 3â-junction ssDNA/dsDNA, or mixtures of these different forms) remains to be determined after 23-year studies. To visualize the mobility shift of phosphorylated version of Chk1, phosphatase inhibitor tautomycin is typically added to the <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (Kim et al., 2005; Kumagai and Dunphy, 2000), which makes the observations using the model dA<sub>70</sub>/dT<sub>70</sub> system more difficult to be interpreted regarding the direct and/indirect effect. Our study aims to use the more defined 30nt- and 80nt-ssDNA gap structures and determine the role and mechanism of APE1 in the ATR DDR pathway activation. Whether and how APE1 contributes to the ATR and/or ATM DDR pathway using model dA<sub>70</sub>/dT<sub>70</sub> system in <italic>Xenopus</italic> system is determined to be out of the scope of current study; however, it may be interesting to test this in the future studies.</p><p>Our current study focuses on how APE1 interacts and ssDNA and recruits ATRIP onto ssDNA via a non-catalytic function. âDoes APE1 activate the ATR pathway by DNA circles containing AP sites?â In our opinion, it is very likely. One of our recently published studies using <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system has determined that APE1 and its 3â-5â exonuclease activity is important for the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway activation in response to the defined plasmid-based SSB structures (Lin et al., 2020). Future studies using plasmid DNA containing site-specific AP site may be utilized to test whether APE1 and its AP endonuclease activity is critical for the defined AP site-derived ATR/Chk1 DDR pathway activation. In the first and second paragraph of the Discussion section (Page 14), we did add more description regarding the current understanding of APE1 and its nuclease activity in the DDR pathway activation: âIn addition to its critical roles in DNA repair and redox regulation (Li and Wilson, 2014; Tell et al., 2009), accumulating evidence suggests important roles of APE1 in the activation of the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway (Li et al., 2022; Lin et al., 2020; Vrouwe et al., 2011). We and others have demonstrated that APE1 and its nuclease activity are important for the ATR-Chk1 DDR activation in response to oxidative DNA damage and ultraviolet-damage in mammalian cells (Li et al., 2022; Vrouwe et al., 2011). Furthermore, APE1 plays an essential role in the initiation step of 3'-5' end resection in SSB-induced ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway via its 3'-5' exonuclease acitivity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract system (Lin et al., 2020). Mechanistic studies further elucidate that APE1 directly recognizes and binds to SSB site and generate a small ssDNA gap structure via its catalytic function for the subsequent APE2 recruitment and activation for the continuation of SSB end resection (Lin et al., 2020). Notably, APE1 forms biomolecular condensates in vitro and in nucleoli independent of its nuclease activity to promote the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway activation in cancer cells, and APE1 is proposed as a new direct activator of the ATR kinase, in addition to TopBP1 and ETAA1 (Li and Yan, 2023; Li et al., 2022)â¦..In current study, we have identified and characterzied another distinct regulatory mechanism of APE1 in the ATR-Chk1 DDR pathway independent of its nuclease activity.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The title is misleading. As depicted in the model in Figure 5B, the main role of APE1 in promoting ATR activation in HSS extracts seems to be to counteract a putative inhibitor of ATRIP recruitment. However, there is no data in the paper showing that this role is linked to the RPA-independent mechanism of ATRIP recruitment. It is suggested to remove &quot;RPA-independent manner&quot; from the title.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown in our initial submission that with the absence of each other, recombinant RPA protein complex and APE1 protein can recruit ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps independently in in vitro reconstitution system (Figure 1C and 3C). We have also shown that APE1 depletion led to compromised ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA gaps (Figure 1B) and that RPA-depletion led to decreased ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA gaps in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). All these observations suggest that APE1 mediates ATRIP onto ssDNA in an RPA-dependent and RPA-independent manner. Therefore, we revised our model in new Figure 5 showing the RPA-dependent and APE1-dependent recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps in in vitro reconstitution system (Figure 5A) and the APE1-dependent recruitment of endogenous ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps in RPA-dependent and -independent manner in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (Figure 5B). To better reflect the major findings in this study, we also revised the title of our manuscript to âAPE1 recruits ATRIP to ssDNA in an RPA-dependent and -independent manner to promote the ATR DNA damage responseâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. An important experiment missing is to test the effect of RPA on APE1-dependent ATRIP recruitment. In the in vitro experimental setting, the authors should compare absence versus presence of RPA to address if the addition of RPA strongly enhances ATRIP recruitment when APE1 is present.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown that in the absence of each other, recombinant RPA protein complex and APE1 protein can recruit ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps independently in in vitro reconstitution system (Figure 1C and 3C). We did perform additional in vitro experiment in which purified recombinant GST-APE1 protein, His-RPA complex, or both proteins were present and found that APE1-mediated ATRIP recruitment and RPA-mediated ATRIP recruitment are neither competitive nor cooperative, but rather are independent from each other (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 3E-3F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors never discuss the importance of APE1 for ATR activation in different contexts and different lesion types. Is the role of APE1 in promoting ATRIP recruitment broadly required for ATR activation? If so, one would predict that cells lacking APE1 should exhibit deficient ATR signaling in response to several types of genotoxins (and is that the case?). If not, then how do the authors explain the central importance of APE1 in ATRIP recruitment in their system given that ssDNA is a general trigger of ATR signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional experiment in the revised manuscript showing that siRNA-mediated knockdown of human APE1 compromised the hydrogen peroxide-induced ATR/Chk1 DDR pathway activation in human cultured cancer cell U2OS cells (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B). Consistent with the significant mechanism of APE1 in ATRIP recruitment onto ssDNA in ATR DDR, previous studies have shown the APE1 is important for the ATR DDR activation in response to oxidative stress, alkylation damage, and UV-damage in culture mammalian cells (Li et al., 2022; Vrouwe et al., 2011). More detailed description can be found in our response to #2 Essential Revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figures 1A and 1B, APE1 depletion completely blocked ATRIP recruitment to Gap plasmids and dsDNA containing 30nt and 80nt ssDNA gaps. These results indicated that APE1 is essential for the recruitment of ATRIP onto RPA-coated ssDNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS and RPA cannot bind ATRIP without the presence of APE1. However, this explanation conflicts with the proposed model in Figure 5A, in which RPA is able to recruit ATRIP without APE1. As such, the working model in Figure 5A is not supported by the HSS experiments performed in Figure 1. The authors need to clarify this point of confusion, which is probably attributed to the model in Figure 5A being based only on in vitro data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the question. To make better clarification and avoid potential misunderstanding, we revised our Figure 5 and illustrated the RPA-dependent and APE1-dependent recruitment of ATRIP onto ssDNA gaps âIn in vitro reconstitution systemâ (Figure 5A), and the two modes of APE1-dependent recruitment of ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gaps âin <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extractsâ (Figure 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 1D the authors claim that APE1 increases the recruitment of ATRIP, however, such an increase in recruitment is not obvious from the presented blot, and careful quantitation (with replicates and statistics) should be presented to support the claim.</p></disp-quote><p>The intensity of ATRIP onto ssDNA gap structures were quantified and statistical analysis shows the presence of GST-APE1 protein increased the recruitment of His-ATRIP protein onto ssDNA gap structures, compared with GST (Lane 5 vs Lane 2, Lane 6 vs Lane 3, Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figures 2B and 2C, the authors show that APE1-ssDNA association occurs in a length-dependent manner in vitro, where no ssDNA shorter than 30nt is shown to interact with APE1. However, this is in conflict with Figure 1A, in which Gap plasmid resected to reveal 18-26nt of ssDNA (refer to line 129) is still able to robustly interact with APE1. The authors should address this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data in this study show that APE1 protein can associate with 30nt- and 80nt- ssDNA regions within defined gapped DNA structures and defined ssDNA structure (40, 60, and 80nt) (Figure 2). Consistent with our observations, other studies have shown that 22nt-ssDNA and 28nt-ssDNA are sufficient for a stable hAPE1-ssDNA complex formation in in vitro EMSA assays and that hAPE1 associates with ssDNA regions at stalled DNA replication forks in vitro (Bazlekowa-Karaban et al., 2019; Hoitsma et al., 2022). These observations are in line with our estimated ssDNA gap size (~18-26nt) through the distinct 3â-5â SSB end rection for ATR DDR activation in response to defined SSB structures in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system (Lin et al., 2018; Lin et al., 2020). It is worth noting that the estimated ssDNA gaps (~18-26nt) at defined SSB site did not include the possible 5â-3â SSB end rection in <italic>Xenopus</italic> HSS system. More description of ssDNA gap size has been included in the second paragraph in the Discussion section (Page 15, Line 433-446).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The concentrations of APE1 proteins used for EMSA assay should be disclosed to show the binding affinity of APE1 and ssDNA. Meanwhile, whether this affinity is physiologically relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion, and we have added the concentrations of APE1 protein (1, 5, and 20 Î¼M) used for the EMSA assays in Figure 2E.</p><p>âWhereas the concentration of <italic>Xenopus</italic> APE1 protein in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg was estimated to be ~1.5 Î¼M (Wuhr et al., 2014), the concentration of hAPE1 protein in HEK293T cells was estimated to ~2.8 Î¼M (https://opencell.czbiohub.org/gene/ENSG00000100823) (Wisniewski et al., 2014). Considering most APE1 protein is localized inside of the nucleus of mammalian cells (Li and Wilson, 2014), the observed APE1 affinity and interaction with ssDNA in our in vitro EMSA assays (Figure 2E) are physiologically relevant.â.</p><p>This part has been added to the Discussion section (Page 15, Line 426-431).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure 4A, the pulldown of GST-APE1 AA1-34 still pulls down RPA70 even though both RPA-binding motifs are entirely absent. This conflicts with the result seen in the double RBM mutant, where no RPA is pulled down at all in Figure 4C. The authors should address this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We run another two independent experiments (Repeat 1 and Repeat 2). From the three independent experiments (see the blots of RPA70 bands <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), we chose Repeat 1 as representative results in our revised figures (New Figure 4A). Our quantification of RPA70 bands from pulldown samples normalized to RPA70 bands from input indicated that AA1-34 APE1 displayed significantly decreased capacity to interact with His-RPA protein, compared with WT APE1 (New Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A). We recognize that there are possible differences between point mutations and protein fragments. We canât completely exclude the possibility that the AA1-34 fragment of APE1 may have another alternative binding site for RPA complex.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>IB against anti-RPA in pulldown samples.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82324-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
