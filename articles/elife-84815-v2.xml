outcomes in drug-susceptible TB is less well understood. Here, we generate a population-based dataset of drug-susceptible <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) isolates from China to identify factors associated with poor treatment outcomes. We analyzed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data of MTB strains from 3196 patients, including 3105 patients with good and 91 patients with poor treatment outcomes, and linked genomes to patient epidemiological data. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify bacterial genomic variants associated with poor outcomes. Risk factors identified by logistic regression analysis were used in clinical models to predict treatment outcomes. GWAS identified fourteen MTB fixed mutations associated with poor treatment outcomes, but only 24.2% (22/91) of strains from patients with poor outcomes carried at least one of these mutations. Isolates from patients with poor outcomes showed a higher ratio of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated mutations compared to isolates from patients with good outcomes (26.3% vs 22.9%, t-test, p=0.027). Patient age, sex, and duration of diagnostic delay were also independently associated with poor outcomes. Bacterial factors alone had poor power to predict poor outcomes with an AUC of 0.58. The AUC with host factors alone was 0.70, but increased significantly to 0.74 (DeLong’s test, p=0.01) when bacterial factors were also included. In conclusion, although we identified MTB genomic mutations that are significantly associated with poor treatment outcomes in drug-susceptible TB cases, their effects appear to be limited.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>drug-susceptible tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>treatment outcomes</kwd><kwd><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic></kwd><kwd>bacterial factors</kwd><kwd>whole-genome sequencing</kwd><kwd>genome-wide association study</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82272376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Major Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZD2021CY001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>There are fourteen genomic variants of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> that are significantly associated with poor treatment outcomes in drug-susceptible TB patients, but their predictive value is limited.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis (TB), caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB), is responsible for more deaths globally than any other single infectious agent, causing nearly 1.5 million deaths and an estimated 10 million new cases each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>). Successful treatment of TB not only cures the patient but also prevents disease transmission and the development of difficult-to-treat drug-resistant strains. Treatment outcomes are therefore important metrics for assessing the effectiveness of national TB control programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dheda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Migliori et al., 2019</xref>). While approximately 86% of patients with drug-susceptible TB are cured with the standard four-drug treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>), there remains a substantial subset of patients who fail treatment. To formulate strategies that will reduce treatment failures, it would be helpful to first define the risk factors associated with poor outcomes.</p><p>There are host factors that are well known to be associated with treatment failure, including poor patient adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alipanah et al., 2018</xref>), sex, age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Imperial et al., 2018</xref>), diagnostic delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lestari et al., 2020</xref>), co-infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and TB treatment history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastos et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chenciner et al., 2021</xref>), but we wondered whether the genetic composition of the infecting strain might also contribute to poor outcomes. While drug resistance is the major bacterial risk factor for TB treatment failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lange et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mirzayev et al., 2021</xref>), a growing number of genomic studies suggest that other bacterial determinants may also be risk factors. For example, specific mutations in metabolism-related genes of MTB could lead to drug tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hicks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Torrey et al., 2016</xref>), thereby increasing the risk of developing resistance and relapsing after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2020a</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2022</xref>) recently showed that genetic mutations in the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator <italic>resR</italic> can cause antibiotic resilience and are associated with the acquisition of drug resistance and treatment failure. Although these genetic polymorphisms in the MTB genome do not directly lead to drug resistance, they are significantly more common in drug-resistant bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hicks et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Because drug resistance is such a dominant risk factor for treatment failure, a search for other bacterial genomic determinants associated with treatment failure is best performed in drug-susceptible MTB isolates.</p><p>To study the role of bacterial genomic determinants, other than drug resistance mutations, that might be associated with poor treatment outcomes, we analyzed drug-susceptible TB isolates from new TB cases collected in population-based cohort studies at three different sites in China. The bacterial determinants we identified and the patient characteristics were then used to build a clinical prediction model to estimate the contribution of bacterial factors to poor TB treatment outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characteristics of the study population and MTB isolates</title><p>The pooled study population from the three different sites in China consisted of 3496 new cases of drug-susceptible TB.

To explore the bacterial factors associated with poor TB treatment outcomes, we first excluded patients with outcomes unlikely to be associated with bacterial factors, including patients lost to follow-up, non-TB deaths, and unknown outcomes. Ultimately, a total of 3196 new cases with drug-susceptible TB were included in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): 3105 with good outcomes and 91 with poor outcomes (failure, 25; TB death, 15; transferred for MDR, 4; and relapse, 47).

Based on this analysis, it appears that genomic variants of the infecting MTB strain may be markers for poor tuberculosis treatment outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive evaluation of the contribution of bacterial genetic factors to poor treatment outcomes in drug-susceptible TB patients. Although our analysis showed that, as expected, patient characteristics of age, sex, and duration of diagnostic delay were associated with poor TB treatment outcomes, it also found fourteen bacterial genomic variants that were associated with an increased risk of poor treatment outcomes. The best clinical prediction model, with an AUC of 0.74, incorporates both host and bacterial risk factors. In a setting where the genomes of all MTB isolates are sequenced, these risk factors may provide a rationale for developing personalized approaches to tuberculosis treatment.</p><p>GWAS has yielded remarkable advances in the understanding of complex traits and has identified hundreds of genetic risk variants in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uffelmann et al., 2021</xref>), including genetic polymorphisms associated with increased susceptibility to TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Quistrebert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). With the increasing availability of bacterial WGS data, it is now possible to use GWAS to probe the relationship between pathogen genotypes and clinical disease phenotypes. GWAS has identified genetic determinants of MTB drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farhat et al., 2013</xref>), TB transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sobkowiak et al., 2020</xref>), virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Genestet et al., 2022</xref>) and host preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, GWAS was used to identify bacterial genetic variants associated with poor treatment outcomes in patients with drug-susceptible TB and assess their impact on outcomes.</p><p>While this study found mutations in the MTB genome that were associated with poor treatment outcomes, models that consider only bacterial factors were poor predictors of outcome, with an AUC of only 0.58. Furthermore, only 24.2% (22/91) of patients with poor outcomes carried at least one of the GWAS-identified fixed mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), and therefore these mutations played no role in the majority of poor outcomes. The 237 GWAS-identified unfixed mutations are diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and have a mutation frequency that is generally only 5%–10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The low frequency of these diverse unfixed mutations suggests they may confer a relatively small selective advantage without any preferential mutation types or increasing mutation frequency. In addition, none of the GWAS-identified unfixed mutations were among the 14 GWAS-identified fixed mutations, suggesting the unfixed mutations merely reflect individual genetic features of the particular MTB isolate with no evidence of homoplastic fixation in the bacterial population.</p><p>There is evidence, although limited, that genes carrying the fourteen fixed GWAS-identified mutations play a role in the response to first-line drug and hypoxic stress. The <italic>otsB1</italic> gene harbors the mutation with the strongest association and encodes trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase, which has been associated with rifampicin tolerance under hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jakkala and Ajitkumar, 2019</xref>). The E2 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase, encoded by <italic>dlaT</italic>, is required for optimal MTB growth and resistance to reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) and immune killing by host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi and Ehrt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tian et al., 2005</xref>). Most of the genes carrying the fourteen GWAS-identified fixed mutations were rarely reported in previous large-scale GWAS of drug-resistant MTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coll et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farhat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Naz et al., 2023</xref>), and none of the fourteen mutations were reported in these studies. However, two of the genes in which the mutations were found had been previously identified as potentially associated with first-line drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farhat et al., 2013</xref>): CtpB, a probable cation-transporter P-type ATPase B; and MetA, a probable homoserine O-acetyltransferase. Our inference that the fourteen fixed mutations had only limited effects on treatment outcome would explain why: they were not identified in previous studies; isolates from only 24.2% (22/91) of patients carried any of these 14 mutations; and none of the mutations were shared amongst all 22 patients.</p><p>The mutations may be epistatic adaptations suited to the genomic characteristics of each individual strain. The GWAS-identified mutations were also present in some patients with good outcomes but were less frequent than in patients with poor outcomes. Although patient information was unavailable concerning other known host risk factors such as adherence to the treatment regimen and comorbidities such as HIV co-infection, diabetes, smoking, and low BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kamara et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vernon et al., 2019</xref>), our clinical prediction model still revealed that host factors are significantly more important determinants of poor outcomes than bacterial factors. Nevertheless, we believe that our study has shown that bacterial genomic factors can also contribute to poor outcomes.</p><p>Sample size and the classification of treatment outcomes are important challenges when exploring the association of bacterial factors with poor outcomes. Because standard first-line regimens cure at least 85% of drug-susceptible TB patients, this study had to pool data from three sites with a total of 3496 new cases to obtain 91 patients with poor outcomes. We excluded 300 patients who either died from non-TB causes, were lost to follow-up, or had unknown outcomes. We attempted to validate our findings with a dataset of 1397 new drug-susceptible TB cases from Malawi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guerra-Assunção et al., 2015</xref>), but were unable to replicate the GWAS analysis because the only poor treatment outcome in the Malawi dataset was death, and it was impossible to distinguish the patients who succumbed to TB from those who died from non-TB causes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we found that there are bacterial genomic variants that are significantly associated with poor treatment outcomes in drug-susceptible TB patients. Although host factors are clearly more important, the most accurate models for predicting poor treatment outcomes with drug-susceptible TB incorporate both host and bacterial risk factors. In the future, it may be possible to identify patients at high risk for treatment failure by analyzing the characteristics of both the host and the bacterial genome of the infecting strain. This could make it possible to identify patients requiring longer or individualized treatment regimens and thus improve cure rates for drug-susceptible TB.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Selection of patients and samples</title><p>A strain database search was performed for TB patients treated during 2009–2020 at three study sites in Shanghai, Sichuan, and Heilongjiang, China. For each of the 4374 TB patients registered during this period, a pretreatment sputum sample was decontaminated and inoculated onto Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium (Heilongjiang) or in liquid medium (Shanghai and Sichuan) and observed for 6–8 weeks. Culture-positive isolates were re-cultured on LJ medium for 3–4 weeks. Colonies were scraped from the surface of the LJ slopes and the DNA was isolated for WGS.

Of these, patients who died were divided into deaths from TB and non-TB, and those not evaluated included cases transferred for treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and cases whose treatment outcome was unknown. For the current study, TB treatment outcomes were grouped into three categories: (1) good outcomes -- cured and treatment completed; (2) poor outcomes -- treatment failures, deaths from TB, transferred for MDR and relapse; and (3) other -- lost to follow-up, non-TB deaths and unknown outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>SNPs calling, resistance prediction, and phylogenetic reconstruction</title><p>A previously described pipeline was used for calling single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Annelies Van Rie (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. The manuscript provides little to no detail about how the samples were obtained, other than the fact that they are &quot;pre-treatment&quot; samples. The authors must clarify if they are all sputum samples (as assumed) and if some/all represent induced sputa. Similarly, much greater detail is required about sample propagation, in particular, the possibility that samples underwent (multiple rounds of) in vitro culture to achieve sufficient biomass for whole-genome sequencing. If so, what growth media were used, how long were samples cultured, and how many generations does this equate to? Also, it is very important to know if all samples were treated identically.</p><p>2. Continuing from the above, it wasn't clear what was meant by some of the terminology used in the manuscript. Does the term &quot;isolates&quot; indicate that samples were plated to separate single colonies? Or are the &quot;isolates&quot; referred to throughout the manuscript actually populations of potentially different Mtb clones obtained – and propagated – as mixed samples? This information is critical given the potential that the identified polymorphisms – both fixed and, perhaps even more so, unfixed – might have arisen as a consequence of in vitro (laboratory) handling under standard aerobic conditions.</p><p>3. Causation is always difficult to establish unequivocally in this type of study. Ideally, the Mtb genotypes contained within samples obtained pre-treatment should be compared with samples obtained following treatment when the &quot;poor&quot; outcome was manifest – the expectation being that the polymorphisms identified should be evident (even dominant) at the later stage. In the absence of these data – which are difficult to obtain (even impossible, for example, where the &quot;poor&quot; outcome was death) – it would strengthen the perceived relevance of the identified mutations if the authors were able to provide any other evidence – perhaps from studies of drug-resistant Mtb isolates? – supporting their inferred role in undermining frontline treatment.</p><p>4. Related to the above, the authors make a valid point that their intention here was different from other studies which have deliberately utilized drug-resistant Mtb isolates to identify resistance-conferring and resistance-enabling mutations. Nevertheless, it would be very interesting to know if any of the mutations identified in those other studies were also picked up here – and, if not, why that might be the case.</p><p>5. The analyses presented in this study are heavily dependent on statistical methods; however, there is very little detail provided about the methodology applied. This omission detracts from the inferred outcomes-associated Mtb polymorphisms, especially given that the predominance of lineage 2 (and sub-lineage 2.3) risks a lineage-specific association, rather than a more generalizable pathogenicity phenotype.</p><p>6. It is also not clear that the statistical analyses have considered the fact that the &quot;good&quot; outcomes exceed the &quot;poor&quot; outcomes by a factor of ~34x. Similarly, the heavy skew in the &quot;good&quot; (3105) versus &quot;poor&quot; (91) samples (approximately 34x difference in sample size) raises the possibility that mutations identified in the &quot;poor&quot; category might be artificially over-represented. More clarity in detailing the statistical methods is required to allay any concerns about the identification of candidate polymorphisms.</p><p>7. Related to the above: The reference in the abstract to &quot;3496 MTB strains&quot; is deceptive: 300 &quot;other&quot; were excluded, and the remaining samples are split 3105:91. This means only 91 samples derive from &quot;poor&quot; outcomes, which is the focus of the work.</p><p>8. The authors note the importance of &quot;host&quot; factors, including age, sex, duration of diagnostic delay, etc. How were these factors separated (excluded) from the mycobacterium-associated factors in comparing genotypes from &quot;good&quot; versus &quot;poor&quot; outcomes?</p><p>9. It is not clear why SEM was performed. SEM is used to assess causal relationships between variables. This study is focused on the predictive power of the genomic mutations, on their own and adjusted for patient-related factors. SEM seems inappropriate here and can be removed.</p><p>10. In drug-susceptible TB, adherence to treatment is probably the most important determinant for failure and relapse. Were data on adherence included as a variable in the logistic regression model?</p><p>11. The following results are essential and should be included in the abstract: (i) Bacterial factors on their own had poor predictive power AUC of 0.58. The AUC for predicting poor treatment outcomes increased significantly (P = 0.01) from 0.70 to 0.74 when including both. (ii) Only 24.2% (22/91) of patients with poor outcomes carried at least one GWAS-identified fixed mutation.</p><p>12. In the conclusion, it is stated: &quot;While we found a statistically significant effect of the MTB genomic determinants on treatment outcomes of drug-sensitive cases, the effect appears to be limited&quot; This would be the most appropriate conclusion for the abstract.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Half of the poor treatment outcomes were relapses.</p><p>Q1: did you check if there were differences in the14 Mtb variants between the relapse cases and other reasons for poor treatment outcomes?</p><p>Q2: For the patients who relapsed, was the isolate at the time of relapse also sequenced?

As stated above, the “isolates” for WGS referred to the populations of colonies re-cultured from frozen stocks. We agree with the reviewers that new, false positive mutations could be generated during in vitro expansion of bacterial colonies or by PCR and sequencing errors. To filter out false positives, we used a previously validated pipeline developed in our lab. To confirm the reliability of our method, we selected three single colonies from different frozen stocks, grew them in L-J medium and subjected them to WGS using the same strategy employed in this study.</p><p>For single colonies, the unfixed mutations detected in the raw WGS data were considered to be false positive mutations arising during in vitro culture or the result of sequencing errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Most false positives (~99.6%) can be excluded by eliminating mutations with allele frequency &lt; 5% or supported by fewer than five reads. The remaining false positives, such as mutations with more than 50% of supporting alleles enriched in the terminal region of sequencing reads, can be removed with our previously described pipeline trimming <sup>[3]</sup>. To make it clearer we have added this additional information to the methods section (lines 283-285): “A previously validated pipeline was used to filter out false positives that may have arisen during the in vitro expansion of bacterial colonies or caused by PCR and sequencing errors (Liu et al., 2022)”.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Schematics of false positive filter in three single colonies.</title><p>The density plot above the scatter plot shows the distribution of mutation depth while the plot to the right of the scatter plot shows the distribution of mutation frequency.

Causation is always difficult to establish unequivocally in this type of study. Ideally, the Mtb genotypes contained within samples obtained pre-treatment should be compared with samples obtained following treatment when the &quot;poor&quot; outcome was manifest – the expectation being that the polymorphisms identified should be evident (even dominant) at the later stage. In the absence of these data – which are difficult to obtain (even impossible, for example, where the &quot;poor&quot; outcome was death) – it would strengthen the perceived relevance of the identified mutations if the authors were able to provide any other evidence – perhaps from studies of drug-resistant Mtb isolates? – supporting their inferred role in undermining frontline treatment.</p><p>4. Related to the above, the authors make a valid point that their intention here was different from other studies which have deliberately utilized drug-resistant Mtb isolates to identify resistance-conferring and resistance-enabling mutations. Nevertheless, it would be very interesting to know if any of the mutations identified in those other studies were also picked up here – and, if not, why that might be the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these insightful questions. We agree with the reviewer that comparison of pre- and post-treatment samples can better illustrate the causal relationship between the mutations we identified and poor treatment outcomes. However, post-treatment samples could only be obtained from the 47 relapse cases at the time of relapse. GWAS-identified fixed mutations in the relapse samples were only detected in the isolates from the 13 patients whose first samples also contained GWAS-identified mutations. Then, as suggested by the reviewer, we sought to explain the correlation between these mutations and the poor treatment outcomes in terms of their association with drug resistance.</p><p>We looked for mention of the mutations we identified in published studies of drug-resistant Mtb isolates <sup>[5-7]</sup>. None of the 14 mutations we identified were reported in these studies, but two of the genes in which the mutations occurred (<italic>ctpB</italic> and <italic>metA</italic>) had been described as potentially associated with first-line drug resistance <sup>[5]</sup>. We postulate two possible reasons that could explain why the mutations we found were not identified previously: (1) Differences in the genotype composition of the datasets may have led to inconsistent results. The datasets of previous studies were predominantly comprised of L4 strains, while ours included mainly L2 strains. (2) The 14 mutations we identified may have had only limited effects on treatment outcome and therefore did not display the convergent evolution seen with the drug-resistant mutations, especially those most frequent in clinical strains, such as <italic>rpoB</italic> S450L or <italic>katG</italic> S315T.</p><p>To test the first hypothesis, we used WGS data to select the drug-resistant strains collected during the same period at the three study sites and performed GWAS to identify mutations associated with resistance, but this analysis did not detect any of the 14 mutations associated with poor outcomes of drug-susceptible tuberculosis. This result was not surprising, because the strains we included in the study were pretreatment drug-susceptible isolates without prior drug exposure that would have selected for resistance associated mutations. We therefore favor the second explanation, i.e., the limited impact of the 14 mutations. Bacterial factors alone had low power for predicting poor outcomes, with an AUC of just 0.58. Only 24.2% (22/91) of patients with poor outcomes carried at least one GWAS-identified fixed mutation.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe our study demonstrates that there are genetic variants associated with poor outcomes in drug-susceptible Mtb, but their role in causing poor outcomes is limited. These results emphasize that future studies on bacterial genetic factors associated with poor treatment outcomes should focus on drug resistance-associated variants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The analyses presented in this study are heavily dependent on statistical methods; however, there is very little detail provided about the methodology applied. This omission detracts from the inferred outcomes-associated Mtb polymorphisms, especially given that the predominance of lineage 2 (and sub-lineage 2.3) risks a lineage-specific association, rather than a more generalizable pathogenicity phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We describe the statistical methods used for GWAS in the methods section (lines 299-300). Population structure has an impact on GWAS analyses, so after consulting previous GWAS strategies we used a linear mixed model to control for the confounding effects of MTB lineage. The distribution of most (85.7%, 12/14) of the inferred outcome-associated mutations across the lineages is not significantly different (<xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>). Although two mutations (<italic>Rv1747</italic> T191A/<italic>cobN</italic> A751V) were significantly more prevalent in L4 strains than in L2 strains, these two mutations were not specific to L4 strains and evolved convergently in strains of different lineages.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the ratio of

It is also not clear that the statistical analyses have considered the fact that the &quot;good&quot; outcomes exceed the &quot;poor&quot; outcomes by a factor of ~34x. Similarly, the heavy skew in the &quot;good&quot; (3105) versus &quot;poor&quot; (91) samples (approximately 34x difference in sample size) raises the possibility that mutations identified in the &quot;poor&quot; category might be artificially over-represented.

We also considered the effect of the ratio of controls to cases on the statistical power. When cases and controls are both freely available, selecting equal numbers will make a study most efficient. Because of the limited number of cases in this study, i.e., drug susceptible TB patients with poor outcomes, we attempted to augment the statistical confidence by increasing the ratio of controls to cases. We are aware that the gains in statistical power diminish as the ratio of controls to cases increases, and at ratios greater than 4:1 the additional statistical power is minimal. However, if the data on controls is easily obtained there is no reason to limit the number of controls <sup>[8]</sup>.

The manuscript provides little to no detail about how the samples were obtained, other than the fact that they are &quot;pre-treatment&quot; samples. The authors must clarify if they are all sputum samples (as assumed) and if some/all represent induced sputa. Similarly, much greater detail is required about sample propagation, in particular, the possibility that samples underwent (multiple rounds) of in vitro culture to achieve sufficient biomass for whole-genome sequencing. If so, what growth media were used, how long were samples cultured, and how many generations does this equate to? Also, it is very important to know if all samples were treated identically.</p><p>2. Continuing from the above, it wasn't clear what was meant by some of the terminology used in the manuscript. Does the term &quot;isolates&quot; indicate that samples were plated to separate single colonies? Or are the &quot;isolates&quot; referred to throughout the manuscript actually populations of potentially different Mtb clones obtained – and propagated – as a mixed sample? This information is critical given the potential that the identified polymorphisms – both fixed and, perhaps even more so, unfixed – might have arisen as a consequence of in vitro (laboratory) handling under standard aerobic conditions.</p><p>3.

Nevertheless, it would be very interesting to know if any of the mutations identified in those other studies were also picked up here – and, if not, why that might be the case.</p><p>5. The analyses presented in this study are heavily dependent on statistical methods. As for sample handling, however, there is very little detail provided about the methodology applied. This omission detracts from the interpretation, especially given that the predominance of lineage 2 (and sub-lineage 2.3) risks a lineage-specific association, rather than a more generalizable pathogenicity phenotype.</p><p>6. Related to the above: The reference in the abstract to &quot;3496 MTB strains&quot; is deceptive: 300 &quot;other&quot; were excluded, and the remaining samples are split 3105:91. This means only 91 samples derive from &quot;poor&quot; outcomes, which is the focus of the work.</p><p>7. Continuing from the above, it is not clear that the statistical analyses have taken into account the fact that the &quot;good&quot; outcomes exceed the &quot;poor&quot; outcomes by a factor of ~34x. Similarly, the heavy skew in the &quot;good&quot; (3105) versus &quot;poor&quot; (91) samples (approximately 34x difference in sample size) raises the possibility that mutations identified in the &quot;poor&quot; category might be artificially over-represented. More clarity in detailing the statistical methods is required to allay any concerns about the identification of candidate polymorphisms.</p><p>8. The authors note the importance of &quot;host&quot; factors, including age, sex, duration of diagnostic delay, etc. How were these factors separated (excluded) from the mycobacterium-associated factors in comparing genotypes from &quot;good&quot; versus &quot;poor&quot; outcomes?</p></disp-quote><p>Each of these questions has been carefully answered in our responses to the essential revisions, above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
