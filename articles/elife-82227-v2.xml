Current models suggest that exophers are neuroprotective, providing a mechanism for stressed neurons to eject toxic protein aggregates and organelles. However, little is known of the fate of the exopher once it leaves the neuron. We found that exophers produced by mechanosensory neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> are engulfed by surrounding hypodermal skin cells and are then broken up into numerous smaller vesicles that acquire hypodermal phagosome maturation markers, with vesicular contents gradually degraded by hypodermal lysosomes. Consistent with the hypodermis acting as an exopher phagocyte, we found that exopher removal requires hypodermal actin and Arp2/3, and the hypodermal plasma membrane adjacent to newly formed exophers accumulates dynamic F-actin during budding. Efficient fission of engulfed exopher-phagosomes to produce smaller vesicles and degrade their contents requires phagosome maturation factors SAND-1/Mon1, GTPase RAB-35, the CNT-1 ARF-GAP, and microtubule motor-associated GTPase ARL-8, suggesting a close coupling of phagosome fission and phagosome maturation. Lysosome activity was required to degrade exopher contents in the hypodermis but not for exopher-phagosome resolution into smaller vesicles. Importantly, we found that GTPase ARF-6 and effector SEC-10/exocyst activity in the hypodermis, along with the CED-1 phagocytic receptor, is required for efficient production of exophers by the neuron. Our results indicate that the neuron requires specific interaction with the phagocyte for an efficient exopher response, a mechanistic feature potentially conserved with mammalian exophergenesis, and similar to neuronal pruning by phagocytic glia that influences neurodegenerative disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phagocytosis</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicle</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG047101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31AG066405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arnold</surname><given-names>Meghan Lee</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS101969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smart</surname><given-names>Anna Joelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs R24OD010943</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM135326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37AG56510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Driscoll</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Giant neuron derived vesicles called exophers are processed by phagocytosis in neighboring skin cells, and the phagocytic interaction promotes exopher production.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells expend a great deal of energy and resources to maintain the quality of their active proteome, matching expression with degradation, sensing and regulating protein folding and protein complex assembly via chaperone systems, and employing several types of protein degradation systems to remove damaged or aggregated protein products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). As long-lived cells that typically cannot divide, neurons may be especially vulnerable to loss of proteostasis equilibrium, with protein aggregation proposed as a common element in the pathophysiology of several prevalent neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurtishi et al., 2019</xref>). In some cases, transfer of neurotoxic protein aggregates and damaged organelles to neighboring cells has also been demonstrated, potentially acting to ameliorate the deleterious effects in the originating neuron, but in turn such transfer may be deleterious to receiving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2018</xref>). How such transfer processes contribute to the etiology and pathology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimerâs, Parkinsonâs, and Huntingtonâs is an area of increasing investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davis et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies indicate that wholesale ejection of aggregated protein and damaged organelles into extracellular vesicles represents another pathway to deal with toxic proteostress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">NicolÃ¡s-Ãvila et al., 2022</xref>). Of particular interest are giant extracellular vesicles called exophers, with diameters rivaling that of the neuronal somata from which they bud, first discovered in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neurons under proteostress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">NicolÃ¡s-Ãvila et al., 2020</xref>). Ejected exophers can carry aggregates and mitochondria out of the neuron, and the production of exophers is greatly stimulated under stress conditions that promote accumulation of misfolded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>). For example, exopher production is greatly increased by inhibition of proteosome and autophagy activity, increased osmotic strength, increased oxidative activity, nutrient deprivation, and forced expression of aggregating Hungtingtin polyQ or mCherry proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>). In the case of Huntingtin HTT-Q128 protein expression, neurons that produced exophers maintained better neuronal function than those that did not, suggesting that exopher production is protective to neurons experiencing proteotoxic load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, recent work indicates similar mechanisms operate in mammalian systems, with exophers reported to export oxidized mitochondria from highly active mouse cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">NicolÃ¡s-Ãvila et al., 2020</xref>), and exopher-resembling giant vesicles identified in human and mouse brain, with an apparent increase in exopher number in diseased brain samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siddique et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The best studied system for analysis of neuronal exopher production remains the six <italic>C. elegans</italic> mechanosensory touch receptor neurons where exophers were discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>). These neurons are largely unipolar, each extending a long sensory neurite embedded in the hypodermis (skin) of the animal where each senses gentle touch to the animal body region within its receptive field, leading to a rapid retreat behavior when stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bounoutas and Chalfie, 2007</xref>). Of the six touch neurons in the hermaphrodite, the centrally located ALMR neuron produces exophers with the highest frequency and is the main model used in our studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>). Previous work showed that 10â20% of ALMR neurons stimulated by high-level expression of mCherry produce an exopher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>). If an ALMR neuron produces an exopher, it generally only produces a single such vesicle in its lifetime, with most exophers produced on day 2 of adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>). Very few exophers appear outside of the day 1 to day 3 timeframe, which correlates with the high metabolic activity associated with reproduction, and an organismal switch in overall proteostatic stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morimoto, 2020</xref>). Exophers in the ALMR neuron typically emerge from the neuronal soma in a polarized manner, formed from the plasma membrane opposite the large neurite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, as a budded exopher moves away from the soma it initially remains connected to the soma by a thin thread-like nanotube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>). Ultimately the connection to the soma is lost and the exopher is released. The exopher quickly breaks up into smaller vesicles that we refer to as âstarry nightâ (SN) vesicles, which later disappear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Longitudinal analysis indicates that exophers vesiculate prior to degradation of exopher-derived cargo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequential images captured on a fluorescence dissecting microscope are shown for the same animal at different timepoints.

The <italic>C. elegans</italic> system offers the opportunity to understand this process in the native cellular context of the intact animal in which neurons are constantly interacting with neighboring cells. Here we show a key role for the closely associated hypodermis in phagocytosis and degradation of neuronal exopher contents. The acquisition of hypodermal phagosome maturation markers by the exopher-laden phagosome was low until phagosome fission into smaller starry night vesicles occurred, with lysosome activity required for the degradation of starry night vesicle content after phagosomal fission. Importantly, our data also indicate a role for hypodermis-neuron interaction beyond simple exopher degradation, as the ability of the neuron to produce exophers appears to depend upon action of certain regulators in the hypodermis, including the GTPase ARF-6, its effector SEC-10/exocyst, and the phagocytic receptor CED-1/Draper.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exophers break up into smaller vesicles after release from the neuron</title><p>As previously described, exophers appear most frequently on adult day 2 (D2), with fewer appearing on adult day 1 (D1) or adult day 3 (D3), and very few appearing outside of this age range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>). To better understand the fate of exophers after they are produced, we first performed manual longitudinal tracking in individual animals focused on D1 or D2 exophers produced by the ALMR touch receptor neuron expressing a touch neuron-specific mCherry marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For these experiments, we followed animals in their unperturbed and unrestrained culture plate environment using a high-magnification epifluorescence-dissecting microscope.</p><p>We noted that the vast majority of mCherry-filled exophers convert into smaller âstarry nightâ (SN) vesicles, and this always precedes the eventual loss of the neuronal exopher-derived mCherry signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>). Transient tubulation and rapid vesicle movement is a prominent feature of exopher vesiculation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Exopher-derived small vesicles often appeared within the first 2 hr after exopher formation (D1 mean = 2.0 hr [N = 32], D2 mean = 2.5 hr [N = 22]). Most exophers were eventually fully converted to starry night vesicles, with all detectable exopher-derived mCherry signal lost over the course of 3â4 days (D1 mean persistence = 80 hr [N = 24], D2 mean persistence = 98 hr [N = 14]). A minor fraction of exophers did not convert to starry night vesicles (7%, N = 118). These exophers persisted and were never degraded over a 7-day tracking period, apparently failing to engage the hypodermal degradative machinery. Taken together our results suggest an obligatory transition from large exopher to smaller starry night vesicles prior to eventual degradation of exopher contents in the hypodermis.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-82227-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Exophers tubulate and vesiculate to form starry night vesicles.</title><p>mCherry-filled ALMR neuron-derived exopher tubulates and vesiculates after release from the neuron.

Once a forming phagosome seals, the process of phagosome maturation begins, eventually leading to the degradation of the phagocytosed material. Phagocytic cups are characterized by polymerization of abundant F-actin that supports plasma membrane deformation to surround the target of engulfment. Phagosome maturation proceeds via sequential fusion of a sealed phagosome with endocytic compartments, generally beginning with early endosomes, then late endosomes, and finally lysosomes. Recycling of material not destined for degradation, such as phagocytic receptors, proceeds at the same time. To determine whether mCherry-containing exophers undergo phagocytosis and phagosome maturation in the surrounding hypodermis, we expressed a variety of molecular markers with mNeonGreen tags from single-copy transgenes using a hypodermis-specific promoter (Phyp7) from the <italic>semo-1/Y37A1B.5</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Philipp et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We focused first on intact early-stage exophers that had not started to break up into the smaller starry night vesicles. If the exopher is engulfed by the surrounding hypodermal cells via phagocytosis, we would expect hypodermal F-actin to surround the extruded exopher during the initial stage of exopher processing. To test this model, we expressed F-actin biosensor mNG::UtrCH, encoding an mNeonGreen fusion to the CH-domain of Utrophin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Winder et al., 1995</xref>), specifically in the hypodermis. We then quantified the F-actin signal at the periphery of newly formed exophers marked by mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). As a control, we performed the same analysis on the ALMR neuronal soma from which the exopher was derived since the soma is also surrounded by the hypodermal Hyp7 cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bounoutas and Chalfie, 2007</xref>). We found that most exophers we examined were clearly coated in hypodermal F-actin (74% positive, N = 27), while the hypodermal membrane around the neuronal soma was not enriched in F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). We also noted that most (65%, n = 45) intact exophers were surrounded by hypodermal puncta positive for mNG::PH(PLCÎ´), a biosensor for the lipid PI(4,5)P2, with significantly more PI(4,5)P2 signal overlap with the exopher periphery than the nearby neuronal soma periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lemmon et al., 1995</xref>).

Second, we captured early budding events via time-lapse imaging, which is challenging since exopher events are rare and their time of occurrence is random within the first three days of adulthood.

Indeed, we found that depletion of hypodermal actin using tissue-specific RNAi against actins <italic>act-1, act-2</italic>, or <italic>act-3</italic> resulted in accumulation of exophers derived from the ALMR neuron, suggesting a failure in hypodermal phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Hypodermis-specific depletion of <italic>arx-2</italic>, encoding the Arp2 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex required for formation of branched actin during phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goley and Welch, 2006</xref>), also resulted in the accumulation of exophers and a reduction in starry night vesicles that derive from exopher degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These experiments do not specify which actin isoforms are involved as actin RNAi reactions are likely to cross-react with one-another, and actin or arp2/3 perturbations are difficult to interpret in isolation, as they can affect many processes. Still, taken together, our data support the interpretation that a canonical actin-dependent hypodermal phagocytosis response is initiated in response to extruded exophers; hypodermis-specific disruption of actin and key actin regulator Arp2/3 results in a block in hypodermal digestion that processes ALM-derived exophers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>Once phagocytosis is complete, we would expect hypodermal endosome and lysosome markers to accumulate on exopher-phagosomes as phagocyte organelles fuse with the phagosome to promote phagosome maturation and the degradation of its contents. We found that hypodermally expressed mNeonGreen markers for distinct steps of phagosomal maturation label the periphery of intact ALMR neuron-derived exophers, but this labeling was weak, further supporting the interpretation that large exophers are usually associated with early stages of hypodermal phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâH</xref>). In particular, we noted frequent weak labeling for early phagosome marker RAB-5 (42%, N = 29), late phagosome marker RAB-7 (70%, N = 24), and autophagosome marker LGG-1/LC3, suggesting that hypodermal early endosomes, late endosomes, and autophagosomes begin to associate with large phagocytosed exophers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâF</xref>). Low-level association with the exopher phagosome periphery may indicate transitory endosome and autophagosome association rather than full fusion at this stage. Notably, however, early and late phagosome marker labeling, and autophagosome marker labeling, is much more pronounced later, after fragmentation of the exopher-laden phagosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We observed little acquisition of hypodermally expressed lysosome marker LMP-1/LAMP by intact exopher-phagosomes, suggesting little lysosome association at the large single phagosome exopher stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Hypodermal endosomes and autophagosomes, but not lysosomes, begin recruitment prior to exopher-laden phagosome vesiculation.</title><p>(<bold>A, C, E, G</bold>) Fluorescence micrographs are shown for an mCherry-labeled ALMR neuron-derived exopher, or the similarly sized mCherry-labeled ALMR neuronal soma from the same neuron.

As expected for phagosomes, we found very little colocalization of starry night vesicles with Golgi marker AMAN-2 or basolateral recycling endosome marker RME-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

The vesicles measured 200â500 nm in size, significantly smaller than the average extruded large vesicle exopher (~3 Î¼m).

Indeed, hypodermal CED-1ÎC::GFP clearly labeled the periphery of exophers undergoing engulfment. The pattern of association of CED-1ÎC::GFP with the exopher was striking in that CED-1ÎC::GFP became enriched at sites of early exopher budding, but did not label the still-attached neuronal soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

These results indicate that hypodermal CED-10 does not affect neuronal exopher generation like CED-1, ARF-6, or SEC-10, but strongly affects completion of exopher phagocytosis, a prerequisite for phagosome fragmentation into starry night vesicles. We also found that hypodermis-specific mNeonGreen::CED-10 is enriched on the hypodermal membrane surrounding the exopher compared to the hypodermal membrane surrounding the neuronal soma, suggesting a direct role for CED-10 in exopher-laden phagosome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that the conserved CED-1/DRAPER phagocytic receptor plays a role in recognition and removal of neuronally derived exophers, and along with ARF-6 and SEC-10, supports activities in the hypodermis that greatly influence neuronal exopher production. Other phagocytic regulators, such as CED-10/Rac, do not appear important for such non-autonomous regulation of exophergenesis, but are required to complete phagocytosis and remove the exopher once it has formed.

Here we investigated the fate of mCherry-filled exophers released by the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ALMR touch neuron, finding that the surrounding hypodermis engulfs the exopher via defined phagocytosis steps, then processes the exopher-laden phagosome via phagosome maturation, ultimately leading to the degradation of most neuron-derived mCherry cargo in hypodermal phagolysosomes. The exopher response appears to be a mechanism to expel toxic cargo such as protein aggregates from the neuron, which is activated when other proteostasis pathways, such as the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy pathways, prove insufficient to the proteostatic load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>). Exophergenesis is likely to be especially important in cells such as neurons that cannot dilute accumulated toxins by cell division. Uptake of toxic or excess material by another cell provides a fresh chance to degrade components that the neuron-intrinsic pathways could not handle. In the case of the ALMR touch neuron in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the hypodermal receiving cell Hyp7 is a very large syncytium formed by the fusion of many cells during development. Hyp7 degradative capacity is expected to far outstrip that of the neuron expelling an exopher. The exopher, as a phagocytic cargo, presents an unusual challenge in that it is often as large as an apoptotic cell, but remains attached to a living neuron during early stages of engulfment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neuronal exopher production requires phagocyte recognition</title><p>Our analysis revealed an unexpected relationship between hypodermis and neuron with respect to exopher production. Failure in exopher uptake by the hypodermis might have been expected to result in accumulation of unengulfed exophers, as occurs for apoptotic cell corpses if engulfment fails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mangahas and Zhou, 2005</xref>). However, we found that fewer exophers are produced by neurons in <italic>arf-6</italic> and <italic>ced-1</italic> mutants as both exopher and starry night vesicle accumulation is strongly reduced. ARF-6 and CED-1 are required in the hypodermis for this effect as this phenotype is rescued by hypodermis-specific <italic>arf-6</italic> or <italic>ced-1</italic> re-expression, respectively. Moreover, hypodermis-specific RNAi of <italic>arf-6</italic> or its effector <italic>sec-10</italic> also reduce neuronal exopher production, strengthening the conclusion of hypodermal function required for neuronal exophergenesis. Interestingly, depletion of actin, Arp2/3, or loss of <italic>ced-10/Rac</italic> blocks at a later step, accumulating exophers, suggesting that an actin response by the hypodermis is not a key molecular requirement for neuronal exopher production. Further work will be required to understand the precise step in exophergenesis affected by hypodermal recognition. Since early bud frequency appears unaffected in <italic>arf-6</italic> mutants, hypodermal recognition is likely to be required for elaboration of the typical large exopher bud and/or to prevent regression of exopher buds back into the soma prior to bud scission.</p><p>CED-1, as a phagocytic receptor, functions in the phagocytic cell, and our CED-1 localization data suggest that hypodermal CED-1 distinguishes between exopher and the attached soma, exclusively associating with the exopher bud. The accumulation of hypodermal CED-1 around the exopher bud but not the neuronal soma, even at relatively early stages of exopher budding, reveals a likely asymmetry in surface membrane components between neuronal soma and exopher. It is interesting to note that mouse cardiomyocytes producing exophers maintain a dedicated pool of attached macrophages to accept produced exophers, suggesting that such close interplay between the exopher ejecting cell and the accepting phagocyte may be a conserved feature of exopher production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">NicolÃ¡s-Ãvila et al., 2020</xref>). This kind of instructional relationship between phagocyte and neuron is also reminiscent of neuronal pruning by glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raiders et al., 2021</xref>). The transfer of expanded polyglutamine aggregates from neurons to associated glia in <italic>Drosophila</italic> further suggests a mechanistic kinship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>). Our results with <italic>ttr-52</italic> and <italic>anoh-1</italic> suggest that presentation of phosphatidylserine on the exopher surface contributes to specific exopher recognition, especially given the known role of CED-1 in phosphatidylserine recognition. Further work will be required to fully understand how an exopher-producing cell senses and responds to the associated phagocyte.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Exopher production may be neuroprotective</title><p>The removal of exopher contents from the neuron by phagocytosis is likely to be neuroprotective. Previous work showed that gentle touch response is better preserved in a HttQ128::CFP background when touch neurons had produced an exopher compared to animals in which the touch neurons had not produced an exopher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>). To extend this analysis, we performed a similar analysis in <italic>arf-6</italic> and <italic>ced-1</italic> mutants in animals expressing mCherry in the touch neurons, comparing gentle touch response to mCherry controls. For both <italic>arf-6</italic> and <italic>ced-1</italic> mutants, we found reduced response to gentle touch in 10-day-old adults (Ad10), but not 5-day-old adults (Ad5), indicating a deficit in old-age neuronal function in mutants in which exopher maturation is compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref>). These results are consistent with a neuroprotective role for exopher production, but caveats remain to this interpretation, as neither ARF-6 nor CED-1 are specific to exophergenesis and may affect neuronal aging in other ways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Phagosome maturation is required for the hypodermal processing of neuronal exopher material</title><p>A number of trafficking mutants, including <italic>rab-35</italic> and <italic>cnt-1,</italic> allowed full exopher production, but blocked phagosome completion. RAB-35 and CNT-1 have been proposed to be negative regulators of the small GTPase ARF-6, with downregulation of ARF-6 important for the completion of phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kutscher et al., 2018</xref>). Downregulation of ARF-6 may be required to control relative PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3)P levels, with the proper mix of such lipids required to recruit/activate fission factors such as LST-4/Snx9 and DYN-1/dynamin that complete phagosomal sealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). Especially high levels of force from outside the neuron may be required to complete exopher phagocytosis if the neuron does not fully sever the soma-exopher connection from the inside, as might be implied by the long nanotube-like connector frequently observed between the neuronal soma and exopher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>). A requirement for external forces provided by the phagocyte was recently proposed for severing large lobes produced by <italic>C. elegans</italic> primordial germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with ARF-6 regulation by RAB-35 and CNT-1, <italic>rab-35</italic> and <italic>cnt-1</italic> mutants display the opposite phenotype to the <italic>arf-6</italic> loss-of-function mutant, accumulating rather than lacking exophers, and display an epistasis relationship suggesting that RAB-35 positively regulates CNT-1, and CNT-1 downregulates ARF-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kutscher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chesneau et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allaire et al., 2013</xref>).

Subcellular localization results with these proteins were surprising, however; while RAB-35 smoothly labeled the engulfed exopher periphery, CNT-1 and ARF-6 were only visualized as puncta resembling endosomes at the phagosome periphery. Such subcellular distribution could indicate that RAB-35 functions directly on the phagosome, while ARF-6 and CNT-1 could function via endosomal transport or membrane contact rather than assembling directly on the phagosomal membrane.</p><p>There are some noteworthy mechanistic differences between exopher phagocytosis and other <italic>C. elegans</italic> phagocytosis events involving RAB-35 and/or CNT-1. First, in the RAB-35/CNT-1-dependent phagocytosis of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> male linker cell, <italic>arf-6</italic> null mutants were epistatic to <italic>rab-35/cnt-1</italic> mutants as we observed, restoring efficient linker cell phagocytosis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kutscher et al., 2018</xref>). However, the <italic>arf-6</italic> single mutant had no effect on linker cell corpse production or disposal, unlike the strong effects <italic>arf-6</italic> mutants have on exopher production. Linker cell phagocytosis was also CED-1 independent, unlike the exopher case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kutscher et al., 2018</xref>). The strong effects of ARF-6 and CED-1 single mutants on the exopher system indicate clear mechanistic differences from the linker cell example. One possibility is that ARF-6 and SEC-10/exocyst control CED-1 recycling required for early exopher recognition by the hypodermis. ARF-6 may then also contribute to later steps in phagocytosis as hypodermis-specific depletion of another candidate ARF-6 effector, PPK-1, does not affect exopher production but inhibits the transition from engulfed exopher to exopher-laden phagosome fragments. PPK-1 function is likely required prior phagosomal sealing. We also found that exophers that did form in <italic>arf-6</italic> mutants were more likely than normal to remain soma-attached, similar to our findings after hypodermal <italic>ppk-1</italic> depletion, supporting an additional later role for ARF-6 with PPK-1.</p><p>The apparent obligatory progression from exopher-laden phagosome to âstarry nightâ phagosomal fragmentation prior to degradation of phagosomal content resembles recently described phagosomal resolution processes in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo and in mammalian macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghose and Wehman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fazeli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin-Konigsberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fazeli et al., 2016</xref>). We found that SAND-1/Mon1 was required for exopher-containing phagosome fragmentation. Given the role of SAND-1 as a subunit of the key RAB-7 GDP/GTP exchange factor during phagosome maturation, our results imply an essential role for RAB-7 and its effectors in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kinchen and Ravichandran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nordmann et al., 2010</xref>). Recent work in mammalian macrophages indicates a role for Rab7-effector and lipid transfer protein ORPL1 in tethering phagosomal microdomains to the ER in concert with ER localized VAP, acting to reduce PI4P levels and potentially acting as an anchor for the phagosome as pulling forces draw out recycling tubules from the limiting membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin-Konigsberg et al., 2019</xref>). It will be of great interest to determine whether such ER tethering is relevant to exopher-laden phagosome resolution and whether failure in this process can explain our results with <italic>sand-1</italic> mutants. Furthermore, we identified a requirement for ARL-8 in exopher-laden phagosome resolution, suggesting a role for kinesin-type motor activity as a driving force in exopher-phagosome tubulation and fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghose and Wehman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fazeli et al., 2018</xref>). We also note extensive acquisition of hypodermal LGG-1/LC3 by fragmented, but not whole exopher-laden phagosomes, suggesting either LC3-associated phagocytosis, or fusion of exopher-phagosome fragments with autophagosomes, which may support later content degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">PeÃ±a-Ramos et al., 2022</xref>). We favor a full autophagosome fusion model since we did not observe LGG-1 association with intact phagosomes as would be expected for LC3-associated phagocytosis. Interestingly, we also did not observe lysosome (LMP-1) marker acquisition on unfragmented phagosomes, which suggests a different order of events from that described in macrophages, where lysosome fusion to phagosomes precedes fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin-Konigsberg et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results identify a set of conserved phagosome resolution mechanisms that operate to break down the large phagosomes containing neuronal exophers, with implications for the ultimate fate of engulfed material, including toxic aggregates.

Three biological replicates of 30 animals/replicate were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>ALMR exopher occurrence was scored as yes or no (binary), with each trial graphed as a percentage of total.

cellâcell communication. The authors present compelling data showing that large extrusions (exophers) of neuronal cells are taken up by adjacent hypodermal cells and eventually degraded by lysosomes, uncovering an important mechanism for clearing toxic cargo. Mechanistically, the study identifies a number of small GTPases and accessory components, as well as the phagocytic receptor (CED-1).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82227.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kratsios</surname><given-names>Paschalis</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/024mw5h28</institution-id><institution>University of Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0488bnd65</institution-id><institution>Oregon Health and Science University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.07.31.502194">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.31.502194v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marc Freeman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A common point of concern is whether hypodermal cells are promoting exopher production in neurons. Additional experiments are needed to test this hypothesis, such as site of action rescue for ced-1 and ced-10 (cell-specific rescue), and ruling out that exophers don't simply just retract into the cell body in these mutant backgrounds because they cannot be taken up by hypodermal cells.</p><p>2. The authors should also induce exopher production through other means (e.g., expression of mutant Huntingtin protein) and then test any involvement of CED-1. Such experiments would demonstrate broad applicability of the mechanism described herein.</p><p>3. The author should experimentally address what is the ultimate fate of a neuron that is unable to produce exophers?</p><p>4. An available gain-of-function allele of arf-6 that is likely GTP-locked must be used to confirm the proposed model.</p><p>5. The key message of the paper is not clear and modifications of the text and/or title are required. The title suggests that the reader will learn about how ARF-6 and CED-1 control exopher extrusion, but there does not appear to be a substantial amount of data to support this claim.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The reduced exopher phenotype of arf-6 and ced-1 mutants is very intriguing. The authors show that these proteins function in the hypodermis and propose that they stimulate exopher production by neurons. However, couldn't an alternative hypothesis be that they are required for exopher scission, and that in their absence, exophers are resorbed into the neuronal cell body? This is an important distinction and should be addressed experimentally.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Could the authors perhaps label each graph of the adult age (D2, D3 etc?). I had to read the Figure legends to see that Figure 2F was D2 and Figure 2G was D3. This will help the reader.</p><p>2. Can authors provide definitions for I assume other neurons (PVM, ALML, AVM)? I don't see them described in text or figure legend.</p><p>3. In Figure 2, the overlap of F-actin and PIP2 appears to be clear. However, the difference in Figure 3 is small (most markers show around 2Î¼m2). More controls would be beneficial. Could the authors use a different control and compare exopher to a non-engulfed exopher instead of exopher to soma? The authors demonstrated that blocking actin assembly would disrupt phagosome formation. This should result in significantly less labeling of phagocytic markers on the periphery of intact ALMR neuron-derived exophers.</p><p>4. The authors state in the discussion that the events of exopher breakdown may occur in a different order than macrophages. Because there is no association with lysosomes, it appears that exophers are not phagolysosomes. They do, however, associate with Rab-5 and Rab-7. How acidic are the exophers? Is the exopher labeled with FYVE-GFP? The fact that loss of ARL-8 prevents the formation of smaller vesicles suggests that exophers may be broken down and fused with lysosomes.</p><p>5. The authors state that live imaging of these events is challenging. But it would be great to use live imaging, which is the strength of the model system at certain critical points.</p><p>6. In the final model Rab5 and Rab7 associate with only the smaller vesicles. Figure 3 implies that they associate also with the exopher.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It seems important for the CED-1/Draper and eat-me signal experiments to perform cell-specific rescue experiments to show that these proteins are acting in the hypodermis and neuron, as suspected. I may have missed it, but I didn't see these studies in the paper. Similarly, for the CED-10 studies, it's important to functionally define the tissue of action.</p><p>2. Previously, a gain-of-function allele of arf-6 that is likely GTP-locked was described. Can the authors test the effects of that allele to confirm their model? The diagram in figure 6K would suggest that this would bypass RAB-35 defects. Is that the case?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82227.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We now add data showing rescue of exopher production in <italic>ced-1</italic> mutants by a hypodermis-specific CED-1 transgene (Figure 8B), and have added hypodermis-specific <italic>ced-10</italic> RNAi data (Figure 8F), showing depletion of <italic>ced-10</italic> from the hypodermis is sufficient to induce exopher accumulation. These data further confirm our proposal of a key role for the hypodermis in promoting exopher production.</p><p>The other issue brought up by the reviewers was whether the lower exopher rate observed in mutants with a focus in the hypodermis resorbed exopher buds more frequently than controls. We sought to address this issue in time-lapse imaging experiments using <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, which have an unusually high exopher rate. We compared animals with and without the additional <italic>arf-6</italic> mutation, our best characterized hypodermis-focused exopher suppressor. After analysis of &gt;130 videos lasting several hours each, we did not capture enough exopher events to answer this question directly.</p><p>However, we did find a high rate of early bud formation in both genotypes (Figure 8 supp 2; Movies 3 and 4). Our results suggest that neurons begin to form exophers in both genotypes, but the buds rarely progress to completion in <italic>arf-6</italic> mutants, implying a key role for interaction with the hypodermis to elaborate large buds.

Unfortunately, our Huntingtin expressor lines now display high levels of transgene silencing precluding their use in this experiment. Given this, we switched to a low toxicity GFP-expressing transgene from the Chalfie lab that we found has a detectable level of exopher production from touch neurons, uIs31[Pmec17::GFP]. We found that <italic>arf-6</italic> mutants suppressed exophers in this background as effectively as in previous mCherry experiments (Figure 6E), indicating that our results are not dependent upon the particular transgene marking the touch neurons or the associated expressed protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The author should experimentally address what is the ultimate fate of a neuron that is unable to produce exophers?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question we measured the function of the mechanosensory touch neurons, using the classic gentle touch response assay in mCherry expressing animals, comparing controls to <italic>arf-6</italic> and <italic>ced-1</italic> mutants. For both mutants, we found reduced response to gentle touch in older adults (Ad10), indicating a deficit in old age neuronal function (Figure 8, supp 2). These results are consistent with exopher production maintaining neuronal health into old age, but interpretation is limited since neither <italic>ced-1</italic> or <italic>arf-6</italic> are specific to exophergenesis and these loci may also affect the animals in other ways. There are currently no known genetic perturbations that are <italic>specific</italic> to the process of exophergenesis, so there is no better current method to address the Reviewer question. We had already published similar results in our 2017 Nature paper that first described exophers, showing that gentle touch response is better preserved in the Htt::Q128::CFP background when touch neurons had produced an exopher as compared to animals in which the Htt::Q128::CFP touch neurons had not produced an exopher.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Could the authors use a different control and compare exopher to a non-engulfed exopher instead of exopher to soma?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs question. We have described in the text that recruitment of maturation markers to intact exophers is small, and appears more adjacent rather than overlapping, suggesting that these markers are acquired by fusion with endosomes and autophagosomes that is much more pronounced during the starry night phase (Figure 4). This is quite different from the strong recruitment of actin at an early phase of phagocytosis. The maturation markers are naturally abundant on endosomes and autophagosomes in the hypodermal cells and some degree of association by chance will occur with the soma regardless of whether the soma has produced an exopher.</p><p>Phagosome markers are dynamic and associate at different points of maturation, creating substantial challenge to comparing engulfed vs. non-engufed structures. Our experience is that comparison of the soma from which an exopher is derived to the engulfed exopher is the best control in terms of signal strength and dynamic range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors demonstrated that blocking actin assembly would disrupt phagosome formation. This should result in significantly less labeling of phagocytic markers on the periphery of intact ALMR neuron-derived exophers.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs point that such analysis could strengthen our interpretation. We have not directly analyzed the effects of actin disruption on phagocytic marker recruitment because we quantified these markers as only very weakly associated with intact exophers normally, making it quite difficult to measure a reduction. The RNAi-based actin perturbations we used likely only partially reduce actin levels and would likely generate some intermediate level of recruitment effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors state in the discussion that the events of exopher breakdown may occur in a different order than macrophages. Because there is no association with lysosomes, it appears that exophers are not phagolysosomes. They do, however, associate with Rab-5 and Rab-7. How acidic are the exophers?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fascinating question. We have not yet been able to measure exopher pH directly, but we have observed that when GFP and mCherry are both incorporated into exophers, the GFP is visible in intact âearly stageâ exophers but is often hard to detect during the starry night phase, suggesting that exopher pH starts to drop below pH 6, the pKa of GFP, by the starry night stage. However, even early phagosomes may drop below pH 6. Phagolysosomes should be closer to pH 4. We have tested the improved firePHLY pH sensors developed by Amy Kao, and constructed strains that work well to report pH in other tissues. However, the firePHLY biosensor is based upon fusions to LMP-1/LAMP, which we know does not label exophers or most exopher fragments, precluding its use in the hypodermis to address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is the exopher labeled with FYVE-GFP?</p></disp-quote><p>We infer that this question is directed at the timing of phagolysosome identity for engulfed exophers. Since a high proportion of the starry night vesicles are positive for 2XFYVE (Figure 4B) (which they should lose by the phagolysosome stage), our data suggest that many starry night vesicles are still immature phagosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The fact that loss of ARL-8 prevents the formation of smaller vesicles suggests that exophers may be broken down and fused with lysosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is more work to be done to fully understand at which step ARL-8 functions in exopher-phagosome maturation. While ARL-8 has traditionally been considered as lysosome-enriched, data on the degree to which ARL-8 is enriched on early and late endosomes as opposed to lysosomes are sparse. Two published <italic>C. elegans</italic> papers (PMID: 23485564; 36652947) indicate ARL-8 is also found on RAB-5 positive endosomes and phagosomes, suggesting that ARL-8 could begin action prior to lysosome fusion. We could not find any studies that distinguish between late endosome/phagosome and lysosomes with respect to ARL-8 enrichment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors state that live imaging of these events is challenging. But it would be great to use live imaging, which is the strength of the model system at certain critical points.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree in principle and would love to have more of this kind of data. Most cases where live imaging is used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> involve imaging events that occur in most or all animals, either continuously or with highly predictable timing, allowing capture of the large number of events required for quantitative interpretation. Since exophergenesis is relatively rare and relatively unpredictable in its timing (10-20% occurrence of a single event sometime during the first 3 days of adulthood), it is much more difficult to capture enough events for interpretation. Adult animals cannot be kept in a healthy state immobilized on slides for more than a few hours at a time. We have found that existing microfluidic devices do not sufficiently immobilize animals for the high-resolution imaging needed for our studies. We have added time lapse studies in the revised manuscript that partly address the dynamics associated with <italic>arf-6</italic> deficits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
