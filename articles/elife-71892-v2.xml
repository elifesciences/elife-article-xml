synaptic mRNAs in order to generate activity-dependent changes in plasticity. Here, we develop a strategy combining compartment-specific crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) in conditionally tagged mice to precisely define the ribosome-bound dendritic transcriptome of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We identify CA1 dendritic transcripts with differentially localized mRNA isoforms generated by alternative polyadenylation and alternative splicing, including many that have altered protein-coding capacity. Among dendritic mRNAs, FMRP targets were found to be overrepresented. Cell-type-specific FMRP-CLIP and TRAP in microdissected CA1 neuropil revealed 383 dendritic FMRP targets and suggests that FMRP differentially regulates functionally distinct modules in CA1 dendrites and cell bodies. FMRP regulates ~15–20% of mRNAs encoding synaptic functions and 10% of chromatin modulators, in the dendrite and cell body, respectively. In the absence of FMRP, dendritic FMRP targets had increased ribosome association, consistent with a function for FMRP in synaptic translational repression. Conversely, downregulation of FMRP targets involved in chromatin regulation in cell bodies suggests a role for FMRP in stabilizing mRNAs containing stalled ribosomes in this compartment. Together, the data support a model in which FMRP regulates the translation and expression of synaptic and nuclear proteins within different compartments of a single neuronal cell type.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain has over 100 billion neurons that together form vast networks to relay electrical signals. A neuron receives electrical signals from other neurons via branch-like structures known as dendrites. The signals then travel into the cell body of the neuron. If their sum reaches a threshold, they fire a new signal through a single outgoing projection known as the axon, which is connected to the dendrites of other neurons.</p><p>A single neuron has thousands of dendrites that each receive inputs from different axons, and it is thought that the strengthening and weakening of these dendritic connections enables us to learn and store memories.</p><p>Dendrites are filled with molecules known as messenger ribonucleic acids (mRNAs) that act as templates to make proteins. Axonal signals reaching the dendrites can trigger these mRNAs to make new proteins that strengthen or weaken the connections between the two neurons, which is believed to be necessary for generating long-term memories.</p><p>A protein called FMRP is found in both the cell body and dendrites and is able to bind to and regulate the ability of mRNAs to make proteins. A loss of the gene encoding FMRP is the most common cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism in humans, but it remains unclear precisely what role this protein plays in learning and memory.</p><p>Hale et al. used genetic and bioinformatics approaches to specifically study mRNAs in the dendrites and the cell body of a specific type of neuron involved in memory in mice. The experiments revealed that FMRP played different roles in the dendrites and cell body. In the dendrites, FMRP interacted with mRNAs encoding proteins that can change how the neuron responds to a signal from a neighboring neuron and may alter how strong the connections between the neurons are. On the other hand, FMRP in the cell body modulated the activities of mRNAs encoding proteins that in turn regulate the activities of genes.</p><p>These findings change the way we think about how memory may work by suggesting that groups of mRNAs encoding proteins with certain activities are found in distinct parts of a single neuron. These observations offer new ways to approach intellectual disabilities and autism spectrum disorder.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>local translation</kwd><kwd>FMRP</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding proteins</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd><kwd>mRNA localization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007027</institution-id><institution>Leon Levy Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hale</surname><given-names>Caryn R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hale</surname><given-names>Caryn R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawicka</surname><given-names>Kirsty</given-names></name><name><surname>Mora</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name><name><surname>Fak</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Jin Joo</given-names></name><name><surname>Cutrim</surname><given-names>Paula</given-names></name><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hale</surname><given-names>Caryn R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawicka</surname><given-names>Kirsty</given-names></name><name><surname>Mora</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name><name><surname>Fak</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Jin Joo</given-names></name><name><surname>Cutrim</surname><given-names>Paula</given-names></name><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS081706</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hale</surname><given-names>Caryn R</given-names></name><name><surname>Sawicka</surname><given-names>Kirsty</given-names></name><name><surname>Mora</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name><name><surname>Fak</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Jin Joo</given-names></name><name><surname>Cutrim</surname><given-names>Paula</given-names></name><name><surname>Darnell</surname><given-names>Robert B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining compartment- and cell-type specific transcriptomic approaches reveals FMRP regulation of synaptic regulators in the dendrites and chromatin regulators in the cell bodies of CA1 neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A key feature in the molecular biology of learning and memory is protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity, which involves translation of localized mRNAs in response to synaptic activity. Local translation has been demonstrated in neuronal dendrites and axons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glock et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin and Holt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rangaraju et al., 2017</xref>) and allows for rapid and precise changes in the local proteome near active synapses. In dendrites, a brief burst of local translation has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for induction of the late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP, occurring hours to days after potentiation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frey et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang and Schuman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 1997</xref>) and long-term depression (LTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huber et al., 2000</xref>), and inhibiting protein synthesis blocks long-term memory formation <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/u39nsp/OIlK">(</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frey et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sutton and Schuman, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Activity-dependent local translation depends on both the availability of specific mRNAs and the sensitivity with which their translation can be initiated upon local signaling events. Both rely on interactions between mRNAs, a host of RNA-binding proteins, and ribosomes. mRNAs are thought to be transported in a translationally repressed state into the neuronal processes via transport granules containing RNA-binding proteins such as the Fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP), CPEB1, ZBP-1, and STAU1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hüttelmaier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krichevsky and Kosik, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martin and Ephrussi, 2009</xref>). Although dendritic targeting elements have been defined for a few mRNAs such as <italic>Camk2α</italic>, <italic>Actb</italic>, and <italic>Map2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreassi and Riccio, 2009</xref>), and a few RNA-binding proteins have been found to regulate individual mRNAs, such as the interaction between ZBP-1 and the <italic>β-actin</italic> mRNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Biswas et al., 2019</xref>), the functional relationship between the global dendritic transcriptome and individual RNA-binding proteins is still largely unknown. For at least some localized mRNA granules, signaling cascades initiated by synaptic activity lead to their dissolution and initiation of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dahm and Kiebler, 2005</xref>), but the role of RNA regulatory factors in this process is incompletely understood. The integrated study of the dendritic transcriptome and the RNA-binding proteins responsible for regulation of local translation will provide critical insight into the mechanisms underlying protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity.</p><p>FMRP, the RNA-binding protein whose activity is lost in Fragile X syndrome, represses translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bassell and Warren, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costa-Mattioli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laggerbauer et al., 2001</xref>) and is thought to be a key regulator of activity-dependent local translation in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bear et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Dendritic FMRP levels are increased upon neuronal activity, with evidence for local translation of the FMRP transcript itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greenough et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weiler et al., 1997</xref>) and kinesin-mediated movement of FMRP-containing mRNA transport granules from the neuronal cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dictenberg et al., 2008</xref>). At the synapse, FMRP is proposed to be linked to local signal transduction, potentially through calcium-induced post-translational modification of the protein, which alters the FMRP granule and leads to translation of the mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Narayanan et al., 2007</xref>). FMRP knockout (KO) neurons show excess basal translation as well as an inability to produce activity-stimulated translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ifrim et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Direct FMRP targets have been identified in the whole mouse brain through CLIP studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korb et al., 2017</xref>), indirectly through ribosome-binding studies (translating ribosome affinity purification [TRAP]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ceolin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumari and Gazy, 2019</xref>) or through TRAP together with crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>). Some recent studies have explored FMRP targets specifically in the excitatory CA1 neurons of the mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ceolin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>). FMRP target genes overlap significantly with autism susceptibility genes and include genes involved in both synaptic function and transcriptional control in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darnell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>), and loss of FMRP increases translation of chromatin modifiers such as BRD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Korb et al., 2017</xref>) and SETD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shah et al., 2020</xref>). These and other observations have suggested a model in which FMRP regulates the stoichiometry of its targets in two ways: globally, by translational control of transcription regulators in the cell body, and locally, by enabling activity-dependent local translation of synaptic proteins in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darnell, 2020</xref>), but it is still unclear the extent to which such regulation occurs simultaneously in a single neuron. Here, we probe this model by exploring subcellular compartment-specific patterns of FMRP binding and regulation.</p><p>We utilize compartment- and cell-type-specific profiling technologies to precisely define the transcriptome of mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We use TRAP and conditionally tagged (cTag) mice that express tagged RNA-binding proteins in a single-cell type to study RNA regulation specifically in CA1 neurons combined with manual microdissection to isolate compartment-specific proteins and mRNAs. RNA profiling of subcellular CA1 compartments reveals that dendritic mRNAs are enriched for elongated 3′UTR isoforms and depleted for alternative splicing (AS) events driven by the neuronal splicing factor NOVA2, indicating a nuclear role in the generation of the localized transcriptome in CA1 neurons. Integrating compartment-specific cTag-FMRP-CLIP and TRAP defined FMRP CLIP scores in the dendrites and cell bodies of CA1 neurons and identified 383 FMRP-bound dendritic targets. This allowed us to distinguish FMRP targets according to their site of regulation within neurons, revealing enrichment of FMRP-regulated mRNAs encoding nuclear proteins in the CA1 cell bodies and mRNAs encoding synaptic proteins in the CA1 dendrites. Moreover, although mRNA localization is unaffected in FMRP KO mice, mRNAs encoding these synaptic proteins show altered localized ribosome association. Together, these findings support a model in which distinct patterns of both mRNA and FMRP subcellular localization enable FMRP to regulate the expression of different proteins within different compartments in a single neuronal cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification and characterization of the dendritic transcriptome in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vivo</title><p>We developed a system that allows for parallel isolation of mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins that are enriched in the cell bodies or dendrites specifically in excitatory CA1 neurons in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We created three CA1-specific protein-tagged mouse lines by crossing cTag mice with mice in which Cre recombinase expression is driven from the Camk2a promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsien, 1998</xref>). In these mice, Cre is expressed only in pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus. The cTag-PABP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>) and cTag-FMRP mice allow for Cre-dependent expression of GFP tagged polyA-binding protein c1 (PABPC1), , or FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van Driesche et al., 2019</xref>), respectively.

These layers contained material from pyramidal neurons (in which proteins of interest contain an affinity tag, green) and contaminating cell types (other colors). Microdissected compartments were subject to affinity purification in order to obtain pyramidal neuron-specific ribosomes or affinity-tagged RNA-binding proteins and bound mRNAs. In order to obtain the dendritic ribosome-bound transcriptome, TRAP-seq was performed from tagged ribosomes in the CA1 neuropil compartment. Compartment-specific cTag-PAPERCLIP was performed in order to determine mRNAs with 3′UTR isoforms that undergo differential localization, and compartment-specific FMRP regulation was determined by cTag FMRP-CLIP of the microdissected compartments.

For example, the <italic>Ankrd11</italic> transcript undergoes APA to express a short and long isoform, and only the long isoform is abundant on dendritic ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K</xref>). Interestingly, CA1 FMRP-CLIP tags were detected on the long, dendritic isoform, but only sparsely on the short isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, gray dashed boxes). To look at this phenomenon on a transcriptome-wide scale, we isolated exon junction reads in whole hippocampus CA1 FMRP-cTag-CLIP data. While the length of CLIP tags (20–100 nts) results in a low number of junction reads, we were able to confidently identify FMRP-CLIP tags covering 17 differentially abundant alternative splice events. For example, FMRP binding was largely absent on a shorter, CB-enriched isoform of the <italic>Cnksr2</italic> transcript, while robust binding was evident on the longer, dendritic 3′UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, gray dashed boxes). Of the 12 exon junction reads that originated from exon 20 of the <italic>Cnksr2</italic> transcript, 10 were derived from the long isoform, suggesting that approximately 80% of the FMRP-bound <italic>Cnksr2</italic> transcripts derived from the longer, dendritic isoform. This was especially striking since the shorter isoform was the predominant isoform in CA1 pyramidal neurons (~80% of exon junction reads in cell body TRAP belonged to the short isoform), indicating a high degree of selectivity of FMRP binding to this dendritic isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Globally, we compared the percent spliced in (PSI) values for the 17 detected alternative splice events detected in FMRP-CLIP with those in the CA1 cell body and neuropil TRAP data. This revealed that splicing events identified in FMRP-bound mRNAs show stronger correlation with PSI values determined in CA1 neuropil TRAP relative to cell body TRAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Hippocampal slices from cTag mice were crosslinked, microdissected into cell body and neuropil regions, and subjected to FMRP-CLIP using antibodies against GFP. This allowed purification of FMRP-bound RNA specifically in the CA1 cell bodies or dendrites. Across five biological replicates, we obtained 746,827 FMRP CA1-specific CLIP tags from the cell bodies and 80,749 tags from CA1 dendrites.

(<bold>F</bold>) Distinct, compartment-specific FMRP regulation of functionally distinct subsets of mRNAs in CA1 cell bodies and dendrites. Localization of mRNA to the dendrites does not appear to be FMRP-dependent in CA1 neurons, but likely depends on other factors (e.g., other RNA-binding proteins or mRNA characteristics such as GC content, length, or secondary structure) that target mRNAs to the dendrite or compartments within the neuronal soma. In dendrites, the absence of FMRP increases the ribosome association of its targets; this finding is consistent with a model in which FMRP inhibits ribosomal elongation and thereby translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>). In resting neurons, the translation of FMRP-bound mRNAs encoding synaptic regulators (FM2 and FM3 mRNAs) is repressed. When FMRP is not functioning, due to either genetic alteration (FMRP KO or FXS) or neuronal activity-dependent regulation (e.g., FMRP calcium-dependent dephosphorylation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bear et al., 2004</xref>), ribosome association and translation of targets are increased. In cell bodies, FMRP binds mRNAs that encode for chromatin regulators (the FM1 cluster of FMRP targets), as well as FM2/3 mRNAs (consistent with synapses forming on the cell soma). FM1 targets show patterns of mRNA regulation similar to what our group observed in bulk CA1 neurons: FMRP target abundance is decreased in FMRP KO cells, perhaps due to loss of FMRP-mediated block of degradation of mRNAs with stalled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darnell, 2020</xref>).

We estimated enrichment of the FM1-3 transcripts among all FMRP-bound, CA1-expressed transcripts ranked by their dendritic or cell bodies-specific FMRP CLIP score. FM2 and FM3 clusters were highly enriched in FMRP-bound mRNAs in both the dendrites and the cell bodies, while the FM1 cluster was strongly enriched among cell body-bound FMRP targets, but only weakly enriched among the dendritic FMRP-bound transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This suggests that FM2 and FM3 modules contain mRNAs that are directly bound and regulated by FMRP in dendrites, and the FM1 cluster contains highly bound FMRP targets in the cell bodies, indicating distinct, biologically coherent regulation.</p><p>We further utilized compartment-specific FMRP-CLIP scores to identify functional modules of ASD candidate mRNAs subject to compartment-specific FMRP regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1J</xref>). One module, AM2, contains transcripts enriched for glutamate signaling, learning, and memory, and is bound by FMRP in both the dendrites and cell bodies. The AM1 module consists of genes involved in chromatin modification and is highly enriched among mRNAs bound by FMRP in the cell bodies, but is not significantly enriched among dendritic FMRP-bound mRNAs. Taken together these observations suggest the possibility of compartmentalized roles for FMRP, in which mRNAs important for synaptic signaling are bound and regulated by FMRP near the synapses, while mRNAs bound by FMRP in the cell bodies are involved in the regulation of neuronal gene expression through chromatin regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>FMRP regulates the ribosome association of its targets in dendrites</title><p>To better understand FMRP-dependent regulation of dendritic mRNAs, we examined the dendritic ribosome-bound transcriptome in FMRP KO animals. We performed bulk RNA-seq and cell-type-specific TRAP on microdissected hippocampi from WT and FMRP KO littermates. Bulk RNA-seq of microdissected material in FMRP WT and KO mice showed no overall change in the localization of FMRP targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, left panel). In addition, the mRNAs found to be dendrite-present and dendrite-enriched in KO animals (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1K</xref>) show large overlap with those in WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). We validated this finding by FISH in FMRP KO mouse brain slices and found no evidence for altered localization of FMRP targets into the neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>). Global analysis of 3′UTR usage differences in TRAP between dendrites and cell bodies in FMRP KO and WT animals also showed no significant (FDR &lt; 0.05) instances of dysregulated localization of 3′UTR isoforms in FMRP KO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

Interestingly, this was evident for FM2/3, but not FM1 transcripts. While FMRP targets are generally downregulated in TRAP from hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>), a finding that we replicate in cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>), transcripts that encode synaptic regulatory proteins (FM2/3), which are bound by FMRP in the dendrites, show increased ribosome association in CA1 dendrites of KO animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These results suggest a model in which FMRP differentially regulates translation of functionally distinct mRNAs in specific neuronal compartments (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent advances in cell-type-specific transcriptomic approaches have greatly increased the resolution at which we understand gene expression in the nervous system. Here, we build on these advances by incorporating compartment-specific CLIP and TRAP in order to define (1) a high-quality, cell-type-specific transcriptome of CA1 neuronal cell bodies and dendrites in vivo, (2) FMRP-bound mRNAs in dendrites, and (3) compartment-specific FMRP regulation of its targets. We found subcellular differences in the sets of alternatively spliced or polyadenylated transcripts in each compartment, connecting pre-mRNA nuclear regulation to subcellular localization in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Moreover, previously defined, directly bound FMRP targets are overrepresented in the dendritic transcriptome, and FMRP preferentially binds to these dendritic mRNA isoforms. We find that the ribosome association of dendritic FMRP targets is increased in FMRP-null mice, consistent with differential translational regulation between subcellular compartments. Distinct sets of FMRP-bound autism-related transcripts have been described, particularly those related to chromatin regulation and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>). Remarkably, we find here that these transcripts show different subcellular localization: transcripts encoding chromatin regulators are enriched in CA1 cell bodies, while those encoding synaptic regulators are enriched in their dendrites. Together, these observations indicate that RNA regulatory factors link post-transcriptional controls with local translation of RNA isoforms in neurons. The data support and extend a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darnell, 2020</xref>) in which FMRP integrates cellular activity and signaling to maintain neuronal homeostatic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>) by mediating differential translation of transcripts encoding nuclear and synaptic functions in the cell body and dendrite, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The CA1 dendritic transcriptome</title><p>Much effort has been put into molecular profiling of the localized transcriptome, translatome, and proteome using in vitro neuron or neuron-like cell models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zappulo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goering et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Middleton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taliaferro et al., 2016</xref>). In vivo systems, such as microdissection of hippocampal CA1 regions, offer the advantage of profiling neurons that have formed physiological levels of relevant connections with surrounding neurons. Although RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cajigas et al., 2012</xref>), 3-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tushev et al., 2018</xref>), and TRAP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainsley et al., 2014</xref>) have been performed previously for microdissected CA1 neuropil, these studies were either not performed using cell-type-specific approaches or unable to capture full-length mRNAs in resting neurons. As the mRNAs presented here are intact and relatively free of contaminating cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), this dataset can be used for definition of dendritic ribosome-bound mRNAs and for identification of differential usage of 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and alternative splice isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in CA1 neuropil and cell bodies compartments, making it a valuable dataset for the community.</p><p>Consistent with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tushev et al., 2018</xref>), we find that the majority of differentially localized 3′UTRs are longer than their sequestered counterparts, suggesting that APA events that lead to longer 3′UTR isoforms might allow inclusion of localization and regulatory elements, such as binding sites for RNA-binding proteins or AGO-miRNA complexes. Long 3′UTRs may also act to recruit binding partners for nascent proteins, which can affect the function and/or localization of the protein, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berkovits and Mayr, 2015</xref>). Future experiments analyzing compartment-specific cTag-CLIP of RNA-binding proteins that bind to 3′UTRs such as AGO, Staufen, NOVA1/2, or ELAVL2/3/4 will provide further insight into the role of these 3′UTRs in mRNA localization and local translation.</p><p>In addition to a role for 3′UTR-APA in RNA localization and regulation, we find that 20% of differentially localized 3′UTRs result from APA events that impact the CDS. This finding underscores the possibility that differential mRNA localization may be linked to expression of functionally distinct protein isoforms generated during nuclear processing. This is further supported by our observation of AS events that result in differentially localized mRNA alternatively spliced isoforms, which has not been reported previously. We found that NOVA2, a neuron-specific splicing factor, is responsible for the generation of splicing isoforms that are sequestered to the neuronal cell bodies of CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). NOVA1 and NOVA2 are examples of a relatively small number of mammalian splicing factors demonstrated to directly bind to pre-mRNA and thereby regulate AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang and Darnell, 2011</xref>) and also bind 3′ UTRs of those same transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eom et al., 2013</xref>). For example, in the case of GlyRa2, NOVA proteins co-localize with the transcript in the nucleus to regulate exon 3A splicing and in neuronal dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Racca et al., 2010</xref>). These findings further underscore the many ways in which RNA-binding proteins contribute to neuronal complexity in specific subcellular compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>FMRP binds dendritic mRNAs</title><p>The significant overlap between CA1 FMRP targets and dendrite-enriched mRNAs supports literature indicating that FMRP regulates a significant portion of the dendritic transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bagni and Zukin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu-Yesucevitz et al., 2011</xref>). We do not find a role for FMRP in the localization of its targets in CA1 neurons, as demonstrated in our comparison of FMRP WT and KO brain. However, overall FMRP-binding affinity (defined by FMRP-CLIP scores in hippocampal neurons) correlates with relative dendritic abundance of a given mRNA (i.e., the enrichment of mRNAs in the neuropil over the cell body, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), indicating a strong preference for FMRP binding on dendritic mRNA isoforms. This suggests the possibility that FMRP and localized mRNAs may be co-transported into the dendrites. It is also possible that FMRP may play a role in localization of its targets in other neuronal cell types, as has been suggested in radial glia from developing mouse brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pilaz et al., 2016</xref>). Future studies dissecting compartment-specific regulation of FMRP targets in cell-type systems such as these will be very informative.</p><p>Interestingly, through analysis of whole-cell cTag FMRP-CLIP data, we find multiple instances of FMRP selectively binding to specific dendritic isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A striking example is the case of the <italic>Cnksr2</italic> gene, which generates a short, sequestered mRNA and a longer, highly localized isoform. The protein encoded from the dendritic mRNA isoform contains an additional PDZ-binding domain that is not present in the shorter isoform. <italic>Cnksr2</italic> has been identified in genome-wide association studies as an ASD candidate, and mutations in this gene have been shown to cause epilepsy and intellectual disability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aypar et al., 2015</xref>). In the cell body compartment, the shorter isoform is predominant, which can be seen by both PAPERCLIP and TRAP. However, FMRP-CLIP, which generally binds the CDS and at least the proximal 3′UTR regions of its targets, shows predominant binding on the 3′UTR of a minor isoform in the presence of a more highly expressed, shorter, sequestered mRNA isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similar trends can be seen with a number of other mRNAs such as <italic>Ankrd11</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and <italic>Anks1b</italic> (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that FMRP can display binding preferences both on different transcripts and different isoforms generated from a single gene. This finding adds an additional layer to the already-complicated process of how FMRP recognizes and binds its targets and suggests that FMRP binding specificity may rely on localization-determining events in the nucleus, such as deposition of RNA-binding proteins on the 3′UTRs of alternatively spliced transcripts.</p><p>FMRP binding to dendritic mRNA isoforms may also be a result of events that occur in the cytoplasm. For example, some mRNAs with longer 3′UTRs themselves may possess great propensity for entrance into FMRP-containing transport granules due simply to length. This would be consistent with observations that long mRNAs are preferentially found in stress granules due to lower translation efficiency and increased ability for RNA-RNA interactions to form, which are thought to stabilize RNA granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khong et al., 2017</xref>). This suggestion is also supported by findings that FMRP is found in neuronal mRNA transport granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dictenberg et al., 2008</xref>) and is known to bind to RNA structural elements such as kissing complexes and G-quadruplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darnell et al., 2005</xref>), and support suggestions for a role for FMRP in maintaining the translationally repressed status of long mRNAs in transport granules.</p><p>Although previous work has proposed a role for the interaction between G-quadruplexes and the RGG domain of the FMRP protein in mRNA localization in an in vitro system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goering et al., 2020</xref>), we did not find enrichment of G-quadruplexes in the 3′UTRs of dendritic FMRP targets when compared to dendritic non-FMRP targets. This is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell et al., 2011</xref>) that direct FMRP binding occurs primarily on CDS and proximal 3′UTR portions of its targets without observable sequence specificity. This discrepancy could be the result of cell-type-specific functions of FMRP or may indicate that FMRP-directed regulation of G-quadruplex-containing mRNAs is not the result of stable binding of FMRP to these sequences.</p><p>We present here a list of mRNAs that are highly bound to FMRP in the dendrites of CA1 neurons. These 383 targets are significantly enriched in the dendrites and were found to have high FMRP CLIP scores in whole CA1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), indicating higher than expected FMRP binding relative to other mRNAs of similar transcript abundance. Dendritic FMRP targets were determined by combining compartment-specific CLIP and TRAP experiments to determine compartment-specific FMRP CLIP scores. Importantly, these targets are the result of stringent filtering to include only high-confidence, experimentally defined dendritic FMRP targets.</p><p>Moreover, we bioinformatically extended our findings using compartment-specific FMRP CLIP scores to identify functional clusters of previously identified FMRP targets that are differentially abundant in the dendrites in respect to CA1 cell bodies. We find a remarkable link between the function of the protein product of a given FMRP target mRNA and its subcellular localization. The FM1 cluster, which contains FMRP target transcripts encoding proteins with nuclear functions such as histone modification and chromosome organization, is enriched in CA1 cell bodies. Approximately 10% of mRNAs encoding chromatin modifiers in CA1 neurons are FMRP targets. In contrast, FM2 and FM3 FMRP target mRNAs, which encode for proteins with synaptic functions such as ion transport, receptor signaling, and cell polarity, are found in both cell bodies and dendrites. Approximately 15–20% of CA1 mRNA encoding synaptic genes are members of the FM2 and FM3 clusters of FMRP targets. Together, these results indicate highly specific FMRP targeting of these two biologically coherent subgroups of targets in two distinct neuronal compartments, suggesting differential translation of chromatin transcripts in the cell body and synaptic-related transcripts in dendrites, and potentially where axonal synapses make contacts in the cell soma.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Compartment-specific regulation of FMRP targets</title><p>Interestingly, mRNAs from genes in the FM2 and FM3 clusters show increased ribosome association in the FMRP KO mouse in a pattern distinct from the FM1 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Bulk RNA-seq on the same compartments, as well as FISH on FMRP KO mouse brain, showed that overall FMRP targets levels were largely unchanged in abundance or localization in the neuropil. This suggests that in the absence of FMRP, while transcripts that are normally FMRP targets can still be localized to dendrites, they have an increased ribosome association. This supports the proposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2008</xref>) that FMRP in the neuronal processes may exist in a polyribosome-depleted granule, which is altered to become translationally competent upon neuronal activity. It is also consistent with the role of FMRP as a translational suppressor and detection of increased basal translation rates in mouse models of Fragile X syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gross et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we suggest a model in which FMRP specifically binds mRNAs that encode synaptic proteins and are fated for dendritic localization and maintains them in a translationally repressed, and potentially polyribosome-depleted state for transport into the processes. Further, within the dendrite, our findings in FMRP-null mice are consistent with a role for neuronal activity to induce polyribosome formation and local translation (and concomitant increased polyribosome density) of its specific targets in dendrites. This may be through activity-dependent removal of FMRP from its targets, for example, by dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Narayanan et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Future experiments investigating how dendritic FMRP binding changes upon neuronal activity will help to elucidate the precise role of FMRP in regulation of activity-dependent local translation in dendrites.</p><p>We have previously shown in bulk CA1 neurons that FMRP target mRNAs are destabilized in the absence of FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>). Earlier work also suggested that FMRP targets as a group are downregulated in the absence of FMRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thomson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ceolin et al., 2017</xref>), and some evidence can be seen for translational activation of individual mRNAs. Our TRAP in CA1 cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4A</xref>) is consistent with this data, and with the proposal that the absence of FMRP leads to an overall decrease in steady-state mRNA abundance of its targets. We detect downregulation of both transcripts encoding chromatin regulators (FM1) and synaptic regulators (FM2/3) in the cell bodies in the absence of FMRP. We hypothesize that FMRP may act to protect mRNAs with stalled ribosomes from degradation, suggesting a role for FMRP in stabilization of translationally stalled mRNAs. A similar model has been proposed following the finding that the abundance of codon-optimized FMRP targets is decreased in FMRP KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Richter and Zhao, 2021</xref>). It is reasonable to suspect that loss of FMRP may lead to an increase in translation in the cell body, as seen in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greenblatt and Spradling, 2018</xref>); however, TRAP does not allow for quantitation of ribosome occupancy, so we could not detect these changes using this method. Downregulation of steady-state mRNA levels in cell bodies in the absence of FMRP could also relate to homeostatic feedback on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darnell, 2020</xref>). However, in the dendrites we suggest that this pathway is either not present or is decreased in steady-state neurons, such that the absence of FMRP is seen as increased ribosome association of FMRP targets encoding synaptic regulators (FM2/3) and thus translational regulation of these mRNAs predominates in dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>An emerging theme in the study of FMRP is that not all targets are regulated in the same manner. Ribosome profiling and RNA-seq in FMRP KO cells in vitro identified distinct groups of FMRP targets whose localization and translation is regulated by the RGG- and KH- domains of the FMRP protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goering et al., 2020</xref>). Extensive ribosome profiling and RNA-seq in mouse brains showed functionally distinct groups of FMRP targets for which loss of FMRP leads to changes in either mRNA levels or translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shah et al., 2020</xref>). Our work suggests that subcellular localization of FMRP targets may be a critical factor in these distinct modes of FMRP-mediated regulation. Further, we present three functionally distinct clusters of CA1 FMRP targets and suggest that the cluster that contains chromatin regulators (FM1) are specifically regulated in the cell bodies, whereas synaptic regulators (FM2/3) are regulated in both compartments.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate the ability to utilize compartment- and cell-type-specific RNA profiling technologies to precisely define the dendritic transcriptome. Our results underscore the role of FMRP as an important regulator of dendritic mRNAs, playing an important function in ribosome association of isoform-specific dendritic targets and local translational control. This finding, coupled with the identification of FM1 chromatin-associated transcripts regulated by FMRP exclusively in the cell bodies, supports the hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darnell, 2020</xref>) that FMRP acts as a sensor for neuronal activity through actions on both neuronal transcription and synaptic activity. Further studies into how these subsets of mRNAs are differentially FMRP-regulated in a subcellular compartment-specific manner will have important implications in the understanding of how dysregulation of FMRP and its targets leads to intellectual disability and ASD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>Mus musculus</italic> C57BL6/J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.Cg-Tg(Camk2a-cre)T29-1Stl/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:005359">IMSR_JAX:005359</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Referred to as Camk2a-Cre</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>M. musculus</italic> C57BL6/J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6N.129-Rpl22tm1.1<break/>Psam/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:011029">IMSR_JAX:011029</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Referred to as RiboTag</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background(<italic>M. musculus</italic> C57BL6/J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.129P2-Fmr1tm1Cgr/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from W.T.

RNA was collected by standard Trizol (Invitrogen) extraction via the manufacturer’s protocol and quantified with RiboGreen Quant-IT assays (Invitrogen). Bulk RNA-seq samples were treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) prior to library preparation. RNA was further purified for polyadenylated RNA by using Dynabeads mRNA Purification Kit (Ambion). The libraries were prepared by TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

After perfusion, animals were decapitated and intact brains removed and postfixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C. Brains were then transferred to PBS with 15% sucrose for 24 hr followed by PBS with 30% sucrose for a further 24 hr and then embedded and frozen in OCT medium. 12 μm coronal slices were prepared using a Leica CM3050 S cryostat and directly adhered to Fisherbrand 1.0 mm superfrost slides (Cat # 12-550-15) and stored at –80°C until use. FISH was performed using the RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent Kit v2 as recommended for fixed frozen tissue, with some exceptions. For pretreatment of samples prior to hybridization, slides were baked at 60°C for 45 min, followed by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4°C for 90 min. Samples were dehydrated in ethanol (50, 70, and 100% twice each) and incubated at room temperature before hydrogen peroxide treatment for 10–20 min, followed by target retrieval as recommended. After probe hybridization, samples were washed three times for 15 min in wash buffer heated to 37°C. Probes used were conjugated with Alexa fluorescein (488 nm), Alexa Cyanine 3 (555 nm), and Alexa Cyanine5 (647 nm). RNAscope probes were designed to recognize unique 3′UTR sequences (for UR-APA events) or for common and distal 3′UTRs (for UTR-APA events) with at least 500–1000 nts between regions.

Objective: Zeiss Plan 63 × 1.4 NA Apochromat oil immersion; imaging at this objective was performed using Immersol 518F immersion media (ne = 1.518 [23°C]; Carl Zeiss). Acquisition parameters include laser lines 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, and 633 nm (laser power adjusted until relative power for each line eliminates as much background as possible without diminishing signal). Emission filter for Airyscan detection: 405ch, BP 420–480+ BP 495–620; 488ch, BP 420–480 + 495-550; 561ch, BP 420–480 + 495-620; 633ch, BP 570–620+ LP645. Settings: eight bit-depth and acquired with image size: 135.0 × 135.0 µm; pixel size: 0.14 µm (step size is 0.159 using a piezo stage). All raw image data was sent directly to ZEN 2.3 software for reconstruction. Files underwent Airyscan processing (parameters: auto strength at 6 for 3D images) before being stitched at a normalized cross-correlation threshold set at 7. Processed and stitched .czi files were converted to .ims files using Imaris File Converter x64 9.6.0 before being uploaded into Imaris x64 9.6. Spots were quantified using the spot counting operation (Imaris software) with the default values and modifying the spot detection parameters (‘Model PSF-elongation along Z-axis’: estimated XY diameter: 0.8 μm; estimated Z diameter: 1.4 μm). Detection threshold was adjusted manually until all false/weak signals were eliminated. The mRNA coordinates (X, Y, Z) were downloaded for bioinformatic analysis. Max projections exported from Imaris were uploaded in Fiji. Images were adjusted to eight-bit, orientation is adjusted, and channels are separated. For detection of nuclei for bioinformatic analysis, threshold was adjusted until the majority of the DAPI stain was detected and applied. ‘Analyze particles’ operation was applied with the settings size 50-infinity (pixel units); circularity 0.0–1.0; show ‘masks.’ Resulting text image files were used for downstream analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Compartment-specific cTag FMRP-CLIP</title><p>Microdissection of hippocampal slices from 5 to 8 adult Camk2a-FMRP-cTag mice was performed as described above, except that the slices were UV crosslinked in HBSS with 0.1 mg/mL cycloheximide three times using 400 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> after sectioning and before microdissection.

Dendrite-enriched mRNAs used the same filters, but also required an FDR of CA1 neuropil vs. cell bodies of less than 0.05.

For prediction of the location of the cell body layer in each image, nuclei and spot-containing pixels were identified and converted into scatterplots in R. Scatterplots were sliced into 25 vertical slices, and the density of each slice was plotted in order to identify the location of the bottom of the cell body layer in each slice. These points were subject to two rounds of polynomial curve fitting, with outliers removed manually between the two rounds. The predicted distance between each FISH spot and the cell body was determined using the distance between the spot and the fitted curve. For <italic>t</italic>-tests, spots were considered to be in the neuropil if they were more than 10 µmfrom the predicted line. Changes in distribution were also assessed using Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">3</xref>, 1000 spots were samples from each picture, and the spots were binned into 15 bins according to their distance from the cell bodies layer.

From whole-cell PAPERCLIP datasets, peaks were considered that had 10 or more tags and represented 5% or more of the tags on that gene. For microdissected PAPERCLIP datasets, any peaks that had tags in more than one neuropil PAPERCLIP experiment were considered. Splice junctions were identified in both whole-cell and micro-dissected TRAP samples. Splice junctions were considered if they were found in 10 reads or if they represented 10% of total junction reads for that gene. Using the GenomicRanges package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>), the upstream splice junction was identified for each PAPERCLIP site, and the downstream PAPERCLIP site was identified for each splice junction. Percentage of covered bases for these potential 3′UTRs was determined using bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) and only those with 80% coverage in any single experiment were considered in downstream analyses. Next, ambiguous genes and 3′UTRs that overlapped other genes/UTR were eliminated. This yields all expressed final exons. Genes with multiple 3′UTRs were selected and used for counting of reads from microdissected TRAP-seq samples using featureCounts, followed by DEXSeq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2012</xref>) to identify differentially localized 3′UTRs. For 3′UTR usage analysis in KO animals, the expressed 3′UTRs identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were used, and reads aligning to each 3′UTR in WT and KO cell bodies and CA1 neuropil TRAP were quantitated using featureCounts as above.

To find G-quadruplex motifs, the regular expression &quot;[AU]GGA(.{0,6})[AU]GGA(.{0,6})[AU]GGA(.{0,6})[AU]GGA&quot; was searched for in the 3′UTR of CA1 mRNA sequences using the gregexpr function in R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-7"><title>Compartment-specific CLIP</title><p>CLIP tags were processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref> for FMRP-CLIP and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hwang et al., 2017</xref> for cTag-PAPERCLIP). Briefly, for FMRP-CLIP, tags were mapped to the transcriptome using the transcript with the highest expression for each gene as determined by whole-cell Camk2a-TRAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>). For cTag-PAPERCLIP, tags were mapped to the genome and polyadenylation sites were determined by clusters called using the CTK software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shah et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-8"><title>Calling dendritic FMRP targets</title><p>Counts of FMRP-CLIP tags mapped to transcripts were normalized first for transcript length and then by sequencing depth (scaled to 10,000 tags) in order to generate length and library size normalized CLIP expression values for each transcript. mRNAs were determined to be dendritic FMRP targets if they fit one of two criteria: (1) if they were reproducibly detected in cTag-FMRP-CLIP on the neuropil (&gt;5 normalized tags per 10,000 in at least 3 of 5 replicates, 287 genes) or (2) if they had a mean compartment-specific CLIP score &gt;1 (241 genes). See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1G</xref> for CLIP scores and CLIP expression information. CLIP scores were determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>), with a few exceptions to account for low numbers of dendritic CLIP tags. All CLIP tags that map along the length of CA1 mRNAs were used for analysis. CLIP expression scores were calculated by dividing CLIP tags by transcript length, followed by normalization for library depth. TPMs for TRAP-seq were determined by the tximport package from pseudocounts obtained from salmon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Soneson et al., 2015</xref>). For each CLIP replicate and compartment, TRAP TPMs were plotted against CLIP expression scores with a TRAP TPM &gt; 1 and FMRP-CLIP tags in three or more replicates. Linear models were determined, and mean CLIP scores were calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sawicka et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-9"><title>Functional clustering of FMRP targets</title><p>Functional module detection implemented within the HumanBase software was used to determine functional clusters of previously defined CA1 FMRP targets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/module/">https://hb.flatironinstitute.org/module/</ext-link>). Compartment-specific FMRP CLIP scores were determined essentially as described above, except without filtering for reproducibly detected mRNAs in order to maximize the number of genes included in the analysis. For GSEA, CA1 mRNAs were ranked by compartment-specific FMRP CLIP scores. GSEA was performed using the fgsea package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korotkevich et al., 2021</xref>) using the gene lists from module detection as pathways.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mouse procedures were conducted according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines at the Rockefeller University using protocol numbers 14678, 17013 and 20028.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Tables used in this study.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dendrite-present mRNAs results of DESeq2 analysis. ‘Neuropil_vs_CB’ indicates results of CA1 neuropil/CA1 cell bodies TRAP comparison, ‘TRAP_vs_RNAseq’ indicates results of CA1 neuropil TRAP/CA1 neuropil RNAseq comparison. ‘CrePos_vs_CreNeg’ indicates results of Camk2a-Cre-positive CA1 neuropil TRAP/Camk2a-Cre-negative CA1 neuropil TRAP comparison.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Robert Singer as Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Young Yoon (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Two key experiments are needed to support the claim that FMRP plays a role in localization, which is only correlative from the data shown. First is to perform quantitative analysis of FMRP target mRNA localization in dendrites from WT vs. Fmr1 KO mice. A second additional key validation experiment is to show that 1 or 2 mRNAs with high levels of FMRP-CLIP reads, for example, specific 3'UTR isoforms, are sufficient to promote mRNA localization to distal compartments of neurons using fluorescent reporters, as a standard method. This would add new biology. On the computational analysis side, the authors should assess if G-quadruplexes are enriched in their dendritic transcriptome datasets, consistent with a recent paper in <italic>eLife</italic> on the role of FMRP interactions with G-quadruplexes in mRNA localization (Goering et al., 2020). This topic is not addressed. The authors previously published a paper that dismissed the roles of 3'UTR and instead revealed that FMRP interacts promiscuously mostly along coding sequences to stall ribosomes and repress translation of autism linked mRNAs (Darnell et al., Cell 2011). The present data sets need to be overlapped and compared to their previous paper to identify relationships or lack thereof. Lastly is an important issue of whether or not there are consensus motifs for FMRP binding as suggested by several recent bioinformatics studies. This topic can be addressed and would add new biology to the present study on how FMRP achieves selectivity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Despite the fact that FMRP targets are overrepresented in the dendritic transcriptome, it does not appear from this study that FMRP plays an active role in the mechanism of dendritic mRNA localization, at least under steady state conditions. One goal of the manuscript is to address a major question in the mRNA localization field, which is how FMRP may differentially modulate &quot;localization&quot; of functional classes of mRNAs such as those encoding transcriptional regulators and synaptic plasticity genes (Line 78-90). The data here indicate that FMRP directly interacts with functional classes of mRNAs in different cellular compartments, which has previously been shown in the field. However, no evidence is provided that mechanistically reveal a role for FMRP to promote subcellular localization of different functional classes of mRNAs. The correlative evidence presented in this manner does not add mechanistic insight. The authors can strengthen the manuscript by providing additional experimental evidence and/or computational analysis.

The analysis and presentation of Figure 7 needs more depth to better tie together the role of FMRP in dendritic mRNA regulation and isoform regulation. Figure 7 needs to show the data in the same format as earlier figures.

First is to perform quantitative analysis of FMRP target mRNA localization in dendrites from WT vs. Fmr1 KO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>While we have now looked in detail for a role for FMRP in localization, both in response to Reviewer’s suggestions and to some degree in our initial submission, we explicitly do not find evidence for such a role. This conclusion rests on undertaking the suggested experiments, most importantly quantitative RNA analysis (FISH, RNA-seq and TRAP-Seq) of FMRP target localization in dendrites of WT and FMRP KO mouse brain. We now include supplements to Figure 7 (supplements 2 and 3), which shows data from experiments performing FISH on FMRP WT and KO mouse brain slices. We performed global analysis of 3’UTR usage in FMRP WT/KO, similar to Figure 2. We also analyzed FMRP targets whose mRNAs were found to be dendrite-enriched in our studies (and now present this data for Kmt2d, Lrrc7 and Map2 in Figure 7 – supplement 2), and find no significant differences in mRNA localization in FMRP KO mouse brain slices in these studies.</p><p>We also searched for but did not find evidence for changes in differential 3’UTR isoform usage in the two compartments in FMRP KO mice. Globally, analysis of all 3’UTRs revealed no significant change in usage between FMRP KO and WT animals (Figure 7 – supplement 3A). We validated these by FISH for two genes (Cnksr2 and Anks1b) which are FMRP targets that produce 3’UTR isoforms that are differentially bound by FMRP and localized to the dendrites (Figure 7 – supplement 3). In sum, do not find any evidence for significant dysregulation of mRNA localization in these genes in FMRP KO mice (Figure 7 – supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second additional key validation experiment is to show that 1 or 2 mRNAs with high levels of FMRP-CLIP reads, for example, specific 3'UTR isoforms, are sufficient to promote mRNA localization to distal compartments of neurons using fluorescent reporters, as a standard method.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the results found in Figure 7 – supplements 2 and 3 which indicate that FMRP does not play a role in localization of mRNAs in the CA1 region but rather is involved in regulation of their translation, we do not believe these studies are warranted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This would add new biology. On the computational analysis side, the authors should assess if G-quadruplexes are enriched in their dendritic transcriptome datasets, consistent with a recent paper in eLife on the role of FMRP interactions with G-quadruplexes in mRNA localization (Goering et al., 2020). This topic is not addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this omission, and have performed this analysis and present the results in detail below in the response to Reviewer 1 and in the new Figure 4 – supplement 1 in the manuscript. To summarize, we do not find evidence in our data of G-quadruplexes (either experimentally-defined or G-quadruplex motifs) playing a role in determination of FMRP binding in CA1 dendrites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors previously published a paper that dismissed the roles of 3'UTR and instead revealed that FMRP interacts promiscuously mostly along coding sequences to stall ribosomes and repress translation of autism linked mRNAs (Darnell et al., Cell 2011). The present data sets need to be overlapped and compared to their previous paper to identify relationships or lack thereof. Lastly is an important issue of whether or not there are consensus motifs for FMRP binding as suggested by several recent bioinformatics studies. This topic can be addressed and would add new biology to the present study on how FMRP achieves selectivity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and acknowledge that the question of how FMRP recognizes its targets is highly interesting and elusive. However, in this work, consistent with our previous work presenting FMRP-CLIP on both whole brain (J. C. Darnell et al., 2011) and in CA1 neurons (Sawicka et al., 2019), we find FMRP binding patterns that are consistent with FMRP coating the CDS and proximal 3’UTR sequences of its targets. We do not see reliable, reproducible evidence for “peaks” like those present in CLIP experiments on RNA-binding proteins that exhibit sequencing-specific binding patterns. Therefore it is not possible to generate specific sequences where FMRP seems to be binding for input into motif analyses programs, and any motif analysis performed on FMRP CLIP tag sequences themselves would likely reflect the nature of the mRNAs themselves (i.e. GC-content, codon-optimality) and not give information about specificity of FMRP binding.</p><p>In addition, our previous cell-type specific FMRP-CLIP experiments have been on bulk neuronal material (Sawicka et al. 2019; Van Driesche et al., n.d.). Although cell-type specific TRAP-seq has been performed on microdissected CA1 compartments (Ainsley et al. 2014), investigators were unable to isolate significant amounts of RNA from resting neurons, and degradation of the isolated RNAs did not allow the types of 3’UTR and alternative splicing analyses that were performed here. The Schuman group has performed extensive analysis of mRNAs from microdissected CA1 compartments (Cajigas et al. 2012a; Tushev et al. 2018), but have not performed FMRP-CLIP or any experiments using cell-type specific or direct protein-RNA regulatory methods. In vitro systems have been used to analyze mRNA localization in FMRP KO systems (i.e. (Goering et al. 2020)), but in vitro systems are unable to fully recapitulate the complexities of in vivo brain regions, and did not analyze direct RNA-protein interactions. As our work is on in vivo brain slices, is cell-type specific, and integrates TRAP-seq, PAPERCLIP and CLIP-seq datasets, we believe that our work is novel and will be of great interest to the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Despite the fact that FMRP targets are overrepresented in the dendritic transcriptome, it does not appear from this study that FMRP plays an active role in the mechanism of dendritic mRNA localization, at least under steady state conditions. One goal of the manuscript is to address a major question in the mRNA localization field, which is how FMRP may differentially modulate “localization” of functional classes of mRNAs such as those encoding transcriptional regulators and synaptic plasticity genes (Line 78-90). The data here indicate that FMRP directly interacts with functional classes of mRNAs in different cellular compartments, which has previously been shown in the field. However, no evidence is provided that mechanistically reveal a role for FMRP to promote subcellular localization of different functional classes of mRNAs. The correlative evidence presented in this manner does not add mechanistic insight. The authors can strengthen the manuscript by providing additional experimental evidence and/or computational analysis. Related to this, it is unclear how the authors reconcile the data in Figure 7E with their overarching model that increased levels of FMRP binding actively promote mRNA localization, as suggested by Figure 5 and 6. However, the data in Figure 7E indicate that mRNA localization is not perturbed in the absence of FMRP.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point, and have provided the suggested analyses. As discussed above, our data does not suggest a role for FMRP in mRNA localization, but rather a preference for FMRP binding to localized mRNA isoforms and a role for FMRP in regulating ribosome association in the dendrites. We detailed above the changes to the manuscript that address this issue.</p><p>Nonetheless, we did do additional experimental and computational analysis to strengthen the paper overall and specifically with respect to a role for FMRP in localization. Additional experimental analyses now included in the paper include FISH, and computational analysis includes detailed analysis of the dendritic transcriptome of FMRP KO animals and G-quadruplex studies, as above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further related to a role of FMRP in mRNA localization, a recent paper in eLife reports that FMRP RGG box promotes mRNA localization of a set of FMRP targets through G-quadruplexes (Goering et al., 2020).

Importantly, as discussed above, we do not see major differences in the dendrite-enriched or dendrite-present lists when called on FMRP WT vs KO animals, and we don’t see altered distribution of 3’UTR isoforms.

We address this in several ways. First, we supplement TRAP data with PAPER-CLIP data, which captures all polyadenylated CA1 transcripts, independent of whether they are ribosome-bound. PolyA-bound mRNA data is concordant with TRAP data, suggesting that the two are largely overlapping (Figure 2 – supplement 1). We now discuss this more clearly in the manuscript, and also present results for both bulk RNA-seq and TRAP in Figure 7 as requested by the Reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some additional discussion and evaluation of relevant literature is needed to explain what aspects fit or do not fit with the proposed model.

Most importantly, we now clearly find that FMRP is binding different mRNAs in the CA1 cell body and dendritic layers, and suggest that FMRP-mediated regulation results in different outcomes in the cell bodies and dendrites of CA1 neurons.

In order to better represent our findings, we have revised our model figure to give a more mechanism view of the different modes of FMRP regulation in the two compartments, and have also added an additional section in the Discussion that ties together our previous work, other work in the field and the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should discuss and compare other data obtained with TRAP-Seq in Fmr1 KO (Thompson et al., Neuron 2017).</p><p>– The authors should discuss how TRAP-Seq analysis compares to ribosome profiling in Fmr1 KO to infer different types of FMRP dependent mechanisms of localization and translational control (Goering et al., 2020; Greenblatt et al., Science 2018) as well as mRNA stability (Shu et al., PNAS 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion, and agree that our manuscript would benefit from more context between our work and other groups. We address this in two ways. First, we have revised our model figure in order to better detail the different outcomes of FMRP regulation in the two compartments, with the results in the cell bodies being similar to those found for whole-cell experiments in other works (i.e. Thomson, Coelin, Shu). No subcellular compartment-specific CLIP or ribosome profiling in FMRP WT or KO animals has been performed, making our work novel and of great importance to the field.
