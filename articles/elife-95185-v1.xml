protein (BMP) signalling and has thereby been identified as a potential therapeutic target. Using rat in vivo and human in vitro and ex vivo model systems of MASH fibrosis, we show that neutralisation of Gremlin-1 activity with monoclonal therapeutic antibodies does not reduce liver inflammation or liver fibrosis. Still, Gremlin-1 was upregulated in human and rat MASH fibrosis, but expression was restricted to a small subpopulation of COL3A1/THY1<sup>+</sup> myofibroblasts. Lentiviral overexpression of Gremlin-1 in LX-2 cells and primary hepatic stellate cells led to changes in BMP-related gene expression, which did not translate to increased fibrogenesis. Furthermore, we show that Gremlin-1 binds to heparin with high affinity, which prevents Gremlin-1 from entering systemic circulation, prohibiting Gremlin-1-mediated organ crosstalk. Overall, our findings suggest a redundant role for Gremlin-1 in the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis, which is unamenable to therapeutic targeting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bone morphogenetic proteins</kwd><kwd>Gremlin-1</kwd><kwd>liver fibrosis</kwd><kwd>metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease</kwd><kwd>metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis</kwd><kwd>NAFLD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Novo Nordisk A/S</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horn</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Lalor</surname><given-names>Patricia F</given-names></name><name><surname>Weston</surname><given-names>Chris J</given-names></name><name><surname>Newsome</surname><given-names>Philip N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Antibody-mediated neutralisation of Gremlin-1 was ineffective in treating fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitits, likely due to low hepatic expression in a subset of myofibroblasts and redundant Gremlin-1 signalling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is aetiologically closely linked to insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome, and in parallel with the rise in obesity is becoming the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, affecting about 20–30% of the population in western countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Younossi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Younossi et al., 2018</xref>). It is characterised by hepatocellular lipid accumulation and, through multiple mechanisms, can progress to inflammation of the liver (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis [MASH]) and subsequent fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Powell et al., 2021</xref>). Liver fibrosis has been identified as the predominant factor determining patient prognosis, and higher stages are associated with liver-related events such as liver failure or the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as extrahepatic events such as cardiovascular disease, extrahepatic cancer, or endocrinological complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Gremlin-1 is a protein that is mainly expressed in fibroblasts and stem cells, and has been linked to fibrosis in a number of organs, including the kidney, lung, pancreas, and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Church et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Staloch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duffy et al., 2021</xref>). It acts mainly via inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling by direct binding and inactivation of BMPs 2, 4, and 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Topol et al., 2000</xref>), whilst some have reported actions on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and monocyte migration inhibitory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mitola et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). Gremlin-1 forms dimers and avidly binds to glycosaminoglycans such as heparin and heparan sulphate, although the latter is not necessary for its interaction with BMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tatsinkam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kišonaitė et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tatsinkam et al., 2015</xref>). In the liver, expression is generally low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gustafson et al., 2015</xref>) and restricted to activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which are the main fibrogenic cell population in the liver along with fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogawa et al., 2007</xref>). Hepatic Gremlin-1 has been linked to hepatocellular insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hedjazifar et al., 2020</xref>) and recent literature described a role in driving hepatocellular senescence, which in turn is linked to hepatic fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baboota et al., 2022</xref>). Previous evidence suggests that Gremlin-1 plays an active role in liver fibrosis by inhibiting the anti-fibrotic action of BMPs 4 and 7 on activated HSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). Systemic siRNA-mediated knockdown of Gremlin-1 downregulated hepatic TGFβ signalling and reduced fibrosis in a rat CCl<sub>4</sub> model of liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, adipose tissue dysfunction and inflammation are both important factors in the pathogenesis of MASLD and MASH fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gastaldelli and Cusi, 2019</xref>), and Gremlin-1 has been described to drive adipogenesis and adipocyte dysfunction in hypertrophic adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grillo et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>To date, the effects of therapeutic inhibition of Gremlin-1 in human liver fibrosis, and MASH in particular, have not been studied. Therefore, we aimed to further characterise the expression of Gremlin-1 in human and rodent MASH and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an anti-Gremlin-1-directed antibody treatment in rodent and human in vivo and ex vivo models of MASH fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hepatic Gremlin-1 is increased in human and rat MASH liver, localised to portal myofibroblasts</title><p>We aimed to determine Gremlin-1 expression in MASH and establish which, if any, cell types in the liver expressed Gremlin-1. <italic>GREM1</italic> was undetectable in healthy human liver by RNAscope in situ hybridisation (ISH) but staining increased in fibrotic MASH liver, localising to the fibrotic septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

Treatment of LX-2 cells with BMP4 also increased SMAD1 phosphorylation, which was prevented by the addition of Gremlin-1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), and anti-Gremlin-1 antibodies, but not isotype control, effectively restored SMAD1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, K<sub>D</sub> = 2.04–2.96 × 10<sup>–9</sup> M). Antibodies differed in their binding stoichiometries; the 0032:ND/0568:ND antibody formed complexes with Gremlin-1 dimers in a 2:2 ratio, whilst the 0030:HD compound bound Gremlin-1 predominantly in a 1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Antibodies had different effects with regards to heparin binding, indicated by the suffixes ‘HD’ for heparin-displacing and ‘ND’ for non-displacing antibodies.

Size exclusion chromatography on mixtures of Gremlin-1, heparin, and anti-Gremlin-1 antibodies revealed that the 0030:HD antibody forms 1:1 complexes with free Gremlin-1 not involving heparin, while the 0032:ND antibody captures heparin-bound Gremlin-1, leading to the formation of higher-order complexes that were insoluble and precipitated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Overexpression but not antibody blockade of Gremlin-1 modified the expression profile of human hepatic fibrogenic cells</title><p>Having characterised effective neutralising antibodies against Gremlin-1, we evaluated whether anti-Gremlin-1 treatment reduced the fibrogenic activation of HSC.

Baboota et al. recently suggested that anti-Gremlin-1-based therapies may be able to halt or even reverse MASH progression through inhibition of hepatocellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baboota et al., 2022</xref>). In the present study, we aimed to develop and evaluate anti-Gremlin-1 neutralising antibodies as therapeutic assets for the treatment of MASH fibrosis.</p><p>Gremlin-1 is mainly expressed in adipose tissue, the intestine, and the kidneys, while hepatic expression is considered low in healthy human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gustafson et al., 2015</xref>) and rodent tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boers et al., 2006</xref>). In healthy mouse liver, Gremlin-1 expression was undetectable, but others have previously found increased mRNA expression in murine fibrotic liver in <italic>Mdr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice fed a cholate-containing diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boers et al., 2006</xref>) and porcine serum-induced murine liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, in patients with type 2 diabetes and MASH, Hedjazifar et al. have found increased Gremlin-1 expression and a positive correlation with liver steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and the stage of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hedjazifar et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings of increased RNAscope ISH signal in human and rat MASH fibrosis largely corroborate existing evidence, although our secondary analyses from existing bulk RNA-sequencing datasets conflicted in that regard. Furthermore, our RNAscope studies on human livers highlight the heterogeneity of Gremlin-1 expression across and within individual livers, resulting in a high risk of sampling bias. Not least, we showed increased hepatic Gremlin-1 expression across different aetiologies of end-stage chronic liver disease, pointing towards a role not specific to metabolic liver disease.</p><p>The exact cellular localisation of hepatic Gremlin-1 is under continuous investigation. Using RNAscope ISH, we found that Gremlin-1 mRNA localised to <italic>COL3A1/THY1<sup>+</sup></italic> myofibroblasts. Some authors previously found increased Gremlin-1 expression in HHSC-derived myofibroblasts when compared to quiescent and early activated HSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogawa et al., 2007</xref>). However, following studies found evidence that Gremlin-1 expression is most abundant in portal fibroblasts when compared to HSC in murine bile duct ligation and CCl<sub>4</sub> models of fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iwaisako et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that portal fibroblast-derived myofibroblasts, rather than HSC-derived myofibroblasts, are the predominant Gremlin-1-expressing cells of the liver. Still, as mentioned above, hepatic Gremlin-1 expression seems to be very low, evidenced by available liver scRNA-sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ramachandran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guilliams et al., 2022</xref>). In our integrated analysis of both datasets, <italic>GREM1</italic> was barely detectable but showed considerable expression in smooth muscle cell subsets and myofibroblasts expressing <italic>COL3A1</italic> and <italic>THY1</italic>. All taken together, our data confirmed a subset of myofibroblasts as the predominant hepatic cell population expressing Gremlin-1.</p><p>We found increased levels of Gremlin-1 expression in MASH fibrosis and localisation of Gremlin-1 to periportal hepatic fibroblasts. However, we did not find any therapeutic effect of antibody-mediated neutralisation of Gremlin-1, neither in a rat CDAA-HFD in vivo model nor in human ex vivo or in vitro culture models of MASH fibrosis. We extensively tested and characterised our therapeutic antibodies and were able to show high-affinity binding to Gremlin-1 and inhibition of its functional activity on BMP4. Furthermore, treating rats with the heparin-displacing anti-Gremlin-1 antibody in vivo led to a significant increase in circulating Gremlin-1 protein, evidencing reliable target engagement. However, the small subset of <italic>COL3A1/THY1<sup>+</sup></italic> periportal fibroblasts unlikely represents the major fibrogenic cell subset in MASH. While periportal myofibroblasts play an important role in biliary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nishio et al., 2022</xref>), in most chronic liver diseases such as MASH and alcohol-related liver disease, HSC-derived myofibroblasts represent the predominant fibrogenic cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2021a</xref>). Moreover, hepatic Gremlin-1 expression is quite low when compared to organs such as the intestine or visceral adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gustafson et al., 2015</xref>). Others suggested that Gremlin-1 plays an important role in visceral adipose tissue biology by driving adipocyte hypertrophy and adipose tissue dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grillo et al., 2023</xref>). Given the important role of visceral adipose tissue dysfunction in MASLD/MASH development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gastaldelli and Cusi, 2019</xref>), Gremlin-1 could drive the development and progression of MASH by modulating local adipose tissue function. Some authors even have hypothesised that visceral adipose tissue Gremlin-1 might act directly on the liver via delivery through the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hedjazifar et al., 2020</xref>), but this seems unlikely considering the high-affinity binding of Gremlin-1 to glycosaminoglycans such as heparin, which very likely prevents Gremlin-1 from entering the bloodstream. We carefully selected the CDAA-HFD rat model of MASH fibrosis for our in vivo studies as this was the only animal model tested that showed convincing and reliable hepatic upregulation of Gremlin-1 upon liver injury. While the CDAA-HFD model reliably reproduces the histological hallmarks of hepatic disease in MASH, such as liver steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lefere et al., 2020</xref>), it does not incorporate extrahepatic factors such as obesity and adipose tissue dysfunction as drivers of disease. On the contrary, CDAA-HFD leads to reduced weight gain and reduced visceral adiposity compared to control diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lefere et al., 2020</xref>). Data on adipose tissue biology in CDAA-HFD are scarce, but increased expression and release of the obesogenic cytokine leptin is considered a hallmark of severe obesity and the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tilg and Moschen, 2006</xref>). Experiments on mice suggest that this axis is disrupted in CDAA-fed animals as they show reduced leptin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2021b</xref>). Likewise, although not specifically tested, obesity-induced changes in adipose tissue Gremlin-1 expression and biology are likely not reflected in the CDAA-HFD model used here.</p><p>PCLS are a well-established method that allows the study of hepatic signalling pathways ex vivo, and unlike monolayer cell culture models reflects hepatic cell-cell interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paish et al., 2019</xref>). We used liver specimen from patients undergoing liver transplantation, which enabled us to study the effects of anti-Gremlin-1 treatment on clinically relevant, chronically diseased liver. However, these samples were derived from patients with end-stage liver disease which is usually not amenable to pharmacological interventions aimed at reversing disease. We were also limited to studying samples after 24 hr of treatment, because we observed tissue and RNA degradation when keeping cirrhotic PCLS in culture for longer. While others have incubated cirrhotic PCLS for up to 48 hr, they still observed significant changes in gene expression as early as 24 hr after dosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suriguga et al., 2022</xref>), and we also found a clear anti-fibrotic response upon ALK5 inhibition, so it is unlikely that the shorter duration of our experiment precluded us from observing early effects of Gremlin-1 blockade. However, any potential effects of Gremlin-1 on infiltrating immune cells and extrahepatic signals, e.g., from the gut or adipose tissue, are not reflected in PCLS.</p><p>Our negative findings from rat in vivo and human ex vivo models were largely corroborated by our results obtained through in vitro cell culture of fibrotic liver cells. Anti-Gremlin-1 treatment was ineffective in reducing pro-fibrogenic gene expression in both LX-2 and primary HHSC. This was in line with findings that lentiviral overexpression of <italic>GREM1</italic> in both cell types did not alter the expression of fibrogenic genes in response to TGFβ1. Interestingly, overexpression of <italic>GREM1</italic> increased the expression of <italic>CCL2</italic>, a proinflammatory cytokine upregulated in early stellate cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2021a</xref>) and <italic>LOX</italic>, which plays an important role in collagen crosslinking and is typically upregulated later in the HSC activation cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>GREM1</italic> overexpression also modulated the expression of BMP-signalling-related genes, including <italic>BMP7</italic>, <italic>SMADs,</italic> and <italic>INHBB</italic>, which might counter-balance any potential pro-fibrogenic effect.</p><p>Overall, considering the minor role of periportal fibroblasts, the main cell population expressing Gremlin-1, in MASH fibrosis and the lack of an effect upon neutralisation of Gremlin-1, the role of hepatic Gremlin-1 in liver fibrosis seems questionable. While some authors described in vivo effects of siRNA knockdown of Gremlin-1 on liver fibrosis in a carbon tetrachloride model of liver fibrosis in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), others did not find any effect of adenoviral overexpression or intraperitoneal injection of recombinant Gremlin-1 protein on steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in high-fat diet-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khatib Shahidi et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies suggest that Gremlin-1 might not be a solely pro-fibrotic protein through inhibition of BMPs. Studies on myocardial fibrosis, urinary carcinoma, and intervertebral disc degeneration found that Gremlin-1 can also directly antagonise TGFβ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Müller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2023</xref>), thereby potentially exerting anti-fibrotic effects. Therefore, the specific role of Gremlin-1 in organ fibrosis might be largely dependent on the context and the local balance of BMPs and TGF proteins.</p><p>Our findings regarding the heparin-binding properties of Gremlin-1 shed further light on the biological function and potential use of Gremlin-1 as a biomarker or therapeutic target. Heparin binding is a hallmark of the TGFβ superfamily of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rider and Mulloy, 2017</xref>), including Gremlin-1 belonging to the Dan family, and therefore it was not unexpected that Gremlin-1 also possesses high-affinity binding properties towards glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiodelli et al., 2011</xref>). To our surprise, using our highly sensitive and specific luminescent channelling assays as well as LC-MS, we found no consistent evidence of circulating Gremlin-1 protein. Other groups reported increased levels of Gremlin-1 protein in the blood of patients with MASLD/MASH and cardiovascular disease and even found correlations with parameters of hepatic disease activity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hedjazifar et al., 2020</xref>). Proving the absence of a protein is inherently challenging if not impossible. Still, leading up to this assay we tested many high-affinity polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, exploiting all epitopes of Gremlin-1 to avoid epitope masking (e.g. by binding to other proteins) in circulation. Using this range of antibodies on several detection platforms, we still found no detectable Gremlin-1 in circulation, despite high sensitivity of our assays, which was confirmed using spike-ins of recombinant protein from several batches and the presence of detectable Gremlin-1 in circulation after anti-Gremlin-1 treatment in the rat CDAA-HFD model. Furthermore, the absence of any signal suggests that unspecific binding was not an issue. We are therefore confident that our assay worked and that we should have been able to pick up signals from Gremlin-1 concentrations as high as have been reported in the literature. We propose that the heparin-binding properties of Gremlin-1 preclude release of Gremlin-1 protein into systemic circulation while it is retained locally in its functional niche, amplifying local activity surrounding Gremlin-1-expressing cells. However, this likely precludes release of Gremlin-1 protein into systemic circulation. Therefore, previous findings relating to correlations of circulating Gremlin-1 need to be interpreted with caution. Still, extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McNamee et al., 2022</xref>) and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chatterjee et al., 2017</xref>) reportedly can contain Gremlin-1, which might still offer a route of inter-organ communication through Gremlin-1. Taken together, the implications of Gremlin-1 heparin-binding properties and possibility of its absence from systemic circulation clearly need to be considered when studying its function, therapeutic applications, and suitability as a biomarker.</p><p>In summary, our data provide compelling evidence that hepatic Gremlin-1 is not a suitable target for treating MASH-induced liver fibrosis. However, this does not preclude a role for Gremlin-1 in other liver diseases, and biliary fibrosis in particular. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests a role for Gremlin-1 in carcinogenesis and future studies will have to define its role in hepatocellular carcinoma development. Not least, the role of Gremlin-1 in adipose tissue is well established and targeting visceral adipose rather than hepatic Gremlin-1 might be a more promising target in MASH.

Eight separate libraries, representing different antibody families and each with a 1–2×10<sup>9</sup> diversity, were screened for specific binders through consecutive rounds of enrichment using MACS and FACS. In short, using biotinylated rhGremlin as a ‘bait’ protein, two rounds of MACS selections were performed followed by three rounds of FACS, including a de-selection round for poly-specific binders. After the final selection round, clones were plated, picked, and sequenced from each of the libraries.

RNAscope probes (Advanced Cell Diagnostics [ACD], Newark, CA, USA) directed against human GREM1 and human THY1 or COL3A1 were hybridised for 2 hr at 42°C using RNAscope 2.5 LS Duplex Reagent Kit (ACD) followed by RNAscope amplification. Fast red chromogenic detection of GREM1 was followed by green chromogenic detection (ACD) of THY1 or COL3A1. Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. The GREM1-positive dot area fraction (dot area per tissue area) of single RNAscope ISH with the GREM1 probe has been quantified using HALO v3.5.3577 and the Area Quantification v2.4.2 module.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>RNA isolation and reverse transcription</title><p>RNA from cells was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit or RNeasy Micro Kit (74104 and 74004, respectively, QIAGEN, Germany), following the manufacturer’s instructions, including on-column DNA digestion (RNase-Free DNase Set, 79254, QIAGEN).

Horn et al. developed an anti-Gremlin-1 antibody in-house and tested its ability to neutralize gremlin-1 and treat liver fibrosis. This article has the advantage of testing its hypothesis with different animal and human liver fibrosis models and using a variety of research methodologies.</p><p>The experimental design and results support the conclusion that the anti-gremlin-1 antibody had no therapeutic effect on treating liver fibrosis, so there are no other suggestions for new experiments:</p><p>(1) The authors used RNAscope in situ hybridization to establish the correlation between Gremlin-1 expression and NMSH livers or cell lines.</p><p>(2) A luminescent oxygen channelling immunoassay was used to measure circulating Gremlin-1 concentration. They found that Gremlin-1 binds to heparin very efficiently, preventing Gremlin-1 from entering circulation, and restricting Gremlin-1's ability to mediate organ cross-communication.</p><p>(3) The authors developed a suitable NMSH rat model which is a choline-deficient, L-amino acid defined high fat 1% cholesterol diet (CDAA-HFD) fed rat model of NMSH, and created a selective anti-Gremlin-1 antibody which is heparin-displacing 0030:HD antibody. They also used human cirrhotic precision-cut liver slices to test their hypotheses. They demonstrated that neutralization of Gremlin-1 activity with monoclonal therapeutic antibodies does not reduce liver inflammation or liver fibrosis.</p><p>One concern is that several reagents and assays are made in-house without external validation. Also, will those in-house reagents and assays be available to the science community?</p><p>Overall this manuscript provides useful information that gremlin-1 has a limited role in liver fibrosis pathogenesis and treatment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Horn and colleagues present data suggesting that the targeting of GREM1 has little impact on a mouse model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. Importantly, they also challenge existing data on the detection of GREM1 by ELISA in serum or plasma by demonstrating that high-affinity binding of GREM1 to heparin would lead to localisation of GREM1 in the ECM or at the plasma membrane of cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an impressive tour-de-force study around the potential of targeting GREM1 in MASH.</p><p>This paper will challenge many existing papers in the field around our ability to detect GREM1 in circulation, at least using antibody-mediated detection.</p><p>Well-controlled, detailed studies like this are critically important in order to challenge less vigorous studies in the literature.</p><p>The impressive volume of high-level, well-controlled data using an impressive range of in vitro biochemical techniques, rodent models, and human liver slices.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their time in assessing our manuscript and are very grateful for the positive response. Below, we give a point-by-point response to the reviewer’s comments and indicate where we plan to adjust the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses: only minor.</p><p>(1) The authors clearly show that heparin can limit the diffusion of GREM1 into the circulation-however, in a setting where GREM1 is produced in excess (e.g. cancer), could this &quot;saturate&quot; the available heparin and allow GREM1 to &quot;escape&quot; into the circulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their question. Indeed theoretically, if the production of Gremlin-1 exceeds the capacity of heparin to immobilise Gremlin-1, the protein may be released into solution and thus may enter the circulation. Whilst we have not addressed this possibility in our studies, we agree that it may be a mechanism worthwhile exploring in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Secondly, has the author considered that GREM1 be circulating bound to a chaperone protein like albumin which would reduce its reactivity with GREM1 detection antibodies?</p></disp-quote><p>We have thought of the possibility that Gremlin would bind other proteins such as BMPs, and thereby mask assay-antibody epitopes. To minimise this possibility, we used antibody pairs which bind different epitopes. We also used LC-MS for Gremlin-1 detection (data not shown in the manuscript), a method that is not affected by epitope masking. With the LC-MS analysis we did not pick up any gremlin-signal in plasma. We will mention the LC-MS data in the updated manuscript.</p><p>Also, we were able to detect circulating Gremlin-1 after treatment with anti-Gremlin-1 antibodies. As these were the same antibodies that were used in our assays, we should have not been able to detect Gremlin-1 if there had been a masking interaction with circulating high abundant plasma proteins such as albumin.</p><p>Finally, we believe that the assay antibodies would outcompete binding of any other proteins because of their high affinity and very high concentrations used in the assays.</p><p>In summary, we are very confident that Gremlin-1 is not present in circulation. We will though make some minor adjustments to the manuscript in order to stress this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Statistics-there is no mention of blinding of samples-I assume this was done prior to analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>All reported results were derived from hard quantitative readouts obtained through assays that are not liable to subjective interpretation. This also applies to immunohistochemistry and RNAscope histologic quantification, using Visiopharm Integrator System software ver. 8.4 or HALO v3.5.3577 (Area Quantification v2.4.2 module), respectively. Therefore, no blinding was necessary prior to analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 211-I suggest adding the Figure reference at the end of this sentence to direct the reader to the relevant data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and will add a reference to Figure 1F here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 1E Y-axis units are a little hard to interpret-can integers be used?</p></disp-quote><p>As the y axis in Figure 1E is on the logarithmic scale, integer numbers would be very hard to read because of the large range of numbers. As we acknowledge that the notation used may be difficult to read, we will change it to superscript scientific notation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Did the authors attempt to detect GREM1 protein by IHC? There are published methods for this using the R&amp;D Systems mouse antibody (PMID 31384391).</p></disp-quote><p>Parallel to the work described in PMID 31384391 (Dutton et al., Oncotarget, 10: 4630-4639, 2019), we have tested a whole range of commercial and in-house gremlin-1 antibodies. We independently arrived at the same conclusion as Dutton et al namely that goat anti-gremlin antibody R&amp;D Systems AF956 can stain the mouse or rat intestine in the muscularis layer and in the crypts/lower part of the villi, using FFPE sections. As per Dutton et al. we also corroborated this IHC staining by RNAscope - the mRNA was restricted to the muscularis and the connective tissue just below the crypts, suggesting that Gremlin-1 partially diffuses away from the cells that produce it. In contrast, none of the other commercial or in-house gremlin antibodies that we tested provided any useful staining on FFPE sections.</p><p>We also used the R&amp;D Systems AF956 antibody on several rat MASH liver samples. We saw little or no staining in livers from chow-fed rats, with only occasional weak staining around portal areas. Depending on the rat model, we saw from little or no staining to at most weak staining in portal areas and fibrotic areas. Among the various models tested, we observed the strongest staining in the rat CDAA-HFD+cholesterol model, in line with the ISH data.</p><p>However, we were unable to establish IHC on human MASH liver samples using the R&amp;D Systems AF956 antibody (or any other antibody) despite 98% sequence identity at the amino acid level between human and rat gremlin-1. Considering the results in Dutton et al. on rodent intestines, we tested the antibody on some human intestine samples, but the results on the available samples (inflamed appendices) were inconclusive.</p><p>We will include representative IHC staining images for Gremlin-1 protein on rat livers as a Supplementary Figure and mention in the manuscript that IHC for human Gremlin-1 did not work with the available antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Did the authors ever observe GREM1 internalisation using their Atto-532 labelled GREM1?</p></disp-quote><p>The Atto-532 Gremlin-1 cell association assay was mainly intended to visualise the association of Gremlin-1 with cell surface proteoglycans and how this interaction is affected by heparin-displacing and non-displacing antibodies. We observed a possible, but inconclusive intracellular association of Atto-532 Gremlin-1. However, this assay was not specifically designed for this purpose, and we did not follow up on this. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions on whether cell surface bound Gremlin-1 can be internalised. However, we appreciate that internalisation of Gremlin-1 would be an interesting biological mechanism worth following up in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Did the authors complete GREM1 ISH in the rat CDAA-HFD model? Was GREM1 upregulated, and if so, where?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed Grem1 ISH in the rat CDAA-HFD model and representative images of this are shown in Figure 1F. In chow-fed animals, Grem1 was expressed in a few cells in the portal tract, whereas after CDAA-HFD, Grem1 positive cells became more abundant in the portal tract and were also detectable in the fibrotic septa, as described in the respective results section. However, we performed no co-staining with other markers as we did for human liver samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Supplementary Figure 4C - why does the GFP level decrease in the GREM1 transgenic compared to control the GFP mouse? No such change is observed in Supplementary Figure 4E.</p></disp-quote><p>In Supplementary Figure 4C we show expression of GFP mRNA and GREM1 mRNA in lysates of GFP-control and GREM1-GFP overexpressing LX-2 cells. The x-axis labels indicate the different lentiviruses. Therefore, the right panel in Supplementary Figure 4C shows that GREM1 overexpressing LX-2 cells expressed more GREM1 compared to GFP-control transduced LX-2, while GFP mRNA expression was comparable between the two.</p><p>The results in Supplementary Figure 4E look different because – as can also be seen from the % of GFP+ cells in Supplementary Figure 4D – the GREM1 lentivirus here was more effective in transducing the cells, which is why both GFP and GREM1 mRNA were increased with GREM1 lentivirus compared to the GFP-only control. Unlike LX-2, the lentivirally transduced HHSC were not sorted on GFP positive cells prior to qPCR, which may explain the differences in GFP mRNA expression pattern between the two cell types.</p><p>We acknowledge that the figure may be difficult to interpret and will adjust the figure annotation to improve on this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>It is controversial whether liver gremlin-1 expression correlates with liver fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Horn et al. developed an anti-Gremlin-1 antibody in-house and tested its ability to neutralize gremlin-1 and treat liver fibrosis. This article has the advantage of testing its hypothesis with different animal and human liver fibrosis models and using a variety of research methodologies.</p><p>The experimental design and results support the conclusion that the anti-gremlin-1 antibody had no therapeutic effect on treating liver fibrosis, so there are no other suggestions for new experiments:</p><p>(1) The authors used RNAscope in situ hybridization to establish the correlation between Gremlin-1 expression and NMSH livers or cell lines.</p><p>(2) A luminescent oxygen channelling immunoassay was used to measure circulating Gremlin-1 concentration. They found that Gremlin-1 binds to heparin very efficiently, preventing Gremlin-1 from entering circulation, and restricting Gremlin-1's ability to mediate organ cross-communication.</p><p>(3) The authors developed a suitable NMSH rat model which is a choline-deficient, L-amino acid defined high fat 1% cholesterol diet (CDAA-HFD) fed rat model of NMSH, and created a selective anti-Gremlin-1 antibody which is heparin-displacing 0030:HD antibody. They also used human cirrhotic precision-cut liver slices to test their hypotheses. They demonstrated that neutralization of Gremlin-1 activity with monoclonal therapeutic antibodies does not reduce liver inflammation or liver fibrosis.</p><p>One concern is that several reagents and assays are made in-house without external validation. Also, will those in-house reagents and assays be available to the science community?</p><p>Overall this manuscript provides useful information that gremlin-1 has a limited role in liver fibrosis pathogenesis and treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their time in assessing our manuscript and are very grateful for the positive response. We acknowledge the fact that most of our results were derived from assays using in-house generated reagents which will therefore be hard to reproduce externally. Whilst for legal reasons we cannot share the sequences of the monoclonal antibodies, we will be able to share aliquots with fellow scientists upon request. We will include a sentence to this end to the data availability statement.</p></body></sub-article></article>
