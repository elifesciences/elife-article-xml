lifespan. Although multiple approaches have facilitated the identification of candidate genes that govern longevity, the molecular mechanisms that link aging pathways are still elusive. Here, we conducted a quantitative mass spectrometry screen and identified all phosphorylation/dephosphorylation sites on yeast proteins that significantly responded to calorie restriction, a well-established approach to extend lifespan. Functional screening of 135 potential regulators uncovered that Ids2 is activated by PP2C under CR and inactivated by PKA under glucose intake. <italic>ids2Δ</italic> or <italic>ids2</italic> phosphomimetic cells displayed heat sensitivity and lifespan shortening. Ids2 serves as a co-chaperone to form a complex with Hsc82 or the redundant Hsp82, and phosphorylation impedes its association with chaperone HSP90. Thus, PP2C and PKA may orchestrate glucose sensing and protein folding to enable cells to maintain protein quality for sustained longevity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>calorie restriction</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOST106-2311-B-002-010-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teng</surname><given-names>Shu-Chun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Food overconsumption impairs cellular protein folding through a novel aging-related signaling pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a complex process in which cells gradually lose their ability to execute regular functions and organs show increased susceptibility to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harman, 1981</xref>). The causes of aging have been attributed to nine hallmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). However, crosstalk between these hallmarks is rare. Calorie restriction (CR) is the most effective intervention known to extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCay et al., 1989</xref>), improve organism function, and retard cell senescence in a variety of species from yeast to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCay et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Cabo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Cabo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2002</xref>). CR delays the onset and/or reduces the incidence of many age-related diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mattson and Wan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roth et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Budding yeast has been perceived as an advantageous model to conveniently examine and isolate new components in aging-related pathways. In yeast, CR can be modeled by reducing the glucose concentration of the media from 2% as the <italic>ad libitum</italic> concentration to 0.5% (or lower), resulting in a 30–40% increase in lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2000</xref>). Two different lifespan paradigms are established in querying the lifespan of yeast cells: the replicative lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tesch et al., 1978</xref>) and chronological lifespan (CLS). RLS denotes the number of daughter cells that a single mother cell can generate before senescence, representing the division potential of the mother cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mortimer and Johnston, 1959</xref>), whereas CLS refers to the length of time for which yeast cells remain viable in a non-dividing state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Longo and Fabrizio, 2012</xref>).</p><p>CR exerts anti-aging effects by regulating metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kapahi et al., 2004</xref>) and enhancing stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fabrizio et al., 2001</xref>). These processes down-regulate the amino acid-sensing mTOR and the glucose-sensing PKA signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wei et al., 2008</xref>). Attenuation of Tor1, Sch9, and PKA kinases promotes activation of Rim15 kinase-mediated transcription factors Msn2/4 and Gis1 to increase pathways in glycogen accumulation, antioxidant enzyme formation, heat shock protein expression, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fontana et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, CR-mediated Tor1 repression enhances Snf1 kinase (the mammalian AMP kinase homologue in yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Orlova et al., 2006</xref>) to extend CLS by promoting respiration, acetyl-CoA levels, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wierman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wright and Poyton, 1990</xref>). Although these signaling pathways regulated by CR-modulated phosphorylation have been studied thoroughly, we speculate that there are other unknown regulators remaining to be explored. Here, we developed a screening procedure to discover additional pathways regulated under CR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A phosphoproteomic screening method identified Ids2 dephosphorylation under CR</title><p>To explore anti-aging mechanisms, we performed mass spectrometry-based quantitative phosphoproteomic profiling to globally define the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation sites of regulated proteins under CR.

Among these phosphopeptides, 318 proteins (508 phosphopeptides) showed a 2-fold increase under 0.5% glucose, meaning that these peptides were phosphorylated under a glucose-limited CR environment; 427 proteins (825 phosphopeptides) showed a 2-fold decrease under 0.5% glucose, indicating that these peptides were phosphorylated under a glucose-enriched environment; and 113 proteins contained both increased and decreased phosphopeptides on the same protein under 0.5% glucose.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39925.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ids2-S148 phosphorylation influences stress tolerance, growth, and chronological lifespan.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram highlights the steps in candidate screening.

Among them, 334 phosphoproteins were annotated to participate in biological processes including glycolysis (p &lt; 0.01), cytokinesis (p &lt; 0.01), signal transduction (p &lt; 1.0 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), cell communication (p &lt; 1.0 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), transcription (p &lt; 1.0 × 10<sup>−5</sup>), and stress response (p &lt; 1.0 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Many instances of phosphorylation regulation in our database coincided with the existing CR/nutrient-sensing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dilova et al., 2007</xref>), such as PKA, Tor, and Snf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wei et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In previous studies, CR has been shown to extend lifespan through an increase in respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2002</xref>), augmentation of cellular protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wei et al., 2008</xref>), and induction of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morselli et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we challenged the deletion strains of 135 candidates in the top categories of the GO analysis with various stresses, including heat shock, oxidative stress, DNA replicative stress, and/or nonfermentable carbon growth. We also verified the efficiency of autophagy by a GFP-Atg8 cleavage assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheong et al., 2005</xref>). Phenotypic analyses exhibited that 53 deletion strains showed defective phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Phosphomimetic and/or dephosphomimetic mutations of these 53 candidates were generated to verify the functions observed in the deletion strains, and only the <italic>ids2-S148D</italic> phosphomimetic strain displayed a growth defect in heat shock and glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). According to our mass spectrometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), S148 on Ids2 was identified (Ids2 RRS<underline>S</underline><sup>148</sup>IQDVQWIR) to be dephosphorylated under CR. The growth defect under CR was observed in <italic>ids2Δ</italic> and <italic>ids2-S148D</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>ids2-S148D</italic> phosphomimetic strains showed shortened CLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Ids2 is involved in the modulation of Ime2 during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sia and Mitchell, 1995</xref>); however, it is a functionally unknown protein in the mitotic cell cycle. We, therefore, speculated that Ids2-S148 phosphorylation may play an important role in stress response and lifespan control.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PKA phosphorylates Ids2 upon glucose intake, and PP2C dephosphorylates Ids2 under CR</title><p>Because the protein level of Ids2 did not change under CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we hypothesized that the phosphorylation status of Ids2 may modulate its function. To verify the CR-mediated Ids2 phosphorylation, an antibody against S148 phosphorylation was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Western blot analysis showed that Ids2-S148 phosphorylation decreased under CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) but not under nitrogen starvation or TOR pathway inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Based on the PhosphoGRID and pkaPS databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neuberger et al., 2007</xref>), Ids2 RRS<underline>S</underline><sup>148</sup>IQD may be phosphorylated by PKA (score = 1.57).

However, crosstalk between these aging pathways is rare. Both nutrient sensing and proteostasis control lifespan. Here, our phosphoproteomic screen mapped 632 yeast proteins containing CR-responsive phosphorylation, although we could not rule out the possibility that some of the alterations might be due to a change in the abundance of the protein itself. Coupled with functional analyses, we identified a co-chaperone protein, Ids2, which is inactivated under glucose intake. The PKA writer and PP2C eraser may orchestrate glucose sensing and protein folding, and phosphorylation of Ids2 impedes its association with HSP90. Thus, glucose concentration may influence the HSP90 chaperone activity, enabling cells to control protein quality under environmental conditions for sustained longevity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our findings are consistent with a previous large-scale analysis of the genetic interaction between HSP90 and Ids2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franzosa et al., 2011</xref>). We predict that Ids2 is a key regulator in promoting cellular tolerance to stress. HSP90 is a conserved protein controlling late protein-folding steps. Interestingly, sequence alignments of Ids2 show a certain degree of sequence similarity across homologues of HSP90 co-chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), including the S148 residue.

Although currently there is no direct evidence that PP2C may control stress tolerance through the MAPK pathway, our study provides a means by which PP2C governs stress tolerance: PP2C removes PKA-mediated Ids2 phosphorylation to maintain ample chaperone activity.</p><p>Finally, what is the role of Ids2 in protein folding at the molecular level? HSP90 forms a homodimeric complex, which consists of an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), a middle domain (M), and a C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2006</xref>). Co-chaperones can bind to specific domains of HSP90 to stabilize its conformation and further modulate its function. For example, yeast Sti1/Hop and human FKBP51 and FKBP52 utilize their tetratricopeptide (TPR) domains to interact with the C-terminal EEVD motif of HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Röhl et al., 2013</xref>) to stabilize chaperones. Moreover, the N-terminal region of co-chaperone Aha1 interacts with the M domain of HSP90 to stabilize its closed state conformation and thereby increase its ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyer et al., 2004</xref>). Our domain mapping results determined that Ids2 also binds to the M domain of HSP90 and stimulates the ATPase activity of HSP90. In addition, Ids2 forms complex with Aha1 in our MS/MS data of the Ids2-TAP complex. Thus, it will be of interest to investigate the different controlling mechanisms and client specificities of Ids2 and Aha1 in modulating HSP90. Much work will be required to understand the mechanistic role of co-chaperone Ids2.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Myc <break/>(mouse <break/>monoclonal)</td><td>Roche</td><td>11667149001; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_390912">AB_390912</ext-link></td><td>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-HA <break/>(12CA5) (mouse <break/>monoclonal)</td><td>Roche</td><td>11583816001; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_514506">AB_514506</ext-link></td><td>(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-ACTIN <break/>(rabbit <break/>polyclonal)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>A2066; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_476693">AB_476693</ext-link></td><td>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Hsp90 <break/>(rabbit <break/>polyclonal)</td><td>PMID: 23434373</td><td/><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GST <break/>(rabbit <break/>polyclonal)</td><td>GeneTex</td><td>GTX110736; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1949427">AB_1949427</ext-link></td><td>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Pgk1 <break/>(mouse <break/>monoclonal)</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>459250</td><td>(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-(P) <break/>S148-Ids2 <break/>(rabbit purified <break/>polyclonal <break/>antibody)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-Firefly <break/>Luciferase</td><td>GeneTex</td><td>GTX125849; <break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11173184">AB_11173184</ext-link></td><td>(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>EnzChek <break/>phosphate <break/>assay kit</td><td>Thermo Fisher <break/>Scientific</td><td>E6646</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial <break/>assay or kit</td><td>KAPA SYBR <break/>FAST <break/>qPCR Master <break/>Mix Kit</td><td>Sigma- <break/>Aldrich</td><td>KK4600</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Calmodulin <break/>Sepharose 4B</td><td>GE <break/>Healthcare</td><td>17-0529-01</td><td>Affinity resin</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>TALON <break/>Superflow</td><td>GE <break/>Healthcare</td><td>28-9574-99</td><td>Affinity resin</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>IgG Sepharose <break/>6 Fast Flow</td><td>Amersham <break/>Pharmacia <break/>Biotech AB</td><td>17-0969-01</td><td>Affinity resin</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Glutathione <break/>Sepharose 4 <break/>Fast Flow</td><td>GE <break/>Healthcare</td><td>17-5132-01</td><td>Affinity resin</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td>Deoxycorticosterone <break/>acetate</td><td>Sigma- <break/>Aldrich</td><td>D7000</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td>Protease <break/>inhibitor <break/>cocktail tablets</td><td>Roche</td><td>4693132001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical <break/>compound, <break/>drug</td><td>PKA, <break/>catalytic <break/>subunit, <break/>bovine heart</td><td>Millipore</td><td>539576</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>Image J</td><td/><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td>Image <break/>analysis</td></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>GraphPad <break/>Prism5</td><td/><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td>Statistical <break/>analysis <break/>and graph <break/>representation</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and yeast strains</title><p>The yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

After confirming the pop-in structure by Southern blot analysis and 5-FOA selection, the <italic>URA3</italic> pop-out mutants were selected and verified by PCR and sequencing. The C-terminal-tagged Gln1 was created by insertion of the PCR products of the GFP-<italic>HIS3</italic> cassette.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sample preparation for phosphopeptide enrichment</title><p>Yeast cells were grown in yeast extract peptone dextrose (YPD) medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone) supplemented with 2% (normal condition) or 0.5% glucose (calorie-restricted) for 3 hr and then harvested from log-phase growing cultures. Protein samples were extracted and subjected to gel-assisted digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). First, proteins were fixed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS<italic>-</italic>PAGE) directly, and the gel was cut into five pieces for trypsin proteolytic digestion. Digested peptides were extracted three times for 30 mins each and completely dried by vacuum centrifugation at room temperature. Then, we used a homemade immobilized metal affinity column for phosphopeptide enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>). An Ultra-Performance LC<sup>TM</sup> system (Waters) was used for automated purification of phosphopeptides. The Ni<sup>2+</sup> ions were removed, and the nitrilotriacetic acid resin was activated. The peptide samples from trypsin digestion were re-established in loading buffer and loaded into an activated immobilized metal affinity chromatography column. Finally, the unbound peptides were removed, and the bound peptides were eluted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>LC-MS/MS Analysis</title><p>The purified phosphopeptides were analyzed in triplicate LC-MS/MS by an LTQ-Orbitrap XL hybrid mass spectrometer interfaced with an Agilent 1100 series HPLC. Survey full-scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap (<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 350–1600) with the resolution set to 60,000 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 400 and the automatic gain control target at 106. The 10 most intense ions were sequentially isolated for an MS/MS scan using collision-induced dissociation and detection in the linear ion trap with previously selected ions and dynamic exclusion for 90 s. All the measurements in the Orbitrap were performed with the lock mass option for internal calibration. Raw MS/MS data from the LTQ-Orbitrap were transformed to msm files using RAW2MSM software (version 1.1). The msm files were searched using Mascot (version 2.2.1) against the Swiss-Prot <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> database (version 54.2, 6493 sequences) with the following exceptions: only tryptic peptides with up to two missed cleavage sites were allowed, the fragment ion mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm, and the parent ion tolerance was set at 0.6 Da. Phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Portela et al., 2002</xref>) and oxidation (M) were specified as variable modifications. Peptides were considered identified if their Mascot individual ion score was greater than 20 (<italic>p</italic>-0.05). The false discovery rates for Orbitrap data were determined with a Mascot score greater than 20 (<italic>p</italic>-0.05). The quantitative analysis of phosphopeptides was performed with the SEMI label-free algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roskoski, 1983</xref>). The raw data files acquired from the LTQ-Orbitrap were converted into files of the mzXML format by the program ReAdW, and the search results in MASCOT were exported in Extensible Markup Language data (.xml) format. After data conversion, the confident peptide identification results (<italic>p</italic>-0.05) from each LC-MS/MS run were loaded and merged to establish a global peptide information list (sequence, elution time, and mass-to-charge ratio). Alignment of elution time was then performed based on the peptide information list using linear regression in different LC-MS/MS runs followed by correction of aberrational chromatographic shifts across fragmental elution-time domains. The mass spectrometry raw datasets were deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vizcaíno et al., 2014</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org">; http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org</ext-link>) dataset identifier PXD001368 and DOI 10.6019/PXD001368.

The genes showing a 2-fold change with Bonferroni multiple correction testing were annotated for GO terms. The spatial-compartmental relationship and the genome annotation between the phosphopeptides were defined through the use of KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) orthology, a genomic, biochemical and enzyme-substrate metabolism-based online database developed by the team of Minoru Kanehisa of Kyoto University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dennis et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Stress resistance assay</title><p>Yeast cells were first grown overnight in yeast extract peptone (YEP) or synthetic complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vizcaíno et al., 2014</xref>) glucose medium at 30°C. Then, cells were re-inoculated into fresh YEP or SC medium and grown to exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5). Tenfold serial dilutions of indicated strains were spotted onto YEP with 2% glucose (YEPD), YEP with 3% glycerol (YEPG), or SC glucose plates containing various concentrations of chemicals: 0.04% Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 100 mM hydroxyurea, 10 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 400 mM LiCl, 50 µg/ml hygromycin B (Hyg B), and 5 nM rapamycin, and incubated at 30°C (normal) or 37°C (heat shock) for 2–3 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Chronological lifespan assay</title><p>The CLS assay of wild-type, <italic>ids2Δ</italic>, <italic>ids2-S148A,</italic> and <italic>ids2-S148D</italic> strains were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Postnikoff and Harkness, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Longo et al., 2012</xref>). Viability at day 3, when the yeast had reached stationary phase, was defined as the point of 100% survival. Thereafter, aliquots from the culture were diluted according to the estimated survival and plated on YEPD plates every other day. After 3 days of incubation at 30°C, colony-forming units were calculated. A semi-quantitative CLS spotting assay was also performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). In brief, the same cell numbers from the culture were serially diluted 10-fold and spotted on YEPD plates every 2 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tandem Affinity Purification</title><p>Tandem affinity purification of Ids2 was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tsai et al., 2008</xref>) in the protocol from the Yeast Resource Center of the University of Washington. In brief, the BJ2168 pYES2-Ids2-TAP strain was inoculated into one liter SC with 2% raffinose and grown to log phase prior to adding galactose to induce protein overexpression. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and protease inhibitors) and with the use of glass beads and a homogenizer. Then, 250 µL of IgG Sepharose 6 Fast Flow prep in 1:1 slurry in NP-40 was added to the lysate and incubated at 4°C for 2 hr with gentle shaking. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with TEV cleavage buffer. Fifty units of TEV protease (Thermos) was added, and the solution was incubated overnight. The supernatant was collected, and calmodulin-binding buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Mg acetate, 1 mM imidazole, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 % NP-40) and 200 µL of calmodulin sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were added for a 2 hr incubation at 4°C. Samples were washed, and the bound proteins were eluted into fractions with calmodulin elution buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Mg acetate, 1 mM imidazole, 20 mM EGTA, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 % NP-40). The eluents were combined and precipitated with 25% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were analyzed with 10% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with silver stain. Bands were cut out and trypsinized for mass spectrometry analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>One-dimensional SDS-PAGE combined nano-LC-MS/MS (GeLC-MS/MS)</title><p>To identify the Ids2-TAP interacting proteins, GeLC-MS/MS, one of the targeted proteomics approaches, was applied as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, gel pieces were destained in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>/ACN (3:2, v/v) three times for 25 min each, dehydrated in ACN and dried in a SpeedVac. In-gel proteins were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol in 25 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> at 56°C for 45 min, allowed to stand at room temperature (RT) for 10 min, and then alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide in the dark for 30 min at RT. After the proteins were digested by sequencing grade modified porcine trypsin (1:100; Promega, Madison, WI) overnight at 37°C, peptides were extracted from the gel with ACN to a final concentration of 50%, dried in a SpeedVac, and then stored at 20°C for further use. For reverse-phase LC-MS/MS analysis, each peptide mixture was resuspended in HPLC buffer A (0.1% formic acid, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and loaded into a trap column (Zorbax 300 SB-<sub>C18</sub>, 0.3 × 5 mm, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) at a flow rate of 0.2 μL/min in HPLC buffer A. The salts were washed with buffer A at a flow rate of 20 μL/min for 10 min, and the desalted peptides were then separated on a 10 cm analytical C<sub>18</sub> column (inner diameter, 75 μm). The peptides were eluted by a linear gradient of 0–10% HPLC buffer B (99.9% ACN containing 0.1% formic acid) for 3 min, 10–30% buffer B for 35 min, 30–35% buffer B for 4 min, 35–50% buffer B for 1 min, 50–95% buffer B for 1 min, and 95% buffer B for 8 min at a flow rate of 0.25 μL/min across the analytical column. The LC setup was coupled online to an LTQ-Orbitrap linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA) operated using Xcalibur 2.0.7 software (Thermo Scientific). Full-scan MS was performed using the Orbitrap in an MS range of 400–2000 Da, and the intact peptides were detected at a resolution of 30,000. Internal calibration was performed using the ion signal of cyclosiloxane peaks at m/z 536.165365 as a lock mass. A data-dependent procedure was applied that alternated between one MS survey scan and six MS/MS scans for the six most abundant precursor ions in the MS survey scan with a 2 Da window and fragmentation via CID with 35% normalized collision energy. The electrospray voltage applied was 1.8 kV. Both MS and MS/MS spectra were acquired using one microscan with a maximum fill-time of 1000 and 150 ms for MS analysis, respectively. Automatic gain control was used to prevent overfilling of the ion trap, and 5 × 10<sup>4</sup> ions were accumulated in the ion trap to generate the MS/MS spectra. All the MS and MS/MS data were analyzed and processed using Proteome Discoverer (version 1.4, Thermo Scientific). The top six fragment ions per 100 Da of each MS/MS spectrum were extracted for a protein database search using the Mascot search engine (version 2.4, Matrix Science) against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot sequence database. The top-six-peaks filter node improved the number of peptides identified with high confidence by reducing the number of peaks in the searched peak lists. This method avoids matching peptide candidates to spurious or noise peaks, thereby avoiding false peptide matches. The search parameters were set as follows: carbamidomethylation (C) as the fixed modification, oxidation (M), N-acetyl (protein), pyro-Glu/Gln (N-term Q), six ppm for MS tolerance, 0.8 Da for MS/MS tolerance, and two for missing cleavage. After database searching, the following filter criteria were applied to all the results: a minimum peptide length of six, a minimum of two unique peptides for the assigned protein, and peptide and protein identification with FDR less than 1% peptide filter were accepted. For precursor ion quantification, Proteome Discoverer was employed using a standard deviation of 2 ppm mass precision to create an extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) for the designated peptide.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Antibody generation and western blot analysis</title><p>Cells were grown at 30°C in YEPD medium.

To generate antibodies, rabbits were boosted with carrier-conjugated phosphopeptides once per month. Pre-immune sera were collected before boosting. Blood was collected every 2 weeks, incubated at 37°C for 30 mins, and separated via high-speed centrifugation. Clarified serum was incubated at 56°C for 30 mins to remove complement.

This might explain changes in luciferase expression and Gln1-GFP aggregates presented and should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have softened our statements in Abstract, in Figure 5 legend, and in other places. To investigate the putative co-chaperone function on HSP90, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity (Schena and Yamamoto, 1988) and v-Src toxicity (Boczek et al., 2015) assays have been performed. For monitoring GR maturation, the strains were co-transformed with a plasmid that constitutively expresses GR and a plasmid carrying a β-galactosidase reporter. We observed that the GR activity in the <italic>ids2Δ</italic> and its phosphomimetic mutant, <italic>ids2-S148D,</italic> decreased compared with that in the wild-type cells (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Consistently, the v-Src toxicity, which is strictly dependent on yeast HSP90 in vivo, reduced in the <italic>ids2D</italic> and <italic>ids2-S148D</italic> strains (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). The results support our model that Ids2 may serve as a co-chaperone orchestrating the HSP90 function.</p><p>Although a potential DNA binding ability of Ids2 might have a chance to affect our luciferase expression and the Gln1-GFP aggregation results through transcriptional activation, in our firefly luciferase experiment, we expressed firefly luciferase under a <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. The control samples were first grown at 25 °C and then shifted to higher temperatures (30 °C and 37 °C). There was no apparent decrease in firefly luciferase protein levels in <italic>ids2Δ, hsc82Δ</italic>, and <italic>ids2-S148D</italic> cells compared to that in the wild-type strain when we induced the expression with galactose at 25 °C (Figure 4C). Therefore, the reduction of the firefly luciferase protein under the higher temperature is probably not through an Ids2-mediated transcriptional activation on the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, but most likely due to protein degradation of misfolded firefly luciferase as Professor Susan Lindquist previously suggested (Nathan et al., 1997). Moreover, in the Gln1-GFP aggregation experiment, we have further examined the <italic>GLN1</italic> mRNA expression in the tested strains under glucose starvation using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (new Figure 4D). The transcriptional level of <italic>GLN1</italic> did not show any significant change in these strains, indicating that the appearance of Gln1-GFP aggregates was not a consequence of the difference of transcriptional regulation of Ids2 on <italic>GLN1</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should make clear one major caveat of the initial phosphoproteomics data – that it is not normalized to changes in total protein levels upon caloric restriction. Therefore, it is not possible to differentiate between the phospopeptides that are changed due to a change in the abundance of the protein itself from those that are actually changed due to phosphorylation/desphosphorylation events.</p></disp-quote><p>For the phosphoproteomic analysis used in this study, indeed we cannot rule out the possibility that the phosphopeptides were changed due to a change in the abundance of the protein itself. As suggested by the reviewer, we have added this possibility in Discussion (first paragraph). Moreover, to minimize this vagueness, we have marked the proteins (n = 16) in red in our mass data (new Figure 1—source data 1) that have been reported to be influenced on the transcriptional levels under CR stress according to a previous research (Lee and Lee, 2008). For the only positive candidate Ids2, we have verified that the protein level of Ids2 is not a major issue of regulation under CR (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The control for the Ids2-TAP IP-MS experiment is not ideal. A better control would be cells expressing just the TAP tag alone (Protein A + CBP), to discount non-specific hits that bind either of these two proteins. This is especially important given that Hsc82/Hsp82 are common contaminants in affinity proteomics experiments (as defined by the CRAPome database).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have added the cells expressing the TAP tag alone as a control (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1). We have used an HSP90 specific antibody to confirm that the signal was faithfully derived from HSP90 (Hsc82/Hsp82) protein and only appeared in the Ids2-TAP-pulldown, but not in the TAP-alone pulldown. The results indicate that the signal around 80 kDa on the silver staining gel may mainly come from the HSP90 proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors suggest that this Ids2-dependent regulation of Hsc90 activity is key to longevity control, allows survival during chronological aging (starvation in stationary phase), and is required for CR to retard aging in stationary phase (it is stated, for example, that &quot;PP2C phosphatase antagonizes the function of PKA to extend lifespan&quot;). In this respect, the data does not at present support these conclusions and more data is required for making this link. For example, the authors should test whether Ids2 and Hsc90 are required for CR to prolong lifespan – no CR experiments are included presently. Also, for the conclusions stated it is expected that the ids2-S148A mutant should display a longer lifespan even without CR – is this true and if so, does it depend on Hsc90?</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether Ids2 and Hsc82 are required for CR-mediated lifespan extension, we have measured the chronological lifespan of <italic>ids2Δ, hsc82Δ</italic>, <italic>ids2-S148A</italic> and <italic>ids2-S148D</italic> under CR (0.5% glucose). Indeed, <italic>ids2Δ, hsc82Δ</italic>, and <italic>ids2-S148D</italic> strains lost their ability to extend lifespan under CR, and the <italic>ids2-S148A</italic> mutant showed lifespan extension as the wild-type control under CR (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). Moreover, the <italic>ids2-S148A</italic> mutant did not display a longer lifespan than the wild-type strain under normal condition. Based on these findings, we speculate that HSP90 needs dephosphorylated Ids2 for its full chaperone complex activity to extend lifespan under normal and CR conditions, and in yeast Ids2 may provide enough dephosphorylated form under normal condition for HSP90’s activity. We have softened our model (Introduction, first paragraph and Figure 5 legend, and other places) based on these observations.</p><p>References</p><p>Boczek EE, Reefschlager LG, Dehling M, Struller TJ, Hausler E, Seidl A, et al.
