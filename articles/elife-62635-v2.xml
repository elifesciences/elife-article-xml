To identify age-related adipose features, we evaluated the senescence and adipogenic potential of adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) from abdominal subcutaneous fat obtained from healthy normal-weight young (&lt;25 years) or older women (&gt;60 years). Increased cell passages of young-donor ASCs (in vitro aging) resulted in senescence but not oxidative stress. ASC-derived adipocytes presented impaired adipogenesis but no early mitochondrial dysfunction. Conversely, aged-donor ASCs at early passages displayed oxidative stress and mild senescence. ASC-derived adipocytes exhibited oxidative stress, and early mitochondrial dysfunction but adipogenesis was preserved. In vitro aging of aged-donor ASCs resulted in further increased senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and severe adipocyte dysfunction. When in vitro aged young-donor ASCs were treated with metformin, no alteration was alleviated. Conversely, metformin treatment of aged-donor ASCs decreased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in decreased senescence. Metformin’s prevention of oxidative stress and of the resulting senescence improved the cells’ adipogenic capacity and insulin sensitivity. This effect was mediated by the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase as revealed by its specific inhibition and activation. Overall, aging ASC-derived adipocytes presented impaired adipogenesis and insulin sensitivity. Targeting stress-induced senescence of ASCs with metformin may improve age-related adipose tissue dysfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>adipose stromal cells</kwd><kwd>adipogenesis</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>metformin</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EQU201903007868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fève</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RHU-ANR-15-RHUS-0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Capeau</surname><given-names>Jacqueline</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Pelletier</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Mantecon</surname><given-names>Matthieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Gorwood</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><name><surname>Auclair</surname><given-names>Martine</given-names></name><name><surname>Foresti</surname><given-names>Roberta</given-names></name><name><surname>Motterlini</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name><name><surname>Atlan</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Fève</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name><name><surname>Capeau</surname><given-names>Jacqueline</given-names></name><name><surname>Lagathu</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><name><surname>Bereziat</surname><given-names>Veronique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sorbonne University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Le Pelletier</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name><name><surname>Mantecon</surname><given-names>Matthieu</given-names></name><name><surname>Gorwood</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name><name><surname>Auclair</surname><given-names>Martine</given-names></name><name><surname>Atlan</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Fève</surname><given-names>Bruno</given-names></name><name><surname>Capeau</surname><given-names>Jacqueline</given-names></name><name><surname>Lagathu</surname><given-names>Claire</given-names></name><name><surname>Bereziat</surname><given-names>Veronique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universite Paris Est Creteil</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Foresti</surname><given-names>Roberta</given-names></name><name><surname>Motterlini</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universite de Paris</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laforge</surname><given-names>Mireille</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aging is associated with stress-induced senescence of adipose stromal cells, leading to impaired adipogenesis, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance, all being alleviated by metformin treatment of adipose stromal cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adipose tissue is the largest lipid storage and endocrine organ in the body. Recent studies have highlighted adipose tissue’s critical role in age‐related diseases and metabolic dysfunction. Aging is physiologically associated with fat redistribution and a metabolic and functional decline in adipose tissue, associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cartwright et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cartwright et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tchkonia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luo and Liu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stout et al., 2017</xref>). The age-related redistribution of adipose tissue is characterized by the accumulation of truncal fat, hypertrophy of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and overall loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mancuso and Bouchard, 2019</xref>). An excess amount of VAT might reflect the paucity of SCAT during aging. Indeed, while accumulation of SCAT in the lower part of the body is considered to be a metabolic sink capable of buffering surplus energy, a decline in SCAT storage capacity might lead to (i) ectopic lipid deposition in the bone marrow, heart, liver, and muscles and (ii) an increase in cardiometabolic comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stout et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, it has been suggested that appropriate SCAT plasticity and expandability guard against metabolic disorders (including insulin resistance) and that the age-related loss of these properties favors metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pasarica et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McLaughlin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>On the cellular level, several age-related changes in SCAT and VAT might contribute to adipose tissue dysfunction. Failure of SCAT is likely to result from the impaired recruitment of precursors and blunted adipogenesis. The identification of adipose-derived progenitor cells in the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue has highlighted the importance of de novo adipogenesis in adipose tissue expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cawthorn et al., 2012</xref>). Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are defined as plastic-adherent cells expressing specific surface antigens and that are able to differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondroblasts in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominici et al., 2006</xref>). They can be isolated, expanded, and induced to differentiate into the above-mentioned lineages by using specific culture conditions and thus constitute a useful tool for studying age-related diseases. The abundance of adipocyte progenitors/precursors that differentiate into adipocytes is an important determinant of SCAT expandability and functionality. Adipocyte-differentiated ASCs have a crucial role in lipid handling, adipose tissue expansion, and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palmer and Kirkland, 2016</xref>). With age, the frequency of ASCs decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). A reduction in the ASCs proliferation rate might ultimately reflect cell senescence and might be involved in the onset of metabolic alterations (e.g. insulin resistance) observed during aging.</p><p>The age-dependent senescence of ASCs has been linked to a decrease in mitochondrial activity and an increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choudhery et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maredziak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Although most of the literature data show that aging has a negative effect on osteoblasts and chondrocytes, the results differ with regard to the impact of senescence on the ASCs’ adipogenic potential. Indeed, some studies found that aging had a negative effect on adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karagiannides et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sepe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beane et al., 2014</xref>), whereas others found that adipocyte differentiation increased with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Girolamo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choudhery et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maredziak et al., 2016</xref>). Lastly, it has been suggested that targeting senescent cells in adipose tissue will enhance adipogenesis and metabolic function in old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We show here that different mechanisms were involved in physiological, in vivo, aging and in passage-related, in vitro, aging, resulting in different adipocyte dysfunction. Thus, at early passages, ASCs isolated from SCAT of aged donors displayed stress-induced senescence leading to early adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and cellular insulin resistance but preserved adipogenesis. Conversely, in vitro passage-induced (long-term in vitro culture) aging in young-donor ASCs was responsible for the onset of senescence features in the absence of oxidative stress leading to a gradual decline in the proliferation and adipocyte differentiation capacity associated with enhanced insulin resistance. Interestingly, we showed that all these dysfunctions were more pronounced in aged-donors ASCs with increasing passage number.</p><p>The biguanide drug metformin is widely used to treat diabetes and also appears to modulate a number of aging-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barzilai et al., 2016</xref>). Metformin exerts pleotropic effects and has a favorable influence on metabolic and cellular processes closely associated with the development of age-related conditions, such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and cellular senescence. We therefore sought to determine whether exposure of ASCs to metformin could prevent stress-induced senescence and rescue the impaired metabolic phenotype of ASCs obtained from aged donors. Our results show that, via the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), metformin exerted an antioxidant effect and improved mitochondria metabolism. Therefore, metformin alleviated the stress-induced cellular senescence of aged-donor ASCs and rescued adipocyte differentiation and function, which might be involved in the drug’s insulin-sensitizing effect in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro aging results in senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction while physiological aging induces early oxidative stress in ASCs</title><p>In order to determine the impact of aging on ASCs, we evaluated three cellular models: (i) ASCs isolated from human SCAT samples obtained from young adults (under the age of 25- referred as ‘young-donor’) that were cultured in vitro from early (P3) to late passage (P11); (ii) physiologically aged ASCs that were isolated from older adults (over the age of 60- referred as ‘aged-donor’) at early passage, (iii) and, finally, aged-donor ASCs cultured from P3 to P11.</p><p>First, we observed that the in vitro increased passage number of young ASCs led to a senescent phenotype. The population doubling times (PDT) of young-donor ASCs at P7 and P11 were slightly longer than at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The mean percentage of senescent young-donor ASCs (i.e. those positive for senescence-associated (SA)-β-galactosidase) was increased at P7 and P11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>) although the level of lysosome accumulation measured by Lysotracker fluorescence remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Accordingly, young-donor ASCs expressed significantly greater levels of the cell cycle arrest proteins p16<sup>INK4</sup> and p21<sup>WAF1</sup> at P7 and P11 and of the senescence-associated protein prelamin A at P11 compared to P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). However, the level of ROS production was the same regardless of the passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), indicating that oxidative stress was not enhanced in that setting. In order to evaluate the presence of mitochondrial dysfunction, we measured both the volume (by using Mitotracker that labels mitochondria) and the membrane potential (with the aggregate to monomer ratio of the JCI dye) of mitochondria. Young-donor ASCs did not show any modification of mitochondrial mass over the passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) but presented a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, mostly at P11 as compared to P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), in favor of late mitochondrial dysfunction. These data suggest that long-term in vitro culture of young-donor ASCs induced the onset of senescence with mitochondrial dysfunction but without enhanced oxidative stress.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In vivo and in vitro aging are differently associated with senescence, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs).</title><p>After isolation from the abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT) of young (gray circles or bars) and aged (black circles or bars) donors, ASCs were cultured from passages (P) 3–11.

Indeed, we observed that in aged-donor ASCs, treatment with compound C counteracted the beneficial effect of metformin on cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), senescence marker levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–D</xref>), oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), and mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–G</xref>). Interestingly, adipocytes differentiated from aged-donor ASCs, then pre-treated with both metformin and compound C during proliferation but not during differentiation did not show metformin’s beneficial effect on adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>) and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>). Accordingly, we showed that AMPK constitutive activation with AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside), an agonist of the AMPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merrill et al., 1997</xref>), induced a decrease of aged-donor ASCs senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction at P11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) leading to increased triglycerides and decreased ROS production in adipocytes differentiated from aged-donor ASCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings highlighted AMPK’s role in the beneficial action of metformin on aged-donor ASCs and the derived adipocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study shows for the first time that passage-related (in vitro) or physiological (age of the donor, in vivo) aging leads to different senescence mechanisms and thus differently affects adipocyte and adipose tissue function. In vitro passage-induced senescence impedes adipocyte differentiation while stress-induced senescence (as observed in physiological aging) results in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction but not impaired differentiation in ASC-derived adipocytes. When aged-donor ASCs age in vitro, the two processes are present resulting in a severe dysfunction in derived adipocytes. By activating AMPK, metformin restored almost all the features of aging in aged-donor ASCs to the levels observed in young-donor ASCs. However, metformin did not modify these variables in the latter cells.</p><p>Our data are in line with previous studies of human ASCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alicka et al., 2020</xref>). The ASCs have a typical mesenchymal stem cell morphology, and there are little or no morphological differences between young-donor and aged-donor cells in early passages. In most studies, the PDT of human ASCs did not vary with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, we did not observe any differences between young-donor and aged-donor ASCs with regard to the phenotype or proliferation rate early in the period of culture (P3). However, with increasing passage numbers, aged-donor cells developed severe features of senescence (such as increased SA-β-galactosidase activity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunctions) earlier than young-donor cells that also present in vitro features of senescence. These alterations might have driven the progressive fall in proliferation capacity seen for aged-donor ASC from P5 onward. Indeed, we found that aged-donor ASCs had molecular, morphological, and functional impairments late in culture (P11). We propose that our results provide a better understanding of the molecular events occurring in ASCs in the course of aging.</p><p>With regard to the mechanisms that might promote senescence in ASCs, greater mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production have previously been linked to the occurrence of age-dependent ASC senescence. Decreased mitochondrial function and elevated mitochondrial generation of ROS are thought to be critical in the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Correia-Melo et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, ROS accumulation was observed at P3 in aged-donor ASCs, whereas mitochondrial dysfunctions were only observed at P7 suggesting that ROS could initially not originate from mitochondria. In agreement, Seahorse experiment did not show any difference in respiration capacities between aged- and young-donor ASCs. We report here that increased senescence during in vitro aging was not associated with early mitochondrial dysfunction in derived adipocytes while mild senescence and increased oxidative stress observed in the situation of in vivo aging were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, we propose to disentangle ASC senescence from adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction and, conversely, to associate ASC increased oxidative stress with adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction.</p><p>It has already been reported that ASC senescence impairs adipogenic differentiation capacity. In particular, several other studies of human and murine mesenchymal stromal cells had shown a reduction in differentiation potential upon aging in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choudhery et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maredziak et al., 2016</xref>). Our data are in agreement with this point. Moreover, they allow to better decipher the respective roles of oxidative stress and senescence regarding adipogenesis. Accordingly, we show that in vitro passage-related senescence impairs adipogenesis even in the absence of enhanced oxidative stress. Conversely, in physiological aging, adipocyte-differentiated ASCs present early enhanced oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions but not reduced adipogenic potential. Thus, senescence, but not oxidative stress alone, impairs adipogenic differentiation. However, a high level of oxidative stress results in stress-induced senescence and in turn in reduced adipogenic differentiation. When young-donor ASCs at early passages, that is, devoid of any age-related alteration, were treated with lopinavir, both oxidative stress and senescence occurred resulting in impaired adipogenesis. Conversely, darunavir induced neither senescence nor impaired adipogenesis.</p><p>One of the study’s objectives was to determine whether preventing the onset of senescence in aged-donor ASCs restored their adipogenic capacity. There is experimental evidence that metformin extends lifespan in model organisms, sparking interest in its clinical relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin-Montalvo et al., 2013</xref>). We used a metformin concentration of 25 µmol/L, in the upper range observed in diabetic patients and considered as a safe concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frid et al., 2010</xref>). As a senomorphic drug, it has been shown that metformin can reduce the SA secretory phenotype. Accordingly, we observed that metformin decreased activin A secretion, a molecule that has been previously shown to impair adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), in both young-donor and aged-donor ASCs regardless the passage (data not shown). However, in our model, metformin did not restore the adipogenic capacity of senescent young-donor ASCs at P11, suggesting that (i) metformin could act by another mechanism, (ii) metformin was not able to reverse the ASCs’ senescence features when oxidative stress is low, and (iii) metformin was able to reverse stress-induced senescence by acting on oxidative stress.</p><p>Metformin was shown to decrease ROS production by ASCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marycz et al., 2016</xref>) and to significantly improve ASC proliferation and function, in correlation with a higher mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smieszek et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we showed that aged-donor ASCs expressed and activated AMPK to a lower extent than young-donor ASCs, and that this impairment could be reversed by metformin treatment. This effect is related to metformin’s ability to inhibit complex 1 in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to activation of AMPK and a reduction in endogenous ROS production. Accordingly, we found that metformin was a potent antioxidant and prevented the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction in aged-donor ASCs. Interestingly, we found that metformin treatment had a beneficial effect on aged-donor ASCs but not on young-donor ASCs; this suggests that in vitro and in vivo aging have different mechanisms, which result in different cellular and molecular alterations. It has been shown that metformin has various effects on several pathways and targets, in addition to AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barzilai et al., 2016</xref>). Even though metformin’s ability to inhibit mitochondrial complex 1 has been best characterized, many other pathways are affected. Nonetheless, we observed that beneficial effects of metformin were lost in the presence of compound C (a potent AMPK inhibitor) or mimicked with the AMPK activator AICAR – highlighting the central role of the AMPK-linked signaling network in the ASC aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salminen and Kaarniranta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkewitz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to have shown that metformin can partially rescue/maintain the adipogenic capacity of aged-donor ASCs. Metformin has been shown to inhibit adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marycz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) when cells are exposed during the process of differentiation. Here, we used a novel model in which ASCs were only treated with metformin before the induction of differentiation. By removing metformin during ASC differentiation, we were able to rule out a direct effect on adipogenesis. Thus, our data suggest that metformin’s prevention of oxidative stress-induced senescence and dysfunction during ASC proliferation restored adipogenesis. Interestingly, we also observed that metformin increased the insulin sensitivity of newly differentiated ASCs isolated from aged-donor ASCs by activating AMPK; this activation has been shown to contribute to the drug’s insulin-sensitizing effect in vivo – particularly in the liver and in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salminen and Kaarniranta, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several studies strongly suggest that metformin could improve adipose tissue function. A treatment with metformin leads, in most cases, to fat loss and improved insulin sensitivity, but these effects are largely related to actions outside adipose tissue. A few studies evaluated the effect of metformin on the different fat depots. In the large clinical study ‘Diabetes Prevention Program Research group’, both SCAT and VAT were reduced in glucose-intolerant women after 1 year of treatment with metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujimoto et al., 2007</xref>). As well, adiponectin level was mildly improved while leptin was decreased in favor of improved adipose tissue function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberg et al., 2019</xref>). Improved adipose tissue function is also observed in SCAT explants isolated from obese subjects treated ex vivo with metformin but not in isolated adipocytes suggesting that metformin affected cells from the stroma vascular fraction, that contains adipose stromal cells, and not directly differentiated adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zulian et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, metformin improved expression of genes involved in adipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis, arguing for its ability to improve adipose function during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kulkarni et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The present study had several limitations. First, we used ASCs obtained from abdominal SCAT; ASCs obtained from other subcutaneous or VAT depots might not behave in the same way. Another limitation concerns the use of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), which is required for the prolonged in vitro expansion of ASCs. It has been shown that FGF2‐treated ASCs are larger, less readily proliferative, and more senescent than control ASCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we cannot rule out a possible masking effect of FGF2 on the aging of ASCs. Finally, we cannot address in our ASC model the potential role of the cross talk with immune cells that could also affect adipose tissue functions.</p><p>Aging is associated with the induction of senescence and associated disorders (including impaired adipogenesis, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance) in ASCs isolated from SCAT. These changes might be involved in the alterations in fat redistribution (particularly a paucity of SCAT, favoring VAT accumulation) and cardiometabolic diseases observed during aging. Our results suggest that metformin may be a promising candidate for treating age-related dysfunction in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and thus warrants evaluation in a clinical setting.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A recapitulative scheme of the alterations observed in adipose stromal cells undergoing in vitro,

After centrifugation, stromal vascular fraction was filtered, rinsed, and plated (10,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium alpha (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, France) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (PAN-Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), 2 mmol/L glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mmol/L HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 2.5 ng/mL FGF2 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ). On average, we isolated 65,000 cells per mL of SCAT liposuction sample, with similar yield between SCAT from aged or young donors. Upon confluence, adherent cells were trypsinized (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and seeded at a density of 2000/cm<sup>2</sup> for the study of proliferating ASCs and of 4000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> prior to the induction of adipogenesis. During expansion, cells were exposed (or not) to 25 µmol/L metformin (Merck, Sigma-Aldrich, St Quentin Fallavier, France). The metformin concentration chosen in our study is close to Cmax observed in elderly subjects, which exhibited higher average Cmax than younger subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jang et al., 2016</xref>). At a late passage (P11), cells were exposed (or not) to 0.1 µmol/L of compound C (Merck, Sigma-Aldrich).

The percentage of blue SA-β-galactosidase-positive cells was estimated by cell counting in at least three random-selected fields at a magnification of 20×. The acidotropic dye Lysotracker (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) was used to evaluate the lysosomal mass. Cells cultured in 96-well plates (Corning, New York, NY) were incubated with Lysotracker for 2 hr at 37°C.

Cell lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against the activated forms (Ser473 phosphorylation) of Akt (Cell Signaling Technology). Protein expression was checked using antibodies against Akt (Cell Signaling Technology). Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was measured using the Glucose Uptake-Glo assay kit (Promega, Fitchburg, WI), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, on day 14, adipocytes were serum-starved for 18 hr. Prior to the experiment, cells were incubated for 1 hr in glucose-free DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Next, 100 nmol/L insulin and 2-deoxyglucose mix were successively added for 60 and 10 min, respectively. In parallel with the insulin-stimulated and non-stimulated conditions, 50 µmol/L of the actin-disrupting agent cytochalasin B (Merck, Sigma-Aldrich) was added as a negative control and enabled determination of the net insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.

The authors provided more consolidated evidence linking fundamental aging processes, oxidative stress, cellular senescence and mitochondrial dysfunction to a progressive functional decline in adipose tissue. They also performed more mechanistic studies to explain the beneficial effects of metformin, such as stress resistance in human ASC. I believe that the authors provide sufficient data to support the main hypothesis in the current manuscript. I'm satisfied with all responses from the authors.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Metformin alleviates aging-associated cellular senescence of human adipose stem cells and derived adipocytes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yi Zhu (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>We feel that the major conclusions are right but the manuscript and story is not quite clear enough at present and there is a lack of deeper cellular and molecular mechanistic understanding of these phenomena to distinguish this work from the previous published studies. That ASC senescence impairs adipogenic differentiation capacity, has been previously reported in e<italic>Life</italic> in 2015 (doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.12997). For example, you concluded that adipose derived progenitor cells from older adults have higher potential to become senescence, which impaired adipogenesis. The percentage of senescent cells in adipose tissues is low, but the mechanism of how they could significantly affect adipose tissue functions is unknown. Is this through paracrine effects? or cross talk with other immune cells? etc..</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Although the authors found that ASC senescence is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, it the nature of the links between these cellular events is unclear. It is well-known that mitochondrial dysfunction can directly lead to senescence. If the authors meant to prove that ASC senescence causes early adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction, more evidence is required.</p><p>2. It has already been reported that ASC senescence impairs adipogenic differentiation capacity, in e<italic>Life</italic> in 2015 (doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.12997). Furthermore, although the authors found that metformin prevents the onset of senescence and associated dysfunctions in ASCs, it has been shown in many publications that metformin is a senomorphic drug that can reduce the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. So it is not surprising that metformin can block the effects of senescent ASCs. Also regarding the increased adipogenesis by metformin, it has been reported that metformin can directly regulate adipogenic transcription factors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα). As such, sufficient novelty is lacking at this point, and would require demonstration of causal links among these cellular events.</p><p>3. Several conclusions need to be smoothed out and discussed in more detail. Methods must be described with more details, especially with regard to fat depot digestion (type of collagenase, concentration of collagenase, amount of tissue used for the digestion, are cell yields similar between young and old adipose tissue? Number of plated ASC?). The authors must consider that the term ASC is nowadays related to Adipose stromal cells and not Stem cells. As described in the introduction and method sections, ASC are stromal cells that adhere to plastic including fibroblast, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, endothelial cells, resident macrophages, preadipocytes and progenitors.

That ASC senescence impairs adipogenic differentiation capacity, has been previously reported in eLife in 2015 (doi: 10.7554/eLife.12997). For example, you concluded that adipose derived progenitor cells from older adults have higher potential to become senescence, which impaired adipogenesis. The percentage of senescent cells in adipose tissues is low, but the mechanism of how they could significantly affect adipose tissue functions is unknown. Is this through paracrine effects? or cross talk with other immune cells? etc..</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewers, and the reviewing Editor for their constructive comments that helped us to improve the quality of our manuscript. We now clearly outline that ASCs senescence could be either related to the in vitro aging (due to increased cell passages) or to the in vivo aging (stress-induced). These situations differently affect adipocyte differentiation and function. In our model we could not evaluate the role of the cross-talk with immune cells. We indicate that point as a limitation at the end of the discussion. We confirm the potential role of activin secreted by senescent cells and acting through paracrine mechanisms as previously shown [1]. We provide below a point-by-point reply to the reviewers’ remarks and criticisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Although the authors found that ASC senescence is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, it the nature of the links between these cellular events is unclear. It is well-known that mitochondrial dysfunction can directly lead to senescence.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study we used ASCs isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue of young and aged donors (named young-donor ASCs and aged-donor ASCs) both of which underwent in vitro aging over the culture passages. Therefore, we can evaluate 3 age-related processes: in vitro aging alone (young-donor ASCs with increasing passage number), in vivo physiological aging alone (aged-donor ASCs at early passage, P3) and in vitro and in vivo aging together (aged-donor ASCs at increasing cell passage numbers). Thus, we were able to analyze the defects presented by ASCs in each situation and the resulting adipose dysfunction presented by adipocyte-differentiated ASCs.</p><p>Regarding young-donor ASCs, we observed that, at P3, the level of senescence was minimal but increased cell passage number in vitro led to ASCs senescence without oxidative stress. In this situation, adipocyte differentiated-ASCs showed decreased adipogenesis starting from P7 but without mitochondrial dysfunction, despite mild oxidative stress.</p><p>Conversely, physiological aging (aged-donor ASCs at P3) was characterized by oxidative stress in proliferating ASCs but no mitochondrial dysfunction as evaluated by JC1. To go further, we performed additional Seahorse experiments. Young- and aged-donor ASCs presented a similar respiration profile, indicating the absence of mitochondrial dysfunction. These results suggest that increased ROS production observed in aged-donor ASCs at P3 did not initially result from mitochondrial dysfunction (new Figure 2). Interestingly, adipocytes differentiated from these aged ASCs, at this early passage, maintained their adipogenic potential but presented early oxidative stress. In addition, they presented mitochondrial dysfunction as outlined by seahorse experiments (new Figure 4). Altogether, these results are in favor of different senescence mechanisms depending on chronological (in vitro passages) or physiological (age of the donor) aging. in vitro passageinduced senescence impedes adipocyte differentiation while stress-induced senescence (as observed in physiological aging in aged-donor ASCs at P3) results in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction but not impaired differentiation in derived adipocytes. When aged-donor ASCs age in vitro, the two processes are present resulting in severe dysfunction in adipocyte differentiated-ASCs.</p><p>We have now changed the manuscript accordingly in the results and Discussion sections and added the seahorse experiment (Figure 2 and 4 in the revised manuscript). For these experiments, we benefited from the help and expertise of our collaborators Roberta Foresti, Roberto Motterlini, and Mireille Laforge. Therefore, they were included in the authors of the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the authors meant to prove that ASC senescence causes early adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction, more evidence is required.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data reveal that in vitro aging of young-donor ASCs, that resulted in ASC senescence, was not associated with early mitochondrial dysfunction in derived adipocytes (at P7, Figure 3F and G), thus disentangling ASC senescence and adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. This sentence was added in the Results section.</p><p>To investigate the impact of physiological aging of ASCs, we analyzed the respiration profile at P3 in adipocyte differentiated-ASCs from young and aged donors. The analysis of basal OCR did not reveal any significant difference. However, the adipocyte differentiated from aged-donors ASCs displayed a major decrease in their maximal respiratory capacity as compared to those from young-donor ASCs, as indicated by a significantly lower increase in OCR after the addition of the uncoupling agent FCCP (new Figure. 4). Therefore, increased oxidative stress associated with mild senescence in aged-donor ASCs resulted in mitochondrial dysfunction in ASC-derived adipocytes, suggesting that adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction could be linked to increased oxidative stress in ASCs. This sentence was added in the Result section and discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>To further delineate the link between oxidative stress and senescence of ASCs and of derived adipocytes, we induced senescence of young-donor ASCs at P3 by treating them with an HIV protease inhibitor (PI) and analyzed the impact of this stress-induced senescence on adipocyte differentiated-ASCs. PIs are known to induce senescence by accumulating farnesylated prelamin A, responsible for premature aging syndromes [2-5]. As shown in new Figure 5, a treatment for 30 days of ASCs with lopinavir associated with a low dose of ritonavir (LPV/r) led to senescence but also to a high level of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions (destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, as shown by the JC1 assay despite increased mitochondrial mass). Adipocytes derived from these LPV/r-treated ASCs, which presented severe oxidative stress and marked senescence, exhibited increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions together with altered adipogenesis. This confirmed that induction of oxidative stress and senescence in young ASCs resulted in severe adipose dysfunction in derived adipocytes. Interestingly, another π with less adverse effects, darunavir associated with a low dose of ritonavir (DRV/r), did not increase senescence in ASCs but induced mild oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Accordingly, treatment of ASCs with DRV/r did not impede adipocyte differentiation, further indicating that mild oxidative stress in the absence of senescence in ASCs did not impair adipogenesis.</p><p>Overall, our results are in favor of the hypothesis that mild oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction do not preclude differentiation of ASC-derived adipocyte. Therefore, we were able to disentangle the effect of senescence alone versus oxidative stress on ASC-derived adipocyte differentiation, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We added these data in the revised manuscript with new figures 2, 4, and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It has already been reported that ASC senescence impairs adipogenic differentiation capacity, in eLife in 2015 (doi: 10.7554/eLife.12997).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it has already been reported that ASC senescence impairs adipogenic differentiation capacity. Our data are in agreement with this point. Moreover, we further show that in vitro passage-related senescence impairs adipogenesis even in the absence of increased oxidative stress. Thus, in our study we show, for the first time, that during physiological aging (aged-donor ASCs at early passage), adipocyte differentiated-ASCs present early oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions but not reduced adipogenic potential. Thus, senescence, but not oxidative stress alone, impairs adipogenic differentiation. However, when oxidative stress is high, this results in stress-induced senescence and in turn in reduced adipogenic differentiation. Our results allow to better decipher the respective role of oxidative stress and senescence regarding adipogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, although the authors found that metformin prevents the onset of senescence and associated dysfunctions in ASCs, it has been shown in many publications that metformin is a senomorphic drug that can reduce the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. So it is not surprising that metformin can block the effects of senescent ASCs.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the effect of metformin, we agree with the reviewer that it can reduce the SASP. Accordingly, we observed a decrease in activin A secretion in response to metformin in both young-donor and aged-donor ASCs regardless the passage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). However, in our model metformin did not restore the adipogenic capacity of young-donor ASCs at P11 that present senescence but not oxidative stress, suggesting that (i) metformin could act by another mechanism and (ii) metformin was not able to reverse the ASCs’ senescence features when oxidative stress is low (iii) metformin was able to reverse stress-induced senescence by acting on oxidative stress.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Activin A secretion increases with ASCs senescence.</title><p>The results correspond to the mean ± SEM. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01, ***P&lt;0.001 for aged-donor vs. young-donor ASCs, §P&lt;0.05, §§P&lt;0.01 metformin-treated vs. non-treated ASCs.

Accordingly, we found that metformin was a potent antioxidant and prevented the onset of mitochondrial dysfunction in aged-donor ASCs. In young-donor ASCs at P11, which display senescence features and low oxidative stress, metformin had no impact on oxidative stress and did not improve adipogenesis.</p><p>This effect is believed to be related to metformin’s ability to inhibit complex 1 in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to activation of AMPK. In agreement, we observed that the beneficial effects of metformin were lost in the presence of compound C (a potent AMPK inhibitor) (see figure 8 in the revised manuscript) – highlighting the central role of the AMPK-linked signaling network in the ASCs aging process [7,8]. To confirm this hypothesis, we directly activated AMPK using AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside), an agonist of the AMPK pathway [9]. The direct activation of AMPK by AICAR led to an impact on ASCs similar to that observed in the presence of metformin, characterized by decreased oxidative stress and senescence of aged-donor ASCs at P11 (new Figure 8—figure supplement 1). AICAR treatment also led to decreased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunctions in derived adipocytes together with improved adipogenesis (new Figure 8—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also regarding the increased adipogenesis by metformin, it has been reported that metformin can directly regulate adipogenic transcription factors, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα). As such, sufficient novelty is lacking at this point, and would require demonstration of causal links among these cellular events.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, metformin can directly regulate adipogenic transcription factors. Metformin has been shown to inhibit [10-12] or increase adipogenesis [13], depending on the concentration used [14], when cells are exposed throughout the differentiation process. In our study, we used a different model in which ASCs were treated with metformin only before the induction of differentiation. By removing metformin during ASCs differentiation, we were able to rule out a direct effect on adipogenesis (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1). We have added a figure illustrating the protocol used in our study to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In addition to all the changes made throughout the paper, we toned down some of our conclusions. Moreover, our results allowed us to discuss the fact that ASCs senescence could be either related to in vitro aging (due to increased cell passages) or to in vivo aging (stress-induced).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods must be described with more details, especially with regard to fat depot digestion (type of collagenase, concentration of collagenase, amount of tissue used for the digestion, are cell yields similar between young and old adipose tissue? Number of plated ASC?).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and we added the missing information in the Material and Methods section. The amount of tissue used depended on the volume of the sample withdrawn during surgery. However, the collagenase digestion protocol was always the same (we used a ratio of 2/3 of 0,2% collagenase combined with 1/3 of adipose tissue). Similarly, the cells were counted and plated at the same density (10,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> in T75 flasks). On average, we isolated 65,000 cells per mL of SCAT liposuction sample, with similar yield in SCAT obtained from aged or young donors. These points are now detailed in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors must consider that the term ASC is nowadays related to Adipose stromal cells and not Stem cells. As described in the introduction and method sections, ASC are stromal cells that adhere to plastic including fibroblast, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, endothelial cells, resident macrophages, preadipocytes and progenitors.

Conversely, physiological aging (aged-donors versus young-donors) led to premature senescence and increased oxidative stress as soon as P3 as observed in proliferating ASCs obtained from aged-donors.

However, we performed an additional experiment in which AMPK was directly activated by its agonist AICAR. In these experiments, young-donor and aged-donor ASCs were cultured until P11 and then treated or not with AICAR and metformin for 7 days. Our results clearly show that AMPK activation reversed ASCs senescence and led to functional adipocytes. Since the effect of AICAR was observed after 7 days of treatment and was similar to the effect of metformin given for a long period, we think that our results cannot be explained by a resistance to metformin after a long duration of treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When taking into account the large number of individuals treated with metformin, is there any evidence of an impact of metformin treatment on age-related loss in subcutaneous adipose tissue?</p></disp-quote><p>Several clinical studies strongly suggest that metformin could improve adipose tissue function. A treatment with metformin leads, in most cases, to reduced weight, i.e. global fat loss, and improved insulin sensitivity, and these effects are largely related to actions outside adipose tissue. A few studies evaluated the effect of metformin on the different fat depots. In the large study “Diabetes Prevention Program Research group” with more than 3,000 glucose intolerant subjects, mean age 54 years, treated with placebo or metformin or lifestyle intervention, both SCAT and VAT were reduced in women after 1 year of treatment with metformin [15]. As well, adiponectin level was mildly improved while leptin was decreased in favor of improved adipose tissue function [16]. Improved adipose tissue function is also observed in SCAT explants issued from obese subjects treated ex vivo with metformin. The treatment resulted in increased adiponectin expression. As well, a 3-month treatment of obese subjects with metformin resulted in increased adiponectin expression in SCAT. Interestingly this effect was observed in SCAT biopsies but not when adipocytes differentiated from patients’ adipose stromal cells were treated in vitro with metformin suggesting that metformin affected cells from the stroma vascular fraction, that contains adipose stromal cells, and not directly differentiated adipocytes [17]. Finally, a study evaluated, in a cross-over study, the effect of metformin versus placebo on SCAT parameters from aged subjects (mean age 71 years). As expected, treatment with metformin resulted in weight loss and overall improved insulin sensitivity. Interestingly, in adipose tissue, metformin improved expression of genes involved in PPAR signaling and in SREBP signaling and triglyceride synthesis, arguing for its ability to improve adipose function during aging [18].</p><p>Part of this paragraph is now added in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, inhibition of senescence may lead to cancer development. Authors must discuss this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that metformin did not improve directly senescence of adipose stromal cells but decreased oxidative stress and therefore decreased stress-induced senescence in these cells. Reactive oxygen species are considered as favoring DNA damage and carcinogenesis. To reduce oxidative stress is generally considered as favorable regarding this process.</p><p>Regarding the ability of metformin to modulate cancer development, a high number of studies have shown that metformin exerts antitumor effects. At first, the ability of metformin to reduce cancer risk was reported in patients with type-2 diabetes receiving metformin as an antidiabetic agent. Then, this was also shown in retrospective and meta-analysis studies regarding some cancers, which showed that metformin improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival, mainly in early-stage colorectal and prostate cancers [19]. Different mechanisms have been described among which the activation of AMPK and the reduction of oxidative stress but also a number of mechanisms independent of AMPK activation [20]. Even if studies are required to further decipher these mechanisms, no alert on a pro-oncogenic effect of metformin has been raised.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
