The Arabidopsis reference genome sequence was published as the first nuclear genome of a flowering plant in 2000 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsis.org/">http://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arabidopsis Genome Initiative, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Somerville and Koornneef, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koornneef and Meinke, 2010</xref>). The ease and speed with which experiments can be conducted on <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has allowed enormous fundamental progress in our knowledge of the molecular principles of plant development, cell biology, metabolism, physiology, genetics and epigenetics (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arabidopsisbook.org/">http://www.arabidopsisbook.org/</ext-link>). The many uses of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> as the universal reference plant continue to expand, particularly in the field of systems biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brady et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Endo et al., 2014</xref>), and more recently provide a means of placing molecular functions into an ecological and evolutionary context in natural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tian et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mitchell-Olds and Schmitt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso-Blanco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bergelson and Roux, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fournier-Level et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hancock et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Züst et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Many of the traits that render <italic>A. thaliana</italic> an attractive model plant also constitute adaptations that reflect the ecological niche occupied by this species, such as the short generation time and the ability to self-fertilize (selfing). Indeed, the natural history of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> differs notably from that of the species in its sister group of the most closely related existing plant species, which includes <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis arenosa</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis croatica</italic>, and the three species <italic>Arabidopsis halleri</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis cebennensis</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis pedemontana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koch and Matschinger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hohmann et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Within these six evolutionary lineages, a number of phylogenetically (as yet) unresolved taxa have been described, as have auto- and allopolyploidization events (see Glossary). The divergence time of the common ancestor of these species and the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> lineage was estimated at around 5 million years ago (Mya) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koch et al., 2000</xref>), with upper and lower bounds of 17.9 and 3.1 Mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beilstein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ossowski et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, divergence occurred immediately before or during the transition from a warm period to progressively colder climates, followed by rapid glacial cycles from 3 Mya until the latest glacial maximum about 18,000 years ago. There has even been a natural allopolyploidization event between <italic>A. arenosa</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> 10,000–300,000 years ago, giving rise to <italic>Arabidopsis suecica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sall et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jakobsson et al., 2006</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06100.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>A. thaliana</italic> and a subset of species from its sister clade.</title><p>From left to right: <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Col), <italic>A. halleri</italic> (ssp. <italic>halleri</italic>; individual Lan5, Langelsheim, Harz, Germany), <italic>A. lyrata</italic> (ssp. <italic>lyrata</italic>; selfing accession Great Lakes, North America), and <italic>A. croatica</italic> (Baške Oštarje/Ljubičko Brdo, Croatia). <italic>A. thaliana</italic> was grown from seed to early reproductive stage, and the other species were propagated vegetatively and grown for 3–6 months.

The species is a colonizer and pioneer plant of disturbed, poor, stony or shallow soils, and it can also be found in nutrient-poor, often sandy, meadow and forest habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mitchell-Olds and Schmitt, 2006</xref>). Similarly, the species closely related to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are able to colonize bare rocky habitats. Sequence polymorphism data provide evidence for a historical expansion of the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> species population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nordborg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schmid et al., 2005</xref>), thus differing from the known demographic histories of the non-hybrid species in its sister group in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wright et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heidel et al., 2010</xref>). It has been suggested that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> re-colonized Central Europe from glacial refugia in the Caucasus or Balkans between ∼10,000 and 5000 years ago, possibly accompanying the spread of human farming from the Near East (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Francois et al., 2008</xref>). There is also clear evidence for additional glacial refugia for <italic>A. thaliana</italic> in the Mediterranean region, including the North African Atlas Mountains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brennan et al., 2014</xref>), and for additional migration (for example, from the Iberian peninsula in a northeastern direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sharbel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pico et al., 2008</xref>]), as well as for population structure reflecting isolation by distance in Eurasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nordborg et al., 2005</xref>). This reflects an evolutionary history of vast climatic and environmental fluctuations, likely including a series of alternating phases of population size contraction and expansion with migration and admixture following glacial cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beck et al., 2008</xref>). In the past few 100 years, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has further expanded its geographic and climatic range in synanthropy (see Glossary), migrating to and across North America, as well as southward in Africa, and more recently to East Asia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The present climatic and geographic range of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is larger than that of any of its close relatives, which have either not expanded into warmer climates or are local endemics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koch and Matschinger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hohmann et al., 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06100.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Map of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> worldwide distribution.</title><p>Areas colored in red correspond to the continuous distribution of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>; red circles mark additional sites.

Estimates place these transitions as having occurred, based on different approaches, at around 0.4 Mya or around ≥1 Mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bechsgaard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tang et al., 2007</xref>). By contrast, most species closely related to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are either predominantly or strictly outcrossing (the latter if species are strongly self-incompatible). In addition to selfing, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is an annual plant with a rapid life cycle that can be as short as 6–8 weeks in some accessions, whereas most of its close relatives are biannuals or herbaceous perennials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Shehbaz and O'Kane, 2002</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1, 2</xref>). Vegetative <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants are smaller in size than most of its close relatives, and their survival and reproduction are comparably robust in a variety of environments. The leaves of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are positioned to form a more compact rosette, and inflorescences are more erect and elongated, than in its close relative <italic>A. halleri</italic>. These morphological differences are likely to constitute adaptations to differing environments. By comparison to its sister group of species, the flowering of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is highly synchronized, with the formation of a larger number of siliques (seed pods) per plant, each containing a higher, or far higher, number of seeds that are smaller in size compared to those of its relatives. Seeds of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are long-lived and highly viable by comparison to those of <italic>A. halleri</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> (Ute Krämer, personal observation). These features of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> render it ideal for mutagenesis, genetics, and for the identification, selection and propagation of mutant or transgenic lines, as well as for stock maintenance.</p><p>The complexity of organ architecture appears to be reduced in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.

This organization differs from the roots of its close relative <italic>A. halleri</italic>, which contain two additional cell layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hanikenne et al., 2008</xref>), and is in stark contrast to root tissues composed of multiple cell layers, as found in many other plants. The metabolic cost of building an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> root is evidently minimal, and this is likely to have ecological implications which have yet to be determined.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06100.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The simple anatomy of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> roots.</title><p>Longitudinal (left) and transverse (right) confocal sections of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> roots.

These properties of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> have greatly facilitated the sequencing, assembly and annotation of its genome, as well as molecular genetics and genomics approaches.</p><p>All of these characteristic features of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are likely to constitute adaptations that jointly define the ecological niche of the species and reflect an ecological strategy that has apparently been highly successful in recent evolutionary history.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Plant development and its environmental control</title><p>Classical molecular genetics approaches have been used in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to dissect the patterning and development of flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meyerowitz et al., 1991</xref>), embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mayer et al., 1991</xref>), leaves and roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Di Laurenzio et al., 1996</xref>), and of the maintenance of stem cell niches at the plant's growing tips. These stem cells fuel the ongoing (indeterminate) growth that is characteristic of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Clark et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lenhard et al., 2001</xref>). The biology of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is rich in temperature- and light-dependent regulation, some of which might be triggered by photosynthates (see Glossary) rather than by light itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haydon et al., 2013</xref>). Important work has investigated the molecular networks that mediate environmentally controlled developmental switches in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, as well as natural intraspecific variation in phenology (see Glossary). Examples include the light-regulated development of seedlings (photomorphogenesis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deng et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nemhauser, 2008</xref>), the transition from vegetative to reproductive development, also termed flowering time control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Simpson and Dean, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Valverde et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andres and Coupland, 2012</xref>), and seed dormancy and germination control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bentsink et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Graeber et al., 2012</xref>), as well as natural variation in these traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brachi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chiang et al., 2013</xref>). The need for developmental transitions to be timed accurately and robustly is reflected in the emerging complex, multi-layered epigenetic regulation of some key loci, for example the flowering control gene <italic>Flowering Locus C</italic> (<italic>FLC</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Simpson and Dean, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Csorba et al., 2014</xref>). Such complex regulation in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> may have evolved in a step-wise fashion alongside recurrent climatic fluctuations encountered by <italic>A. thaliana</italic> during its evolutionary history. Nevertheless, contemporary global warming appears to proceed faster than the local adaptation of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilczek et al., 2014</xref>), based on the reproductive fitness of plants grown at locations across the European distribution range from stored seeds, which were collected in different geographic regions between 4 and 70 years earlier.</p><p>Phenotypic plasticity and utilizing limited local resources in bare habitats for rapid and ample reproduction appear to be characteristics of the life history of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. The plant also seemingly evades periodic or episodic environmental adversities, including between-plant competition, <italic>via</italic> a rapid life cycle. Consequently, the adjustment of developmental timing to environmental conditions is likely to be of major importance in the phenotypic plasticity of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Martinez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Riboni et al., 2014</xref>), and an apparent target of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Horton et al., 2012</xref>). This might also contribute further to the observed regulatory complexity of flowering time control (see preceding paragraph).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Other interactions with the environment</title><p>In contrast to the vast majority of flowering plants, the roots of the Brassicaceae generally do not undergo mycorrhizal or rhizobial symbiosis. This is likely to make <italic>A. thaliana</italic> comparably independent of specific soil microbes or microbiomes, which may be advantageous for a colonizer of recently disturbed and exposed soils. Additionally, it allows the plant to commit all energy expenditure to its own growth and reproduction, but heightens the demands on the endogenous machinery for nutrient acquisition and efficiency, and for protecting roots from environmental stress. Some of the central molecular components of these pathways have been identified in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> before their discovery in other kingdoms of life, for example, the biosynthesis of low-molecular-weight chelators for micronutrient metal cations through nicotianamine synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Trampczynska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schuler et al., 2012</xref>), and for both micronutrient and non-essential toxic metal cations through phytochelatin synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Clemens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tennstedt et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the effective and balanced acquisition of adequate quantities of inorganic nutrients, such as phosphate, nitrogen and iron, and their efficient utilization by <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants have been observed and characterized at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hindt and Guerinot, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Araya et al., 2014</xref>). When natural accessions of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are cultivated under uniform controlled conditions, genetically controlled within-species variation is observed in leaf nutrient concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Atwell et al., 2010</xref>), which appears to be adaptive at least in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Poormohammad Kiani et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Key traits of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are the timing of germination to coincide with favorable environmental conditions, a short life cycle, and the ability to tolerate unfavorably hot or dry conditions in the form of de-hydrated seeds. Consequently, we would expect stress tolerance to be less elaborate in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> than in some other plants. Indeed, despite a very wide geographic distribution range, there are no reports of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> accessions that exhibit extreme physiological traits, different from its sister group of plant species. As one out of a total of ∼500 known metal hyperaccumulator plant species (see Glossary), <italic>A. halleri</italic> accumulates extraordinarily high concentrations of zinc and cadmium in leaves where these metals act as a so-called elemental defense against biotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Boyd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Krämer, 2010</xref>). In addition, several species in the sister clade of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> are well-known members of plant communities found in extreme habitats. Calamine soils rich in zinc, cadmium and lead—commonly as a result of anthropogenic pollution—are readily colonized by <italic>A. halleri</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ernst, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Krämer, 2010</xref>), and occasionally by <italic>A. arenosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Przedpełska and Wierzbicka, 2007</xref>). In addition, there are some natural populations of <italic>A. arenosa</italic> and <italic>A. lyrata</italic> on nutrient-poor ultramafic soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Holubover serpentinite, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Turner et al., 2010</xref>), which contain high levels of nickel and magnesium originating from the local bedrock (see Glossary). Finally, populations of <italic>A. lyrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Shehbaz and O'Kane, 2002</xref>) and <italic>A. croatica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Plants, 2014</xref>) characteristically inhabit calcareous outcrops (see Glossary).</p><p>Above-ground (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vorholt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Horton et al., 2014</xref>) and below-ground organs of <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and their immediate vicinity, provide habitats for microbial communities, which appear to be more strongly influenced by soil type than by plant genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Bulgarelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lundberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schlaeppi et al., 2014</xref>). These microbial communities can include commensals (see Glossary), as well as various naturally occurring viral, bacterial, fungal and oomycete pathogens. Arabidopsis possesses a wealth of general molecular pattern-triggered innate immunity responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schwessinger and Ronald, 2012</xref>) and more-specific, effector-triggered and <italic>Resistance</italic> (<italic>R</italic>) gene-dependent, defenses against microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cui et al., 2014</xref>) (see Glossary). Their elucidation has extensively contributed to our understanding of plant defenses against pathogens. By comparison, we understand far less about how pathogens shape genetic diversity in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Karasov et al., 2014</xref>) and about the establishment and maintenance of beneficial interactions of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> with microbes, such as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and microbes that trigger induced systemic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lugtenberg and Kamilova, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pieterse et al., 2014</xref>) (see Glossary). Once <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has initiated reproductive development, reproduction is favored over defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Winter et al., 2011</xref>). This is consistent with the general ecological strategy of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> towards an escape from stress through resource allocation that prioritizes reproduction, followed by a rapid conclusion of the life cycle, which differs from its longer-lived relatives. Similarities have been noted between plant defenses and animal innate immunity. These relate primarily to the domain architectures of NLR (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat) protein receptors (see Glossary) that function in the detection of biotic attack, and the programmed cell death that occurs as a host defense response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maekawa et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> possesses effective defenses against herbivory, for example by insects and snails, with an important role for secondary metabolites. Most prominently, a class of sulfur-rich compounds, called glucosinolates (see Glossary), are converted to pungent and toxic breakdown products in damaged tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Halkier and Gershenzon, 2006</xref>). These compounds are agronomically important determinants of taste and are receiving much attention as health-protective, anti-cancer components of ‘functional foods’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sonderby et al., 2010</xref>). Upon leaf wounding, the systemic activation of defenses in distant leaves involves the long-distance movement of electrical surface potential changes at velocities between 43 and 150 µm s<sup>−1</sup> involving ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR)-related membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mousavi et al., 2013</xref>). Strikingly, this bears some similarity to the role of vertebrate iGluRs in fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. The fast systemic movement of electrical signals turns out to be of broader importance in plant responses to the environment. For example, upon exposure of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> to salt stress, a systemic signal moves from root to shoot in the form of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave at a velocity of 400 µm s<sup>−1</sup>, requiring the vacuolar ion channel TPC1 (Two Pore Ca<sup>2+</sup> Channel protein 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Choi et al., 2014</xref>). These findings underpin the central importance of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> as a model for obtaining molecular insights into fundamentally novel aspects of plant biology.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Metabolism in the context of natural history</title><p>Metabolic properties are noteworthy components of natural history because they are likely to facilitate, constrain or even prevent specific adaptations in a given lineage sharing them. With respect to nutrient ions, plants of the Brassicaceae family were classified as calciotrophic, based on their ability to store comparably large quantities of dissolved calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kinzel, 1982</xref>). This is physiologically challenging because cytosolic free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels have to be maintained at very low (&lt;0.1 µM) resting levels continuously in order to allow for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated signaling to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Choi et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, calciophobic plants contain Ca in the form of insoluble precipitates, mostly oxalates. In calciotrophic plants, leaf Ca concentrations are generally higher than leaf potassium concentrations, as is common in the Brassicaceae, Papaveraceae and Resedaceae families, but rare in other plant families. Calcium cations are stored inside cell vacuoles alongside other solutes, including the organic acid anions malate or citrate, which act as both chelators and charge balance for Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The large capacity that Brassicaceae family members have for storing divalent cations in their vacuoles might explain why this family comprises ∼50% of all known metal hyperaccumulator plant taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Krämer, 2010</xref>). Moreover, the absence of adaptation to extreme osmotic conditions in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> could result from its metabolism, which appears to generally avoid high internal osmotic potentials by storing osmotically inactive starch instead of osmotically active photosynthetic sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Streb and Zeeman, 2012</xref>). Finally, in association with the high sulfur content of glucosinolates, the Brassicaceae exhibit an active sulfur metabolism and a comparably elevated requirement for sulfate as a nutrient in the soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marschner, 1995</xref>). More data are required for future comparisons between <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and its sister clade.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conclusions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a well-established model in molecular genetics and plant cell biology, is progressively being adopted by ecologists and evolutionary biologists, who require far more information on the sites of origin of natural accessions than is contained in the written records of the earlier collections.
