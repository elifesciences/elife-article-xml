Vertebrates have evolved programmed cell death pathways that sense invasive enteric pathogens and eliminate their intracellular niche. Previously we reported that genetic removal of one such pathway, the NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome, is sufficient to convert mice from resistant to susceptible to oral <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> challenge (Mitchell et al., 2020). Here, we investigate the protective role of additional cell death pathways during oral mouse <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. We find that the Caspase-11 inflammasome, which senses <italic>Shigella</italic> LPS, restricts <italic>Shigella</italic> colonization of the intestinal epithelium in the absence of NAIP–NLRC4. However, this protection is limited when <italic>Shigella</italic> expresses OspC3, an effector that antagonizes Caspase-11 activity. TNFα, a cytokine that activates Caspase-8-dependent apoptosis, also provides potent protection from <italic>Shigella</italic> colonization of the intestinal epithelium when mice lack both NAIP–NLRC4 and Caspase-11. The combined genetic removal of Caspases-1, -11, and -8 renders mice hyper-susceptible to oral <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Our findings uncover a layered hierarchy of cell death pathways that limit the ability of an invasive gastrointestinal pathogen to cause disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pathogenesis</kwd><kwd><italic>Shigella</italic></kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI075039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI063302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI155634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic analyses using a new oral infection mouse model demonstrate that cell death pathways protect against the gastrointestinal bacterial pathogen <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Shigella</italic> is a genus of enteric bacterial pathogens that causes ~270 million yearly cases of shigellosis, with ~200,000 of these resulting in death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khalil et al., 2018</xref>). Shigellosis manifests as an acute inflammatory colitis resulting in abdominal cramping, fever, and in severe cases, bloody diarrhea (dysentery) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kotloff et al., 2018</xref>). Bacterial invasion of the colonic intestinal epithelium and subsequent dissemination between adjacent intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is believed to drive inflammation and disease. <italic>Shigella</italic> pathogenesis is mediated by a virulence plasmid which encodes a type three secretion system (T3SS) and more than 30 virulence factors or effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schnupf and Sansonetti, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schroeder and Hilbi, 2008</xref>). The T3SS injects effectors into the host cell to facilitate bacterial invasion, escape into the cytosol, and disarmament of the host innate immune response to make the cytosol a hospitable niche for replicating <italic>Shigella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashida et al., 2015</xref>). The virulence plasmid also encodes IcsA, a bacterial surface protein that facilitates cytosolic actin-based motility and is essential for bacterial spread to neighboring IECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernardini et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldberg and Theriot, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mattock and Blocker, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The innate immune system can counteract intracellular bacterial pathogens by inducing programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Williams, 1994</xref>). Programmed cell death eliminates the intracellular pathogen niche, maintains epithelial barrier integrity, promotes clearance of damaged cells, and enhances presentation of foreign antigens to cells of the adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deets et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jorgensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch and Nusrat, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yatim et al., 2017</xref>). Three main modes of programmed cell death are common to mammalian cells: pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Each is controlled by distinct sensors and conserved downstream executors which together provide a formidable barrier that pathogens must avoid or subvert for successful intracellular replication. Of particular relevance to <italic>Shigella</italic> and other gastrointestinal pathogens, cell death of IECs is accompanied by a unique cellular expulsion process that rapidly and selectively ejects dying or infected cells from the epithelial layer, thereby potently limiting pathogen invasion into deeper tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fattinger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knodler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sellin et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>Shigella</italic> is an example of a pathogen in intense conflict with host cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ashida et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Shigella</italic> encodes multiple effectors to prevent cell death in human cells, including OspC3 to block Caspase-4 inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oh et al., 2021</xref>), IpaH7.8 to inhibit Gasdermin D-dependent pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luchetti et al., 2021</xref>), OspC1 to suppress Caspase-8-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashida et al., 2020</xref>), and OspD3 to block necroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ashida et al., 2020</xref>). The antagonism of these pathways (and perhaps others that are yet undiscovered) and the resulting maintenance of the epithelial niche appears sufficient to render humans susceptible to <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Mice, however, are resistant to oral <italic>Shigella</italic> challenge because <italic>Shigella</italic> is unable to counteract epithelial NAIP–NLRC4-dependent cell death and expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>). Removal of the NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome renders mice susceptible to shigellosis, providing a tractable genetic model to dissect <italic>Shigella</italic> pathogenesis after oral infection in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use the NAIP–NLRC4-deficient mouse model of shigellosis to investigate the role of programmed cell death in defense against <italic>Shigella</italic> in vivo. We find that Caspase-11 (CASP11), a cytosolic sensor of LPS and the mouse ortholog of human Caspase-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2014</xref>), provides modest protection from <italic>Shigella</italic> infection in the absence of NAIP–NLRC4. As in humans, this pathway is antagonized by the <italic>Shigella</italic> effector OspC3, and genetic removal of <italic>ospC3</italic> from <italic>Shigella</italic> results in a significant CASP11-dependent reduction in bacterial colonization of IECs and virulence. We also find that TNFα, a cytokine that can induce TNF receptor 1 (TNFRI)-dependent extrinsic apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Piguet et al., 1998</xref>), defends mouse IECs from bacterial colonization and limits subsequent disease. TNFα-dependent protection is strongest when mice lack both NAIP–NLRC4 and CASP11, revealing a hierarchical program of cell death pathways that counteract <italic>Shigella</italic> in vivo. <italic>Casp1/11<sup>–/–</sup>Ripk3<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and <italic>Casp8<sup>–/–</sup>Ripk3<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice, which lack some but not all key components of pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, are largely protected from disease, revealing redundancies among these pathways. <italic>Casp1/11/8<sup>–/–</sup>Ripk3<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice, however, are hyper-susceptible to shigellosis, indicating that programmed cell death is a predominant host defense mechanism against <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Furthermore, neither interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R)-mediated signaling nor myeloid-restricted NAIP–NLRC4 have an apparent effect on <italic>Shigella</italic> pathogenesis, suggesting that it is cell death of IECs that primarily protects mice from shigellosis. Our findings underscore the importance of cell death in defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens and provide an example of how layered and hierarchical immune pathways can provide robust defense against pathogens that have evolved a broad arsenal of virulence factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CASP11 contributes to resistance of B6 versus 129 <italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice to shigellosis</title><p>We previously generated NLRC4-deficient mice on the 129S1/SvImJ (129) background (129.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic>) and observed that these mice appeared more susceptible to oral <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> challenge than C57BL/6J (B6) NLRC4-deficient mice (B6.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mitchell et al., 2020</xref>). We reasoned that the apparent difference between the strains might be due to genetic and/or microbiota differences. To address these possibilities, we infected co-housed B6.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and 129.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice and directly compared disease severity between the two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, light blue versus pink symbols). The B6.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice exhibited only modest weight loss (5–10% of starting weight) through two days and began to recover by day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The 129.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice, however, continued to lose weight through day 3 (10–15% of starting weight) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon sacrifice at day 3, we harvested the IEC fraction from the cecum and colon of each mouse, washed this fraction in gentamicin to eliminate any extracellular <italic>Shigella</italic>, and lysed these cells to enumerate intracellular bacterial colonization of IECs. IECs from 129.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice harbored &gt;10-fold higher intracellular <italic>Shigella</italic> burdens than those from B6.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also found that 129.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice had higher levels of inflammatory cytokines CXCL1 and IL-1β in their intestinal tissue, as measured by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). CXCL1 and IL-1β are NF-κB-induced cytokines previously implicated in driving disease during shigellosis by initiating inflammation and promoting innate immune cell recruitment to the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arondel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sansonetti et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sansonetti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singer and Sansonetti, 2004</xref>). Here, these cytokines serve as biomarkers of disease. Because the ELISA used cannot distinguish between pro-IL-1β and cleaved IL-1β, reported IL-1β levels reflect the strength of the NF-κB response (as do reported CXCL1 levels) rather than the strength of Caspase-1 activation. The 129.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice also exhibited significantly more gross cecum shrinkage than B6.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and there were modest but insignificant increases in diarrhea (as measured by the wet weight to dry weight ratio of mouse feces) in 129.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice relative to the B6.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice at 2 and 3 days post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We scored mouse feces for the presence of occult blood (score = 1) or macroscopic blood (score = 2) at days 2 and 3, the sum of which represents a blood score from 0 to 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). All 129.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice had occult blood in their feces on at least one of these days, with many having occult or macroscopic blood on both days.

Consistent with these results, mice that were homozygous 129/129 at <italic>Casp11</italic> also exhibited significantly enhanced bacterial colonization of the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We observed trending but insignificant increases in inflammatory cytokine CXCL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and cecum shrinkage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and significantly more pronounced diarrhea at day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) in mice that were 129/129 at <italic>Casp11</italic> relative to mice that were B6/129 at <italic>Casp11</italic>.

As these additional modifiers appear to be relatively weak compared to <italic>Casp11</italic>, we did not attempt to map them genetically.

Intestinal tissue from B6.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup>Casp11<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice also expressed significantly higher levels of CXCL1 than tissue from B6.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup>Casp11<sup>+/–</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

Indeed, its role is usually reported to be detrimental to the host. For example, TNFα is a major driver of pathology during Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Dullemen et al., 1995</xref>).

In both B6.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup>Casp11<sup>–/–</sup></italic> and 129.<italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice, TNFα neutralization led to a striking increase in severity of infection and a 10-fold increase in bacterial colonization of the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>TNFα-dependent protection might occur via an NF-κB-dependent, pro-inflammatory response from infected or bystander IECs that express TNFRI or by TNFRI-CASP8-dependent apoptosis of infected cells. Given the redundant, overlapping functions of both Caspase-11 and TNFα in the absence of NLRC4, we favor the hypothesis that TNFα promotes epithelial defense by initiating IEC apoptosis of infected cells in which NF-κB signaling is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashida et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Jong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Newton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanada et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). NF-κB-dependent cytokines IL-1β and CXCL1 increase after TNFα neutralization, hinting that protection might not be driven by the TNFα-dependent activation of NF-κB. However, this interpretation is complicated by the fact that bacterial burdens also increase and might drive the observed increases in NF-κB-dependent cytokines via an alternate mechanism. An important next step will be to associate TNFα-dependent protection with expulsion of infected IECs in the mouse gut or in IEC organoid cultures.

While we infer that cell death in the intestinal epithelium is the protective mechanism downstream of both CASP11 and TNFα, further experiments are required to directly observe and quantify differences in these modes of cell death in vivo.</p><p>Taken together, our experiments suggest the existence of a layered cell death pathway hierarchy (NLRC4&gt;CASP11&gt;TNFα–CASP8) that is essential in defense against oral <italic>Shigella</italic> infection in mice. Our work highlights both the importance of redundant layers of immunity as a strategy to counteract intracellular pathogens and the significant evolutionary steps required by <italic>Shigella</italic> to overcome these pathways and cause disease in humans. We observed a correlation between bacterial burdens in IECs and pathogenicity in our experiments, indicating that the extent to which <italic>Shigella</italic> can colonize the intestinal epithelium dictates the severity of disease during infection. However, the sensors within IECs that initiate inflammation and drive pathogenicity in vivo have yet to be uncovered and might present an ideal pharmacological target to limit pathological inflammation during acute <italic>Shigella</italic> infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Animals used in infection experiments were littermates or, if not possible, were generally co-housed upon weaning. In cases when mice were not co-housed upon weaning, mice were co-housed for at least 3 weeks prior to infection. Co-housing was strategically performed to maximize cage overlap between all experimental groups. Different experimental treatments (comparing disease across different <italic>Shigella</italic> genotypes or antibody treatments) were stratified within mouse genotypes of the same litter, where possible, to ensure that phenotypes were not the result of the differences in different litter microbiomes. Mice were transferred from an SPF colony to an ABSL2 facility at least 1 week prior to infection.

Mouse infections were performed in 6- to 22-week-old mice. Initially, mice deprived of food and water for 4–6 hr were orally gavaged with 100 μL of 250 mg/mL streptomycin sulfate dissolved in water (25 mg/mouse) and placed in a cage with fresh bedding.

Is epithelial cell death further defective in Nlrc4-/-Casp11-/- and Casp1/11/8-/- Ripk3-/- mice compared to Nlrc4-/- mice? An experimental quantification of epithelial cell death in vivo would strengthen the paper, such as immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence microscopy for cleaved caspase-3. However, this reviewer recognizes that this is potentially challenging to address in vivo, but such assays have been performed in published studies (ie PMID 31606566). Alternatively, the authors could show effects on cell death and extrusion in cultured epithelial cells, similar to their previous studies (Mitchell and Roncaioli et al. 2020,, Rauch et al., 2017).</p><p>2. The claim made in the discussion that the mechanism of TNF⍺-mediated anti-Shigella defense is &quot;not likely driven by TNF⍺-dependent activation of NF-κB&quot; may be overstated because caspase-8 can drive NF-κB activation and cytokine production in various settings, which the authors. Additionally, the increased bacterial burdens in caspase-8-deficient mice and mice treated with anti-TNF⍺ confound the interpretation of increased cytokine production. Experimentally, this could be addressed by measuring cell-intrinsic cytokine production by flow cytometry at a timepoint or tissue where the bacterial burdens are equal between groups. Alternatively, the authors could modify the text of the discussion by acknowledging the alternative interpretation to include the possibility that NF-κB activation downstream of TNF⍺ signaling may contribute to bacterial control.</p><p>The recommendations below would strengthen the paper but are not critical to support the conclusions of the study. Whether to address these points experimentally or by appropriate modification of the text should be left to the discretion of the authors.</p><p>1. The claim in Figure 2 that the caspase-11 inflammasome &quot;prevents disease&quot; in Nlrc4-deficient mice, as phrased in the figure legend seems like it may be an overstatement, or at least not nuanced enough given the data. In particular, there is no difference in weight, and just 2/9 mice had blood in the gut, making it not possible to make a robust statistical conclusion from these data. A possible explanation is contained subsequently within the paper itself, in that OspC3 efficiently blocks Casp-11 activation, likely masking anti-bacterial effects of Casp-11. Based on this, the description of Figure 2 in the text may benefit from modification in light of this possible interpretation.</p><p>2. What happens at later timepoints to Casp1/11/8-/- Ripk3-/- mice? Do they eventually recover their weight and diarrhea like previously shown in 129.Nlrc4-/- mice (Mitchell and Roncaioli et al. 2020), or do they succumb to infection? If the authors already have this data, it would further define the nature of the increased susceptibility of these mice. However, this experiment is not essential to the claims of the paper.</p><p>3. Statistical recommendations:</p><p>a. Figure 5: Please provide statistics comparing WT and iNlrc4Lyz2Cre groups in all panels.</p><p>b. For statistical analyses involving more than two groups, please use a test that corrects for multiple comparisons (particularly in Figures 4 and 8).</p><p>c. The authors may consider using a statistical test in occult blood analyses, such as a Fisher's exact test, which can analyze categorical data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Introduction states that T3SS mediates actin-based motility, but I think this is primarily IcsA dependent, which I think is not a T3SS effector.</p><p>In the figure 1 legend the authors should state that this is experiment is representative of 1 experiment. We, the readers, should not infer this by omission.</p><p>Please add the &quot;129S1/SvImJ&quot; full strain name to the methods section.</p><p>The authors should state that CXCL1 is measured as markers of disease rather than as specific mediators to be investigated in this paper. Figure 1d shows an ELISA for IL-1β from tissue homogenate. This signal could arise from either pro-IL-1β or mature IL-1β. If the ELISA has the ability to detect both forms, then this may be a marker for NF-κB responses rather than caspase-1 activation. The authors make no claims either way. They should simply comment on this in the text, as this is not discussed currently.</p><p>Figure 1 paragraph 2: &quot;mixed homozygous 129/129 or heterozygous B6/129 at all loci&quot;. This is not correct, please revise.</p><p>The way this data is discussed in the text, and presented in the figure legends (Figure 1 and Figure 1--supplementary figure 2) is incorrect. To my understanding, the data in these two figures are the same data but groups split different based on Casp11 vs Hiccs genotypes. The legend needs to clearly state that it is the same data. In fact, all the details of the supplementary label could be removed, simply referring to figure 1. This would make it even more clear that it is the same experimental data. This can also be facilitated by more clear writing and transition sentences in the main text.</p><p>Figure 1 should be relabeled so it is more clear that the groups &quot;129/129 at Casp11&quot; and &quot;B6/129 at Casp11&quot; are also deficient for Nlrc4. Perhaps simply writing Nlrc4-/- across the bottom with a line over all the groups? Also check panel 1G label for consistency.</p><p>The interpretation for Figure 1c-1d-1e is not correct. The authors describe the genotypes N2 cross Casp11(129/129) mice as having &quot;modest increases&quot; in inflammatory cytokines and cecum shrinkage, however, the CXCL1 p value is 0.09, which could be described as trending but not statistically significant, the IL-1b levels are not different by eye, and the cecum length perhaps is trending.</p><p>Figure 2E is statistically significant in the difference, but Figure 2F is only trending, so this needs to be stated correctly in the text.</p><p>Figure 3B and 3D are paired in the sentence when discussed, but 3B is significant and 3D is trending.</p><p>Figure 3F and 3G are again paired in the sentence as being &quot;reduced levels&quot;, but 3F is significant and 3G is not even trending to different.</p><p>Figure 7A-E are described as &quot;modest increases&quot; however most of these are not statistically significant. There might be real differences there if the power of the experiment were doubled or tripled, however, this is probably not worth the effort. In comparison, Figure 6A has trending differences where IL-1R appears to have a trending detrimental effect on weight, but this is interpreted as not significantly different. This also might be significant with sufficient power, but again, not worth the effort to pursue that.</p><p>The authors are much more clear and precise in their interpretations of Figure 5F and 5G, this style should be applied to earlier figures. I may have missed other imprecise interpretations, please read each interpretation carefully to ensure they are correct.</p><p>Please add a statistical analysis section to the methods.</p><p>Regarding statistical analysis, in Figure 1A, the authors make an interpretation that the 129 parentals are the same as the N2 Casp11(129/129) and that the B6 parentals are the same as the N2 Casp11 (B6/129). However, the statistical analysis cannot use Mann-Whitney because 4 groups are being compared. If only day 3 was to be analyzed, then the authors need to use a one-way ANOVA. If time is added to this analysis, this is another variable added to the experiment, and requires a two-way ANOVA.</p><p>Figure 3, 4, 6, 7N legends state that a Mann-Whitney test was used for all data analyses, but the statistics show comparisons across more than two groups. A one-way ANOVA (or Kruskal-Wallis) is the correct analysis in this case.</p><p>There are no statistical analysis on the F1 mouse experiments in supplement figure 1, but conclusions are drawn from these experiments in the text so statistical analysis should be performed.</p><p>Many figures use littermates. The authors should state in the results text what the parent genotypes were. They also need to state the full genotype of each gene in the panel in the graphical figure. Heterozygous sufficiency cannot be assumed, and heterozygous states must be stated on each mouse. If all heterozygous mice were discarded and mice arise from het x het breeding, this should be stated for clarity so that a reader does not have this concern. For example in Figure 2 are the WT mice actually Nlrc4+/- and Casp11+/-, and are the Nlrc4-/- mice actually Nlrc4-/- Casp11+/- mice? Another example, in Figure 8, I can only imagine that all these mice are heterozygous at other loci that are not stated, ie the Casp8-/- Ripk3-/- mice are probably also Casp1/11+/-. The full genotype needs to be stated. Also, the legend makes it sound like the WT mice are also littermates. Are these heterozygous mice, or are they a non-co-housed WT control comparison group? This should be stated.</p><p>In the &quot;loss of multiple cell death…&quot; section for Figure 8, at the beginning of this section the authors have already introduced the concept that OspC3 is an incomplete inhibitor, and they have already introduced OspC1 and OspD3. Thus, my expectation in starting to read this section was that these might be incomplete inhibitors as well, but this was not mentioned. Also the discussion would benefit from direct naming and discussing these effectors. I would expect additional &quot;genetics squared&quot; phenotypes in future work that examined these mutants. In other words, stronger phenotypes may be observed for caspase-8 when examining an ospC1 mutant. Revision of the text would be helpful for the reader.</p><p>Fecal blood graphs use dots for each mouse, however, most graphs these dots coalesce and thus are not visible. The authors compensate by labelling the numbers of mice that have blood or not. Perhaps a different type of graph would more accurately convey the data. Perhaps diamonds would make it visible. Perhaps a y axis of percentage of mice, and then each genotype is a &quot;stacked bar&quot; with fecal blood scores. Or maybe a table inset in the figure?</p><p>Model in Figure Supplement 2, I think it would not take too much effort to add RIPK3, OspC1, and OspD3 to the figure, all are relevant to the manuscript. Also, if you rearrange to place the CASP11 module on the left, then you can remove the CASP8 from underneath NLRC4, instead drawing a line from NLRC4 to CASP8 that is under the TNF receptor (thus avoiding having CASP8 on the figure twice).</p><p>I suggest revising the text around the use of Casp8-/- Ripk3-/- mice. Currently, it seems that these mice only investigate caspase-8, and it is assumed that RIPK3 plays no role. However, the role for RIPK3 may only be apparent when Shigella inhibits caspase-8. Which it does with OspC1, thus explaining the existence of OspD3. Thus, most likely, both play a role, but the RIPK3 role is not apparent in a single knockout because caspase-8 is sufficient.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83639.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please address concerns about the rigor of the statistical analysis</p><p>2) Please address the multiple requests for clarification about experimental details and text from all three reviewers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank all the reviewers for their constructive and detailed comments.

We note that it is experimentally challenging to directly identify/quantify cell death in the intestinal epithelium in the context of <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. The ex vivo organoid epithelial cell system used in our previous studies was effective in part because there was a distinct and obvious difference in cell death between NLRC4-competent and NLRC4-deficient organoid monolayers, likely because NLRC4 strongly responds to a synchronized <italic>Shigella</italic> monolayer infection. However, the effects of CASP11 and TNF are more subtle than the effects of NLRC4 and may depend on cytokine responses that originate from hematopoietic cells (not present in organoids).</p><p>In Rauch et al. (2017), cell death was readily detectable because the administration of FlaTox allows for a synchronized, rapid, and potent cell death response. However, in the context of <italic>Shigella</italic> infection, although cell death appears important in limiting bacterial replication and dissemination in the epithelium, cell death events are not synchronized, occur less frequently, and are thus more difficult to visually capture. Furthermore, it is difficult to determine the pathway or sensors that initiate a given cell death pathway, as immunofluorescence for apoptotic, pyroptotic, and necroptotic markers and initiators is difficult to perform in vivo. Nonetheless, we hope to directly quantify cell death in vivo in our future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.
