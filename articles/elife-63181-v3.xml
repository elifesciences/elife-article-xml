This study addresses a long-standing question as to how the most abundant serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A) holoenzyme, PP2A/B55α, specifically recognizes substrates and presents them to the enzyme active site. Here, we show how the PP2A regulatory subunit B55α recruits p107, a pRB-related tumor suppressor and B55α substrate. Using molecular and cellular approaches, we identified a conserved region 1 (R1, residues 615–626) encompassing the strongest p107 binding site. This enabled us to identify an ‘HxRVxxV<sub>619-625</sub>’ short linear motif (SLiM) in p107 as necessary for B55α binding and dephosphorylation of the proximal pSer-615 in vitro and in cells. Numerous B55α/PP2A substrates, including TAU, contain a related SLiM C-terminal from a proximal phosphosite, ‘<bold>p</bold>[<bold>ST</bold>]-<bold>P-</bold>x(4,10)-[<bold>RK</bold>]-<bold>V</bold>-x-x-[<bold>VI</bold>]-<bold>R</bold>.’ Mutation of conserved SLiM residues in TAU dramatically inhibits dephosphorylation by PP2A/B55α, validating its generality. A data-guided computational model details the interaction of residues from the conserved p107 SLiM, the B55α groove, and phosphosite presentation. Altogether, these data provide key insights into PP2A/B55α’s mechanisms of substrate recruitment and active site engagement, and also facilitate identification and validation of new substrates, a key step towards understanding PP2A/B55α’s role in multiple cellular processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>serine-threonine phosphatase</kwd><kwd>PP2A</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>enzyme</kwd><kwd>p107</kwd><kwd>TAU</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM117437</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graña</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03 CA216134-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graña</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>WW Smith charitable Trust Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>no reference number</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graña</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA006927</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Graña</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name><name><surname>Dunbrack</surname><given-names>Roland L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 CA221704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fowle</surname><given-names>Holly</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Ziran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM134683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peti</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS091336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peti</surname><given-names>Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular, cellular, and computational analyses reveal key insights into PP2A/B55α's mechanisms of substrate recruitment and active site engagement, and facilitate identification/validation of new substrates, a step towards understanding PP2A/B55α's role in multiple cellular processes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein phosphorylation is a reversible post-translational modification that is critical for the regulation of signaling and other cellular processes. It is estimated that a third of all cellular proteins are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ficarro et al., 2002</xref>), with more than 98% of those phosphorylation events occurring on serine and threonine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olsen et al., 2006</xref>). The opposing processes of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are catalyzed by protein kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Despite the fundamental importance of dephosphorylation for normal cell physiology, the mechanisms of substrate recognition by protein phosphatases are only poorly understood (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brautigan and Shenolikar, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Members of the <italic>p</italic>hospho<italic>p</italic>rotein <italic>p</italic>hosphatase (PPP) family of serine/threonine phosphatases are responsible for the majority of dephosphorylation in eukaryotic cells, with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) accounting for more than 90% of the total phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moorhead et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Virshup and Shenolikar, 2009</xref>). Within the PPP family, the molecular details of substrate recognition have been best studied for PP1 and calcineurin (or PP2B), and involve the recognition of defined short linear motifs (SLiMs) including RVxF,ΦΦ (where Φrefers to a hydrophobic residue), SILK, among others for PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>); and LxVP and PxIxIT for PP2B. These motifs are characterized by the presence of three or four core interacting amino acids that are part of a 4–10 amino acid stretch within intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) of regulator and/or substrate proteins. This SLiM-mediated specific targeting of substrates or regulatory proteins to PPPs is essential for the temporal and spatial coordination of its functions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brautigan and Shenolikar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heroes et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>PP2A is a highly conserved Ser/Thr protein phosphatase that makes up close to 1% of total cellular protein in some tissue types, making it one of the most abundant enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fowle et al., 2019</xref>). As a multimeric protein, PP2A can exist as a heterodimeric ‘core enzyme,’ consisting of a scaffold (A) subunit and a catalytic (C) subunit, or a heterotrimeric holoenzyme, in which the core dimer complexes with a B subunit (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi, 2009</xref>). The B subunit of PP2A can be subdivided into one of four major families (B55, B56, B72, and B93), each consisting of 2–5 isoforms and numerous splice variants. Apart from its role in subcellular localization, the B subunits are thought to be the key determinant of substrate specificity for the PP2A complex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fowle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurimchak and Graña, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Virshup and Shenolikar, 2009</xref>). Indeed, a PP2A substrate SLiM (LxxIxE) has recently been identified for the B56 family of PP2A regulatory subunits, which form a HEAT repeat fold. The binding affinity of LxxIxE can be modulated by phosphorylation (phosphorylation leads to tighter binding), and it binds in a binding pocket between HEAT repeats 3 and 4. Furthermore, it was recently shown that additional factors including conserved, dynamic charged:charged interaction modulate substrate specificity for B56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This combined molecular and cellular data can be leveraged to validate known B56/PP2A substrates and, most importantly, identify potential novel B56 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hertz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, most of this information is missing for all other B family, limiting our ability to understand substrate recruitment.</p><p>B55α (four isoforms, α, β, ɣ, δ; our work focuses on the α-isoform of B55) is ubiquitously expressed and the most abundant regulatory subunit of PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Critically, all known PP2A/B55α-dependent substrates have key functions in cell division, differentiation, and survival, and are found to be dysregulated in cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fowle et al., 2019</xref>). The structure of the PP2A/B55α holoenzyme allowed for the suggestion of a mechanism for targeting the substrate Tau. Specifically, it was proposed the large negatively charged patch on B55α recruits Lys-rich domains of TAU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2008</xref>), only to be shown that other substrates must use different molecular recognition motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jayadeva et al., 2010</xref>). Recently, proteomics data suggested that B55α preferred substrates that are phosphorylated by Ser/Thr-Pro directed kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cundell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). However, no substrate recruitment mechanism has been identified for B55α, and thus, further insights are of key importance to understand how substrates engage B55.</p><p>Here, by combining and leveraging molecular and cellular data, we characterize the recruitment of the PP2A/B55α-specific substrate p107 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garriga et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jayadeva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolupaeva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kurimchak et al., 2013</xref>). p107 is a pRB-related tumor suppressor with key regulatory roles in the cell cycle (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurimchak and Graña, 2015</xref>). Our data lead to the identification of a conserved SLiM in key B55α substrates and enable us to develop a structural model for B55α substrate recognition that enables us to predict how other substrates bind B55α. Since modulation of PP2A activity is actively being explored in many cancer types, our data will further help in turning PP2A into a key cancer drug target.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>p107 binds to B55</title><p>p107 (retinoblastoma-like protein 1 [RBL1]) is a multidomain protein.

R1 alone can bind B55α, although to a slightly lesser extent than R1/R2 (lane 3), while mutants lacking regions containing R1 do not bind B55α (lanes 6 and 7). Additional experiments highlighted that R1 is the key B55α binding region and that R2 enhances the interaction, but without R1 cannot recruit B55α alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Conversely, binding of p107 to CDK2 (or cyclin A, not shown) strictly depends on the presence of R2 (lanes 2, 4, 5, and 6), which includes an RxL motif necessary for cyclin A/CDK2 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that charged:charged interactions are central for B55α:TAU substrate recruitment. To test if charged:charged interactions are also important for p107 recruitment, we generated p107 R621A and K623A variants (in R1), R633A and R34A variants (in s2), and an R647A variant (in R2) using GST-p107-R1R2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, positive residues in R1 and R2, but not the connecting s2 ‘linker,’ led to a reduction in binding to B55α. Mutation of the cyclin A binding site in R2 (<sub>659</sub>KRRL-AAAA and <sub>660</sub>RRL-AAA mutations to Ala), which also contains positive residues, also reduced binding (data not shown). Thus, positively charged residues participate in binding to B55α.</p><p>We also used NMR spectroscopy to gain further atomic resolution insights into the interaction between p107 and B55α. The 2D [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N] HSQC spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled p107 (residues M612-S687, which include R1, R2, and R3) shows all hallmarks of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), with a highly limited proton chemical shift dispersion due to the lack of a hydrogen bond network in secondary structure elements. This experimentally validates the bioinformatics data. An overlay of the 2D [<sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N] HSQC spectrum of <sup>15</sup>N-labeled p107<sub>M612-S687</sub> in the presence and absence of purified B55α shows that ~15 peaks have reduced intensity, typical for an IDP:protein interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Upon completion of the sequence-specific backbone assignment of p107<sub>M612-S687</sub>, we identified that cross-peaks corresponding to p107 residues M614-E624 were most significantly broadened upon binding to B55α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Consistent with the mutation data, these residues form the core of R1. Furthermore, residues within the linker region and R2 also showed peak intensity attenuations, consistent with additional weaker interactions in R2 contributing and enhancing the interaction of R1. Taken together, the NMR data reinforce that the p107 R1 region mediates key contacts with B55α. p107 interacts with specific B55α surface residues.</p><p>The recently identified LxxIxE B56 SLiM binds to a highly conserved binding pocket on B56. Thus, to identify B55α residues that mediate p107 binding, we analyzed B55α conservation. B55α adopts a β-propeller fold.

The two B55α residues required by the three substrates tested, D197K and L225A, are located on the B55α blade 4, which directly points towards the active site of PP2A/C.

Our data clearly showed that three triple-mutant peptides were unable to bind PP2A/B55α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These data showed that the main R1 interaction residues must be within p107 M618-R626. Next, we tested the single Ala substitution peptides for p107 M618-R626 to identify all residues necessary for p107 binding to PP2A/B55α. These experiments showed that p107 residues H619, R621, V622, and V625 are critical for B55α binding as R1 peptides with H619A, R621A, V622A, and V625A bound poorly to PP2A/B55α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, top). Moreover, to confirm the requirement of each one of these residues for binding to B55α, we generated point mutants and tested them in binding assays. H619A, R621A, V622A, and V625A dramatically reduce binding to B55α holoenzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, bottom). These experiments defined a putative SLiM binding motif for p107 – HxRVxxV – with PP2A/B55α.</p><p>To assess the relationship between binding and dephosphorylation of p107 by PP2A/B55α directly, we measured dephosphorylation of wildtype (wt) pS615-R1 or mutant (mt) variant (H619A or R621A) phosphopeptides (all phosphopeptides acted as their unphosphorylated counterparts in competitive binding assays, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, top). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> shows that the mutant phosphopeptides were dephosphorylated by purified PP2A/B55α at a slower rate compared to the wildtype pS615-R1 phosphopeptide.

Using co-transfection followed by immunoprecipitation assays, we show that GFP-p107-R1, but not mutant GFP-p107-R1 (H/AxR/AV/AxxV/A variant), immunoprecipitates both endogenous B55α and exogenous Myc-B55α together with PP2A/A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As expected, GFP-R1 did not immunoprecipitate B55α-D197K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This confirms that R1 is sufficient to form a complex with the PP2A/B55α holoenzyme in cells and that this is dependent on B55α D197. The specificity of the GFP-p107-R1 fusion protein pulldown was additionally validated by MS, which resulted in the identification of B55α and PP2A/A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Therefore, the p107 R1 domain contains a highly specific SLiM for B55α family members. To determine if B55α modulates the phosphorylation state of CDK2 sites on p107 in cells, we transfected 293T cells with Flag-p107 alone or in combination with either wt B55α or mt B55α-D197K. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> shows that wt B55α expression, but not mt B55α-D197K, leads to reduced phosphorylation of p107 on sites recognized by the CDK substrate antibody, which include p107 S615 (this is the only site recognized by this antibody in the p107 spacer, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To determine if the p107 spacer SLiM is required to modulate the phosphorylation state of S615 in full-length p107, we compared the effect of co-transfection of WT and D197K B55α on S615 phosphorylation of WT and SLiM mutant p107 (<sub>619</sub>HxRVxxV<sub>625</sub> substituted by <sub>619</sub>AxAAxxA<sub>625</sub>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> shows that the binding of WT B55α to the p107 SLiM mutant is drastically diminished and this is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation of p107 S615. As expected, B55α<sub>D191K</sub> does not bind WT or MT p107, nor affects the phosphorylation state. Therefore, the p107 SLiM is essential to maintain steady-state phosphorylation of at least p107 S615, and thus we can infer that B55α must be critical for the temporal regulation of at least this site. We next determined if disruption of the SLiM affects p107 G1 cell cycle suppression activity, and if this is dependent on B55α. U-2 OS cells were co-transfected with H2B-GFP or H2B-GFP with Flag-p107 or the Flag-p107 SLiM MT alone or in combination with Myc-B55α. DNA content was analyzed by PI/FACS analysis of GFP-positive cells. Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farkas et al., 2002</xref>), Flag-p107 expression led to a noticeable increase in the fraction of cells in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Importantly, this effect was drastically increased by coexpression of Myc-B55α, which had a smaller effect on its own. The effect of the Flag-p107 SLiM mutant in G1 was clearly diminished relatively to WT Flag-p107 even with co-transfected Myc-B55α. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that B55α-mediated dephosphorylation of S615 in cells is dependent on specific residues C-terminal from the target dephosphorylation site that mediate contacts with B55α D197 and/or neighboring residues in B55α, and that the SLiM is critically important for modulation of the cell cycle suppressing function of p107.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>p107 R1 interaction with the B55α holoenzyme in cells depends on sites required for binding and dephosphorylation in vitro.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GFP-p107 R1 wildtype and mutant constructs were co-transfected with Myc-B55α wildtype and B55α-D197K mutant constructs into 293T cells and used for IPs with anti-GFP agarose conjugate.

We selected cyclin E because cyclin E/CDK2 is thought to cooperate with cyclin D/CDK4 to disrupt E2F complexes in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calbó et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lundberg and Weinberg, 1998</xref>), and our in vitro data show that it can be phosphorylated by CDK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), whereas p107 S615 is not a target of CDK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farkas et al., 2002</xref>).

Altogether, it suggests that B55α promotes p107 activation and cell cycle arrest at least in part by opposing cyclin E/CDK2 function likely by mechanisms independent of E2F4. Of note, we also observed shifts in E2F4 protein isoform migration with Myc-B55α co-transfection, which may indicate that E2F4 is also dephosphorylated, perhaps as a result of complex formation with p107.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A model for p107 recruitment by PP2A/B55α</title><p>Based on all the established data, we created a model to describe the recruitment of p107 by PP2A/B55. This model is based on the following premises: (1) using HxRVxxV as a ruler, we assumed that either H619<sub>p107</sub> or R621<sub>p107</sub> interacts with D197<sub>B55α</sub>; and (2) as we confirmed that pS615<sub>p107</sub> is dephosphorylated by PP2A/B55α, pS615<sub>p107</sub> must be placed into the PP2A active site. In order to place pS615<sub>p107,</sub> it became more likely that R621<sub>p107</sub> interacts with D197<sub>B55α</sub> for simple distance reasons. This meant that pSPMLHPR will need to connect the PP2A active site and D197<sub>B55α</sub>. To identify possible existing confirmations of such a peptide, we searched the PDB database for peptide fragments from existing proteins structure using the sequence EPxxxPR (pS was exchanged to the E mimic to identify more peptides). Next, we examined the distribution of distances between the oxygen atoms of the OE<sub>1</sub>/OE<sub>2</sub> atoms of the E side chain and the NH<sub>1</sub>/NH<sub>2</sub> atoms of the R side chain, and compared these to the distance between E in the PP2A active site and R621<sub>p107</sub> bound to D197<sub>B55α</sub>, which is 27.5 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, top).

PP2A B-subunits are proteins that adopt specific folds and thus allow for specific substrate recruitment. Much work over the last few years has highlighted how the B56 regulatory subunit recruits its substrates. A central, conserved groove region in B56 provides the necessary and sufficient interaction site for the substrate recognition sequence (SLiM site) – LxxIxE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hertz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Much less is known for B55, despite the fact that it is the most abundant B subunit and targets a myriad of key cellular substrates. Previous reports highlighted the possibility that B55α functions differently with the potential presence of distinct substrate recruitment sites. Specifically, sites of the acidic surface of B55α that were required for Tau dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2008</xref>) appeared dispensable for p107 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jayadeva et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we used a broad range of approaches – from molecular to biochemistry to cellular – to understand how PP2A/B55α recruits specific substrates using p107 as a model substrate.</p><p>We show that p107 S615 (CDK kinase phosphorylation site) is a specific B55α/PP2A holoenzyme dephosphorylation site. p107 residues H619, R621, V622, and V625 within the p<bold>S</bold>Pxxx<bold>H</bold>x<bold>RV</bold>xx<bold>V</bold> motif are critical for binding to B55α in vitro and in cells. Next, we showed that these residues bind to a B55α surface groove that is defined by residues D197 and L225. Importantly, our results show that this B55α surface is also important for recruitment of pRB and KSR, further suggesting that these sites are likely the key substrate recruitment sites for a variety of substrates. However, pRB and KSR differ in the requirement of other conserved residues present within the B55α groove, strongly suggesting that while substrate specificity is determined by the groove, it may use different residues to accommodate a variety of substrates. With this regard, we have found that peptides known to abrogate Tau and MAP2 binding to B55α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sontag et al., 2012</xref>) contain residues that align with our proposed SLiM consensus sequence, <bold>p</bold>[<bold>ST</bold>]-<bold>P-</bold>x(4,10)-[<bold>RK</bold>]-<bold>V</bold>-x-x-[<bold>VI</bold>]-<bold>R,</bold> that is also found in p130/RBL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) and other cellular IDPs, where the phosphosite is 5–11 residues amino terminal from the conserved residues in the binding motif. Strikingly, purified B55α/PP2A holoenzymes dephosphorylate the wildtype TAU peptide, but fail to dephosphorylate a mutant variant that lacks the conserved residues. It appears that the number of residues between the conserved residues that contact the groove and the phosphorylation site varies but can be very small (5 residues in p107 vs. 7 residues in TAU and 11 in MAP2), which suggests a role for the SLiM in phosphosite presentation. In contrast, recent work on the B56 SLiM suggests that B56 SLiM-containing proteins are direct substrates as well as scaffolds to facilitate the recruitment of proteins to B56/PP2A for dephosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kruse et al., 2020</xref>). While there is some correlation between the distance of the B56 SLiM and the site of dephosphorylation and the rate of dephosphorylation, many B56-dependent phosphorylation sites are located on non-SLIM-containing proteins indicating B regulatory subunit-specific dephosphorylation mechanisms. Computational search for a degenerate version of the SLiM ([ST]-P-x(4,10)-[RK]-[VIL]-x(2)-[VILM]) demonstrated a sharp enrichment for the presence of SLiM sequences among B55α interactors and mitotic in vitro substrates, indicating that the presence of the SLiM is not random. If these putative B55α substrate SLiMs are conserved through evolution in these proteins and found in IDRs, they may contribute to B55α binding and/or substrate recognition.</p><p>Moreover, we also identified a second region of p107, which we termed R2, that contributes to B55α binding. This R2 region includes a higher density of positively charged residues that enhance binding most likely via charged:charged interactions (R<sub>647</sub>, and K<sub>657</sub> and/or R<sub>659</sub>). Indeed, this has also been recently shown for protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B; PP3; calcineurin) and the B56 regulatory subunit of PP2A, where these dynamic charged:charged interactions were shown to play a role in substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hendus-Altenburger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, such interactions, which have been recently recognized to be critical for the interaction of IDPs with their target proteins and allow for increased entropy, are likely important for substrate recruitment and specificity by different phosphatases.</p><p>Lastly, we leveraged our mutagenesis data to understand the p107 R1 binding site on B55α by generating a model how p107 R1 engages simultaneously with B55α and the PP2Ac active site. Our computational model based on structural data of peptides with the conserved key residues on p107 needed for B55α binding shows the feasibility of simultaneous binding of both the active site of PP2A/C and D197 on the B55α groove. However, the model peptide is significantly extended, a conformation that would not be favored for catalysis without additional bending of the scaffold subunit. Analysis of the flexibility of the PP2A/A scaffold upon binding to the catalytic subunit, and B subunits of the four distinct holoenzymes, confirms that subunit binding has a major effect on PP2A/A bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The dependency of the conformational flexibility of the scaffold subunit on the nature of the B subunit bound strongly suggests that substrate binding should result in additional relative movement of PP2A/A HEAT-repeats to promote catalysis.</p><p>Taken together, our detailed molecular and cellular study highlights how PP2A/B55α recruits substrates and how these substrates engage with the PP2A active site, and uncovers the top groove of B55α as a central hub for substrate discrimination. In addition, this work will also facilitate identification and validation of new substrates based on the presence of variant SLiMs, a key step towards understanding B55α/PP2A’s role in multiple cellular processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The distance of each pair of peptide structures is the maximum distance of dihedral angles of residue pairs as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">North et al., 2011</xref>). The peptide structures were clustered by DBSCAN function in the R project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dbscan/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dbscan/index.html</ext-link>). We used the structure with best resolution (1G8M and chain A, resolution = 1.75 Å) in the largest cluster as our reference peptide. The peptide structure was moved to D197 of B55α in PDB:3DW8 by manual rotations and translations in PyMOL, such that the NH<sub>1</sub>/NH<sub>2</sub> atoms of R621 were approximately 3 Å from OD<sub>1</sub>/OD<sub>2</sub> atoms of D197. This model was subsequently refined with FlexPepDock web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flexpepdock.furmanlab.cs.huji.ac.il/">http://flexpepdock.furmanlab.cs.huji.ac.il/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>).</p><p>To identify the likely phosphate position in the PP2A active site, we retrieved 68 structures from the PDB containing a phosphate group (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) and a pair of Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions from a search on the Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion on our website Protein Common Interface Database (ProtCID), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/ProtCiD/IPdbfam/PfamLigands.aspx?Ligand=MN">http://dunbrack2.fccc.edu/ProtCiD/IPdbfam/PfamLigands.aspx?Ligand=MN</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xu and Dunbrack, 2020</xref>). These 68 structures contain 47 distinct UniProt proteins including four human phosphatase proteins (PP1A_HUMAN: PDB:4MOV, 4MOY, and 4MP0; PP1G_HUMAN: PDB:4UT2 and 4UT3; PPP5_HUMAN: PDB:1S95; and PR15A_HUMAN: PDB:4XPN). For each Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion, we calculated the distances from the four oxygen atom of the phosphate and saved the shortest distance. The average distance from PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> to Mn ions is 2.38 Å and the standard deviation is 0.59 Å. We also examined a structure of PP5 (PDB:5HPE) that contains a substrate peptide (expressed as a tag separated by a linker from the C-terminus of PP5) with a Glu side chain as phosphomimetic. After aligning the proteins homologous to PP2A with bound phosphate, the structure of 5HPE with a Glu residue, and PP2A in PDB:3DW8, it is clear that the oxygen atoms of the phosphates and the Glu are in very similar positions relative to the Mn<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We calculated the distances between the OE<sub>1</sub>/OE<sub>2</sub> of Glu and NH<sub>1</sub>/NH<sub>2</sub> of Arg for these 520 structures to find peptides long enough to connect Glu and Arg residues. We superposed 217 peptide structures with a distance ≥20 Å onto the ‘two-fragment model’ by minimizing the distances of the OE<sub>1</sub>/OE<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>1</sub>/NH<sub>2</sub> atoms of the peptide with those of the two-fragment model by <italic>pair_fit</italic> function in PyMOL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, top), then calculated the sum of the displacements of the OE and NH atoms for each peptide from the equivalent atoms in the two-fragment model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, middle left). The top 20 structures with minimum distances to the OE<sub>1</sub>/OE<sub>2</sub> atoms of Glu and NH<sub>1</sub>/NH<sub>2</sub> of Arg residues within the reference peptide fragments were selected and mutated into ‘EPLMHPR,’ and added ‘MPM’ residues and ‘V’ residue to build the p107 peptide ‘MPMEPLMHPRV’ in PyMOL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, bottom).

While substrate recognition has been studied for PP1 and PP2B, the substate recognition of PP2A holoenzymes are less understood. Here, Fowle et al., set to understand substrate recognition of B55/PP2A. Using a specific substrate of B55α, p107, the authors identify a conserved binding motif (HxRVxxV) for recognition by B55α and show additional B55α substrates also contain this motif. This work incorporates many complementary structural and biochemical assays to delineate the binding and recognition of substrates by B55α.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. What is the evidence that this motif is only recognized by B5alpha/PP2A and not other B55 family members? Are the residues identified in B5alpha critical to the p107 interaction (D197 and L225) conserved among all of the isoforms? If they are, can other B55 family members bind p107?</p><p>2. Have the authors looked for the HxRVxxV motif across the proteome? The author only state that they noticed that this motif was found in Tau, p130 and MAP2, but how many proteins contain these motifs? A list or understanding of the potential proteins which contain this motif could give researchers outside the field a link to understand the phosphatase important for their protein of interest.</p><p>3. For the P107 deletion mutants has the expression of each one been confirmed in Figure 1 and is decreased binding to PP2A B55alpha been normalized to the expression of these mutants.</p><p>4. Is the phosphorylation of p107 by CDK2 affecting the affinity of B55 binding to this substrate?</p><p>5. Have the authors considered measuring direct binding affinities using ITC/SPR for example to look at the effects of these various mutants in a cell free / in vitro system?</p><p>6. It would have been interesting to study the effects of the various B55 mutants on the endogenous phosphorylation of p107, Rb, and KSR?</p><p>7. To gain insights into the physiological role of the identified domain of p107 in PP2A-B55 binding and in the dephosphorylation of this protein, new &quot;in cellulo&quot; experiments using the full length p107 mutant protein have to be performed and its impact in the temporal pattern of dephosphorylation analyzed.</p><p>8. Figure 1D, it is obvious that in order to compare the levels of PP2A-B55 associated to each construct it is essential to normalize the levels of A and B55 signals to the quantity of protein that is recovered in each pulldown. As such, the levels of each GST construct in the pulldowns have to be measured by western blot and used to obtain the PP2A A our B55/GST-spacer ratio. Ratios can be then compared.</p><p>9. The authors state that: &quot;a mutant lacking residues C-terminal of R2 binds B55α similarly to the full construct, indicating that residues C-terminal to the R2 domain are dispensable for B55α Binding”. Do &quot;residues C-terminal of R2&quot; mean full R2 region? If this is the case, this statement is not supported by Supplementary Figure 1B, where western blot of construct 2 and 7 display dramatically reduced B55 and A levels.</p><p>10. The authors tested the effect of KR residue mutation in the R1 and R2 regions in p107 dephosphorylation. KR mutants used for the R1 are R621A/K623A, the two mutants that were tested in Figure 1D and that were shown to impact B55 binding. However, they select K657A/R659A for R2 region. These two mutants were not tested in Figure 1D. Why do they introduce these mutants and not R647A that was investigated in Figure 1D? If the authors think that these residues are important, why did they not test them for its capacity to bind B55 in Figure 1D?</p><p>11. Other cdk-dependent phosphorylation sites on p107 that are essential for E2F binding have been described. Some of these sites are out of the spacer sequence. It will be interesting to know whether the dephosphorylation of these sites are dependent on PP2A-B55 and regulated by the mutants on the spacer sequence that decrease B55 binding.</p><p>12. Figure 4A and B. Dephosphorylation pattern of R1R2 control construct is drastically different in Figure 4A compared to 4B. In the first case, complete dephosphorylation does only take place upon two hours of incubation compared with fifteen minutes in the second. This is very weird if the same purified phosphatase is used in both experiments. In this line, I would expect a timing of few minutes for a total dephosphorylation when a purified phosphatase is used. Does it mean that phosphatase in Figure 4A lost activity?</p><p>13. &quot;in vivo&quot; experiments on the dephosphorylation of the non-binding p107 full length mutants have not been performed. To demonstrate that these residues are physiologically relevant for the physiological temporal p107 dephosphorylation pattern, these experiments must be done.</p><p>14. In the same line, to really show the involvement of the pST-x(5-10)-(RK)-Vxx(VI)R in Tau dephosphorylation by PP2A-B55 a direct mutant of this sequence of Tau should be checked.</p><p>15. What are the consequences of B55a-interaction mutants in p107 function? Is that mutant protein able to sustain cell cycle arrest?</p><p>16. Since the authors propose a new model/motif, it would be great to add some statistics on to what extent this motif is present in the numerous hits found in recent screens for B55 targets during mitotic exit. Is this motif present in B55 targets involved in non-cell-cycle (TAU) or cell-cycle targets? Is it equally present in proteins dephosphorylated during early versus late mitotic exit? Any hint into these questions may facilitate the impact of the model proposed in the biology of PP2A/B55.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63181.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

We have now clarified this in the manuscript (in the Results section, page 8, lines 13-15). We were not claiming that the interaction of p107 is exclusive to only B55a. Indeed, all residues in the top of the B55a β-propeller structure are highly conserved. These are the residues we experimentally verified (by mutation) to participate in the binding interaction (except residue E27, which lies in a protein segment not present in B55g). Therefore, most likely all members of the B55 family interact with substrates using this SLiM (same as what was shown for B56), as long as both B55 and the substrate are expressed in the same cellular location. Indeed, we have experimentally determined that p107 (using GST-R1 and GST-R1R2 constructs) pulls down B55d (not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Searching for this motif using ScanProsite yields 28 hits including p107, p130, TAU and MAP2. More degenerate versions of the SLiM (p[ST]-P-x(4,10)-[RK]-[VIL]x-x-[VILM]-[RK]) considering conserved amino acid substitutions identify 309 hits in 302 sequences, 1.5% of the proteins in the Swiss Human Proteome. However, as the last residue in the SLiM contributes minimally to binding p107:B55a binding despite is alignment with TAU (Figure 5C, 8A), we determined the frequency of the potential SLiM sequence (p[ST]-P-x(4,10)-[RK]-[VIL]-x-x-[VILM]-x), which retrieved 2831 hits in 2422 sequences (13.9% of the proteome) (Figure 8—figure supplement 1). However, considering that the SLiM would have to be conserved, in an intrinsically Disordered Region (IDR) and controlling dephosphorylation of a phosphosite(s), the frequency of a genuine SLiM is predictably much smaller. If our SLiM is functional in a significant fraction of B55a substrates, SLiM occurrence will be expected to relatively increase in datasets of B55a interactors or datasets where modulation of B55a expression results in phosphoproteome changes. This is in fact what we have seen and reported in a novel Figure 8—figure supplement 1. The fraction of proteins with the SLiM greatly increases among B55a interactors and potential B55a mitotic in vitro substrates (we have also provided an Excel table of the datasets, Figure 8—figure supplement 1-source data 1). This enrichment indicates that many substrates and B55 interactors potentially use this SLiM-based mechanism. Our follow up studies beyond the scope of this manuscript, have further validated the p[ST]-P-x(4,10)-[RK]-[VIL]-x-x-[VILM]-x SLiM by demonstrating that it is essential for binding/or dephosphorylation of two other B55a interactor/substrates including pRB.</p><p>The reviewer is correct, and we apologize for this oversight. We have substituted Supplementary Figure 1B, with a complete representative experiment that includes Coomassie Blue staining of the GST-p107 constructs. Quantitation of B55a signal was normalized by the levels of p107. The same was done for all replicates. This is now specified in the legend of Figure 1D (lines 17 to 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Is the phosphorylation of p107 by CDK2 affecting the affinity of B55 binding to this substrate?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question and we have performed two independent experiments.

Because B55a/PP2A dephosphorylate Cyclin A/CDK2 phosphorylated GST-R1R2 very efficiently, we performed the dephosphorylation step in the presence and in the absence of okadaic acid (OA), which potently inhibits PP2A activity. We noticed that OA diminished binding of GSTR1R2 to B55a, which suggests that when OA occupies the active site of PP2A/C it interferes with binding of p107 to B55a. However, phosphorylated p107 diƒod not bind better than dephosphorylated p107, indicating, as in the previous experiment, that phosphorylation of the target site does not increase the affinity of the substrate for the holoenzyme.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>GST-R1R2 was phosphorylated with Cyclin A/CDK2 where indicated as described in the Manuscript.</title><p>B55a binding to GST-R1R2 was determined in the presence or absence of OA to prevent dephosphorylation.

However, as it was recently shown by some of the authors of the manuscript (PMID: 31633908), these mutants often have unexpected effects. Especially, as they showed for the LxVP SLiM – a change in the LxVP SLiM sequence changed only the on-rate for binding and thus the binding K<sub>D</sub> depends on the ensemble of confirmation the binding protein adopts (the specific sequence elements will restrict the phi/psi space). Thus, while we agree that this is an important line of investigation, due to the much more complex nature of this correlation this is beyond the scope of the work for this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

To gain insights into the physiological role of the identified domain of p107 in PP2A-B55 binding and in the dephosphorylation of this protein, new &quot;in cellulo&quot; experiments using the full length p107 mutant protein have to be performed and its impact in the temporal pattern of dephosphorylation analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>and a similar point made later: <italic>13. &quot;</italic>in vivo<italic>&quot; experiments on the dephosphorylation of the non-binding p107 full length mutants have not been performed. To demonstrate that these residues are physiologically relevant for the physiological temporal p107 dephosphorylation pattern, these experiments must be done.</italic></p><p>We agree that these experiments are important and have generated a new fulllength p107 mutant with Ala substitution (p107<sub>SLiM-MT</sub>) of the essential SLiM residues (<sub>619</sub>HxRVxxV<sub>625</sub> was substituted by <sub>619</sub>AxAAxxA<sub>625</sub>). As shown in new Figure 6D, the binding of WT B55a to p107<sub>SLiM-MT</sub> is drastically diminished and this is accompanied by an expected significant increase in the phosphorylation of p107 S615 (this antibody only recognizes P-S615 in the p107 spacer and has no other consensus sites). Therefore, the p107 SLiM is essential to maintain steady state phosphorylation of at least p107 S615 and thus we can infer that B55a must be critical for the temporal regulation of this site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 1D, it is obvious that in order to compare the levels of PP2A-B55 associated to each construct it is essential to normalize the levels of A and B55 signals to the quantity of protein that is recovered in each pulldown. As such, the levels of each GST construct in the pulldowns have to be measured by western blot and used to obtain the PP2A A our B55/GST-spacer ratio. Ratios can be then compared.</p><p>9. The authors state that: &quot;a mutant lacking residues C-terminal of R2 binds B55α similarly to the full construct, indicating that residues C-terminal to the R2 domain are dispensable for B55α Binding”. Do &quot;residues C-terminal of R2&quot; mean full R2 region? If this is the case, this statement is not supported by Supplementary Figure 1B, where western blot of construct 2 and 7 display dramatically reduced B55 and A levels.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>&quot;residues C-terminal of R2&quot;</italic> means any residues in the spacer after the end of conserved Region 2 (R2, after F<sub>661</sub>). R1 is required and necessary for binding, and any constructs lacking R1, do not bind B55a (Figure 1D top pulldown, lanes 6 and 7, bottom lane 5). Constructs, with R1 lacking R2, bind B55a, but constructs that contain both R1 and R2 show enhanced binding as R2 increases the avidity of p107 for B55a. As discussed in the Discussion section, “This R2 region includes a higher density of positively charged residues that enhance binding most likely via dynamic charged:charged interactions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors tested the effect of KR residue mutation in the R1 and R2 regions in p107 dephosphorylation. KR mutants used for the R1 are R621A/K623A, the two mutants that were tested in Figure 1D and that were shown to impact B55 binding. However, they select K657A/R659A for R2 region. These two mutants were not tested in Figure 1D. Why do they introduce these mutants and not R647A that was investigated in Figure 1D? If the authors think that these residues are important, why did they not test them for its capacity to bind B55 in Figure 1D?</p></disp-quote><p>In some of our earliest experiments we had compared binding of the GST-p107 spacer, to a previously made mutants that prevent cyclin E/A binding (KRRL-AAAA and RRL-AAA mutations to Ala). These mutations disrupt the RxL cyclin binding site. These experiments clearly showed that elimination of these residues reduce B55a binding, and confirmed reduced binding for cyclin A.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Pull down assays with the indicated fusion proteins from HEK-293 lysates were performed and binding of B55<sub>a</sub> and Cyclin A was determined by western blot analysis.</title><p>Two replicates of the experiment showed comparable results.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-63181-sa2-fig5-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Since it was obvious that those residues were important for enhancing R2 avidity, we made the R1R2 K657A/R659A mutants when we started to measure dephosphorylation activity.

We have added clarificatory sentences to the text (Results page 2, lines 8 and 9; Discussion page 3, lines 3-4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Other cdk-dependent phosphorylation sites on p107 that are essential for E2F binding have been described. Some of these sites are out of the spacer sequence. It will be interesting to know whether the dephosphorylation of these sites are dependent on PP2A-B55 and regulated by the mutants on the spacer sequence that decrease B55 binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that this is interesting. We are studying other CDK sites on p107 that may be controlled by this SLiM or conserved SLiMs in other regions. We have started with S640, as we know gets dephosphorylated by B55a/PP2A (Figure 3C), but we do not know if its dephosphorylation is dependent on the SLiM, because we did not have a way to easily detect this phosphosite. We have now generated GSTp107R1R2 mutants that allow us to detect S640 independently of S615 with a CDK substrate antibody. We are generating R1 SLiM mutants to monitor S640 dependency. On the other hand, we have detected a potential degenerate SLiM in the C-terminus of p107, that is also conserved in pRB and could mediate dephosphorylation of C-terminal sites. Our preliminary data show binding of the pRB C-termini to B55a is dependent on the SLiM. This work is ongoing, but out of the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Figure 4A and B. Dephosphorylation pattern of R1R2 control construct is drastically different in Figure 4A compared to 4B. In the first case, complete dephosphorylation does only take place upon two hours of incubation compared with fifteen minutes in the second. This is very weird if the same purified phosphatase is used in both experiments. In this line, I would expect a timing of few minutes for a total dephosphorylation when a purified phosphatase is used. Does it mean that phosphatase in Figure 4A lost activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We have used multiple batches of PP2A/B55a purified from human cells. While the purified holoenzyme is always active and suitable for experimentation the specific activity varies from batch to batch. Originally, we set up our assays to work in the range from 30 to 120 minutes, as we are using µg amounts of substrate, while both purified kinase and phosphatase holoenzymes are in the low nanogram range. When we started to introduce peptides for competition assays, we further optimized the experiment to be completed within one hour by increasing the amount of active phosphatase. As the reviewer suggests the relative amount of active holoenzyme used in 4A is lower than that used in 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. In the same line, to really show the involvement of the pST-x(5-10)-(RK)-Vxx(VI)R in Tau dephosphorylation by PP2A-B55 a direct mutant of this sequence of Tau should be checked.</p></disp-quote><p>As per this comment, we generated a full-length GST-FL-TAU mutant (P10636-8, 441 aa isoform). We found, GST-FL-TAU binds relatively more weakly than GSTp107-R1R2, despite the previous observation that it contains two lysine rich regions that may facilitate binding to B55a. We found that mutation of the SLiM did not disrupt binding in the context of the full-length TAU protein. As there are several charged:charged interactions that stabilize the interaction of the PP2A/B55a holoenzyme with FL-Tau, these may facilitate dephosphorylation of other sites in Tau and be sufficient to stabilize binding even in the absence of the SLiM. Our interpretation is that this TAU SLiM controls dephosphorylation of the Prolinedirected Thr<sub>217</sub> amino terminal to the SLiM. In much studied phosphatases such as PP1 and PP2B, multiple SLiMs and charged-charged interaction contribute to overall binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. What are the consequences of B55a-interaction mutants in p107 function? Is that mutant protein able to sustain cell cycle arrest?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on these questions, we felt that we needed to extend our findings depicted in Figure 6 with functional data. Therefore, we performed several co-transfection experiments in U-2 OS cells to determine the effect of B55a on p107 cell cycle effects and its interaction with E2F4. Our representative experiments are shown in Figure D-F. Together these show that B55a suppresses phosphorylation of at least S<sub>615</sub> (Figure 6D), potently enhances p107 mediated cell cycle arrest (Figure 6E and F), but has no major effects on p107/E2F4 complex abundance (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). The data also show, that the p107 mediated G1 arrest is at least partially dependent on the p107 SLiM, and that mutation of the SLiM strongly diminishes the potent effects of B55a. We also found that cyclin E bypasses p107 cell cycle suppression without disrupting p107/E2F4 complexes. Altogether, suggests that B55a promotes p107 activation and cell cycle arrest at least in part by opposing cyclin E/CDK2 function likely by mechanisms independent of E2F4. Further work beyond the scope of this manuscript will be needed to fully address the mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article></article>
