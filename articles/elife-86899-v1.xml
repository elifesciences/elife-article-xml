Social insects provide a striking example of polyphenism, with queen and worker castes exhibiting morphological, behavioral, and reproductive differences. Here, we show that trophic eggs, which do not contain an embryo and are primarily regarded as a source of food, play a role in the process of caste determination in the harvester ant <italic>Pogonomyrmex rugosus</italic>. When first instar larvae were given access to trophic eggs, they mostly developed into workers. By contrast, larvae without access to trophic eggs developed into queens. We found that trophic eggs differ in many ways from viable eggs, including texture, morphology, and their contents of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, sugar, and small RNAs. Moreover, comparison of miRNA fragment size distributions suggests differences in the composition of miRNAs between the two egg types. This is the first demonstration of trophic eggs playing a role in caste determination in social insects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ants</kwd><kwd>caste determination</kwd><kwd>trophic eggs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_200437</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006390</institution-id><institution>University of Lausanne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name><name><surname>Schwander</surname><given-names>Tanja</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/741491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Laurent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Experiments manipulations show that trophic eggs can suppress queen development and therefore regulate caste determination in ants.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many species of insects, spiders, amphibians, marine invertebrates, and sharks produce trophic eggs, a special type of eggs that do not contain an embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levin and Bridges, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake and Arnofsky, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kudo and Nakahira, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perry and Roitberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strathmann and Strathmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gibson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">López-Ortega and Williams, 2018</xref>). It is generally assumed that these non-developing eggs are either a by-product of failed reproduction or that they serve as nutrition for offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perry and Roitberg, 2006</xref>). However, the suggestion that trophic eggs solely provide a nutritional function is based on surprisingly little evidence. We here report a direct function of trophic eggs in the determination of alternative phenotypes in ants.</p><p>Trophic eggs have been reported in many ant species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table 1</xref>) and are generally thought to mostly or only serve as food for offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crespi, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hölldobler and Wilson, 1990</xref>). Trophic eggs play an important role during the time of colony founding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hölldobler and Wilson, 1990</xref>). Because in most ant species, queens do not forage after the mating flight, they metabolize the alary muscles and fat bodies and convert them into eggs, which serve as food to rear the first batch of larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huber, 1905</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keller and Passera, 1989</xref>). Except for a few species such as <italic>Crematogaster smithi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heinze et al., 1995</xref>) and <italic>Acanthomyrmex ferox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gobin and Ito, 2000</xref>), the queens generally stop producing trophic eggs after the eclosion of the first workers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table 1</xref>). So far, the absence of trophic eggs has been reported in only one species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Trophic egg production is widespread in ants.</title><p>Simplified phylogenetic tree of ant subfamilies redrawn after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romiguier et al., 2022</xref>.

The question mark indicates that it is unclear whether trophic eggs can be produced by queens (in <italic>Lasius niger</italic>, trophic eggs are produced by workers and possibly queens, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table 1</xref>).

In some species, workers further lay trophic eggs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table 1</xref>). These eggs have a trophic function, in particular in genera such as <italic>Pogonomyrmex</italic> where there is no or only little trophallaxis (regurgitative food sharing) among workers. In such species, it has been suggested that trophic eggs may play an important role in food distribution within the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gobin and Ito, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Several studies suggested that the presence of trophic eggs may affect the developmental trajectory of larvae. A study in the Argentine ant <italic>Linepithema humile</italic> showed that the presence of queens in colonies was associated with a drastic decrease in the number of worker-laid trophic eggs as well as a decrease in the proportion of larvae developing into queens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartels, 1988</xref>). Bartels thus proposed that trophic eggs may increase the probability of larvae to develop into queens, which are much larger than workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartels, 1988</xref>). In some lineages of <italic>Pogonomyrmex barbatus</italic>, queens laid a higher proportion of trophic eggs upon the experimental increase of maternal juvenile hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helms Cahan et al., 2011</xref>). Because the treatment also strongly reduced the number of workers produced but triggered a 50% increase in worker body size, trophic eggs were suggested to affect worker size. An increase in the proportion of trophic eggs has also been suggested to be associated with an increase in the proportion of larvae developing into queens (<italic>L. humile</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartels, 1988</xref>; <italic>P. barbatus</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helms Cahan et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, because they observed an increase in nitrogen content with increasing female caste size in the ant <italic>Pogonomyrmex badius</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith and Suarez, 2010</xref> suggested that the larger castes may consume more trophic (nutritional) eggs than the smaller caste, which would feed more on foraged insects. In summary, in at least three species of ants, trophic eggs may play a role in the developmental trajectories of female larvae.</p><p>While conducting egg cross-fostering experiments in the ant <italic>Pogonomyrmex rugosus</italic> to study worker size variation, we observed a sudden increase in the frequency of females developing into queens. During these experiments, we discarded trophic eggs and only cross-fostered eggs that would eventually hatch (hereafter viable eggs). This raises the possibility that the absence of trophic eggs influenced the process of caste determination. These observations prompted us to investigate whether trophic eggs play a role in caste determination in <italic>P. rugosus</italic>. Our experiments revealed that the presence of trophic eggs reduces the probability that female larvae develop into reproductive individuals. Metabolomic analyses also revealed profound differences between viable and trophic eggs, including in the composition of miRNAs and content of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, and sugar.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Trophic and viable egg characteristics</title><p><italic>P. rugosus</italic> queens lay two types of eggs that are morphologically different.

These eggs differ in many ways from viable eggs. First, trophic eggs are larger, rounder, have a smoother surface, a more granular-looking content as well as a more fragile chorion than viable eggs. Similar differences between trophic and viable eggs have been reported in other ant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilson, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wardlaw and Elmes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gobin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dietemann and Peeters, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dietemann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perry and Roitberg, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Our analyses also showed that trophic eggs are solely laid by queens; <italic>P. rugosus</italic> workers are able to produce viable eggs which occasionally develop into males, but they do not lay trophic eggs. Moreover, trophic eggs have a reduced DNA content.</p><p>Importantly, our experiments showed that the presence of trophic eggs influences the process of caste determination. First instar female larvae fed with trophic eggs were significantly more likely to develop into workers than larvae without access to trophic eggs. This was somewhat surprising because trophic eggs are generally thought to be an important source of nutrients to the colony and, everything else being equal, one would think that eating such eggs should increase the likelihood of females to develop into queens (which are usually larger than workers). Indeed, two earlier studies suggested that an increase in the proportion of trophic eggs might be associated with an increase in the proportion of larvae developing into queens (<italic>L. humile</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartels, 1988</xref>; <italic>P. barbatus</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helms Cahan et al., 2011</xref>). However, in these two studies, variation in the availability of trophic eggs was associated with other differences (number of queens in the colony, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartels, 1988</xref>; Administration of a JH analog, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helms Cahan et al., 2011</xref>), making it difficult to determine what factor had a causal effect. It would be interesting to experimentally manipulate the quantity of trophic eggs in <italic>L. humile</italic> and <italic>P. barbatus</italic> to determine whether they have a positive or inhibitory effect on the likelihood of larvae to develop into queens.</p><p>Our analyses revealed that trophic eggs have a lower content of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, and glucose than viable eggs. A reduced protein content of trophic as compared to viable eggs has also been documented in <italic>Pheidole pallidula</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lorber and Passera, 1981</xref>). These findings are in line with the view that trophic eggs do not simply have a nutritional function, as it might then be expected that they should at least contain as much nutrients as viable eggs. Interestingly, our analyses also revealed important differences in RNA and miRNA content between the two egg types. miRNAs have already been suggested to influence larval caste determination in the honeybee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2013</xref>) with worker jelly being enriched in miRNAs compared to royal jelly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). These studies suggest that it is not the royal jelly that stimulates larval determination into queen, but rather the worker jelly which stimulates the development of larvae into workers. Similarly, our study reveals that compounds found in trophic eggs, perhaps miRNAs, influence larval development toward the worker phenotype. Interestingly, it has also been recently shown that trophallactic fluid in the ant <italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic> contains non-digestive related proteins, microRNAs, and juvenile hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, comparison of trophallactic fluid proteins across social insect species revealed that many are regulators of growth, development, and behavioral maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meurville and LeBoeuf, 2021</xref>). Finally, a recent study showed that pupae of several ant species produce secretions that play an important role for early larval nutrition, with young larvae exhibiting stunted growth and decreased survival without access to the fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Snir, 2022</xref>). This raises the possibility that chemicals delivered in trophic eggs, trophallactic fluids, and pupae secretions play previously unsuspected roles in communication and caste development. Given that some ants do not perform trophallaxis, it would be interesting to determine whether there are differences in the content of trophic eggs of species performing trophallaxis and species that do not.</p><p>Maternal effects on the process of caste determination have been demonstrated in several social insect species, including <italic>P. rugosus</italic>, either by queen behavior or content of the eggs being produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Menten et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Linksvayer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schwander et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Libbrecht et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2019</xref>). This is, to our knowledge, the first experimental demonstration that provisioning of trophic eggs influences caste fate. Since only queens produce trophic eggs in <italic>P. rugosus</italic>, trophic egg provisioning could be the main mechanism underlying the previously documented maternal effects on the process of caste determination. In species where workers produce trophic eggs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table 1</xref>), the same mechanism could allow workers to influence colony level caste ratios if their eggs do also affect the process of caste determination. The presence of trophic eggs has been documented in only relatively few ant species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, their presence has been investigated in only a few species, and it is likely that trophic eggs are produced in most ant species, particularly in those with an independent mode of colony founding.</p><p>Finally, our analyses also revealed seasonal differences in the proportion of viable and trophic eggs, with a higher ratio of trophic eggs before hibernation than after. In <italic>Pogonomyrmex</italic>, the production of new queens occurs after hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith and Tschinkel, 2006</xref>) or when the queen dies or is removed from the colony (pers. obs). Thus, new queens are typically produced when there are fewer trophic eggs. Our results predict that under natural conditions, a decrease in the proportion of trophic eggs should lead to an increase in the proportion of larvae developing into queens. The same logic applies to species where trophic eggs are laid only by the workers in queen-right colonies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1, table 1</xref>). After the queen’s death, workers start producing their own male offspring and lay mostly (if not only) viable eggs (<italic>Temnothorax recedens</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dejean and Passera, 1974</xref>; <italic>Plagiolepis pygmaea</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Passera, 1980</xref>; <italic>Myrmecia gulosa</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dietemann et al., 2002</xref>), which again leads to a decrease, or cessation, in trophic egg production. A decrease in trophic egg production and the development of queens were observed simultaneously in freshly orphaned colonies of <italic>T. recedens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dejean and Passera, 1974</xref>), <italic>P. pygmaea</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Passera, 1980</xref>), and <italic>M. gulosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dietemann et al., 2002</xref>). These examples are consistent with the view that trophic eggs may also play a role in the process of caste determination in other ant species.</p><p>In addition to the seasonal differences reported in this study, previous studies in ants have also revealed that young queens produce more trophic eggs than older queens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hölldobler and Wilson, 1990</xref>). Interestingly, the production of new queens in ant colonies starts only when colonies are several years old and have reached a relatively large size. Thus, this raises the possibility that the decrease of the proportion of trophic eggs laid by queens when they age may contribute to the production of new queens being restricted to colonies having reached a relatively large size.</p><p>Egg cannibalism has been reported in many ant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sorensen et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourke, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crespi, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peeters and Tsuji, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aron et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinze et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schultner et al., 2013</xref>) and may serve many purposes, including preferential elimination of males, source of energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sorensen et al., 1983</xref>) and intracolony conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schultner et al., 2014</xref>). Our study indicates a new potential role of egg cannibalism as a mechanism to regulate the allocation of energy into the production of new queens versus workers.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides a new striking example of how females can influence the developmental fate of their offspring. Because many ants produce trophic eggs, it is possible that this mechanism of parental manipulation is widespread and plays an important role in the general process of caste determination. It would be interesting to conduct manipulative experiments similar to those of this study in additional species to determine whether trophic eggs broadly play a role in the process of caste determination. Of interest would also be to determine what chemicals in the egg are responsible for influencing the development of larvae.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Some populations of <italic>P. rugosus</italic> are characterized by a genetic caste determination system whereby development into queens or workers is determined by whether the eggs are fertilized by males of the same genetic lineage or a different genetic lineage than the queen producing the eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Julian et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volny and Gordon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Helms Cahan and Keller, 2003</xref>).

The queens were collected after mating flights in 2008 (Bowie) and 2023 (Bowie and Florence) to initiate colonies in the laboratory. The colonies were maintained in plastic boxes containing water tubes (glass tubes filled with water and sealed with a cotton plug) at 28°C and 60% humidity, with a 12/12 hr light:dark cycle.

From each of 22 donor colonies, we obtained approximately 30 freshly hatched larvae by isolating the queens for 16 hr (from 2 pm to 6 am) every day for 3 weeks (in October 2020), with a 24-hr break every 3 days. Eggs were collected every 8 hr and placed during 10 days in a Petri dish with a water reservoir ensuring a high humidity until they hatched. After hatching, for each colony, half of the larvae (i.e., 15 larvae) were then transferred into a recipient colony containing 20 workers, while the other half were placed in identical recipient colonies, which received in addition 45 0- to 4-hr-old trophic eggs (i.e., there were 3 trophic eggs per larva). There was no cross-fostering between colonies, so that larvae were always placed in recipient colonies containing workers from the same donor colony. The recipient colonies were maintained at 28°C and 60% humidity, with a 12/12 hr light:dark cycle and fed ad libitum twice a week with grass seeds, flies and 20% honey water. The caste of each newly produced individual was recorded at the pupal stage.

Donor colony was included as a random effect. To test whether the presence of trophic eggs affects survival, we performed a linear mixed-effects analysis with mortality as a response variable, presence/absence of trophic eggs as explanatory variable, and colonies as random effects. As we found a significantly higher survival of larvae in recipient colonies with trophic eggs than recipient colonies without trophic eggs (see results), we tested whether the percentage of larvae developing into queens was correlated with survival by performing a linear mixed-effects analysis with the percentage of queen pupae as response variable, the survival as an explanatory variable and colonies as a random factor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Volume and content of trophic and viable eggs</title><p>The volumes of trophic (<italic>n</italic> = 11) and viable eggs (<italic>n</italic> = 14) were estimated by using the volume of an ellipse <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">g</mml:mi><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic"> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">g</mml:mi><mml:mtext mathvariant="italic"> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">w</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$\left(\frac{4}{3} \times \pi \times \mathit{egg\ length} \times \left(\frac{\mathit{egg\ width}}{2}\right)^2 \right) $\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> with egg length and width estimated on images under ×10 magnification using ZEN Microscopy Software (v. 1.1.2.0).</p><p>To determine the nutritional content of viable and trophic eggs, we quantified the proteins, triglycerides, glycogen, and glucose in both types of eggs.

To obtain the two types of eggs, we isolated 12 queens for 10 hr (7 am to 5 pm; from March to October 2021) in a dark Petri dish with three workers and a water supply. Eggs were collected every hour (so all eggs were a maximum of 1 hr old), and trophic and viable eggs were flash-frozen separately in liquid nitrogen. Twenty eggs were pooled for triglycerides–sugar–protein analyses and six eggs for RNA analyses. They were kept at –80°C until the extractions were performed. After the 10 hr of isolation, queens and workers were returned to their colony until the next isolation session.

The authors also compare a number of features of trophic eggs, including protein, DNA, RNA, and miRNA content, to reproductive eggs. To support their argument that trophic eggs have an inhibitory effect on queen development, the authors show that trophic eggs have a lower content of protein, triglycerides, glycogen, and glucose than reproductive eggs, and that their miRNA distributions are different relative to reproductive eggs. Although the finding of an inhibitory influence of trophic eggs on queen development is indeed arresting, the egg cross-fostering experiment that supports this finding can be effectively boiled down to a single figure (Figure 6). The rest of the data are supplementary and correlative in nature (and can be combined), especially the miRNA differences shown between trophic and reproductive eggs. This means that the authors have not yet identified the mechanism through which the inhibitory effect on queen development is occurring. To this reviewer, this finding is more appropriate as a short report and not a research article. A full research article would be warranted if the authors had identified the mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect on queen development. Furthermore, the article is written poorly and lacks much background information necessary for the general reader to properly evaluate the robustness of the conclusions and to appreciate the significance of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We agree that the paper would benefit by having more background information and more discussion. We have followed this advice in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In &quot;Trophic eggs affect caste determination in the ant Pogonomyrmex rugosus&quot; Genzoni et al. probe a fundamental question in sociobiology, what are the molecular and developmental processes governing caste determination? In many social insect lineages, caste determination is a major ontogenetic milestone that establishes the discrete queen and worker life histories that make up the fundamental units of their colonies. Over the last century, mechanisms of caste determination, particularly regulators of caste during development, have remained relatively elusive. Here, Genzoni et al. discovered an unexpected role for trophic eggs in suppressing queen development - where bi-potential larvae fed trophic eggs become significantly more likely to develop into workers instead of gynes (new queens). These results are unexpected, and potentially paradigm-shifting, given that previously trophic eggs have been hypothesized to evolve to act as an additional intracolony resource for colonies in potentially competitive environments or during specific times in colony ontogeny (colony foundation), where additional food sources independent of foraging would be beneficial. While the evidence and methods used are compelling (e.g., the sequence of reproductive vs. trophic egg deposition by single queens, which highlights that the production of trophic eggs is tightly regulated), the connective tissue linking many experiments is missing and the downstream mechanism is speculative (e.g., whether miRNA, proteins, triglycerides, glycogen levels in trophic eggs is what suppresses queen development). Overall, this research elevates the importance of trophic eggs in regulating queen and worker development but how this is achieved remains unknown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments and agree that future work should focus on identifying the substances in trophic eggs that are responsible for caste determination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations For The Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The context for this study is insufficiently developed in the introduction - it would be nice to have a more detailed survey of what is known about trophic eggs in insects, especially social insects. The end of the introduction nicely sets up the hypothesis through the prior work described by Helms Cahan et al. (2011) where they found JH supplementation increased trophic egg production and also increased worker size. I think that the introduction could give more context about egg production in Pogonomyrmex and other ants, including what is known about worker reproduction. For example, Suni et al. 2007 and Smith et al. 2007 both describe the absence of male production by workers in two different harvester ants. Workers tend to have underdeveloped ovaries when in the presence of the queen. Other species of ants are known to have worker reproduction seemingly for the purpose of nutrition (see Heinze and Hölldober 1995 and subsequent studies on Crematogaster smithi). Because some ants, including Pogonomyrmex, lack trophallaxis, it has been hypothesized that they distribute nutrients throughout the nest via trophic eggs as is seen in at least one other ant (Gobin and Ito 2000). Interestingly, Smith and Suarez (2009) speculated that the difference in nutrition of developing sexual versus worker larvae (as seen in their pupal stable isotope values) was due to trophic egg provisioning - they predicted the opposite as was found in this study, but their prediction was in line with that of Helms Cahan et al. (2011). This is all to say that there is a lot of context that could go into developing the ideas tested in this paper that is completely overlooked. The inclusion of more of what is known already would greatly enrich the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be useful to provide a larger context to the study. We now provide more information on the life-history of ants and explained under what situations queens and workers may produce trophic eggs. We also mentioned that some ants such as <italic>Crematogaster smithi</italic> have a special caste of “large workers” which are morphologically intermediate between winged queens and small workers and appear to be specialized in the production of unfertilized eggs. We now also mention the study of Goby and Ito (200) where the authors show that trophic eggs may play an important role in food distribution withing the colony, in particular in species where trophallaxis is rare or absent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods:</p><p>L49: What lineage is represented in the colonies used? The collection location is near where both dependent-lineage (genetic caste determining) P. rugosus and &quot;H&quot; lineage exist. This is important to know. Further, depending on what these are, the authors should note whether this has relevance to the study. Not mentioning genetic caste determination in a paper that examines caste determination is problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have now provided information at the very beginning of the material and method section that the queens had been collected in populations known not to have dependentlineage (genetic caste determining) mechanisms of caste determination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L63 and throughout: It would be more efficient to have a paragraph that cites R (must be done) and RStudio once as the tool for all analyses.

This is important because some colonies of Pogonomyrmex rugosis have been shown to undergo genetic caste determination, in which case the main result would be rendered insignificant. What is the evidence that caste determination in the lineages/colonies used is largely environmentally influenced and in what contexts/environmental factors? All of this should be made clear.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have expanded the introduction to discuss previous work on caste determination in <italic>Pogonomyrmex</italic> species with environmental caste determination and now also provide evidence at the beginning of the Material and Method section that the two populations studied do not have a system of genetic caste determination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 32 and throughout the paper: What is meant exactly by 'reproductive eggs'? Are these eggs that develop specifically into reproductives (i.e., queens/males) or all eggs that are non-trophic? If the latter, then it is best to refer to these eggs as 'viable' in order to prevent confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have updated the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1/Supp Table 1: It is surprising how few species are known to lay trophic eggs. Do the authors think this is an informative representation of the distribution of trophic egg production across subfamilies, or due to lack of study? Furthermore, the branches show ant subfamilies, not families. What does the question mark indicate? Also, the information in the table next to the phylogeny is not easy to understand. Having in the branches that information, in categories, shown in color for example, could be better and more informative. Finally, having the 'none' column with only one entry is confusing - discuss that only one species has been shown to definitely not lay trophic eggs in the text, but it does not add much to the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Trophic eggs are probably very common in ants, but this has not been very well studied. We added a sentence in the manuscript to make this clear.</p><p>Thanks for noticing the error family/subfamily error. This has been corrected in Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 1.</p><p>The question mark indicates uncertainty about whether queens also contribute to the production of trophic eggs in one species (<italic>Lasius niger</italic>). We have now added information on that in the Figure legend.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be easier to have the information on whether queens and workers produce trophic on the branches of the Tree. However, having the information on the branches would suggest that the “trait” evolved on this part of the tree. As we do not know when worker or queen production of trophic eggs exactly evolved, we prefer to keep the figure as it is.</p><p>Finally, we have also removed the none in the figure as suggested by the reviewer and discussed in the manuscript the fact that the absence of trophic eggs has been reported in only one ant species (<italic>Amblyopone silvestrii</italic>: Masuko 2003_)._</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on materials and methods:</p><p>Why did they settle on three trophic eggs per larva for their experimental setup?</p></disp-quote><p>We used three trophic eggs because under natural conditions 50-65% of the eggs are trophic. The ratio of trophic eggs to viable eggs (larvae) was thus similar natural condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 50: In what kind of setup were the ants kept? Plaster nests? Plastic boxes? Tubes? Was the setup dry or moist? I think this information is important to know in the context of trophic eggs.</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain that colonies were maintained in plastic boxes with water tubes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 60: Were all the 43 queens isolated only once, or multiple times?</p></disp-quote><p>Each of the 43 queens were isolated for 8 hours every day for 2 weeks, once before and once after hibernation (so they were isolated multiple times). We have changed the text to make clear that this was done for each of the 43 queens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could isolating the queen away from workers/brood have had an effect on the type of eggs laid?</p></disp-quote><p>This cannot be completely ruled out. However, it is possible to reliably determine the proportion of viable and trophic eggs only by isolating queens. And importantly the main aim of these experiments was not to precisely determine the proportion viable and trophic eggs, but to show that this proportion changes before and after hibernation and that queens do not lay viable and trophic eggs in a random sequence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since it was established that only queens lay trophic eggs why was the isolation necessary?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes this was necessary because eggs are fragile and very difficult to collect in colonies with workers (as soon as eggs are laid they are piled up and as soon as we disturb the nest, a worker takes them all and runs away with them). Moreover, it is possible that workers preferentially eat one type of eggs thus requiring to remove eggs as soon as queens would have laid them. This would have been a huge disturbance for the colonies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 61: Is this hibernation natural or lab induced? What is the purpose of it? How long was the hibernation and at what temperature? Where are the references for the requirement of a diapause and its length?</p></disp-quote><p>The hibernation was lab induced. We hibernated the queens because we previously showed that hibernation is important to trigger the production of gynes in <italic>P. rugosus</italic> colonies in the laboratory (Schwander et al 2008; Libbrecht et al 2013). Hibernation conditions were as described in Libbrecht et al (2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 73: If the queen is disturbed several times for three weeks, which effect does it have on its egg-laying rate and on the eggs laid? Were the eggs equally distributed in time in the recipient colonies with and without trophic eggs to avoid possible effects?</p></disp-quote><p>It is difficult to respond what was the effect of disturbance on the number and type of eggs laid. But again our aim was not to precisely determine these values but determine whether there was an effect of hibernation on the proportion of trophic eggs. The recipient colonies with and without trophic eggs were formed in exactly the same way. No viable eggs were introduced in these colonies, but all first instar larvae have been introduced in the same way, at the same time, and with random assignment. We have clarified this in the Material and Method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 77: Before placing the freshly hatched larvae in recipient colonies, how long were the recipient colonies kept without eggs and how long were they fed before giving the eggs? Were they kept long enough without the queen to avoid possible effects of trophic eggs, or too long so that their behavior changed?</p></disp-quote><p>The recipient colonies were created 7 to 10 days before receiving the first larvae and were fed ad libitum with grass seeds, flies and honey water from the beginning. Trophic eggs that would have been left over from the source colony should have been eaten within the first few days after creating the recipient colonies. However, even if some trophic eggs would have remained, this would not influence our conclusion that trophic eggs influence caste fate, given the fully randomized nature of our treatments and the considerable number of independent replicates. The same applies to potential changes in worker behavior following their isolation from the queen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 77: Is it known at what stage caste determination occurs in this species? Here first instar larvae were given trophic eggs or not. Does caste-determination occur at the first instar stage? If not, what effect could providing trophic eggs at other stages have on caste-determination?</p></disp-quote><p>A previous study showed that there is a maternal effect on caste determination in the focal species (Schwander et al 2008). The mechanism underlying this maternal effect was hypothesized to be differential maternal provisioning of viable eggs. However, as we detail in the discussion, the new data presented in our study suggests that the mechanism is in fact a different abundance of trophic eggs laid by queens. There is currently no information when exactly caste determination occurs during development</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on results:</p><p>Line 65: How does investigating the order of eggs laid help to &quot;inform on the mechanisms of oogenesis&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the aim was not to study the mechanism of oogenesis.

Or is it some other adaptive reason?</p></disp-quote><p>It is likely to be due to a reduction in cell number (trophic eggs have maternal DNA in the chorion, while viable eggs have in addition the cells from the developing zygote) but we do not have data to make this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there a logical sequence to the sequence of egg production? The authors showed that the sequence is non-random, but can they identify in what way? What would the biological significance be?</p></disp-quote><p>We could not identify a logical sequence. Plausibly, the production of the two types of eggs implies some changes in the metabolic processes during egg production resulting in queens producing batches of either viable or trophic eggs. This would be an interesting question to study, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6b is difficult to follow, and more generally, legends for all figures can be made clearer and more easy to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.
