hypertrophy, fat metabolism, and long bone growth. Here, we describe a completely novel role for natriuretic peptide signaling in the control of neural crest (NC) and cranial placode (CP) progenitors formation. Among the components of this signaling pathway, we show that natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (Npr3) plays a pivotal role by differentially regulating two developmental programs through its dual function as clearance and signaling receptor. Using a combination of MO-based knockdowns, pharmacological inhibitors and rescue assays we demonstrate that Npr3 cooperate with guanylate cyclase natriuretic peptide receptor 1 (Npr1) and natriuretic peptides (Nppa/Nppc) to regulate NC and CP formation, pointing at a broad requirement of this signaling pathway in early embryogenesis. We propose that Npr3 acts as a clearance receptor to regulate local concentrations of natriuretic peptides for optimal cGMP production through Npr1 activation, and as a signaling receptor to control cAMP levels through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The intracellular modulation of these second messengers therefore participates in the segregation of NC and CP cell populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>natriuretic peptides</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>neural crest</kwd><kwd>cranial placode</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE025806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saint-Jeannet</surname><given-names>Jean-Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A combination of morpholino-based knockdowns, pharmacological inhibitors, and rescue assays reveal a novel role for natriuretic peptide signaling in the regulation of cell fates in the embryonic ectoderm.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The vertebrate head is characterized by a complex craniofacial skeleton and paired sensory organs. These structures are derived from two embryonic cell populations the neural crest (NC) and cranial placodes (CP), respectively. The NC contributes to the craniofacial skeleton and a subset of cranial ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Minoux and Rijli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordero et al., 2011</xref>), while CP form the anterior pituitary, optic lens, inner ear, olfactory epithelium and several cranial ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schlosser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grocott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saint-Jeannet and Moody, 2014</xref>). Defects in NC and CP development can cause a wide range of human congenital malformations ranging from craniofacial disorders, blindness, deafness and anosmia, to hormone imbalance and orofacial sensory deficits.</p><p>NC and CP progenitors are specified at the neural border zone (NBZ) at the end of gastrulation. There is abundant literature indicating that the activity of molecules of the fibroblast growth factor (Fgf), Wnt and bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp) families must be precisely modulated to specify both NC and CP progenitors in the embryonic ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stuhlmiller and García-Castro, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bae and Saint-Jeannet, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saint-Jeannet and Moody, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schlosser, 2010</xref>). These growth factors in turn activate a unique repertoire of transcription factors that are responsible for initiating a differentiation program unique to these two cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simões-Costa and Bronner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grocott et al., 2012</xref>). Among these transcription factors, Pax3 and Zic1 are especially critical to promote NC and CP fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monsoro-Burq et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong and Saint-Jeannet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cornish et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Milet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaurena et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubey et al., 2021</xref>). To characterize the molecular events downstream of Pax3 and Zic1, we performed a screen using <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap explants expressing varying combinations of these factors and identified several novel regulators of NC and CP fates including natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (Npr3), a component of natriuretic peptide signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bae et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Natriuretic peptides constitute a family of three structurally related but genetically distinct paracrine factors, A-type, B-type, and C-type natriuretic peptides, also known as Nppa, Nppb, and Nppc. They mediate their activity by binding three single-pass transmembrane receptors Npr1, Npr2, and Npr3. Nppa and Nppb have a higher affinity for Npr1, while Nppc binds more specifically to Npr2. All three ligands have a similar affinity for Npr3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suga et al., 1992</xref>). A fourth ligand, Osteocrin/musclin (Ostn) was originally identified in a screen for secreted signaling peptides in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>) and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishizawa et al., 2004</xref>). Ostn binds Npr3 specifically and with high affinity, competing with other ligands for binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moffatt and Thomas, 2009</xref>). Npr1 and Npr2 are guanylyl cyclase receptors that produce cGMP upon ligand-mediated activation, which in turn activates cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) and inhibits the activity of the cyclic nucleotide-degrading enzyme, phophodiesterase 3 (PDE3). In contrast, Npr3 lacks guanylyl cyclase activity and is primarily acting as a clearance receptor to regulate local concentrations of natriuretic peptides through receptor-mediated internalization and ligand degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nussenzveig et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Potter, 2011</xref>). In addition, the cytoplasmic tail of Npr3 possesses a Gi activator sequences that inhibits adenylyl cyclase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anand-Srivastava et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murthy and Makhlouf, 1999</xref>). Natriuretic peptides have been implicated in a broad range of physiological processes, regulating blood volume and pressure, ventricular hypertrophy, fat metabolism, and long bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Potter et al., 2006</xref>), however very little is known on its role during early embryonic development.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that natriuretic peptide signaling plays an important role in embryogenesis controlling NC and CP progenitors formation in the ectoderm. We propose that through its dual function as a clearance and signaling receptor, Npr3 cooperates with other components of the pathway to differentially activate two developmental programs at the neural plate border.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Npr3 is a target of Pax3 and Zic1 at the neural plate border</title><p>The transcription factors Pax3 and Zic1 are broadly expressed at the NBZ and become progressively restricted to different regions of the ectoderm. <italic>Pax3</italic> is expressed in the presumptive hatching gland, and <italic>Zic1</italic> marks the anterior neural plate, while both factors are co-expressed in the NC-forming region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong and Saint-Jeannet, 2007</xref>). Using gain-of-function and knockdown approaches we, and others, have shown that Pax3 and Zic1 are necessary and sufficient to promote hatching gland and CP fates, respectively, while their combined activity is essential to specify the NC in the embryo and in isolated explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monsoro-Burq et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong and Saint-Jeannet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Milet et al., 2013</xref>).

In contrast, Npr3 lacks guanylyl cyclase activity and is acting as a clearance receptor to regulate local concentrations of natriuretic peptides.

Among the components of this signaling pathway, we demonstrate that Npr3 plays a pivotal role by differentially regulating two developmental programs through its dual function as clearance and signaling receptor. Using a combination of MO-based knockdowns, rescue assays and pharmacological inhibitors we show that Npr3, Npr1 and Nppa/Nppc cooperate in the regulation of NC and CP formation, pointing at a broad requirement of this signaling pathway in early embryogenesis. Because of the nature of these receptors, we propose that Npr3 function in the NC territory is to regulate the local concentrations of natriuretic peptides through its clearance activity for optimal cGMP production through Npr1 activation, while Npr3 signaling activity in the CP territory regulates intracellular cAMP levels via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Therefore, the proper modulation of these two second-messengers participates in the segregation of tnese two cell populations at the neural plate border. This represents a completely novel function for Npr3 and natriuretic peptide signaling.</p><p>Natriuretic peptides have been implicated in a broad range of physiological processes, regulating blood volume and pressure, ventricular hypertrophy, fat metabolism, and long bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Potter et al., 2006</xref>). In mouse, deletion of <italic>Npr3</italic> causes systemic hypotension and skeletal deformities, including hunched backs, dome-shaped skulls, elongated long bones and vertebral bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsukawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaubert et al., 1999</xref>). Npr1 null animals show hypertension, ventricular fibrosis and cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lopez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oliver et al., 1997</xref>), while Npr2 mutant animals are affected by dwarfism, due to impaired endochondral ossification, and female infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tamura et al., 2004</xref>). In a recent study, Npr1 has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for treating acute and chronic itch, as ablation of Npr1-expressing spinal interneurons greatly decreased scratching in responses to itch-inducing agents in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mishra and Hoon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Solinski et al., 2019</xref>). While there is abundant literature on the functions of natriuretic peptide signaling in these important physiological processes, only a few studies have explored its role in embryogenesis. There is evidence that Npr1 may regulate self-renewal and pluripotency in mouse ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelalim and Tooyama, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Magdeldin et al., 2014</xref>), while Npr3 has been proposed to maintain ESCs function and viability by controlling p53 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdelalim and Tooyama, 2012</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we observed increased apoptosis in Npr3-depleted <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos. During zebrafish heart development, the differential activation of Npr3 or Npr1/Npr2 by varying concentrations of natriuretic peptides can promote or inhibit cardiomyocyte proliferation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2014</xref>). An similar inhibitory activity of Nppa-mediated activation of Npr1 was reported in the context of mouse cardiac progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hotchkiss et al., 2015</xref>). Another study has also implicated cardiomyocyte-secreted Osteocrin as an important regulator of membranous and endochondral bone formation in the zebrafish craniofacial skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chiba et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, Nppc-dependent activation of Npr2/cGMP signaling pathway regulate somatosensory axons branching, a process of fundamental importance for proper neuronal connectivity in the nervous system (Review in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dumoulin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In zebrafish, Nppa and Nppb as well as Npr1 and Npr2 are functionally redundant during early cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2014</xref>). We did not see the same level of redundancy in <italic>Xenopus,</italic> as both NC and CP formation are exclusively dependent on Npr1 function at these early stages. While typically Npr1 binds Nppa and Nppb at higher affinity than Nppc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suga et al., 1992</xref>), our results indicate that both Nppa and Nppc are the active peptides at these early embryonic stages, suggesting some species-specific differences on the relative importance of the players.</p><p>The availability and concentration of natriuretic peptides at the cell surface appear to be critical to differentially activate this signaling pathway. This is exemplified by work in zebrafish demonstrating that low and high concentrations of natriuretic peptides can initiate distinct responses in the same cell population. Low concentrations of natriuretic peptides enhance proliferation of embryonic cardiomyocytes in vivo through activation of an Npr3/adenylyl cyclase pathway, while elevated concentrations have the opposite outcome, inhibiting their division through activation of Npr1/Npr2 and cGMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2014</xref>). This observation was further confirmed in mammalian cardiomyocytes cultured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2014</xref>). The role of Npr3 as a modulator of cell proliferation was also described for other cell types with contrasting effects on endothelial and smooth muscle cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khambata et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, local concentrations of natriuretic peptides need to be tightly regulated during development. This can be achieved in various ways, through regulated ligand production, degradation by neutral endopeptidases or via a receptor-mediated clearance mechanism. Our data, using a truncated version of human NPR3 lacking the Gi activator sequences (HNPR3ΔC) to rescue Npr3 knockdown, strongly suggest that the clearance activity of Npr3 is required in the NC lineage to decrease the levels of natriuretic peptides and regulate cGMP production through Npr1 activation. On the other hand, the inability of this truncated construct to rescue CP fate upon Npr3 knockdown is strongly indicative that Npr3 signaling activity and adenylyl cyclase inhibition are necessary for the CP lineage. This was confirmed by restoring CP fate in Npr3-depleted embryos through treatment with SQ22536, a small molecule inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally this dual requirement of Npr3 activity sheds light on the importance of cGMP and cAMP, two key second messager molecules, in establishing NC and CP domains. cGMP through multiple downstream effectors including protein kinases G (PKG), cGMP gated-ion channels and phosphodiesterases can regulate several signaling cascades, while cAMP levels are critical for the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) which in turn regulates a broad range of processes such as cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Future studies will investigate how these second messagers mediate their activity in the specific context of NC and CP development in the embryonic ectoderm.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs and antisense oligonucleotides</title><p><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> Pax3GR and Zic1GR cloned into pCS2 +are the hormone-inducible versions of Pax3 and Zic1, fused to the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligand-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong and Saint-Jeannet, 2007</xref>). <italic>Xenopus laevis npr3.L</italic> (Accession number# BC170137) was amplified by PCR with the Pure Taq Ready-to-go PCR beads (ThermoFisher Scientific; Waltham, MA) using NF stage 35 cDNA as template and the following primers (F:<named-content content-type="sequence">TGGAAGGATGTCCTCTATGC</named-content>; R:<named-content content-type="sequence">ACAGTGCCCCAGTTTTTCAC</named-content>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sally A Moody (Reviewer #1); Dominique Alfandari (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript reports the unique finding that specific ligands and receptors in the natriuretic peptide signaling pathway act during early embryogenesis to discriminate between neural crest (NC) and cranial placode (CP) fates. In particular, natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (Npr3) acts as a clearance receptor to regulate local concentrations of natriuretic peptides, and thus optimal cGMP production through Npr1 activation, to promote NC formation. The three reviewers agree that this work is well done and interesting and would be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> once some issues have been addressed.</p><p>1) The main concern is that the manuscript has not conclusively shown that two different mechanisms are involved in the activation of two distinct developmental programs (i. e. NC and CP progenitor development). The authors interpret their data as showing that the truncated receptor Npr3∆C selectively rescues NC but not CP markers. However it seems possible that the truncated receptor simply has a weaker rescuing activity. It is noted that some embryos injected with the wild-type Npr3 have expanded Six-1 and that is not the case for Npr3∆C (Figure 3C). If Npr3∆C rescuing activity is lower for both NC and CP progenitors, it would contradict the authors' conclusion so experiments addressing this possibility are needed and using an additional marker of CP cells in addition to Six-1 is also important. The authors also presume that this receptor lacks the ability to inhibit cAMP but this should be verified, because Cohen et al., 1996 validated it for a mammalian receptor in a different context.</p><p>2)The doses of MOs and human Npr3 mRNA seem unusually high. Can the reason be given?</p><p>3) There is also concern about the apoptotosis and cell proliferation assays as they do not seem to be highly specific given the variability observed at the control uninjected side, this should be discussed. Also, neither the text nor the methods mention the area (i.e., length X width) of the embryo examined for the TUNEL and PHH3 staining. The text only says &quot;dorsal ectoderm&quot;.

In particular, natriuretic peptide receptor 3 (Npr3) acts as a clearance receptor to regulate local concentrations of natriuretic peptides, and thus optimal cGMP production through Npr1 activation, to promote NC formation. The three reviewers agree that this work is well done and interesting and would be appropriate for publication in eLife once some issues have been addressed.</p><p>1) The main concern is that the manuscript has not conclusively shown that two different mechanisms are involved in the activation of two distinct developmental programs (i. e. NC and CP progenitor development). The authors interpret their data as showing that the truncated receptor Npr3∆C selectively rescues NC but not CP markers. However it seems possible that the truncated receptor simply has a weaker rescuing activity. It is noted that some embryos injected with the wild-type Npr3 have expanded Six-1 and that is not the case for Npr3∆C (Figure 3C). If Npr3∆C rescuing activity is lower for both NC and CP progenitors, it would contradict the authors' conclusion so experiments addressing this possibility are needed and using an additional marker of CP cells in addition to Six-1 is also important. The authors also presume that this receptor lacks the ability to inhibit cAMP but this should be verified, because Cohen et al., 1996 validated it for a mammalian receptor in a different context.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment regarding the rescuing activity of these constructs. To our defense we would like to point out that (i) the Western blot in Figure 3B indicates that both constructs are expressed at similar levels in the embryo; (ii) the requirement for the signaling activity of Npr3 in CP formation is supported by the rescue assay using an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor, SQ22536; and (iii) this requirement is further corroborated in a different assay using an adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, which we show interferes with the expression of 2 CP genes, Six1 and Eya1, in animal caps. Altogether these observations support the conclusions. As far as demonstrating that Npr3∆C lacks the ability to inhibit cAMP, unfortunately we do not have a suitable assay in the embryo for direct validation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2)The doses of MOs and human Npr3 mRNA seem unusually high. Can the reason be given?</p></disp-quote><p>The doses of MOs and mRNAs used in this work are comparable to doses used in our previously published work (Dubey et al., 2021, Timberlake et al., 2021, for example). This is also consistent with other studies that have used similar doses of MOs and mRNAs (Matsuda et al., 2022, Canales Coutino and Mayor, 2022, for example). Furthermore, the ability to rescue the Npr3 KD phenotype together with the confirmation of this phenotype by a non-MO based approach give us confidence in the specificity of Npr3 loss-of-function phenotype at these doses of MOs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There is also concern about the apoptotosis and cell proliferation assays as they do not seem to be highly specific given the variability observed at the control uninjected side, this should be discussed. Also, neither the text nor the methods mention the area (i.e., length X width) of the embryo examined for the TUNEL and PHH3 staining. The text only says &quot;dorsal ectoderm&quot;. When reporting numbers of labeled cells between control and experimental samples, it is important that the same &quot;Area&quot; be examined, for the numbers to be meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We do not have a good explanation for the variability observed at the uninjected side for TUNEL staining, however it is something we have previously reported (see Dubey et al., 2021). In their original paper describing programmed cell death during <italic>Xenopus</italic> development, Hansey and Gautier (1998) report “considerable variation in the degree of TUNEL staining and patterns” between embryos, including left–right asymmetries. They speculate that the presence of a fraction of TUNEL-negative embryos during gastrulation and neurulation may reflect the rapid clearance of dead cells from the embryo. They propose that “embryos showing no staining may be passing through similar waves of cell death, but due to the rapid clearance of dead cells it was not detected.” This phenotype is presumably exacerbated by slight variability in the staging of the embryos. This is now discussed and referenced in the manuscript (see legend for FigS3). Regarding the quantification we are now providing additional information to indicate that the same areas on each side of the embryos (uninjected vs. injected) was used to quantify the number of positive cells (see Materials and methods, page 23, last paragraph), and we now include a visual to illustrate this point (see FigS3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figures 2F/G, snai2 is used as the NC marker, but in Figure 3C, sox10 is the NC marker. In Figure 5D, sox10 is used and in 5F, snai2 is used. It would be more consistent to use both rather than switching back and forth.</p></disp-quote><p>To evaluate NC fate in these experiments we have used 3 different markers snai2, sox10 and twist1, and show that they behave in a similar manner in these assays. We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion, unfortunately as the first authors have now left the lab several months ago, we have not been able to expand the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the blastocele injection what was the control? Did the control get 100 nl of water as well? The blascotocell is a complex fluid that contains multiple proteins and ions that are critical for gastrulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing that out. We have included control injections in which the blastocoel fluid was replaced with water, the solvent for these inhibitors. In our hands this treatment does not affect gastrulation or the expression of snai2 and six1 (see page 9, first paragraph and FigS2).</p></body></sub-article></article>
