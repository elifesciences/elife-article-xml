Striatal pathology contributes to several neuropsychiatric conditions, including aberrant selection of actions for specific rewards in addiction. A major source of glutamate driving striatal activity is the rostral intralaminar nuclei (rILN) of the thalamus. Yet, the information that is relayed to the striatum to support action selection is unknown. Here, we discovered that rILN neurons projecting to the DS are innervated by a range of cortical and subcortical afferents and that rILN→DS neurons stably signaled at two time points in mice performing an action sequence task reinforced by sucrose reward: action initiation and reward acquisition. In vivo activation of this pathway increased the number of successful trials, whereas inhibition decreased the number of successful trials. These findings illuminate a role for the rostral intralaminar nuclear complex in reinforcing actions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000027</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AA028070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mathur</surname><given-names>Brian N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DA047014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cover</surname><given-names>Kara K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neural circuit monitoring and manipulation reveal that neurons of the rostral intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus projecting to the dorsal striatum activate at movement initiation and reward to reinforce actions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Classic models of basal ganglia function regard the dorsal striatum (DS) as an integrator of cortical glutamatergic signaling that is modulated by reward signals arising from midbrain dopaminergic input to support the reinforcement of actions directed toward the acquisition of rewards necessary for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeLong and Wichmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>). While several studies highlight the fact that thalamic nuclei directly project to the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alloway et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smith et al., 2014</xref>), these nuclei are far less represented in basal ganglia models. This reflects our relatively poor understanding of the functional role of thalamostriatal signaling in action reinforcement.</p><p>The intralaminar nuclei are the primary source of thalamic excitatory input to the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elena Erro et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parent et al., 1983</xref>). These nuclei are segregated into rostral and caudal subdivisions. At the caudal end, the medullary lamina splits to create the parafascicular nucleus, and more laterally, the centér median nucleus in monkey and human brains. The boundary distinguishing these two nuclei is undetectable in rodents and other smaller mammals; thus, the posterior intralaminar nuclei are referred to solely as the parafascicular nucleus with the consideration that the lateral component of this nucleus is homologous to the centér median nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jones, 2007</xref>). At the rostral end, the so-called rostral intralaminar nuclei (rILN) include the poorly described and weakly demarcated central lateral (CL), paracentral (PC), and central medial (CM) regions. Both the caudal intralaminar grouping and the rILN receive input from a wide array of cortical and subcortical centers and output to both the striatum and the cortex. As such, it is unclear which of the inputs to the intralaminar nuclei are routed to the striatum to potentially influence action reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groenewegen and Berendse, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Functionally, the caudal intralaminar nuclear group responds to salient sensory cues in monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Minamimoto and Kimura, 2002</xref>) and, in rodents, detects changes in action-outcome contingencies to facilitate behavioral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradfield et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradfield and Balleine, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Recent work implicates the rILN in facilitating the execution and switching of learned actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kato et al., 2018</xref>) and driving behavioral reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cover et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the rILN contribute to action reinforcement, but the information that the rILN integrates and relays to the striatum to support this function is unknown. Examining this in mice using in vivo neural circuit monitoring and manipulation methods, we discovered that the rILN dynamically signal at both the initiation of an action and during reward acquisition to optimize action performance. We also determined that striatal-projecting rILN neurons demonstrate homogeneous physiological properties across the three regions but differently integrate cortical, midbrain, and hindbrain information that is then passed on to the striatum. These data support the notion that the rILN are a central integrator contributing to basal ganglia-mediated action reinforcement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Striatal-projecting rILN neurons exhibit uniform properties</title><p>The rILN consist of a contiguous band of cells within the internal medullary lamina that is parcellated into CL, PC, and CM nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman et al., 1983</xref>).

We fiber photometrically recorded activity-dependent calcium signaling selectively from rILN→DS neurons in mice learning a lever-pressing operant task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To assess whether rILN→DS neurons respond to sensory stimuli eliciting an action, action initiation, termination, kinematic properties, or reward, we trained mice to respond to the lever extension by pressing five times in a defined period of time for a sucrose pellet reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In early training stages, mice must complete one, three, or five fixed-ratio presses (FR1, FR3, and FR5, respectively) with no time limit (NTL) for completion. Intermediate schedules consist of progressively shortened response periods to complete the FR5, terminating at a 5 s time limit. We found transient increases in rILN→DS activity that accompanied the first press in the action sequence across all stages of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Comparing the average rILN→DS activity z-score at 1.5 s before and at the time of the first press, we observed significant differences from the first training protocol (fixed ratio 1; FR1), an intermediate schedule (FR5-NTL), and the final training schedule (FR5-5s time limit; time relative to press: F[1,12]=26.73, p=0.0002; schedule: F[2,24]=9.587, p=0.0009).

We observed increases in rILN→DS signaling aligned to movement onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; t=2.817, p=0.037) and preceding the maximum velocity achieved during movement epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>; t=4.116, p=0.009). Significant changes in rILN→DS activity did not accompany movement cessation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>; t=0.341, p=0.75).</p><p>To discriminate between action initiation and the sensory cues (e.g. lever extension) that may signal action initiation, we used a Pavlovian appetitive conditioning paradigm in which sucrose pellets were administered at the termination of an auditory tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We did neither find tone-related changes in rILN→DS signaling nor did we observe learning-dependent changes in either the tone-paired group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>; time relative to tone: F[1,5]=2.046, p=0.21; training stage: F[1,5]=2.466, p=0.18) or the tone non-paired control cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>; time relative to tone: F[1,5]=2.312, p=0.19; training stage: F[1,5]=0.204, p=0.67).</p><p>Alternatively, our observation of training-dependent increases in action initiation-associated rILN activity may reflect the learned expectation of a rewarded action. To test this, we recorded rILN→DS activity after switching FR5 reinforcement to 0%. Mice extinguished FR5 lever pressing within several sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>, t=11.69, p&lt;0.0001), but the first press-aligned signal on completed (but unreinforced) FR5 trials did not differ significantly from reinforced sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>; time relative to lever: F[1,11]=13.36, p=0.0069; reinforcement: F[1,11]=0.1628, p=0.73). In an alternative paradigm, FR5-trained mice alternated between sessions in which completed trials were reinforced at 100 or 50% probability. Lowering the probability of reinforcement did neither alter performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>; t=0.788, p=0.45) nor did it produce significant differences in first press-aligned rILN activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>; time relative to press: F[1,10]=5.571, p=0.04; reinforcement rate: F[1,10]=0.304, p=0.59).</p><p>Lastly, we observed that rILN→DS activity increases at reward acquisition. Sucrose pellet retrieval was accompanied by increased rILN activity on all FR training protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>; time relative to retrieval: F[1,12]=57.24, p&lt;0.0001; schedule: F[1,12]=10.42, p=0.007; interaction: F[1,12]=5.311, p=0.040). Additionally, this signal negatively correlated with reward retrieval latency across all FR5 schedules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <italic>r</italic>=−0.123, –0.147, and –0.097, 95% CI, p&lt;0.0001).

On intermediate training schedules, mice frequently check the pellet receptacle in between individual presses. We examined rILN→DS activity during these ‘premature’ receptacle head entries on trials that were ultimately completed and observed that these events were accompanied by possible negative fluctuations in rILN activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; time relative to head entry: F[1,12]=3.536, p=0.085; schedule: F[2,24]=0.502, p=0.61; interaction: F[2,24]=0.019).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Rostral intralaminar nuclei (rILN)→dorsal striatum (DS) neurons activate with reward acquisition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon of operant chamber.

Thus, we sought to qualitatively identify afferents impinging specifically onto rILN→DS neurons. To do this, we applied a viral strategy involving injection of nuclei that are upstream of rILN with an anterograde trans-synaptic AAV1 viral construct (AAV1-hSyn-Cre-WPRE-hGH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>) that delivers cre recombinase to rILN neurons.

Our observation of rILN→DS neuronal activity occurring at action initiation and correlating to initiation latency suggests that this excitatory input may directly drive striatal signaling for action execution. The absence of discrete signal changes for presses two through five in mice that are well-trained on the FR5 task may reflect the concatenation of the individual movements into a fluid sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, press-related rILN→DS neuronal activity may be obscured due to the temporal limits of the calcium sensor and photometric system. Regardless, these results support previous observations of rILN activity mediating motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giber et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luma et al., 2022</xref>) and action switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kato et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that rILN→DS neurons activate at reward acquisition presents, to our knowledge, a unique addition to known reward-related circuitry. Midbrain dopamine neuron firing shifts during reinforcement learning from reward presentation to associated cues and unexpected reward presentation or omission to provide teachable reward prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schultz, 1998</xref>). In contrast, we found that the rILN stably and persistently signals at reward acquisition across all stages of training and in multiple contexts. Similar reward-related activity is observed in the rILN of primates performing an oculomotor task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wyder et al., 2003</xref>). This signal may serve as a mechanism to provide ongoing reinforcement of appropriately selected actions. Such a mechanism would be advantageous for both the learning of rewarded action sequences but also provides a salient omission when action outcomes change. The sudden absence of this consistent signal may provide a simple cue to drive the search for a new action plan that results in reward. Indeed, we observed a modest negative signal fluctuation when mice prematurely check for sucrose pellets mid-FR5 sequence suggesting that a potential bidirectional signal may provide an instructive cue for action reinforcement. Inhibition of rILN→DS activity significantly reduced the execution of FR5 pressing, which may be due to degradation of this putative reinforcement signal. Regardless, the fiber photometry findings should be considered cautiously given that this approach may not sensitively detect the activity of minority neuronal populations.</p><p>Dopamine release ramps with proximity to rewards and scales to reward magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>), in addition to dopamine terminal signaling coinciding with reward presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>). Through a cholinergic intermediary, the rILN are capable of locally inducing striatal dopamine release in a behaviorally significant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cover et al., 2019</xref>). Our finding of rILN signaling at reward acquisition may suggest that this local dopamine release mechanism is evoked at such events, which may supplement somatically driven dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). The rILN may also relay reward-related information directly to MSNs as these cells are shown to encode reward value and action outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hori et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lauwereyns et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nonomura et al., 2018</xref>). The present study photometrically recorded rILN somatodendritic activity and may not fully reflect signaling at the level of the axon terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Legaria et al., 2022</xref>), including calcium-dependent presynaptic plastic changes occurring at these terminals in the striatum. Future work investigating rILN axonal signals in the striatum may reveal further complexity in thalamic activity supporting action learning and motivated behavior.</p><p>One question that emerges from these results is the origin of the rILN→DS action initiation and reward-related signals. Our neuronal tract tracing experiments identified a range of afferents impinging on rILN→DS neurons. The ACC and OFC, which themselves receive input from the rILN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hunnicutt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murphy and Deutch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van der Werf et al., 2002</xref>), provide two sources of excitatory input. These cortical regions are broadly associated with decision making. The OFC encodes outcome value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gremel and Costa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malvaez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stolyarova and Izquierdo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), whereas the ACC encodes decision predictions, surprise signals, and prediction errors, in addition to mediating cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shenhav et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Totah et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wallis and Kennerley, 2011</xref>). Although less studied, the S/L hypothalamus are well connected with mesolimbic circuitry and linked to regulation of feeding behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plaisier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stuber and Wise, 2016</xref>). Together, these afferents may impart value and motivation for rILN→DS guided action selection.</p><p>We also determined that rILN→DS neurons receive input from a basal ganglia output center, the SN pars reticulata, as well as from nuclei that themselves receive input from the SN pars reticulata: the SC, RF, and PPN. These results confirm the presence of both direct and indirect basal ganglia subcortical loops relaying back to the DS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 1986</xref>). Through inhibition driven by the SN and selective disinhibition enabled by D1-MSN pathway signaling, these loops are hypothesized to support the main functions of the basal ganglia: action selection and reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McHaffie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Redgrave et al., 2011</xref>). The rILN are uniquely positioned to provide feedback for these functions, and our observation of rILN activity corresponding to action initiation and reward acquisition supports this notion. Taken together, rILN pathology may contribute to disorders of action engagement: rILN hyperactivity may contribute to drug seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) in a role similar to the adjacent paraventricular thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamlin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matzeu et al., 2015</xref>), or to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jones et al., 2020</xref>), while hypoactivity may contribute to impaired goal-directed behavior in major depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Höflich et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The neuronal tract tracing experiments revealed specificity of some afferents targeting either the CL or CM nuclei. Such differences in anatomical connectivity may confer individual rILN with selective activity during reward-driven action sequences. As our approach to in vivo rILN recording and manipulation prevented us from parsing the contributions of the individual nuclei, we could not determine whether the action initiation and reward acquisition signals are uniformly represented across the three rILN. Future studies targeting individual rILN circuits may identify specific contributions to motivated behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Licks were recorded using Axoscope software (Molecular Devices), and rILN→DS photometry signal was aligned via custom MATLAB code to the start of lick bouts. Bouts were defined as two or more licks with an inter-lick interval of less than 2 s.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>Photometry data were collected using a customized in vivo fiber photometry system. Two single-wavelength laser modules were used: a 473 nm laser for optimal GCaMP6s excitation and a 405 nm laser to excite GCaMP6s at its isosbestic wavelength (Opto Engine, Midvale, UT, USA). Emission from 405 nm excitation was used to control for signal artifacts due to photometry cable motion, background fluorescence, and other sources of noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). The two lasers were multiplexed at 10 or 15 Hz, resulting in a continuous 20 or 30 Hz pulse train. Both laser beams were bounced into a dichroic filter cube designed for 473 and 405 nm excitation as well as for 510 nm emission (Chroma Technology Corp., Bellow Falls, VT, USA). The two excitation wavelengths were focused through a ×4 fluorite objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) onto a multimode fiber bundle (Thorlabs). One fiber was connected to the mouse through a chronic unilateral multimode fiber implant, and another fiber was placed inside a tube of Alexa Fluor 488 to control for variability in laser energy. Emissions from GCaMP6s and Alexa Fluor 488 were detected as an image of the fiber bundle using an ORCA-Flash4.0 LT high-resolution CMOS camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Laser multiplexing and image acquisition were synchronized using an Arduino Leonardo microcontroller. Trial or time-dependent recordings were initiated through MedPC or Ethovision systems. Camera image acquisition parameters were controlled through HCImage software for Hamamatsu cameras.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Electrophysiological data were analyzed using Clampex software. Statistical analyses were performed in Prism (version 6.01; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) or MATLAB (R2019a; The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, MA, USA).</p><p>Photometry data were analyzed using a combination of custom MATLAB code (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>) and Prism. Pixel intensities imaged from the fiber implanted in the rILN and the fluorophore control fiber were first averaged. The background signal in the absence of laser transmission was then subtracted from the averaged signals. Two separate regressions were performed to minimize any noise sources. First, 473 and 405 nm photometry signals were regressed with the corresponding control fluorophore signal, and the residuals of the regression were then used for further processing. The 473 nm signal was then regressed with the 405 nm signal as a covariate, and the residuals of the regression were extracted as the fully processed photometry signal (z-score) from the rILN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">White et al., 2020</xref>). The photometry signal was then statistically analyzed based on performance or operant task event (i.e. movement-aligned activity or FR trial outcome). For each analysis comparing two or more categories of rILN signal, the number of averaged events or trials were standardized across each compared category for each animal. The average z-score for three consecutive time points was statistically analyzed with the appropriate t-test or ANOVA. Signal AUC was computed in MATLAB.</p><p>To quantify relative strength of afferent innervation to rILN→DS neurons identified in the di-synaptic circuit tracing study, tdTomato-labeled cells were counted in CM, ipsilateral CL, and contralateral CL. Separate ratios of cell counts for CM: ipsilateral CL and ipsilateral CL: contralateral CL were derived, correcting for area, within each coronal slice and averaged across slices and cases for a given assessed afferent. Ratios indicating a difference ≥40% of labeled neurons between the compared rILN nuclei are denoted by line thickness in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> summary diagrams. This criterion was also used to assess relative strength of ipsilateral and contralateral afferent→afferent→DS di-synaptic circuits, when applicable.</p><p>All statistical analyses are reported in the Results. The specific statistical test as well as value and description of n are listed in the figure legends. Averaged data is expressed as mean ± SE. Correlations are expressed as Pearson’s r and 95% CIs. All statistical tests were conducted two-sided, when applicable. Significant post-hoc Holm-Ŝidàk tests for ANOVAs are indicated in the figures. All asterisks in figures indicate: * p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001, and **** p&lt;0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with the United States Public Health Service Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (AUP 0522009) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83627-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode1"><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>Source code for the processing and alignment of the photometric signal to experiment-related events.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83627-code1-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files; Source Data files have been provided for all Figures.

The rILN sends a large glutamatergic projection to the DS, but its role in action selection was unknown. The authors found that the rILN neurons that project to the DS were activated at both action initiation and with the reward, and that activation and inhibition of this pathway increased the success or decreased the success of reward acquisition, respectively. The findings are an important advance in our understanding of the function of rILN to DS projection in reward-based behavior, and the manuscript has provided convincing evidence with the appropriate methodologies to support these claims.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83627.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.10.25.513738">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.25.513738v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Along with your revision please provide a point x point response to each reviewer critique, including the public review and recommendations for authors, play special attention to the essential revisions below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers pointed out that a few strong claims are not well-supported by the experimental data, in addition, a couple of previously published studies are not accurately cited/interpreted in the manuscript. Please tone down the related statements and accurately cite the previous findings.</p><p>2) The reviewers requested further clarification, esp. the anatomical tracing part of the experimental data. For example, providing cell counts, clarification on the methods, etc. Please better integrate this part of the finding into the rest of the manuscript. Please follow the more detailed suggestions in the long-form reviews on other suggestions.</p><p>Please include a key resource table if you haven't already done so.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While overall this is a well-executed study that uses a variety of behavior tasks to demonstrate the activity of DS-projecting rILN neurons. Yet, the different parts of this study (electrophysiology, behavior, tracing) feel somewhat disjointed, and additional control experiments would be needed to substantiate some of the claims made.</p><p>– The statement that the authors &quot;discovered that rILN neurons projecting to the DS integrated information from several subcortical and cortical sources&quot; (abstract lines 39 – 41) is misleading and not fully supported by the presented data. While the authors demonstrate that rILN neurons can receive input projections from several subcortical and cortical areas, they do not show whether these projections converge onto the same individual neurons in rILN, and more importantly, they do not show whether &quot;information&quot; is carried by these projections or integrated into rILN neurons during behavior. Recordings and manipulation experiments of these subcortical and cortical inputs to rILN would be necessary to support such a claim.</p><p>– While fiber photometry is a powerful and suitable approach to measuring neuronal calcium signals, the authors should at least discuss the possibility that measuring calcium photometry signals at the cell soma region might not reflect neuronal firing activity (Legaria et al., 2022), and thus this activity might not indicate rILN neuron signaling to the striatum. Fiber photometry recordings of the axons of these projection neurons in DS would provide more definitive evidence for this signaling.</p><p>Therefore, it would be helpful if the authors could tune down the conclusions related to these areas.</p><p>Other suggestions include:</p><p>– Please clarify if DS projecting neurons from all rILN nuclei show the reported action initiation and reward acquisition activity or only CL neurons.</p><p>– Along similar lines, to what extent of rILN was targeted for optogenetic activation and inhibition? It seems that the authors implanted a total of 4 optic fibers, two on each side (please clarify in methods). What was the reasoning behind this? Please show that only rILN and not PF was activated/inhibited.</p><p>– The transsynaptic tracing experiments – the cell count quantifications in CM, PC, and CL are needed.</p><p>– Why is the injection site for the retrograde cre-dependent tdTomato AAV (Figure 5 middle left panels) showing expression? Please clarify. Is the cre coming through transsynaptic AAV1 from direct projections of each AAV1 injection site (AAV1 is not supposed to spread across a second synapse)? The diagrams suggest that not all regions (e.g. SUM or SC) have direct projections to DS.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I think it was very well conducted and is very strong, well written, and within the scope of eLife's typical papers. I look forward to seeing where the authors take this line of investigation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The final neuroanatomical tracing studies are not very well integrated with the rest of the study. The experiments are introduced as a comparison between the striatum- and cortex-projecting neurons, but the latter experiment was not done. Without distinguishing these two populations or possibly comparing the inputs to intralaminar versus parafascicular nuclei, the experiment does not offer a lot to the overall conclusions. The authors should either do the additional work to make a meaningful conclusion from these experiments or exclude them from the current manuscript.</p><p>2) In line 290, the authors state that &quot;in addition to dopamine terminal signaling coinciding with reward presentation (Howe &amp; Dombeck, 2016); an activity that is not reflected in cell body firing&quot;, however, there are plenty of examples of reward-responsive VTA dopamine neurons from single-unit recordings in SNc/VTA (e.g., PMID: 22258508). The authors should also be very careful in their interpretation of the cited work. The Howe and Dombek paper do not claim that movement and reward-related signals are not encoded in the midbrain, but rather that they are differentially encoded by distinct dopamine neurons subpopulations (see their more recent work: bioRxiv: 2022.06.20.496872) arguing that the differences between axonal and somatic dopamine cell responses is due to genetic identity rather than terminal modulation. Undoubtedly terminal modulation is a key player, and this idea is recently gaining a lot of traction, but the dopamine signal in the striatum likely reflects a combination of somatic activity and terminal modulation, and not just the latter.</p><p>3) The authors show that activity in rILN→striatum projection neurons correlates with movement in S2, and their previous study showed that chemogenetically inhibiting all rILN neurons suppresses movement. How do the optogenetic manipulations here affect spontaneous movement and might this explain their observed effects on goal-directed operant responding in Figure 4?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The rostral intralaminar nuclear complex of the thalamus supports striatally-mediated action reinforcement&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Based on our findings that the three nuclei do not differ in electrophysiological properties, we approached the in vivo experiments with the intent to target the rILN as a unit. As the reviewer points out, the medial-lateral coordinate for optic fiber placement tended to align above the CL and PC nuclei. However, variability in fiber placement and spread of light within tissue resulted in inclusion of CM activity as well. Given the spread of light through tissue (Shin, et al., 2016; PMID: 27895987), it would be very difficult to confidently determine from histology which photometry recordings were primarily obtained from CL vs PC vs CM neuronal activity. We agree with the reviewer that these three nuclei may differently signal during reward-driven behavior. Our di-synaptic tracing study supports this possibility as it revealed unique afferent connectivity to rILNDS projecting neurons. We now mention this limitation of our approach in the discussion (lines 324 – 330).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Along similar lines, to what extent of rILN was targeted for optogenetic activation and inhibition?

For our optogenetic experiments, we infused viruses at four locations (bilateral striatum and rILN) and implanted only two fibers (bilateral rILN) to selectively target striatally-projecting rILN neurons. We have added clarification on this detail to the methods section.</p><p>To prevent inadvertent modulation of Pf neurons, we used virus injection coordinates and volumes that prevented viral spread to the Pf and furthermore implanted the optic fibers in the more rostral regions of the rILN. We histologically confirmed viral expression and fiber placement for all mice and excluded any mice with viral spread to the Pf or off-target fiber placement. We include these criteria for post-hoc exclusion in the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The transsynaptic tracing experiments – the cell count quantifications in CM, PC, and CL are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we now include cell counts for 2 cases per investigated afferent (Figure 5 Supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why is the injection site for the retrograde cre-dependent tdTomato AAV (Figure 5 middle left panels) showing expression?

The diagrams suggest that not all regions (e.g. SUM or SC) have direct projections to DS.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. The tdTomato fluorophore expression observed in the striatum may arise from several possible circuit configurations. To survey just a couple: (1) tdTomato expression in the DS arises from direct projections from the afferent bypassing the thalamus (e.g. ipsilateral ACCStriatum), which would result in labeled striatal somata (ACC pyramidal neurons delivering AAV1-cre to an MSN, and those local MSN collaterals retrogradely picking up rAAV-DIO-tdtomato) and ACC labeled axon terminals in the DS (ACC interneurons delivering AAV1-cre to DS-projecting ACC pyramidal neurons that pick up rAAV-DIO-tdtomato); (2) terminal projections arising from the labeled rILN neurons shown in the middle-right panels (i.e. ACCrILNStriatum).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The final neuroanatomical tracing studies are not very well integrated with the rest of the study.

We agree that it was inadvertently misleading to reference the rILNcortical projection without including comparable experimental results. As such, we have rewritten our rationale for the experiment in the manuscript (lines 220-222).</p><p>We do feel that this experiment assessing rILNstriatal afferents has merit and sets the foundation to assess differences between rILN subpopulations with unique postsynaptic targets. Given that our manuscript exclusively characterizes the rILNstriatal projection in both physiology and behavior, we thought it was fitting to include a qualitative survey of afferents that may contribute to the behaviorally dynamic activity of this circuit. Whereas future investigators may seek to compare the connectivity and function of the rILN with other thalamic nuclei, such as the parafascicular nucleus, we respectively feel that it extends beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In line 290, the authors state that &quot;in addition to dopamine terminal signaling coinciding with reward presentation (Howe &amp; Dombeck, 2016); an activity that is not reflected in cell body firing&quot;, however, there are plenty of examples of reward-responsive VTA dopamine neurons from single-unit recordings in SNc/VTA (e.g., PMID: 22258508).

How do the optogenetic manipulations here affect spontaneous movement and might this explain their observed effects on goal-directed operant responding in Figure 4?</p></disp-quote><p>This a great question. We analyzed a number of parameters in the FR5 task to examine whether optogenetic inhibition altered movement. 2-way repeated measures ANOVAs (factors of light delivery and virus expression) did not reveal significant effects for the average FR5 inter-press interval (light: F(1,26)=1.45, P=0.24; virus: F(1,26)=0.33, P=0.57), total FR5 duration (light: F(1,26)=0.001, P=0.97; virus: F(1,26)=0.22, P=0.65), or reward retrieval latency (light: F(1,26)=0.80, P=0.34; virus: F(1,26)=0.99, P=0.33). We did find a significant effect of light delivery on the latency to initiate the FR5 sequence (an average increase of 100 ms for NpHR-eYFP mice and 160 ms for eYFP control mice; light: F(1,26)=17.37, P=0.0003; virus: F(1,26)=0.05, P=0.83), but only the eYFP control cohort yielded a significant post-hoc test (P = 0.0033; NpHR-eYFP: P = 0.054).</p><p>We think two factors contribute to this apparent discrepancy in motor impairment between the present experiment and the published Cover et al., 2019 Cell Reports finding. The 2019 experiment chemogenetically suppressed somatic and terminal activity of all rILN neurons, whereas here we transiently inhibited somatic activity of striatally projecting rILN neurons. Beyond this methodological difference, however, we suspect that the context underlying movement may play a significant role. The 2019 study monitored spontaneous locomotion in an environment free of rewards and meaningful sensory information. In contrast, the present study assessed performance on an external cue-driven paradigm in motivated (food-restricted) subjects.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In Figure 5C (left), it isn't clear that the fluorogold/AAV1 injection was actually into the supramamillary nucleus.
