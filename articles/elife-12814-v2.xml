mutations. For example, V600E in the BRAF hydrophobic activation segment (AS) pocket accounts for &gt;95% of all kinase mutations. While many hypotheses tried to explain such significant mutation patterns, conclusive explanations are lacking. Here, we use experimental and in silico structure-energy statistical analyses, to elucidate why the V600E mutation, but no other mutation at this, or any other positions in BRAF’s hydrophobic pocket, is predominant. We find that BRAF mutation frequencies depend on the equilibrium between the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket, the overall folding energy, the activation of the kinase and the number of bases required to change the corresponding amino acid. Using a random forest classifier, we quantitatively dissected the parameters contributing to BRAF AS cancer frequencies. These findings can be applied to genome-wide association studies and prediction models.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12814.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12814.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12814.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called BRAF are commonly found in certain cancers, such as melanomas. The same BRAF mutation is found in nearly all of these cancers. This mutation causes the 600th amino acid in the BRAF protein – an amino acid called a valine – to be replaced with another amino acid, a glutamate.</p> <p>BRAF is a type of enzyme called a kinase, and it transmits signals inside cells to promote cell growth. Kinases work by adding a phosphate group to other proteins to alter their activity. The structure of the BRAF kinase contains a pocket-like shape, and the valine at position 600 sits buried inside this pocket when the enzyme is inactive. The “valine-to-glutamate” mutation (often called V600E for short) disrupts the interactions that create this pocket. This in turn results in a permanently active form of BRAF and uncontrolled cell growth. However, it remains unclear why the valine-to-glutamate mutation is so much more common in cancer cells than any other mutation that could affect the pocket in BRAF.</p> <p>To address this question, Kiel et al. used a computational tool to generate three-dimensional models for all the different amino acid substitutions that could occur in BRAF’s pocket. Each mutation was then assessed to see how it might destabilize the structure of BRAF. Only the mutations that affected the 600th amino acid were predicted to be able to open the pocket without destabilizing the part of the enzyme that adds phosphate groups to other proteins.</p> <p>Kiel et al. validated their computational predictions by introducing normal or mutant versions of the BRAF-encoding gene into human cells grown in the laboratory. These experiments showed that a mutation that introduced an amino acid called histidine into position 600 could activate BRAF as much the valine-to-glutamate mutation. Kiel et al. suggest that this “valine-to-histidine” substitution is not found in cancers because it requires three changes to the DNA sequence of the BRAF gene, whereas the valine-to-glutamate substitution only requires one.</p> <p>The results underscore the importance of considering changes at both the DNA and protein level when attempting to understand why certain cancer-causing mutations are more common than others.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12814.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12814.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>structure-energy calculations</kwd><kwd>genotype-phenotype association</kwd><kwd>passenger and driver mutations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRIMES FP7-HEALTH-F4-2011-278568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serrano</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The V600E mutation in BRAF is a cancer hot spot because it opens the activation segment through destabilization of autoinhibitory interactions, but it does not significantly impair folding of the inactive or active kinase domain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In a time of personalized medicine and tumor sequencing, determining which missense mutations affect disease phenotype and exploring the role of cellular and environmental context are crucial. In many oncogenes, mutations are enriched at specific amino acid positions (‘mutation hotspots’), and it is not usually obvious if rare substitutions are passengers or disease-causing mutations. A striking example is the oncogenic serine/threonine kinase BRAF, for which the V600E mutation in its kinase activation segment (AS) accounts for &gt;95% of all BRAF cancer mutations. BRAF is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is an upstream regulator of cellular responses such as cell division and differentiation and is mediated by the MEK/ERK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garnett and Marais, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wellbrock et al., 2004</xref>). BRAF kinase is found mutated in both germline diseases (e.g. cardiofaciocutaneous and Noonan syndromes; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rauen, 2013</xref>) and somatic cancers of the thyroid, skin, colon, and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holderfield et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascierto et al., 2012</xref>). BRAF contains an N-terminal region with a Ras-binding domain, which is followed by a cysteine-rich motif and a C-terminal kinase domain. BRAF is autoinhibited in a closed conformation by the interaction of the N-terminal conserved region 2 (following the Ras-binding and cysteine-rich domains) with the kinase domain, mediated by the interaction of two phosphorylated residues, Ser365 and Ser729, with a 14-3-3 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brummer et al., 2006</xref>). Upon dephosphorylation of the N-terminal phosphorylated Ser365 by phosphatase PPII, the Ras-binding domain is free to interact with Ras at the plasma membrane. This releases autoinhibition and enables either homodimerization or heterodimerization with CRAF, ARAF, or KSR17; subsequent phosphorylation in the AS at Thr599 and Ser602 results in kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Taylor and Kornev, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hmitou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang and Guan, 2000</xref>; for a recent review on the topic see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavoie and Therrien, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Similar to other kinases, the BRAF kinase domain has two subdomains comprising a small N-terminal lobe and a large C-terminal lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scheeff and Bourne, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roskoski, 2010</xref>). The N-terminal lobe contains the nucleotide-binding pocket and the phosphate-binding loop, while the C-terminal lobe binds the protein substrates and contains the catalytic loop. The two lobes, which are spatially connected through the AS, can move relative to each other in order to open or close the cleft. AS residues undergo hydrophobic interactions with the phosphate-binding loop and the ‘αC helix’ of the N-terminal lobe (making the ‘hydrophobic pocket’), locking the kinase in its inactive state. In addition, the misalignment of spatially conserved hydrophobic residues in the N- and C terminal lobes (‘hydrophobic spines’) prevents catalytic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavoie and Therrien, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Phosphorylation within the AS causes structural rearrangements of the AS, the αC helix and the phosphate-binding loop, reorienting the catalytic Asp of the DFG motif in a catalysis-competent orientation, thereby causing BRAF to become active.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12814.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall structure of the kinase domain of BRAF, zoom into the hydrophobic pocket of BRAF, and active- and inactive-like BRAF kinase domain 3D structures used for structure-energy calculation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the BRAF kinase, with functional regions indicated.

The two lobes are spatially connected through the activation segment (AS) of the large lobe. Sequentially, the N- and C-terminal lobes are connected by the hinge, and the AS is part of the C-lobe that interacts with the N-lobe.

Mutations in the phosphate-binding loop (residues 464 to 472) correspond to &lt;1% of all BRAF mutations in cancer. The more important hotspot is found in the AS, with V600E being the most frequent BRAF somatic cancer mutation (98% in the COSMIC database) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cantwell-Dorris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sarkozy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holderfield et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavoie and Therrien, 2015</xref>). Less frequently found mutations at position Val600 are mutations to Asp, Lys, and Arg, which all require two nucleotide substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavoie and Therrien, 2015</xref>). In the inactive conformation, Val600 is buried in a hydrophobic pocket made by residues from the N-terminal subdomain (Ala497, Phe498, Leu525, Leu485, Phe468, and Val487) and the AS (Leu597, Ala598, and Trp604) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Substitution of this residue by charged amino acids (e.g. Glu) disrupts these interactions and results in constitutive kinase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wan et al., 2004</xref>). BRAF V600E does not require RAF dimerization or interaction with Ras to be active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Poulikakos et al., 2011</xref>) yet has an increased propensity to form dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Freeman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roring et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thevakumaran et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Whereas extensive research on BRAF in past years has provided enormous insight and understanding about the regulation of BRAF kinase and the abnormal activity of V600E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavoie and Therrien, 2015</xref>) no studies exist explaining why other amino acid substitutions in the hydrophobic pocket are not found with a high frequency in cancer. In principle, other mutations at the AS (such as Leu597 mutated into Glu), or in other parts of the hydrophobic pocket (e.g V487 into Glu or Leu525 into Glu), should also release the AS and cause constitutive kinase activation. Thus, to answer this question, we performed combined structure-energy, experimental and statistical analyses of mutations in the hydrophobic pocket. We show that V600E is the only single nucleotide substitution (Asp, Lys, and Arg, require two bases substitutions) that opens the AS through destabilization of autoinhibitory interactions, without significantly impairing the folding of the inactive or active kinase domain. We show that other mutations requiring three base substitutions (i.e. V600H) have kinase activities similar to V600E. We provide a quantitative measure for all parameters that contribute to BRAF cancer mutation frequencies by evaluating their importance using a random forest classifier. We anticipate that our results can be translated to other kinases and disease-causing proteins, provided that high-resolution X-ray structures are available.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A quantitative measure for the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket using structure-based energy calculations</title><p>Previous work on BRAF has shown that the V600E mutation is frequently found in cancer because it causes a disruption to the surrounding hydrophobic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wan et al., 2004</xref>).

First, mutations that destabilize the inactive conformation (△△G BRAF_inactive) will drive the protein into a complex with chaperones (i.e. HSP90; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grbovic et al., 2006</xref>) and/or aggregation/degradation, thereby decreasing its overall effective concentration. Second, mutations that destabilize the active conformation (△△G BRAF_active) will also result in the protein having a decreased effective concentration (unless they favor heterodimer formation and cause paradoxical activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heidorn et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Poulikakos et al., 2010</xref>)). Third, unfavorable energy changes in the AS loop of the inactive structures will favor its release and therefore kinase activation (△△G BRAF_inactive_loop). Structural inspection of 28 BRAF structures with different inhibitors showed that the AS loop between Leu597 and Gly615 is moderately to highly flexible (high B-factors) and consequently is unsolved in many structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Position Val600 is moderately flexible (70% solved in X-ray structures). This confirms previous predictions that the AS loop belongs to a region within the kinase domain (intra domain region) that has a large tendency to be disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). Also, previous enhanced-sampling structure-based computational simulations proposed that the AS exhibited a significant tendency to switch from the ordered to unstructured conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marino et al., 2015</xref>). Mutations in regions of high flexibility will have less impact on the unfolding of BRAF compared to those in conformational restricted regions. Thus, for the inactive state, we corrected the folding energies of the mutations in the AS loop (△△G BRAF_inactive) by the frequency for which the corresponding position is solved in the 28 crystal structures. This correction was not applied to the active-like structures because for these three active structures residues were solved only until position 600. The only available structure for which the loop had been solved (4MNE), had a high B-factor from position 601 onwards, but as there was no significant destabilization seen by FoldX, no correction was applied. After applying all these factors, we found several mutations that release the AS (FoldX energies above the threshold of 0.8 kcal/mol) and therefore could activate the kinase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12814.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>AS loop residues in 28 BRAF kinase structures and comparison with B-factors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Percentage of the 28 BRAF X-ray structures that have a given AS residue solved.

After correcting for differences in BRAF expression levels, we found that BRAF V600E phosphorylated MEK at higher levels than wild-type BRAF, and as predicted by FoldX, at similar levels to the double-nucleotide substitutions of V600D and V600K. In contrast, BRAF V600M and V600A yielded wild-type levels of MEK phosphorylation, suggesting that these are in fact passenger mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The remaining mutations gave intermediate MEK phosphorylation levels. Indeed, the V600G mutation, which is also found in the germline and causes CFC syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Champion et al., 2011</xref>) is an intermediate MEK activity mutant.</p><p>The fact that we found V600K and V600D mutants to be as active as the V600E mutant supports the hypothesis previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies et al., 2002</xref>) that the lower frequency of these mutants in cancer must be is due to the fact that two base substitutions are needed for changing Val600 into Lys or Asp, whereas only one is needed for V600E. We confirmed this further by identifying mutations that were not found in cancer (at positions 597 and 600 in the AS), that required three base changes, and that were predicted to be as activating as the most frequent cancer mutation found at these positions. Expression of these mutants (L597Y and V600H) in cells resulted in medium and high kinase activity as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Replacement of V600 by bulkier hydrophobic residues (e.g. Met, Leu, Trp) resulted in weak (V600W) or no kinase activation.

This supports our hypothesis that structural movements in the flexible AS could partially accommodate bulkier hydrophobic residues in the inactive orientation. Thus, we included the chemical nature/hydrophobicity as another factor.

We next wanted to analyze why no other mutation in the hydrophobic pocket - in a different position to Val600 - is found frequently mutated in cancer. Based on FoldX structure-energy calculations, we predicted that mutations in the hydrophobic pocket that destabilize the pocket and may thereby release the AS, would also affect the folding of the inactive and/or active kinase, thereby reducing the effective concentration and thus resulting in lower MEK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We experimentally tested three mutations (V487E, L525E and F498S) that required one, or two (L525E) base changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). F498S is predicted to be the most destabilizing, followed by L525E and V487E. By analyzing the soluble and insoluble fractions from transiently transfected HEK293 cells, we determined that the ratios between soluble and insoluble BRAF were similar for wild-type and the V600E and V600W mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), while the V487E and L252E mutants resulted in significantly more insoluble protein.

Finally, although in the V600E structure (PDB entry 4MNF) Glu600 forms a salt bridge with Lys507 in the αC helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haling et al., 2014</xref>), both residues are solvent exposed, and the Lys side chain is not structurally constrained. Therefore, the possible salt-bridge energy contribution is negligible (FoldX energy calculations suggest no energetic contribution between Glu600 and Lys507 (△△G (E600A) = 0.04+/- 0.1 kcal/mol). This explains why mutations to Lys or Arg are as activating as Glu and Asp.</p><p>As V600E or V600K does not stabilize the active conformation, we tested whether it still requires phosphorylation at Thr599 and Ser602 to keep the AS in a fixed active state (by interacting with Arg575) by mutating these residues to alanines (to disable phosphorylation). In normal growth medium, we observed either no change (V600E) or a slight reduction (V600K) in MEK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests that by opening the AS and preventing its closure, the kinase becomes active, independent of phosphorylation. These results were additionally supported by mutating Glu611 to Ala in the context of V600E. As Glu611 forms a salt bridge with Arg575, this interaction may partially stabilize the open conformation. However, as MEK phosphorylation did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6B–C</xref>), it is more likely that this salt bridge contributes little or nothing to stabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Dissecting the contribution of individual parameters to the prediction of cancer frequencies</title><p>We used random forest predictions to analyze the quantitative contribution of individual factors to the prediction of cancer frequencies. In addition to the six parameters described above, we also included as a parameter the change in codon usage frequency due to a mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). If a frequent codon is mutated to a rare one, this could affect translation efficiency and protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lampson et al., 2013</xref>). To see if a combination of the factors discussed above can be used to predict the observed mutation frequency in cancer, we constructed a random forest classifier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). This ensemble learning technique identifies the contributions of individual ‘trees’ (here, FoldX energies, nucleotide substitutions, and codon frequencies) to an output (here, cancer frequencies). As values not given in the training set cannot be extrapolated by the random forest method, we ran two sets of 100 predictions. For each prediction, we trained with a random subset of samples, using ∼70% of the data and balancing mutations with low and high cancer frequencies. The V600E mutation was included in only one set, and the importance values for all seven parameters for all sets were kept. Next, we ran the trained random forest on the remaining ∼30% of the data and calculated the root mean square deviation (RMSD) as well as the correlation between the real data and the predicted values. The ratio of this correlation to the RMSD was us as a performance indicator for each run. The importance values of the seven different parameters were similar between sets, suggesting that the presence or absence of V600E did not affect the training outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The AS loop energy was the highest contributor to the random forest prediction of cancer frequencies (parameter 3; ∼70% ), while parameters 2 (folding energy active conformation), 4 (nucleotide substitution frequency), 5 (change in codon usage frequency), and 7 (hydrophobic solvation energy) contributed almost equally, and 1 and 6 (destabilization of inactive conformation and the salt bridge) had very little contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Ensemble methods, such as random forests, have several advantages compared to non-ensemble machine-learning methods, such as better handling of small sample sizes and high dimensionality, increased robustness and limited overfitting. The contributions of the different features calculated in this study are quite robust, and in the two cases analyzed (with and without V600E in the training set), they were found to be comparable and to follow the same order.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12814.020</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Quantitative contribution of individual factors to the prediction of cancer frequencies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of real and predicted cancer frequencies (labelled ‘real value’ and ‘predicted value’) for one exemplary random forest prediction (run 16).

By using structure-energy calculations and a number of nucleotide substitutions, we were able to reconcile why V600E is by far the most frequent cancer mutation. We show here, that the effect of a mutation on folding depends on the structural flexibility of the respective hydrophobic pocket where the mutated amino acid is located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, left side). Position Val600 is in a region where the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket causes activation of the kinase as structural flexibility still allows for proper folding. In contrast, those mutations in structurally rigid areas of the hydrophobic pocket only slightly increase the catalytic activity while increasing destabilization, and thus rapidly cause unfolding of BRAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, right side).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12814.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram depicting the relationship between structural flexibility, destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket, and cancer frequencies.</title><p>The effect of a mutation on folding depends on the structural flexibility of the respective hydrophobic pocket where the mutated amino acid is located.

Our results underscore the importance of considering the number of base substitutions required for a given mutation in genome-wide association studies. Rare mutations can be passengers or drivers, depending on the number of base substitutions needed. Additionally, individuals with silent mutations at critical hotspot positions may acquire rare disease mutations infrequently found in cancer. Finally, mutations that both activate and slightly destabilize a protein may be rescued by random fluctuations in the chaperone levels present in a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lehner, 2013</xref>). Consideration of these factors in combination with protein design algorithms may also offer mechanistic explanations of why certain mutations are found at higher frequencies in other oncogenic proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mutation databases</title><p>Somatic BRAF mutations were downloaded from COSMIC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/</ext-link>).

Two sets of 100 random forests each were constructed. In one set, the V600E mutant was always included in the training set of the classifiers, while in the other it was not. Random forests used ∼70% of the samples for the training, with the remaining ∼30% was used for performance testing. All random forests were trained with the same parameters. The number of trees was set to 40, as a further increase did not improve the performance of the predictor. The number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split of the trees was set to four. To assess the significance of each of the features used in the random forest and how they contribute to the prediction outcome, we determined the importance of each of them. This value is computed by calculating the total decrease in node impurities when splitting on a certain variable. This means that every time a specific variable is used for a split in any of the trees in the forest, the decrease in the impurity of the child nodes, respect to the parent node, is calculated. In regression random forests, this is done by calculating the residual sum of squares, comparing the predicted value of the forest with the real value, for each of the samples in the training. It is expected that the residual sum of squares decreases at each split, thus improving the tree. The larger the decrease, the better the split, and thus the variable used is considered more important. For each variable, the decrease in the node impurity is calculated every time it is used for a split in any of the trees, and the values are added to determine the importance of this variable. The features that contribute most to the random forest prediction will have larger importance values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cloning of wild-type and mutant BRAF</title><p>BRAF complementary DNA was cloned into pDEST/N-SF-TAP v1 with N-terminal Strep and Flag tags (provided by Dr. Gloeckner and Dr. Ueffing, HelmHoltz Zentrum Muenchen; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gloeckner et al.

For each seeding-transfection-(stimulation)-lysis experiment, HEK293 cells were seeded on 35-mm dishes and transfected after 24 hr (at 80% confluence) with 1 μg of BRAF plasmid, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 hr, cells were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 25 mM Tris [pH 7.8], 1:1000 protease inhibitor cocktail 1 and 2 [Sigma]). For EGF stimulation experiments, cells were transfected (in serum-free medium) and then, after 1 day, stimulated with 50 ng of EGF or HRG, in 3 ml, for the indicated times, washed with PBS and lysed as above. To fractionate cells into soluble and insoluble fractions, cells were first lysed in hypertonic lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1:1000 protease inhibitor cocktails 1 and 2 [Sigma]), sonicated for 5 min, and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm, after which the supernatant was removed (‘soluble fraction’). The pellet was resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (‘insoluble fraction’). Cell lysates were loaded for Western blot analysis. Blots were incubated with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (SuperSignal West Femto, Thermo 34096) and visualized with a LAS-3000 imager (Fujifilm Co.). Two to three biological sample replicates were generated in each seeding-transfection-lysis experiment and analyzed on the identical Western blot (‘biological replicates performed at the same day’). Up to eight different seeding-transfection-lysis experiments were performed (‘biological replicates performed at different days’). The intensity of protein bands for MEK-p and flag (for total BRAF levels) was quantified with ImageJ. MEK-p levels were normalized by total BRAF levels (using the flag antibody). To compare biological replicates performed at different days MEK-p/BRAF total intensities were referenced to WT (=100%). While the relative intensity changes between WT and mutants always followed the same trend in all biological replicates performed at different days, the quantitative intensity spread could vary (e.g. for V600E between 180% to 400% compared to WT). To compare intensities from Western blots from different days, we averaged experiments that had a similar intensity spread. The following antibodies were used for Western blotting: Flag (Sigma, F1804), phospho-BRAF Ser445 (Cell Signaling, #2330), phospho-MEK Ser217 and Ser221 (Cell Signaling, #9121), β-actin (Thermo, MA5-15739), and total BRAF (SIGMA, HPA001328).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Walter Kolch and Edgardo Ferran for valuable discussions and Tony Ferrar for critical manuscript revision and language editing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://theeditorsite.com">http://theeditorsite.com</ext-link>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor (Yibing Shan), and two peer reviewers.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>The manuscript attempts to explain why certain BRAF mutations, V600E in particular, occur in cancer cells at much higher frequency than others. Through energetic analyses of the effects of mutations on the overall fold stability of BRAF kinase and the mutations' impact to the catalytically active conformation using FoldX, an empirical structure-based energetic function, the authors showed that the high occurrence of V600E is rooted in the unique combination of promoting the catalytically active kinase conformation and maintaining the overall fold stability of the kinase domain by this mutation. It is further shown that the high occurrence of V600E is in part attributed to the fact that the mutation involves only a single nucleotide change in the codon, as V600D and V600K mutations, which are shown to be similar to V600E in terms of energetics and kinase activity, are much rarer for their requirement of two nucleotide in the codon. This work underscores the balance between functional alteration and impact to the overall fold stability of the protein behind a high-occurrence driver oncogenic mutation.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>Overall, the reviewers found this work interesting and saw the relevance of this work to cancer biology and potentially, to drug discovery. The reviewers, however, raised a number of concerns and made a number of suggestions to help strengthen this work. In particular, our reviewers raised important questions concerning the quantification of the Western Blot results. In terms of language and details of the figures, the manuscript is somewhat under-polished and not close to a near publishable condition. Some substantial effort on that front will make the manuscript more acceptable to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) How are MEK-p levels normalized? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the ratio of MEKp for WT BRAF is around 1 (bar graph) but the western blot images seem to show much weaker bands for MEKp than for BRAFtotal. Given the quantitative nature of the study, it is important to be convincing in the quantification of Western Blots results.</p> <p>2) Another main concern has to do with the lack of details of the FoldX analyses. It is not clear exactly what energies are calculated and how they are calculated. For example, more explanation is needed for the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>. A basic description of FoldX should be included in the main text that is accessible to a non-computational scientist. In the last sentence of the subsection “A quantitative measure for the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket using structure-based energy calculations”: What is special about the threshold FoldX energy of 0.8 kcal/mol? Please explain how the threshold is set. Why is only the average free energy of the inactive state corrected for flexibility and not the active state in table 1? Some additional details of the correction are necessary.</p> <p>3) The energies at the activation segment loop were corrected to take into account its high flexibility and assuming that &quot;mutations at protein regions of high flexibility will have less impact.…&quot;. The exact details of the correction and their effect on the energy differences are not clear and this statement needs to be explained in greater details. This is particularly so in the light of the recent paper by Lu et al., Anatomy of protein disorder, flexibility and disease-related mutations, Front Mol Biosci 2015, 2, 47, which discussed the link between the disorder of the loop and the V600E mutation in BRAF.</p> <p>4) In the subsection “Experimental analysis of mutations in the hydrophobic pocket predicted to disturb protein folding”, first paragraph: Where is the correlation plot between ΔΔG and the soluble:insoluble ratio that is mentioned? This figure seems to be absent.</p> <p>5) The discussion in the second paragraph of the Introduction implies that only the open cleft state allows key kinase catalytic residues to change conformations. Inactive and active kinase states are not necessarily correlated with open and closed states. The catalytic residues can be in active or inactive conformations in both open and closed states. Furthermore, it should be made clear that activation requires specific conformational changes involving the catalytic residues.</p></body> </sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12814.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p> <p> <italic>1) How are MEK-p levels normalized?

To be able to compare technical and biological replicates performed on different days we then referenced all intensities to the WT (=100%). We added a section to the Methods explaining the analysis and the number of replicates in detail.</p> <p>We now explain in the figure legend how many biological replicates and technical replicates were used. For the Western blots to be even more convincing, we also show additional Western blots with biological and technical replicates in the new figure supplements: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>.</p> <p><italic>2) Another main concern has to do with the lack of details of the FoldX analyses. It is not clear exactly what energies are calculated and how they are calculated. For example, more explanation is needed for the data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> <italic>or</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref><italic>. A basic description of FoldX should be included in the main text that is accessible to a non-computational scientist. In the last sentence of the subsection “A quantitative measure for the destabilization of the hydrophobic pocket using structure-based energy calculations”: What is special about the threshold FoldX energy of 0.8 kcal/mol? Please explain how the threshold is set. Why is only the average free energy of the inactive state corrected for flexibility and not the active state in</italic> table 1<italic>? Some additional details of the correction are necessary.</italic> </p> <p>We now explain FoldX better in the main text (results) with the help of an additional supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We explain the basic molecular forces that contribute to protein folding and that these energies are integrated in the FoldX force field. We then explain how the sidechain modelling of FoldX is used to generate mutant structures and recalculate the energies using the FoldX force field (to result in DDG BRAF Mut-WT). Next, we explain the whole pipeline in terms of modelling mutants of BRAF in the hydrophobic pocket. Finally, we explain how to interpret the data when folding is affected or, alternatively, if the flexible loop is affected, how this will impact the loss of autoinhibitory interactions, but not affect the overall folding.</p> <p>The threshold of 0.8 kcal/mol represents twice the standard deviation performed using energy calculations with the FoldX force field. We apologize for the lack of explanation and we added this information to the main text.</p> <p>Three active structures are available. In all these, the residues are solved until residue 600, and therefore no correction should be applied. When we analysed the B-factor of the structure with the AS loop solved (4MNE), we found that B-factors are small until positionVal600, and then high for the remaining positions in the loop. However, as there was no significant destabilization predicted by FoldX for mutations in that loop using the active-like 4MNE, we didn’t apply a correction.</p> <p>We added the following sentence to the main text: “This correction was not applied to the active-like structures because for these three active structures residues were solved only until position 600. The only available structure for which the loop had been solved (4MNE), had a high B-factor from position 601 onwards, but as there was no significant destabilization seen by FoldX, no correction was applied.”</p> <p><italic>3) The energies at the activation segment loop were corrected to take into account its high flexibility and assuming that &quot;mutations at protein regions of high flexibility will have less impact.</italic>…</p> <p><italic>&quot;. The exact details of the correction and their effect on the energy differences are not clear and this statement needs to be explained in greater details. This is particularly so in the light of the recent paper by Lu et al., Anatomy of protein disorder, flexibility and disease-related mutations, Front Mol Biosci 2015, 2, 47, which discussed the link between the disorder of the loop and the V600E mutation in BRAF.</italic> </p> <p>We apologize for not having explained this better. There are three types of energies: (i) mutations that destabilize the inactive conformation (using predictions from inactive structures) and affect folding (DDG BRAF_inactive), (ii) mutations that destabilize the active conformation (using predictions from active structures) and affect folding (DDG BRAF_active), and (iii) mutations in the AS loop of inactive structures that will favour its release and cause kinase activation (DDG BRAF_inactive_loop). The folding energies of the inactive structures (DDG BRAF_inactive) have been corrected at regions of high flexibility (such as the AS loop). These mutations will have less impact on unfolding BRAF as structural flexibility still allows proper folding. We now mention in this respect the Lu et al. and Marino et al. papers. “Position Val600 is moderately flexible (70% solved in X-ray structures). This confirms previous predictions that the AS loop belongs to a region within the kinase domain (intra domain region) that has a large tendency to be disordered (Lu et al., 2015). Also, previous enhanced-sampling structure-based computational simulations proposed that the AS exhibited a significant tendency to switch from the ordered to unstructured conformation (Marino et al., 2015).”</p> <p><italic>4) In the subsection “Experimental analysis of mutations in the hydrophobic pocket predicted to disturb protein folding”, first paragraph: Where is the correlation plot between ΔΔG and the soluble:insoluble ratio that is mentioned? This figure seems to be absent.</italic> </p> <p>We apologize for this. We have now added this plot for comparing the values in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p> <p> <italic>5) The discussion in the second paragraph of the Introduction implies that only the open cleft state allows key kinase catalytic residues to change conformations. Inactive and active kinase states are not necessarily correlated with open and closed states. The catalytic residues can be in active or inactive conformations in both open and closed states. Furthermore, it should be made clear that activation requires specific conformational changes involving the catalytic residues.</italic></p> <p>We have deleted the second part of the sentence (‘whereby the open form allows catalytic residues to move into the active site (DFG motif and catalytic loop’): “The two lobes, which are spatially connected through the AS, can move relative to each other to open or close the cleft.” We added ‘catalytic’ in front of the Asp: ‘Phosphorylation in the AS causes structural rearrangements of the AS, the aC helix and the phosphate-binding loop, which reorients the <italic>catalytic</italic> Asp of the DFG motif in a catalysis-competent orientation causing BRAF to be active’.</p></body> </sub-article></article>
