To test whether in vitro conditions represent an intrinsic differentiation pace, human iPSC-derived neural rosettes were challenged by grafting into the faster differentiating chicken embryonic neural tube iso-chronically, or hetero-chronically into older embryos. In both contexts in vitro differentiation pace was initially unchanged, while long-term analysis revealed iso-chronic slowed and hetero-chronic conditions promoted human neural differentiation. Moreover, hetero-chronic conditions did not alter the human neural differentiation programme, which progressed to neurogenesis, while the host embryo advanced into gliogenesis. This study demonstrates that intrinsic properties limit human differentiation pace, and that timely extrinsic signals are required for progression through an intrinsic human neural differentiation programme.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd><kwd>cs12-cs18</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT102817AIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storey</surname><given-names>Kate G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT102817/Z/13/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storey</surname><given-names>Kate G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT101468</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Storey</surname><given-names>Kate G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Comparison of human spinal cord rosette differentiation in vitro and following transplantation into heterologous embryonic environments, reveals cell-intrinsic constraint on human differentiation pace and the importance of timely extrinsic signalling for progression through an intrinsic human neural differentiation programme.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding human embryonic development is a major challenge in contemporary biology and is in large part investigated by creation of pluripotent cell derived in vitro models of developing tissues and organs. One of the most striking features of such in vitro assays is the remarkably faithful recapitulation of specific differentiation programmes in minimal culture conditions. For example, species specific patterns of cell proliferation and timing of neuronal sub-type differentiation are evident in human and macaque cortical progenitors, even when these cells are cultured together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Otani et al., 2016</xref>), strongly supporting the notion that cell autonomous mechanisms direct differentiation programmes. Recent analyses of potential mechanisms that account for human specific differentiation tempo have identified general protein stability and cell cycle duration as parameters that constrain this process in spinal cord progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, a human specific gene, <italic>ARHGAP11B</italic>, has recently been shown to promote the enhanced proliferative capacity of human basal cortical progenitors by augmenting a specific metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Namba et al., 2020</xref>); and so uncovering a genetic basis for such cell autonomous cell behaviour. Such findings indicate that cell intrinsic mechanisms underpin differentiation programme progression and suggest that this process can proceed from the neural progenitor cell state with minimal extrinsic signals. Evaluation of the extent to which human neural progenitors differentiate cell autonomously requires a detailed understanding of the differentiation timing of specific cell types during normal human embryogenesis and how well this is recapitulated in vitro. Indeed, comparison of the timing of the appearance of specific cell types in the human embryo with in vitro data may also help to inform better modelling approaches, which largely rely on morphological changes to align differentiation tempo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Workman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Otani et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In other vertebrate embryos, the extracellular environment, including spatially and temporally regulated signals provided by neighbouring tissues, is known to orchestrate neural differentiation and such signalling is likely to direct this process in human embryos. In vitro models, from rosettes to more complex three-dimensional organoids and gastruloids, aim to recreate this by provision of supportive extracellular environments and timely exposure to ligands or small molecules that modulate signalling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Otani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ogura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiaradia and Lancaster, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moris et al., 2020</xref>). A critical test of the extent to which neural progenitor differentiation is governed by cell autonomous mechanisms is their behaviour in a heterologous environment. However, studies examining differentiation pace and accuracy in such contexts are lacking. This is obviously important when considering use of such neural progenitors in cell replacement strategies following injury or disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sofroniew, 2018</xref>) or for local delivery of secreted factors for therapeutic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), as these approaches involve transplantation into heterologous environments and yet anticipate differentiation into specific cell types (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kumamaru et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kumamaru et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A relatively simple region of the developing nervous system in which to evaluate the extent to which human neural progenitors differentiate cell autonomously, is the developing spinal cord. In vitro generation of spinal cord progenitors from mammalian pluripotent cells has been achieved by approaches in which anterior neural tissue is induced and then caudalised (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meinhardt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>). Recent advances in understanding the cellular origins of the spinal cord have further shown that it arises from a bipotent epiblast cell population adjacent to the anterior primitive streak known as neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tzouanacou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gouti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gouti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henrique et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gouti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Steventon and Martinez Arias, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binagui-Casas et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, in vitro generation of spinal cord progenitors from NMPs may align better with the temporal sequence of cell fate decisions in the embryo. Derivation of NMP-like cells from pluripotent cells has been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Turner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gouti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frith et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Verrier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frith and Tsakiridis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Edri et al., 2019</xref>) and this has catalysed investigation of mechanisms regulating human as well as mouse spinal cord development.</p><p>Here, we present a novel human pluripotent cell-derived in vitro neural rosette assay that recapitulates dorsal spinal cord differentiation observed in vertebrate embryos and use this to evaluate the extent to which cell intrinsic properties direct differentiation of human neural progenitors. Using key cell type-specific marker proteins, we compare in detail in vitro neural differentiation with that in the human embryonic spinal cord. In a series of grafting experiments, in which human iPSC derived spinal cord progenitors are transplanted into the chicken embryonic neural tube, we further test whether differentiation pace can be increased in this faster differentiating environment, as well as the extent to which the differentiation trajectory of transplanted cells relies on timely provision of extrinsic signalling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro generation of human dorsal spinal cord rosettes</title><p>An in vitro protocol which generates dorsal spinal cord from human pluripotent cell-derived NMP-like cells with brachial/ thoracic character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Verrier et al., 2018</xref>) was used to make neural rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The first neurons have now appeared in the dorsal half of the neural tube as indicated by TUJ1 expression, but neuronal subtype markers LHX2, LHX1, dorsal ISLET-1 have yet to be detected, with co-expression of ISLET1 and HB9 identifying ventrally located motor-neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arber et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This combination of marker proteins indicates that the lumbar region broadly corresponds to D8 neural rosettes in which the first neurons have formed, as indicated by DCX and P27 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>); detection of HNK1 in the lumbar region supports this alignment, as this is not found in D6 rosettes and is robustly expressed by D10. The identity of these first dorsal neurons is not yet clear, we detect LHX2 expressing cells in D8 rosettes, but neither LHX1 nor ISLET-1 positive cells were found at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the alteration in transcription factor combinatorial code created by the expansion of the OLIG2 domain in human spinal cord progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marklund et al., 2014</xref>), one possibility is that human-specific neuronal cell types arise in this region.</p><p>Importantly, dorsal interneuron markers LHX2 (dI1) and ISLET1/HB9 (dI3) were also not detected at thoracic levels (which included sections from presumptive forelimb level, brachial spinal cord), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>). This is consistent with the lack of dorsal ISLET1 expression at CS13 at brachial levels in a recent report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>), although a few dorsal ISLET1 positive cells were found in brachial spinal cord of another CS13 embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and T. Rayon pers comm.). This suggests that these interneurons are just beginning to be generated at CS13 at thoracic/ brachial levels and is consistent with detection of LHX2 expressing neurons in CS14 spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marklund et al., 2014</xref>) and (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rayon et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, LHX2 positive cells were first detected in D8 rosettes and both LHX2 and ISLET1 positive cells were found in all D10 neural rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). This earlier detection of dorsal neurons in rosettes suggests that the differentiation programme progresses more rapidly in vitro than in the human embryonic spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><p>A further way to assess differentiation tempo is to align progression of a defined cell population in vitro and in vivo using time elapsed from a key landmark event. The NMP-like cells generated in our protocol have a brachial/thoracic regional character as indicated by Hox gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Verrier et al., 2018</xref>) and differentiation of this region can be compared in vitro and in embryos over time. Detailed analysis of the first appearance of spinal cord neural crest in the human embryo provides a clear landmark with which to align in vivo and in vitro differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bondurand et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O’Rahilly and Müller, 2007</xref>). These latter studies identify morphological emergence of migrating neural crest in cervical level spinal cord in the CS11 human embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O’Rahilly and Müller, 2007</xref>) and in even more caudal spinal cord at this stage using <italic>SOX10</italic> mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bondurand et al., 1998</xref>). From this we infer that pre-migratory neural crest is present prior to CS11 in brachial/thoracic spinal cord, and so aligns this region in CS10-11 embryos with D6 in our neural rosettes, which express SNAI2 but lack migratory neural crest marker proteins SOX10, HNK1, and TFAP2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Using this alignment point we then compared time to appearance of later cell type specific markers in neural rosettes and human embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). As above, dorsally located ISLET1/dI3s first appear ~CS13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and are robustly detected at CS15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rayon et al., 2021</xref>; and see HDBR Atlas <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hdbratlas.org">http://hdbratlas.org</ext-link>), and here this indicates that these neurons appear ~4 days earlier in D10 rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3I</xref>). The landmark switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis indicated by NFIA expression in dorsal neural progenitors was detected in human embryos at CS18 (gestational weeks 7–7.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H’</xref>) but not at CS17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>). This is ~1 week later than in neural rosettes, where NFIA was robustly found at D20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3I</xref>). Moreover, the overall time from spinal cord migratory neural crest appearance to dorsal gliogenesis takes ~2 weeks (D6 –D20) in human dorsal spinal cord rosettes in vitro and ~3–3.5 weeks (CS10/11-CS17/18) in the human embryonic spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). These further comparisons also suggest that differentiation of neural rosettes in vitro proceeds more quickly than equivalent neural progenitor cells in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>In vitro differentiation pace of human neural progenitors is initially unaltered by iso-chronic grafting into the more rapidly developing chicken embryonic environment</title><p>In the vertebrate embryo, the timing of neural differentiation is orchestrated by signals from adjacent tissues, which drive and coordinate axial differentiation but the localised and temporally controlled characteristics of this regulatory influence are lacking in vitro. Indeed, in the embryo, neural progenitors will generate more cells to make a bigger structure and so proliferative phases that expand cell populations might be longer. We have found that the smaller rosette structures generated in vitro differentiate more rapidly and this raises the possibility that differentiation pace in this minimal assay reflects species-specific intrinsic constraints on this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>).

To control for any disturbance in the timing of differentiation due to transplantation procedures we monitored expression of key marker proteins following transplantation of dorsal neural tube from transgenic myr-GFP-expressing chicken embryos at the same stage and into the same position in wildtype chicken embryos.

Similar observations were also made in embryos in which the hemi-dorsal neural tube was removed but no rosette was transplanted prior to incubation and these embryos were processed as controls alongside grafted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–G</xref>).

We therefore analysed separately human rosette cells which were within a rosette formation abutting/continuous with the chicken neural tube (contiguous rosette, CR), a cell group directly incorporated into the chick neuroepithelium (incorporated cell group, ICG), or single cells incorporated within the chicken neuroepithelium (incorporated single cells, ISC) to determine if these different relationships with the chicken host cells influenced differentiation speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’</xref>). However, no differences in differentiation were found between these three cell configurations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). To address the further possibility that small groups or individual human cells may have moved from a rosette into the chicken neuroepithelium at a late time point and so only briefly experienced fuller integration into this host neuroepithelium, these experiments were repeated by initial grafting of small cell groups from dissociated rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s4sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 4—source data 1</xref>). This approach further demonstrated that human cells in small groups and single human cells integrated into the chicken neuroepithelium do not differentiate more rapidly than in in vitro conditions. These findings suggest that a community effect does not underpin the timing of human cell differentiation following transplantation into the chicken neural tube.</p><p>Analysis of neural crest differentiation in transplanted rosettes after 2 days further confirmed the asynchrony between human and host chicken cell differentiation.

Overall, these data show that transplanted human cells can respond to signals provided by this more differentiated chicken host environment and indicate that the onset of human neurogenesis can be advanced if neural progenitors are exposed to an older differentiating environment over a period longer than 2 days.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study presents a novel in vitro human neural rosette assay that recapitulates the temporal sequence of dorsal spinal cord differentiation observed in vertebrate embryos. The more rapid progression of this differentiation programme in vitro than in the human embryo suggests that it represents the intrinsic differentiation pace of this cell population, while lacking signalling dynamics that influence the normal duration of steps in spinal cord differentiation. The initial retention of in vitro differentiation pace in human rosettes transplanted into the faster differentiating chicken embryonic spinal cord, either iso-chronically or hetero-chronically, further supports the notion that this reflects species-specific cell intrinsic timing. Importantly, long-term analysis of transplanted rosettes revealed that the iso-chronic environment was insufficient to sustain the human neural differentiation programme, while the more developmentally advanced hetero-chronic environment accelerated neurogenesis. These findings show that after a delay, which likely reflects previously reported slower protein turnover and cell cycle of human neural progenitors, differentiation of human cells can be influenced by the chicken embryonic environment. Moreover, hetero-chronic grafting into a more differentiated neural tube while increasing neuron production in comparison with neural rosettes in vitro, did not alter the programme of human neural differentiation, which progressed to a neurogenic phase, while the host embryo advanced into gliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). These experiments provide evidence for cell intrinsic constraint on human differentiation pace and highlight the importance of timely extrinsic signalling for progression through an intrinsic human neural differentiation programme.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary comparison of dorsal spinal cord differentiation in rosettes in vitro and following iso-chronic or hetero-chronic grafting and in the developing chicken embryo.</title><p>The timing of differentiation from a dorsal spinal cord neural rosette composed of SOX2/ PAX7 neural progenitors and pre-migratory neural crest cells expressing SNAI2, into neurons (expressing P27 or ISLET1) and migratory neural crest cells (expressing HNK1, TFAP2a and SOX10) and subsequent gliogenesis in these distinct conditions is indicated (D is day of rosette differentiation from NMP-Like cells in vitro, days from transplantation of D6 rosettes is shown for transplantation experiments, and E is for Embryonic day of development in the chicken embryo).

We demonstrated that such structures reproducibly differentiate in a specific temporal sequence which follows that observed in the embryonic dorsal spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), with neural crest differentiating first, then dorsal-interneurons (dI1/3/5 s) and finally glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duband et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deneen et al., 2006</xref>). One peculiarity in this assay, the lack of dI2/4 s interneurons, may be explained by a requirement for more nuanced exposure to BMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duval et al., 2019</xref>), which, although endogenously expressed in this assay, are not exogenously provided in this protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Verrier et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence indicate that the in vitro human dorsal spinal cord rosettes exhibit an intrinsic differentiation pace. First, the timing of neural progenitor differentiation was found to be more rapid in vitro than in the human embryo. This was indicated by the earlier appearance of ISLET1+/HB9- expressing neurons and of NFIA expressing gliogenic progenitors in neural rosettes than in the human embryonic dorsal spinal cord; indeed, the period from migratory neural crest emergence to gliogenesis onset was ~1.5 weeks earlier in vitro than in the human embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Although it is possible that variation between human embryos contributes to this discrepancy, this may reflect longer time spent in expansive neural progenitor phases in the embryo, where this leads to generation of a much larger structure than a rosette. This raises the interesting possibility that overall differentiation pace, beyond that governed by cell intrinsic factors, might be influenced by and scale with the size of a self-organising cell group.</p><p>Secondly, iso-chronic or hetero-chronic transplantation of human neural rosettes into the chicken neural tube did not, in the first 2 days, advance the timing of human neural differentiation (even in individual human cells incorporated within the chicken neuroepithelium). Moreover, by 5 days iso-chronic conditions proved insufficient to sustain human neural differentiation, while more developmentally advanced hetero-chronic conditions now promoted human neural differentiation. As a slow response takes place regardless of the extrinsic cues provided these findings suggest that the ability of transplanted human cells to respond to the chicken environment is constrained by species-specific cell intrinsic properties. Such constraint is consistent with the finding that human ventral neural progenitors have a longer cell cycle and differentiate more slowly than equivalent mouse cells cultured in similar conditions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>). This has been shown to reflect species-specific differences in general protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>), may be indicative of slower human biochemical reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsuda et al., 2020</xref>) and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2021</xref>), and explain the delayed response of human cells to signals provided by the chicken environment. Indeed, transcriptional onset of some differentiation genes may require exposure to appropriate signals in a specific cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pauklin et al., 2016</xref>) and involve defined changes in replication timing at the early G1 timing decision point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dimitrova and Gilbert, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hiratani et al., 2008</xref>). Perhaps related to this is the finding that while human and mouse neural progenitor cells similarly transduce exogenously provided signalling molecule sonic hedgehog, human cells are slower to transcribe some key downstream ventral patterning genes <italic>OLIG2</italic> and <italic>NKX6.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>). This may indicate that initiation of transcription of such genes requires transit through the cell cycle and that this contributes to the slower human neural differentiation pace.</p><p>In vertebrate embryos, the timing of specific phases of neural differentiation is orchestrated by signals from adjacent tissues, which drive and coordinate axial differentiation. This includes: adjacent somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">del Corral et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diez del Corral et al., 2003</xref>), underlying notochord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Placzek et al., 1990</xref>), and overlying ectoderm/roof plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liem et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). Clearly, the localised and temporally controlled characteristics of such regulatory influences are lacking in in vitro assays. The importance of timely exposure to extrinsic cues is underscored by the distinct responses observed following iso-chronic and hetero-chronic transplantation into the chicken embryonic environment. The expression of neural progenitor proteins SOX2 and PAX7 in almost all iso-chronically transplanted human rosette cells after 5 days along with proliferation marker Ki67 and the lack of apoptosis, supports the notion that that these cells are not exposed to sufficiently high levels of differentiation factors. In contrast, in the hetero-chronic condition host neurogenesis is well established and the significant increase in neuronal differentiation in these rosettes by 5 days may therefore reflect longer exposure to higher levels of neuronal differentiation factors. While minimal RA is provided in vitro, the RA synthesising enzyme <italic>Raldh2</italic> is expressed within the chicken neural tube including by the roof plate as well as the meninges enclosing the spinal cord at the time of hetero-chronic grafting E3 (HH19/20) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berggren et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>It is notable that the increased neuron production in heterochronic conditions follows the sequence of the human neural differentiation programme even when the host chicken embryo has progressed further and has been gliogenic for days 3–5 (from E5 to E8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deneen et al., 2006</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This indicates that the host environment is sufficient to support human neural differentiation progression and that this does not involve obviating the neurogenic phase. This is consistent with a related study in which mouse Olig2-expressing progenitors follow neurogenic and subsequent gliogenic phases after grafting into the E2 chicken embryo, and older gliogenic progenitors could not be reprogrammed back to a neurogenic phase in this younger chicken host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mukouyama et al., 2006</xref>). Our data here support operation of a similar intrinsic neural differentiation programme in human cells. It remains unclear whether the increased neuron production in heterochronic conditions represents a change in timing of such an intrinsic differentiation programme or simply the earlier exit of cells from the cell cycle: whether precocious neurogenesis is followed by earlier gliogenesis onset in comparison to in vitro conditions would require analyses at a still later stage. However, support for the possibility of such an acceleration of human differentiation timing is provided by recent transcriptomic analysis of neural differentiation in in vitro co-cultures of human ESCs and mouse EpiSCs, which found acceleration of human neural gene expression in the presence of increasing numbers of differentiating mouse EpiSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>This interpretation places emphasis on the signalling environment and predicts that iso-chronically grafted rosettes, which at day 5 exhibit reduced neurogenesis and arrested neural crest differentiation in comparison with in vitro conditions, will eventually differentiate. However, appropriate cues within the chicken embryo, in particular, for the neural crest, may no longer be present. Previous studies have used xenografting assays to evaluate the behaviour of human cells generated in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Valensi-Kurtz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frith et al., 2018</xref>) or for potential long-term regenerative therapy purposes using either neural progenitor cells or differentiated neurons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kumamaru et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kumamaru et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Linaro et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings emphasise a requirement for appropriate extrinsic cues for differentiation progression, although we cannot rule out inhibitory signals also acting on grafted human neural cells. Most striking was the continued expansion of iso-chronically transplanted neuroepithelial cells; a behaviour reminiscent of neural cancers such as glioblastoma that share a similar neural progenitor gene expression profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agnihotri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hassn Mesrati et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to providing novel insight into the regulation of human neural differentiation, this assay may therefore also offer an opportunity to study cancer origins as well as inform generation of human organs in animal models and cell-based therapeutic approaches to neural injury and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Finally, the CAG promoter and Gateway cassette (cargo) are flanked by two Inverted Terminal Repeat sequences (ITR, TTAA) allowing the piggyback transposon action. To label the cell membrane, a plasma membrane (pm) associated palmitoylated fluorescent protein was generated by the addition of the 20-amino acid sequence of ratGAP-43 MLCCMRRTKQVEKNDEDQKI to the N-terminus of the monomeric enhanced GFP (eGFP) (K.

ChIPS4-pm-eGFP were differentiated to NMP-Like cells and these were then replated and for cultured 6 days in neural differentiation conditions (as described above), and newly formed human neural rosettes were then manually micro-dissected using a sharp glass needle (0.290–0.310 mm) (Vitrolife). After resting in CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37°C for 2 hr, cell aggregates (diameter ≈ 50–100 μm) were gently dissociated and implanted into the dorsal region of one side of the neural tube of stage HH 11–12 chicken embryos. For transplantation of small groups of human dorsal neural progenitors, micro-dissected single human rosettes were further sub-dissected and mechanically dissociated prior to transplantation. Before implantation, the dorsal region on one side of the neural tube was removed at the level of the most recently formed somite (Figure S3). Embryos were then harvested 2 or 5 days post-transplantation (Stage HH 23–24 and HH 30–31 respectively).

At later time points, human neural rosettes were selected for analysis and quantification by their shape (round with a single lumen) and size (neural rosette diameter, D6: 70–100 μm, average: 84±2.7 μm; D10: 125–137 μm, average: 129±1.5 μm; D14: 155–195 μm, average: 179 ±2.7 μm, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). The proportion of cells expressing marker proteins of interest was determined by counting positive cells within a field of neural progenitors (D4) or in three optical sections in a rosette (D6 and later, includes rosette and contacting cells at its periphery at later timepoints) out of total (DAPI+ or GFP+) cells. Fifteen fields of neural progenitors (D4) or 15 rosettes (D6 and later) were analysed for each marker (<italic>n</italic> = 15, five fields of neural progenitors or rosettes from each of three independent differentiation experiments). For transplanted human rosettes at least three sections from grafts in three different embryos were used to determine the proportion of cells expressing a protein of interest. Transplanted human cells were only counted when cells were positive for GFP, immunoreactivity for protein of interest and DAPI. To avoid counting the same cells in consecutive sections, alternate sections were used for each different immunolabelling assay (four different immunofluorescence assays/transplanted embryo) (Figures source data).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Tatiana Solovieva (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The pace that determines differentiation of embryonic cells (and ESCs/iPS) in general, and human embryonic cells in particular, is at the forefront of stem cells and developmental biology fields, with promising translational perspectives towards regenerative medicine. In this manuscript Dady et al. used human neural rosettes derived from hESCS/iPS to test their differentiation pace in the dish. Their data elegantly show their sequential differentiation into different types of neurons and glia at distinct time windows. When compared to their corresponding cells/domain within human embryonic spinal cords, the authors discover that, although the in vitro rosettes recapitulate the temporal sequence of neural tube differentiation (but into dorsal neural subpopulations only), they proceed much more rapidly in vitro compared to the intact embryo. This analysis led the authors to conclude that spinal cord progenitors in the in vitro conditions accelerate their developmental pace as compared to the embryonic counterparts due to lack of the endogenous environmental context.</p><p>Intriguingly, when the rosettes were grafted into chick neural tube in ovo, they did not adjust to the new environment, which contains much more rapidly differentiating cells, and remained in their initial pace. Later, the grafted cells halted their development and remained progenitors. These findings led the authors to conclude that intrinsic properties of the neural rosettes, rather than extrinsic signals from the avian spinal cord, govern their differentiation pace.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All of the points raised by the reviewers seem both reasonable and feasible. Most importantly:</p><p>1. Heterochronic transplantation is a key experiment to test the notion of intrinsic regulation of the timing of human neural stem cell differentiation.</p><p>2. Please provide information on whether the cells analyzed for a given marker are present within or outside of that marker domain in the chick host. This is crucial to interpretation of the data.</p><p>3. Better analysis of the stalled grafts in terms of their cell death/proliferation /glia markers.</p><p>4. As a control, chick-to-chick graft of early progenitors to compare with the human graft to rule out the possibility of an experimental artifact that leads to the human cell behaviour in the chick.</p><p>5. A few grafts using smaller groups of rosette derived cells to clarify whether or not the current results represent human cells that are receiving largely chick host derived signals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this interesting paper by Dady and colleagues the nature of human neural progenitor differentiation is evaluated via transplantation studies. The first part of the paper establishes the timing of neural differentiation in human IPSC model systems and in human embryonic spinal cord, showing that the relative timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis is maintained. In the second part of the paper these human IPSC neural rosettes are transplanted into the chick spinal cord during neurogenic stages (i.e. Isochronic transplantation) and they find that neurons are generated by these transplanted populations. Analysis of transplants at later stages reveals that neurogenesis has &quot;stalled&quot; and is relatively reduced within the transplanted population.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting paper that uses classic approaches to answer potentially interesting questions, however there are some issues that limit its potential impact. The first two figures are recursive and show that the authors can implement an existing protocol. The transplantation studies are intriguing by fall short of offering any new insights. The key finding seems to be that at later stages post-transplantation neuronal differential is &quot;stalled&quot;. There are many other reasons (besides stalling&quot;) that could explain their results. Suppose that stalling was indeed occurring, the authors offer no cellular or molecular insights into what regulates these intrinsic differences across species. At the end, I'm left asking what we have really learned about the mechanisms that control the timing (pace is just fancy and new way of saying timing) of differentiation in human neural stem cells. Below are a few experimental suggestions that could add more insight into this paper:</p><p>1) Fig7, late stage transplant, should check NFIA expression. E7 is gliogenic in the chick and its possible that the rosettes are now becoming gliogenic. Perhaps the observed &quot;stalling&quot; is really a switch to gliogenesis. Alternatively, the apparent reduction in the proportion of neurons could be a survival issue, where older and more differentiated neurons from human rosettes cannot survive in the chick spinal cord. Thus, cell death should be evaluated. Even if there are no detectable changes in cell death, the interpretation should be dialed back a bit as its totally possible that there issues with the maintenance of human neurons in chick spinal cord and by the time they are analyzing transplants at E7 in chick the rosettes have switched to gliogenesis and are no longer making neurons (and the neurons that were produced have died off).</p><p>2) The phrasing is a bit odd.

If there is some sort of intrinsic timing mechanism at play, then the D20 rosettes should still make glia in the neurogenic environment.

Heterochronic transplantation is a key experiment to test the notion of intrinsic regulation of the timing of human neural stem cell differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>Heterochronic transplantation of D6 human neural rosettes into the same position in the developing spinal cord but into older embryos has been undertaken. Three independent experiments were carried out, with three sections from 3 grafts per experiment analysed for each of our panel of markers at 2 days and at 5 days post-transplantation. These extensive new data are presented in a new Results section and in new figures 8 and 9, and results summary figure 10. We find that as with isochronic transplantation there is a &gt;2-day delay before human cells respond to the chick environment, in both contexts the rosette cells retain differentiation timing found in rosettes cultured in vitro. This supports the conclusion that human cells initially follow cell instinct differentiation timing. Strikingly, by 5 days heterochronic grafts exhibit increased neurogenesis in comparison with in vitro rosettes, (while isochronic grafts showed reduced neurogenesis). This demonstrates that human cells can respond to differentiation signals in the chicken embryonic environment. Moreover, by heterochronic day 5 the chicken host has already embarked on gliogenesis, but the human cells continue to follow their normal neural differentiation programme, entering the neurogenic phase. As human cells do not obviate neurogenesis in a gliogenic environment these data further show that human cells follow an intrinsic differentiation programme.</p><p>­­­</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Better analysis of the stalled grafts in terms of their cell death/proliferation /glia markers.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed by assessing expression of key marker proteins in sections of isochronic day 5 grafts. Analysis of cell death using an antibody to detect activated caspase 3 revealed one or two positive cells in only a few sections. Cell proliferation detected with an antibody that recognises Ki67 showed that almost all human rosette cells expressed this protein. These data are quantified and provided in revised figure 6 and as metadata. We conclude that cell death does not contribute to the differentiation state observed at Day 5, although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that this takes place discretely between day 2 and day 5 and so was missed in this analysis (noted in the manuscript). Our conclusion is supported by the proliferative status (Ki67) of almost all cells, which further confirms our original analysis showing that most cells express SOX2 and PAX7. We did not have enough sections to also assess the possibility that these cells have been induced into glial progenitors, but the extensive expression of the neurogenic neural progenitor marker PAX7 in these grafts supports the conclusion that this could not account for the apparent stalling of the neurogenic differentiation. Overall, these data strongly suggest that iso-chronically grafted human neural progenitors have been exposed to insufficient levels of differentiation signals to progress the neural differentiation programme. This is consistent with the slower cell cycle of human neural progenitors and slower metabolism of human cells delaying response to the signalling environment in comparison with the cells of the host chicken embryo. This conclusion is further supported by the increased neurogenesis detected in day 5 hetero-chronic grafts, where exposure to a more developmentally advanced environment now drives neurogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The first part of the paper establishes the timing of neural differentiation in human IPSC model systems and in human embryonic spinal cord, showing that the relative timing of neurogenesis and gliogenesis is maintained. In the second part of the paper these human IPSC neural rosettes are transplanted into the chick spinal cord during neurogenic stages (i.e. Isochronic transplantation) and they find that neurons are generated by these transplanted populations. Analysis of transplants at later stages reveals that neurogenesis has &quot;stalled&quot; and is relatively reduced within the transplanted population.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting paper that uses classic approaches to answer potentially interesting questions, however there are some issues that limit its potential impact. The first two figures are recursive and show that the authors can implement an existing protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous work established this differentiation protocol (Verrier et al. 2018 Development), but this is its first use to analyse by immunofluorescence the timing of neural differentiation and the appearance of specific neuronal and glial cell types in an in vitro neural rosette assay. None of the data presented is recursive and it provides a quantitative timeline of human dorsal spinal cord differentiation. Moreover, our comparison with the human embryonic spinal cord indicates that neural differentiation progresses more rapidly in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The transplantation studies are intriguing by fall short of offering any new insights. The key finding seems to be that at later stages post-transplantation neuronal differential is &quot;stalled&quot;. There are many other reasons (besides stalling&quot;) that could explain their results. Suppose that stalling was indeed occurring, the authors offer no cellular or molecular insights into what regulates these intrinsic differences across species. At the end, I'm left asking what we have really learned about the mechanisms that control the timing (pace is just fancy and new way of saying timing) of differentiation in human neural stem cells. Below are a few experimental suggestions that could add more insight into this paper:</p><p>1) Fig7, late stage transplant, should check NFIA expression. E7 is gliogenic in the chick and its possible that the rosettes are now becoming gliogenic. Perhaps the observed &quot;stalling&quot; is really a switch to gliogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the E7 chick spinal cord is gliogenic (Deneen et al. 2006) and it is formally possible that the human rosettes start to become gliogenic in this context at an earlier time point than in vitro. We observe in vitro that the human rosettes become gliogenic quite late, at D20, while analysis of grafted D6 rosettes after 5 days takes us only to D11 in vitro when rosettes are clearly neurogenic (Figure 2), so the chick environment would need to be able to dramatically accelerate or divert the human neural differentiation programme. Unfortunately, this is the only experiment we have been unable to address directly as we did not have enough sections of day 5 iso-chronically grafted rosettes to assess NFIA expression. However, below we set out the evidence for why we think these late-stage iso-chronically transplanted rosettes are not gliogenic.</p><p>We have effectively tested this question in a new hetero-chronic grafting experiment (undertaken in response to your further comments below), which assesses differentiation of D6 human rosettes grafted into an E3 older chick spinal cord; after 2 days we did not detect expression of glial marker (NFIA) in transplanted human rosettes, despite NFIA expression in the host chicken embryo (new Figure 8D). Further, after 5 days, we found a large increase in the number of neurons (compared to in vitro rosettes), excluding an early switch to gliogenesis at this time (new Figure 9). These findings indicate that the transplanted human rosette cells can respond to the chicken host environment after this longer period of exposure to a more differentiated environment, indeed this is consistent with continued neurogenesis during the transition to gliogenesis that is observed in the developing chick spinal cord, with neurons still being generated at E6 (Deneen et al. 2006). As expanded upon below, these findings support the interpretation that D6 rosettes proceed along the normal sequence of the human neural differentiation programme, generating neurons in a supportive environment, rather than being reprogrammed to the gliogenic pathway. D6 rosettes grafted iso-chronically into the earlier E2 embryo will be exposed to a less advanced neurogenic environment and we think this is not enough to sustain productive human neurogenesis, but some P27 and ISLET1 positive cells are generated from rosette cells that continue to express neurogenic progenitor protein PAX7 at day 5 (Figure 6D) (this is normally downregulated by E6 in the chick during gliogenesis transition, Deneen et al. 2006) and so it is unlikely that the rosette cells are gliogenic. We have now summarised the differentiation status of rosette cells in these different contexts in a new schematic figure 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Alternatively, the apparent reduction in the proportion of neurons could be a survival issue, where older and more differentiated neurons from human rosettes cannot survive in the chick spinal cord. Thus, cell death should be evaluated.

We also analysed cell proliferation and observed that most transplanted human rosette cells express Ki67 indicative of cycling cells (new Figure 6G). These data, along with the expression of SOX2 and PAX7 in almost all cells in iso-chronically transplanted human rosettes after 5 days (Figures 6C, D) indicate that these retain a proliferative neural progenitor cell state, while P27 and Islet1 cell counts indicate they produce few neurons. Moreover, as noted above the same D6 rosettes grafted into a later E3 embryo generate increased numbers of neurons (greater than in vitro) by day 5, indicating that such human cells survive well in the chicken environment. However, it is formally possible that neuronal death takes place discretely between day 2 and day 5 in iso-chronically grafted rosettes and so was not detected in this analysis. We now note this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The phrasing is a bit odd. Homo-chronic should be phrased as &quot;Isochronic&quot;. &quot;Pace&quot; is really just timing of differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the word “homo-chronic” for a reason. The term iso-chronic is often used in classical experiments in which the same tissue is transplanted between two embryos at exactly the same stage of development for example to make fate maps (e.g., Catala et al.1996 MOD, PMID: 7669693). As we did not transplant a piece of human neural tube for evident ethical reasons, we found the term “homo-chronic” more relevant as we are comparing two similar tissues at the same stage of differentiation from two different species. However, for clarity we have now replaced the term homo-chronic with by iso-chronic. We also appreciate that timing and pace have similar meanings here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To truly test whether there is an intrinsic mechanism at play in these transplantation studies, they should perform the heterochronic experiment: Transplant Neurogenic D6 rosettes into the E6 gliogenic chick spinal cord. Admittedly, this is a tough experiment. Therefore, as an alternative, they should perform the complementary heterochronic transplantation: Gliogenic D20 rosettes into the E2, neurogenic chick spinal cord. If there is some sort of intrinsic timing mechanism at play, then the D20 rosettes should still make glia in the neurogenic environment. This was actually already shown for mouse glial progenitors (Mukouyama, et al. PNAS 2006) and it would be a nice addition to this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now carried out a heterochronic experiment. We opted to graft D6 human rosettes into an older host chick embryo at E3, as this allowed us to compare data with D6 rosettes cultured in vitro or iso-chronically transplanted, after 2 days and 5 days. Grafting into even older E6 embryos, as suggested here, was not possible because these are highly vascularised with a strong heartbeat that makes the transplantation and positioning of rosettes technically challenging and reduces embryo viability. The alternative suggestion, transplanting gliogenic D20 rosettes was not undertaken because by this stage the rosette structure has been outgrown and we would also have to characterise rosettes in vitro for a further 2 (D22) and 5 (D27) days to provide in vitro control data sets (note each analysis is carried out with 3 independent differentiations from hPSCs and cells in &gt;5 rosettes quantified and analysed for each marker assessed).</p><p>So, as presented in detail in the paper, we transplanted D6 rosettes composed of dorsal neural progenitors into the dorsal region of the neural tube of an older E3 chicken embryo. After 2 days the E3 host embryo had reached E5 and had begun the gliogenic switch, expressing NFIA in the dorsal neural tube (new Figure 8D). Importantly, we did not detect NFIA in the transplanted rosette after 2 days. In fact, we found no difference between hetero-chronically or iso-chronically transplanted and in vitro cultured rosettes at day 2, indicating that in this timeframe transplanted human cells were not influenced by the chicken host environment. We argue in the paper that this finding is consistent with the correlation between greater protein stability / slower human cell cycle time and slower differentiation pace (Rayon et al. 2020) and we make a case that transit through the cell cycle may be required for expression of differentiation genes and that this may explain the delay seen in both conditions in the response of human cells to the chicken environment.</p><p>Importantly, 5 days after heterochronic grafting (when the human cells had been exposed to the gliogenic environment for 3 days), we found increased neuron production (both p27 and islet1 +ve cells) compared with in vitro rosettes and iso-chronic transplantation conditions (new Figure 9). This tells us that by day 5 human cells can now respond to the chicken environment, and while in isochronic this is insufficient to drive neurogenesis, in the hetero-chronic conditions this results in the next step the neural differentiation programme, i.e. neuron production.</p><p>These heterochronic grafting data therefore support the conclusion that the human neural differentiation programme progresses in an environment with an appropriate level of differentiation signals (presented over 5 days), and that the sequence of cell types generated by this programme is not altered in this older and newly gliogenic environment. This is consistent with the findings of Mukouyama, et al. in the mouse, in that they find that Olig2+ progenitors progress through a differentiation programme, first neurogenic phase and then gliogenic phase when transplanted into the chicken environment, and that this is not reversible, older gliogenic Olig2+ progenitors cannot be reprogrammed back to a neurogenic phase in younger chicken host. Here we show that the neurogenic phase of differentiating human neural progenitors is not obviated by development in an increasingly gliogenic environment. We now address this in the Discussion, noting that this supports operation of an intrinsic programme of human neural differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The labeling in figure 4b makes no sense and seems arbitrarily defined.
