In dense multiciliated carpets, cilia were shown to exhibit a remarkable coordination of their beat in the form of traveling metachronal waves, a phenomenon which supposedly enhances fluid transport. Yet, how cilia coordinate their regular beat in multiciliated epithelia to move fluids remains insufficiently understood, particularly due to lack of rigorous quantification. We combine experiments, novel analysis tools, and theory to address this knowledge gap. To investigate collective dynamics of cilia, we studied zebrafish multiciliated epithelia in the nose and the brain. We focused mainly on the zebrafish nose, due to its conserved properties with other ciliated tissues and its superior accessibility for non-invasive imaging. We revealed that cilia are synchronized only locally and that the size of local synchronization domains increases with the viscosity of the surrounding medium. Even though synchronization is local only, we observed global patterns of traveling metachronal waves across the zebrafish multiciliated epithelium. Intriguingly, these global wave direction patterns are conserved across individual fish, but different for left and right noses, unveiling a chiral asymmetry of metachronal coordination. To understand the implications of synchronization for fluid pumping, we used a computational model of a regular array of cilia. We found that local metachronal synchronization prevents steric collisions, i.e., cilia colliding with each other, and improves fluid pumping in dense cilia carpets, but hardly affects the direction of fluid flow. In conclusion, we show that local synchronization together with tissue-scale cilia alignment coincide and generate metachronal wave patterns in multiciliated epithelia, which enhance their physiological function of fluid pumping.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motile cilia</kwd><kwd>metachronal coordination</kwd><kwd>synchronization</kwd><kwd>multiciliated cell</kwd><kwd>ciliary beating</kwd><kwd>chirality</kwd><kwd>computational model</kwd><kwd>steric collisions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ringers</surname><given-names>Christa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Research Council of Norway</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>314189</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jurisch-Yaksi</surname><given-names>Nathalie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FR3429/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedrich</surname><given-names>Benjamin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FR3429/1-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedrich</surname><given-names>Benjamin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FR3429/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Friedrich</surname><given-names>Benjamin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel frequency-based analysis and computation modeling of cilia carpets reveals that tissue-scale metachronal coordination of cilia can arise even in the absence of global synchronization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Motile cilia are highly conserved, hair-like cell appendages that beat periodically to move fluid in a wide range of species. In vertebrates, motile cilia are present in the brain, the respiratory system, reproductive tracts, and the left-right organizer, where they serve numerous functions related to fluid transport. Cilia move cerebrospinal fluid along the ventricles of the vertebrate brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olstad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sawamoto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ringers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faubel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Worthington and Cathcart, 1966</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Date et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D’Gama et al., 2021</xref>) and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sternberg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thouvenin et al., 2020</xref>), contribute to mucociliary clearance, which protect our lungs and nose from pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bustamante-Marin and Ostrowski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramirez-San Juan et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wallmeier et al., 2019</xref>), or establish the left-right body axis during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferreira et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nonaka et al., 1998</xref>). Cilia often coordinate their movements within and across cell boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanderson and Sleigh, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brumley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machemer, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knight-Jones, 1954</xref>), which may improve cilia-mediated fluid transport as suggested by modeling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgeti and Gompper, 2013</xref>). Yet, how cilia coordination emerges in multiciliated tissues remains an active topic of research.</p><p>In the absence of a tissue-scale ciliary pacemaker, cilia require a physical coupling to coordinate their beat. Coupling between cilia can occur through the surrounding fluid, which is referred to as hydrodynamic coupling, as originally proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taylor, 1952</xref> and first demonstrated experimentally for pairs of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumley et al., 2014</xref>). In short, the movement of one cilium sets the surrounding fluid in motion, which impacts hydrodynamic friction forces on other cilia in its vicinity. A change in hydrodynamic friction forces causes cilia to beat slightly faster or slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klindt et al., 2016</xref>). Theoretical studies showed that hydrodynamic interactions could, at least in principle, orchestrate self-organized synchronization of cilia in metachronal waves, which refer to a sequential rather than synchronous or random movement of neighboring cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gueron and Levit-Gurevich, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guirao and Joanny, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Osterman and Vilfan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wollin and Stark, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgeti and Gompper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakrabarti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanale et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, basal coupling of cilia through their anchoring in the cell cortex may contribute to cilia synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quaranta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wan and Goldstein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klindt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Soh et al., 2020</xref>). Putative synchronization mechanisms must be sufficiently strong to overcome the deleterious effects of slightly distinct beat frequencies, active cilia noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Polin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022a</xref>), and disorder in cilia alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guirao et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, global synchronization across an entire tissue is rather unlikely.</p><p>The localization of cilia carpets deep inside the vertebrate body has motivated previous studies of cilia carpet dynamics to resort to more accessible and simpler, non-animal model systems on the surface of protists such as <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machemer, 1972</xref>) or the green alga <italic>Volvox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machemer, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brumley et al., 2012</xref>), or cell culture systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pellicciotta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oltean et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gsell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khelloufi et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, cilia coordination in the form of metachronal waves is observed in some systems, but not in others, prompting the question on the determinants of cilia synchronization. Previous work showed that cilia density and spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pellicciotta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khelloufi et al., 2018</xref>), the viscosity of the surrounding fluid (e.g. mucus versus water) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machemer, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gheber et al., 1998</xref>), as well as the tissue-scale alignment of cilia polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>) appear to be key parameters for synchronization in cilia carpets. Intriguingly, the wave direction of these metachronal waves can be rotated relative to the direction of the effective stroke of the cilia beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knight-Jones, 1954</xref>). This broken chiral symmetry of metachronal waves is likely a consequence of chiral cilia beat patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgeti and Gompper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meng et al., 2021</xref>), but the details are not understood. Finally, it is not even clear to what extent metachronal coordination is rather a local or a tissue-scale phenomenon, and how this in turn affects the pumping rate of cilia carpets. Answering these open questions requires accessible model systems.</p><p>In this study, we combined experimental and theoretical work to study the coordination of motile cilia and its impact on fluid pumping. We chose as main experimental model the larval zebrafish nose, a cup-like structure of approximately 50 µm diameter containing many multiciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reiten et al., 2017</xref>), which allows for non-invasive biophysical measurements of cilia beating due to its superficial location. Using this in vivo model, we observed that the cilia beat frequency is heterogeneous across the epithelium, limiting synchronization to local domains. Notwithstanding, we identified robust metachronal coordination, with waves that propagated along stable directions across the multiciliated epithelium. The direction of metachronal waves is consistently different in the right nose as compared to the left nose. This difference between left and right noses marks an instance of broken chiral symmetry, which is not explained by cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gheber et al., 1998</xref>) orientation. To understand the implications for fluid pumping of local synchronization as observed in the zebrafish nose, we used a computational model of a regular array of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022a</xref>). We detail how local synchronization is necessary to avoid steric collisions between cilia at higher cilia densities, which helps efficient cilia beating. At the same time, the rate of fluid pumping is robust against weak levels of noise. Finally, we showed that the direction and wavelength of metachronal traveling waves influence the mean pumping rate, but hardly affects the direction of fluid flow.</p><p>Altogether, we propose that local synchronization, tissue-scale cilia alignment, and the emergence of global metachronal waves coincide in a cilia carpet. Collectively, they support its physiological function of fluid pumping.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The dense packing of multiciliated cells in the zebrafish nose provides a powerful model to study cilia coordination</title><p>To study how cilia beating coordinates throughout an entire ciliated organ in its native state, we turned to the larval zebrafish nose, as its localization on the snout allows for non-invasive live imaging of an entire tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). At 4-day post fertilization, the zebrafish nose is a cup-like structure containing multiciliated cells at its rim and olfactory sensory neurons and support cells in its center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kermen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reiten et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hansen and Zeiske, 1993</xref>). To characterize the three-dimensional organization of motile cilia in this organ, we quantified the number, distribution, and properties of multiciliated cells. We imaged 4-day-old larvae that expressed a GFP-based indicator within multiciliated cells (<italic>Tg(Foxj1a:GCaMP6s</italic>)), and that were stained for the ciliary markers, acetylated tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reiten et al., 2017</xref>) and glutamylated tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olstad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pathak et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Our results revealed that the distribution of multiciliated cells across the 3D geometry of the nose is stereotypical: most cells populate the lateral rim, forming two to three rows of multiciliated cells, while fewer cells occupy the medial rim, and are even absent in the anteromedial center regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B&amp;C</xref>). This pattern is highly consistent across fish and mirrored for left and right noses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We identified that on average each nose contains 50.8 multiciliated cells (±6.2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–B</xref>’). We also measured that 47.7 cilia (±9.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–C</xref>’) emanate from an apical cell surface of 17.4 µm<sup>2</sup> (±6.3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–D</xref>’), with a length of 8.8 µm (±0.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–E</xref>’).

By applying our FFT-based analysis on the light-sheet recordings, we observed a decrease in CBF, matching the light transmission experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).

We then extracted the phase angle from the Fourier spectrum for the dominant frequency of that given patch. We decided to extract phases from segmented patches because (<italic>i</italic>) phases extracted for different frequencies are not comparable and lead to noisy signals precluding further analysis, and (<italic>ii</italic>) for time series of finite length, phases of Fourier modes at nearby frequencies are correlated. This analysis provides a unique phase angle for each pixel of the recording (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> right and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). Next, to translate phase information to wave direction and wavelength quantifications, we extracted image gradient vectors from each patch separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This allowed us to quantify and plot both wave direction and wavelength, by calculating the mean gradient vector direction and the mean gradient vector length, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Using this approach, we found that the wave directions form regular patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which are relatively stable over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>), across depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and not particularly affected by increasing viscosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Similar results were obtained for the tela choroidae in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The patterns were, however, more diverse, probably due to a lower density of cilia and motile ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D’Gama et al., 2021</xref>).

In contrast, we observed a stark difference in the angle of the metachronal wave, with an angle of 163.2° relative to the anterior-posterior axis for left noses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) and 100.2° for the mirrored right noses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

Specifically, we used a recently established multi-scale model of a regular array of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022a</xref>), which uses detailed hydrodynamic computations and an experimentally measured three-dimensional beat pattern from <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machemer, 1972</xref>). This model can probe the effect of any wave direction and wavelength of metachronal coordination on fluid pumping and steric interactions, i.e., cilia colliding with each other. Thereby it allows us to disentangle the roles of hydrodynamic interactions and the importance of avoiding steric collision between neighboring cilia in a systematic way. The computational model enables us to investigate metachronal waves with different directions and wavelengths in a cilia carpet as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, where each dot in the hexagonal plot represents a different wave solution with different wave length λ and direction angle θ represented by a wave vector (<italic>k<sub>x</sub></italic>,<italic>k<sub>y</sub></italic>) = 2π/λ ( - sin θ, cos θ ). Using this model, we first investigated how different traveling waves affect the pumping rate per cilium and the mean direction of fluid flow. We observed that the pumping rate is close to its minimum when all cilia beat with the same phase, that is, for in-phase cilia beating with (<italic>k<sub>x</sub></italic>,<italic>k<sub>y</sub></italic>) = (0,0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast, if cilia beat in the form of a metachronal traveling wave with finite wavelength λ, the pumping rate increases significantly. We observed a stronger increase in pumping rate for symplectic or antiplectic metachronal coordination (for which the wave vector is parallel to the direction of the cilia effective stroke, <italic>θ</italic> = 0⁰ or 180⁰), as compared to dexioplectic or laeoplectic metachronism (for which the wave vector is perpendicular to the direction of the effective stroke, θ = ±90⁰). The observed change in pumping rate is a result of hydrodynamic interactions between cilia: if cilia move in opposite directions for an antiplectic wave, destructive interference of flow fields implies that the hydrodynamic load increases for each cilium. Thus, the beating cilia perform more work on the fluid per beat cycle and consequently pump the fluid faster. Hydrodynamic interactions also explain why the pumping rate is higher for symplectic and antiplectic waves as compared to laeoplectic and dexioplectic waves because hydrodynamic interactions are stronger in the direction of an applied force as compared to the direction perpendicular to the force. As a subtle point, an increase in hydrodynamic load also slows down the collective frequency of cilia beating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022b</xref>), but this secondary effect is not strong enough to revert the increase of pumping rate due to enhanced hydrodynamic load. For numerical reasons, our computational model allows only a dilute cilia density of 0.0036 μm<sup>–2</sup> for which cilia do not collide. For higher cilia densities, we expect an even more pronounced change in pumping rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgeti and Gompper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Osterman and Vilfan, 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Metachronal coordination enhances fluid pumping and reduces steric interactions, but does not affect fluid flow direction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Possible traveling wave solutions in a computational model of a cilia carpet.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, we observed that the flow direction is virtually independent of the direction and wavelength of metachronal waves with a variability of less than ±5⁰ for the chosen cilia density. This theory prediction matches our experimental observation. Indeed, we did not find any difference in the overall fluid flow direction in left and right noses with their different metachronal directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F&amp;G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). In conclusion, our results show that metachronal coordination is beneficial for fluid pumping, but does not affect the direction of fluid flow.</p><p>We then probed how deviating from global synchronization impacts fluid pumping. We previously demonstrated theoretically that above a characteristic level of cilia phase noise, global synchronization is lost but local synchronized domains persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022a</xref>). For efficient numerical computations, it is sufficient to consider a smaller carpet that exhibits a single coordinated metachronal wave perturbed by cilia phase noise, instead of several domains with local synchronization each. This is valid because long-range hydrodynamic interactions near a boundary wall such as an epithelial layer decay as inverse cubed distance (~<italic>d</italic><sup>–3</sup>). Therefore, hydrodynamic interactions between distant cilia should have little impact on the rate of fluid pumping, and in fact were previously shown to be dispensable for our computational model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022b</xref>). Hence, we expect that in a cilia carpet with noise-perturbed global synchronization, the main determinant affecting fluid pumping is phase noise between nearby cilia. Correspondingly, we investigated how adding increasing phase noise to a prescribed metachronal wave affects fluid pumping for four possible scenarios: (<italic>i</italic>) the dexioplectic wave with wave vector <bold>k</bold><sub>I</sub> that emerges spontaneously in the computational model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022b</xref>), (<italic>ii</italic>) a perfect dexioplectic wave with θ = 90<sup>o</sup>, (<italic>iii</italic>) the antiplectic wave that maximizes fluid pumping, and (<italic>iv</italic>) in-phase cilia beating.</p><p>We observed that, for the dexioplectic wave <bold>k</bold><sub>I</sub>, the rate of fluid pumping approximately equals that for cilia beating with a random phase relationship, while the pumping rate is substantially higher for the most efficient antiplectic wave and a dexioplectic wave with θ = 90<sup>o</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Generally, if random perturbations of cilia phase remain small (standard deviation σ&lt;0.2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), the pumping rate is only moderately changed. For stronger phase noise (σ&gt;1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), the pumping rate attains a constant value, irrespective of the underlying wave solution, as cilia essentially beat with random phase relationship. Taken together, our results show that cilia carpets exhibiting metachronal coordination can tolerate some level of noise of cilia beating for their physiological function of fluid pumping.</p><p>Besides improving fluid flow, metachronal waves may also prevent steric collisions between neighboring cilia, which could slow down their dynamics. To probe the relevance of steric interactions, we computed for each wave solution a critical density ρ(<bold>k</bold>) at which cilia do not collide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We observed that this critical density is substantially higher than a corresponding density ρ<sub>rand</sub> defined for cilia beating with random phase relationship. In fact, this critical density is minimal for in-phase cilia beating. However, for in-phase beating, the predicted pumping rate is also minimal. In contrast, symplectic and dexioplectic metachronal coordination allow for both an elevated pumping rate and denser cilia packing without steric collisions. The product of the pumping rate per cilium and cilia density yield the total pumping rate of a cilia carpet. We speculate that metachronal coordination may represent an evolutionary solution to the trade-off choice of both realizing a high pumping rate per cilium (which favors metachronal coordination with short wavelength, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and a high cilia density (which favors in-phase synchronization, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Our argument refines a previous hypothesis by Machemer, who proposed that dexioplectic waves reduce steric interactions as compared to symplectic or antiplectic waves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machemer, 1972</xref>.</p><p>Our computational model shows that local synchronization is a prerequisite for efficient cilia beating in dense cilia carpets by avoiding steric collisions between cilia.

Even with only local synchronization of cilia, tissue-scale metachronal coordination with distinct pattern of wave directions is possible in cilia carpets. Indeed, we observed in a zebrafish model system tissue-scale patterns of metachronal waves, which were consistent across individual animals, but different for left and right noses. This difference in wave directions is not a mere consequence of different patterns of cilia alignment, but instead points at an important role of the chirality of the cilia beat and 3D architecture of the underlying tissue. On the basis of computational results, we propose that local synchronization is sufficient to pump fluids at an almost maximal rate.</p><p>In this study, we chose to study multiciliated cells in the developing zebrafish nose. We identified that although these cells bear a reduced number of cilia as compared to mammalian tissues or <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic skin, they retain a ciliary density similar to these other multiciliated epithelia due to their smaller apical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldstein et al., 2016</xref>). In principle, the apical size of cells should not matter for the physics of cilia synchronization. As a small caveat, it is possible that a ciliated epithelium made of smaller cells may be more heterogeneous due to higher divergence in cilia properties across cells. Yet, since the density of cilia is a key property for synchronization of motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pellicciotta et al., 2020</xref>), we argue that the zebrafish nose is an appropriate model for studying coupling mechanisms within and across cell boundaries in a naturally dense cilia carpet, which is highly accessible for imaging experiments. We have also performed experiments in another ciliated tissue, the tela choroidea of the adult zebrafish brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D’Gama et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>), to further strengthen the applicability of our analysis tools.</p><p>Using Fourier-based analyses, we observed that motile cilia in the zebrafish nose and brain beat at slightly different frequencies, both within the organ and across fish. The beating frequency may depend on the number of cilia on the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pellicciotta et al., 2020</xref>), the age of the cell or animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olstad et al., 2019</xref>), but likely not the length of the cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bottier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pintado et al., 2017</xref>). Beat frequency may also relate to the level of synchronization across cilia. In fact, it was shown that upon synchronization, the emergent frequencies of two oscillators converge to the same value as long as the intrinsic frequencies are similar enough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pellicciotta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quaranta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pikovsky et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, cilia should beat faster (or slower) when they are synchronized in-phase (or in anti-phase) because the hydrodynamic friction acting on an individual cilium decreases (or increases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgeti and Gompper, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pellicciotta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meng et al., 2021</xref>). Of note, the cilia beat frequencies reported here do not represent the intrinsic beat frequencies of individual cilia, but instead the emergent frequency when a cilium is interacting with its neighbors. Nevertheless, in our system, we observed that beat frequencies are widely distributed, suggesting that there is no synchronization on a global, tissue scale. This also agrees with experimental data in airway human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feriani et al., 2017</xref>) and modeling work showing that frequency dispersity and active noise in cilia beating limit synchronization to the local scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guirao and Joanny, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022a</xref>). To probe how global versus local synchronization affects the transport of fluid, we turned to a computational approach. We highlight how local synchronization is a prerequisite to reduce steric hindrance in dense cilia carpets. Moreover, the pumping rate of a cilia carpet is robust against moderate levels of phase noise between neighboring cilia, while it should be independent of hydrodynamic interactions with distant cilia, suggesting that locally synchronized cilia can achieve fluid pumping at an almost maximal possible rate. Our results thus complement a previous study suggesting a favorable effect of slight disorder in the cilia polarity for effective fluid transport in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramirez-San Juan et al., 2020</xref>), by highlighting benefits of local order.</p><p>Previous methods to investigate coordinated ciliary movement include spatial correlation approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gheber and Priel, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wan et al., 2020</xref>), measures of phase similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oltean et al., 2018</xref>), or spatial correlation functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feriani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brumley et al., 2015</xref>). However, these approaches are either not automated, or complicated to interpret. In this study, we applied another measure for synchronization commonly used in neuroscience, the magnitude-squared coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al., 1973</xref>). This measure proved to be very robust to detect synchronization across pixels. Synchronized oscillators should beat at the same frequency. Indeed, we observed that our coherence score only reported pixel pairs oscillating at the same frequency. Yet, having the same frequency is only a necessary but not a sufficient condition. Indeed, we noticed that not all pixel pairs oscillating at the same frequency were coherent, in particularly when pixels were far apart and only ‘accidentally’ shared the same frequency. Using this measure, we observe that coherence rapidly decays at a pixel distance of approximately 20 µm, which is larger than the diameter of a cell (4.1–4.7 µm), and longer than the length of a single cilium of approximately 9 µm in the nose. We thus have an indirect, but not yet direct proof that coherence domains cross cell boundaries. It remains to be understood what sets the size of the observed coherence domains. Generally, a stronger coupling between cilia promotes larger domains, while active noise of the cilia beat, dispersity of intrinsic cilia beat frequency, and imperfect cilia alignment should cause smaller domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Solovev and Friedrich, 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guirao and Joanny, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Our results revealed that coherence domains slightly increase in size when the viscosity of the surrounding medium is increased. This complements previous findings by Machemer that changing viscosity can change the direction of metachronal waves in cilia carpets in unicellular <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Machemer, 1972</xref>). We suppose that changing the viscosity of the surrounding medium slightly changes the cilia beat pattern and therefore the synchronization coupling between nearby cilia. Indeed, previous literature showed that shape and speed of the cilia beat changes upon increased viscosities or hydrodynamic load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brokaw, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klindt et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Traveling waves of ciliary phase, in the form of so-called metachronal waves, have been previously observed in ciliated system, particularly in ciliates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brumley et al., 2015</xref>). They are often highlighted as a feature of synchronized cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bustamante-Marin and Ostrowski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ovadyahu and Priel, 1989</xref>), which promote efficient fluid transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elgeti and Gompper, 2013</xref>). Using a novel analysis method based on the phase of the Fourier transform of time-lapse recordings, we revealed coherent patterns of metachronal wave directions in nose pits, which were consistent across individual fish. Intriguingly, wave patterns were different for the left and right noses with an offset of approximately 65° in relation to the anterior-posterior axis of the animal. Of note, due to a slighty different mounting angle of the samples for measuring ciliary beating and cilia polarity, we are not able to directly measure the offset between ciliary beating and metachronal wave direction and hence normalized these values to the anterior-posterior axis of the larvae.</p><p>As we did not observe any other differences between the left and right noses, we speculate that chiral cilia beat patterns may be slightly different for the left and right noses, respectively, since different cilia beat patterns will give rise to different dominant metachronal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meng et al., 2021</xref>), as observed for different metazoan species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Knight-Jones, 1954</xref>). Usually, only one type of metachronism is observed in a single species, and even in a single systematic group. The zebrafish model system established here thus opens the unique opportunity to study two different fundamental types of metachronal coordination in a single species.</p><p>Using hydrodynamic computations, we showed that metachronal coordination hardly changes the direction of cilia-generated fluid flow. Hence, it is unlikely that the different metachronal wave patterns observed between the left and right zebrafish noses and in different species in general affect the direction of fluid flow and thus their physiological function. In line with this, we have not observed differences in the direction of the overall flow generated by the left or right pit. However, metachronal coordination enhances the rate of fluid pumping and at the same time reduces steric interactions at higher cilia density. We speculate that the observed metachronal waves may provide an optimal trade-off between a high pumping rate per cilium and a high cilia density within a cilia carpet.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe here an accessible in vivo model system and novel analytical methods to quantify the properties of the cilia beat as well as emergent synchronization in ciliated epithelium in an unbiased manner. Using these tools, we show that local synchronization is sufficient for coherent patterns of metachronal coordination, which expectedly allows to realize almost the maximal rate of fluid pumping.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (zebrafish)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> <italic>Et(hspGGFF19B:Gal4)Tg(UAS:gfp</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reiten et al., 2017</xref>;

Serial dilutions were performed to achieve lower concentrations of methylcellulose in AFW (0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%), corresponding to (1,875 cP; 3.75 cP; 7.5 cP; 15 cP). Using light transmission microscopy as described above, a 60 s baseline was first recorded at 100 Hz in AFW, after which AFW was exchanged for a viscous solution. After settling for five minutes, the nose is recorded again for 60 s. This was repeated until the fish were recorded with all increasing concentrations and a return to baseline AFW. In another set of experiments, light-sheet experiments were performed as described above. A 4 s baseline was first recorded at 500 Hz in AFW, after which AFW was exchanged for increasingly more viscous solutions. After settling for five minutes, the nose is recorded again for 4 s. Data were further analyzed for CBF, using the framework described above, and ciliary waveforms in Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis pipeline for wave direction and wavelength</title><p>Beating cilia interfere with the transmission of light and result in an oscillatory change of light intensity over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanderson and Sleigh, 1981</xref>).

For each pixel, cilia beat frequency (CBF) was calculated as the frequency (between 15 Hz and half the frequency of acquisition) where the absolute value of the Fourier transform was maximal. This resulted in a spatial CBF map. As beating cilia do not cover the entire recording area, we automatically segmented this area into signal and noise pixels, using a threshold for the local standard deviation (SD). In brief, we moved a 3x3 kernel across the entire frequency map and any pixel belonging to a 3x3 kernel whose SD was below 3 Hz was considered as signal, whereas pixels belonging only to kernels with an SD above 3 Hz were considered as noise. To remove small signal regions, we listed all connected pixels in the frequency map using the <italic>bwconncomp</italic>() Matlab function, and removed regions with fewer than 500 pixels. Altogether, with SD-thresholding and by removing small signal regions, we robustly identified those regions of the imaging area with beating cilia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Coherence and coherence-versus-distance calculations</title><p>The coherence score constitutes a normalized cross-power spectral density: for a pair of time series <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), it is defined as<disp-formula id="equ1">,<label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>where</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>C<sub>xy</sub> (f</italic>) is the magnitude-squared coherence score of the two time series <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) as function of frequency <italic>f</italic></p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>P<sub>xy</sub> (f</italic>) is the cross-power spectral density of <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>P<sub>xx</sub> (f</italic>) and <italic>P<sub>yy</sub> (f</italic>) are the power spectral densities of <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>y</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), respectively.</p></list-item></list><p>One may think of <italic>P<sub>xx</sub> (f</italic>) and <italic>P<sub>yy</sub> (f</italic>) as the squared magnitude of the Fourier transforms of <italic>x(t</italic>) and <italic>y(t</italic>), whereas <italic>P<sub>xy</sub> (f)~x*(f) y(f</italic>) is related to the product of the Fourier transforms of <italic>x(t</italic>) and <italic>y(t</italic>).</p><p>We apply the coherence score to the intensity time series <italic>x(t</italic>) and <italic>y(t</italic>) corresponding to a pair of signal pixels. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows an example of input time series and resulting coherence score, see top and bottom panels.</p><p>Specifically, coherence scores were calculated for 30 s long raw recordings (approx. 99–110 frames per second; parameter: Fs) using an adapted version of the Matlab <italic>mscohere</italic>() built-in function.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Aleksandra Walczak as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We take issue with the strong message conveyed by the title – If anything, the study showed that local synchronization of cilia etc is necessary for global metachronal waves – the manuscript does not answer the question of how the waves emerge – there may well be additional mechanisms at play that are not accounted for (indeed the difference between left/right noses strongly hints at some additional mechanisms), so this study merely shows necessity rather than sufficiency. We suggest focusing the title on the system. Whilst the statement in the title (&quot;sufficient&quot;) is true, the fact that biological systems might in general behave like this is unknown… conclusions could depend quite strongly on the liquid medium (e.g. mucus or watery), on the 3d geometry which could lead to different sorts of flow recirculation, on the details of cilia arrangements which might be species dependent, etc.</p><p>2) The title and the abstract heavily assume that readers know what a metachronal wave is… we doubt that all readers will understand the somewhat subtle difference between the direction and coherence in the wave of coordination and the direction of fluid transport. Maybe the abstract should try to be more introductory in this sense.</p><p>3) Page 3, &quot;results&quot;. how big is the nose &quot;cup&quot;? We found ourselves worrying about patterns of fluid recirculation. The scales in the maps are not immediately obvious to a reader who is not an expert on this organism. Could a diagram, illustrating this &quot;cup&quot; together with cells and flows be made early in the manuscript? Are there any possible consequences of the tissue not being flat, and perhaps specifically cup shaped?</p><p>4) Page 3, &quot;results&quot;: numbers are provided with too many significant figures. There's no point giving an error with 3 s.f.</p><p>5) Data analysis: In looking at Figure 2G we wonder is this special of pixel 1? How does it look like from other reference points? Can authors make perhaps 16 of these, with equally spaced 4 by 4 reference points?</p><p>6) Data analysis: Figure 2I: does panel I change at all if authors consider CBF regions with the highest (and lowest) frequencies, i.e. only work with subregions from C?</p><p>7) Caption Figure 2 when discussing sync or no sync in D, say gray-red and gray-blue (you need 2 to sync). How far are these pairs of pixels? illustrate on panel B or C all three positions. In the caption of G', clarify that these are the 3 colors from G.</p><p>8) Page 6 line 23, give range of viscosities achieved, even if rough values. (We see them in SM but should be here).</p><p>9) Page 9. The differences in the left and right nose are really curious. How symmetric are the left and right nose in terms of the various maps (CBF, coherence, etc)? I don't get a clear sense of this from Figure 5… can something more be presented?</p><p>10) Our biggest wish would be to see flow data, on the same experiments… could this be done? Flow visualization is quite easy, especially if tracers can be added e.g. by particle tracking or PIV? As it is, the connection to flow is made, but only by mapping to the simulation model, which has various differences (β, density, fixed waveform, etc). What exactly is the function of motile cilia in the nose? Is flow rate the critical factor, or flow directionality? More discussion would help.</p><p>11) The model shows there is some tolerance to phase noise – how does this noise compare with data? Can the model help explain why wave direction seems to be more stable than wavelength?</p><p>12) The theory predicts that the flow direction is essentially independent of the direction and wavelength of the waves… so why the distinction between the left/right nose? What is the physiological purpose of the two different wave directions?</p><p>Can the authors provide more (i) biological explanations for why this might happen (is there directional transport of some chemical morphogen?), (ii) physical explanations for how an array with identical ciliary orientation can exhibit different wave directions?</p><p>13) Have the authors checked carefully if there are any other differences between left and right noses, e.g. in terms of beat frequency, distribution/density of cilia, 3D beat pattern, cilia length etc? Is manual tracking of cilia shape possible say from light-sheet recordings (figure S3 showed this was at least possible in some cases)?</p><p>14) The viscosity experiments – when viscosity is increased, the improvement in local coherence is not surprising. The increase is coherence was only slight and restricted mainly to ~20um. The results also didn't pick up any changes in the direction or wavelength of the metachronal waves – so what should be the main take-home message from these experiments?</p><p>15) There is some subtlety in the spatial phase mapping technique, e.g. in the segmentation of space into equal-frequency patches, in the treatment of time signals etc – if this technique can be applied successfully to a different system, a more careful discussion of these details and the level of systematic vs real biological noise in the system would be helpful. E.g. What's the optimal choice of patch size? What are the criteria for extracting phases – what is the tolerance in frequency variation across regions? Are 30s recordings ideal for this method?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77701.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We take issue with the strong message conveyed by the title – If anything, the study showed that local synchronization of cilia etc is necessary for global metachronal waves – the manuscript does not answer the question of how the waves emerge – there may well be additional mechanisms at play that are not accounted for (indeed the difference between left/right noses strongly hints at some additional mechanisms), so this study merely shows necessity rather than sufficiency.

To facilitate further discovery, we have made some of the experimental data and our codes available on Mendeley and Github.</p><p>We also agree that additional mechanisms and/or the 3D geometry of the epithelia tissue may affect metachronal coordination.</p><p>Following the suggestions of the reviewers, we have changed to title to <italic>(i)</italic> reflect that is merely a necessity for metachronal waves (while sufficiency is somewhat open), and <italic>(ii)</italic> state our model system; the new title reads:</p><p>“Novel analytical tools reveal that local synchronization of cilia coincides with tissue-scale metachronal waves in zebrafish multiciliated epithelia”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The title and the abstract heavily assume that readers know what a metachronal wave is… we doubt that all readers will understand the somewhat subtle difference between the direction and coherence in the wave of coordination and the direction of fluid transport.

We revised the abstract to make it more accessible to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. We also have rephrased the introduction of metachronal waves in the introduction and results part, using a simpler language. Below is the newly edited abstract.</p><p>“Motile cilia are hair-like cell extensions that beat periodically to generate fluid flow along various epithelial tissues within the body. In dense multiciliated carpets, cilia were shown to exhibit a remarkable coordination of their beat in the form of traveling metachronal waves, a phenomenon which supposedly enhances fluid transport. Yet, how cilia coordinate their regular beat in multiciliated epithelia to move fluids remains insufficiently understood, particularly due to lack of rigorous quantification. We combine experiments, novel analysis tools, and theory to address this knowledge gap. To investigate collective dynamics of cilia, we studied zebrafish multiciliated epithelia in the nose and the brain. We focused mainly on the zebrafish nose, due to its conserved properties with other ciliated tissues and its superior accessibility for non-invasive imaging. We revealed that cilia are synchronized only locally and that the size of local synchronization domains increases with the viscosity of the surrounding medium. Even though synchronization is local only, we observed global patterns of traveling metachronal waves across the zebrafish multiciliated epithelium. Intriguingly, these global wave direction patterns are conserved across individual fish, but different for left and right nose, unveiling a chiral asymmetry of metachronal coordination. To understand the implications of synchronization for fluid pumping, we used a computational model of a regular array of cilia. We found that local metachronal synchronization prevents steric collisions, cilia colliding with each other, and improves fluid pumping in dense cilia carpets, but hardly affects the direction of fluid flow. In conclusion, we show that local synchronization together with tissue- scale cilia alignment coincide and generate metachronal wave patterns in multiciliated epithelia, which enhance their physiological function of fluid pumping.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Page 3, &quot;results&quot;. how big is the nose &quot;cup&quot;? We found ourselves worrying about patterns of fluid recirculation. The scales in the maps are not immediately obvious to a reader who is not an expert on this organism. Could a diagram, illustrating this &quot;cup&quot; together with cells and flows be made early in the manuscript? Are there any possible consequences of the tissue not being flat, and perhaps specifically cup shaped?</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we thank the reviewers for raising our awareness for this point. We have now addressed the comments by revising the figures as described below.</p><p>In Figure 1, we now include a 3D rendering of the zebrafish snout (former Figure S1A) and a zoom-in of the nasal cavity together with scale-bars. These data were obtained from a live animal expressing a fluorescent indicator in all cells; hence the structure is not altered by fixation.</p><p>We have also included a scheme where we drew the location of motile ciliated cells and the fluid flow direction on the 3D rendering of the zebrafish head in Figure 1-supplemental 1 panel A.</p><p>As shown in Figure 1A (and mentioned by the reviewers), the nasal cavity is cup-shaped and not flat. Based on the prior literature, such as (Bouderlique et al., 2022; Ferreira et al., 2018; Nawroth et al., 2017), we expect that the 3D geometry has only a small impact on short-range hydrodynamic interactions and local synchronization but can impact the direction of cilia-generated flows. Besides, we focused most of our analysis on the dorsolateral part of the pit because cells are more homogeneously polarized in the dorsolateral part of the pit as compared to the ventromedial part (Figure 5) and the tissue is flatter in the dorsolateral part. Nevertheless, we added the following sentence to the Discussion section to discuss possible impacts of a non-flat geometry: “This difference in wave directions is not a mere consequence of different patterns of cilia alignment, but instead points at an important role of the chirality of the cilia beat and 3D architecture of the underlying tissue”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Page 3, &quot;results&quot;: numbers are provided with too many significant figures. There's no point giving an error with 3 s.f.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now edited the numbers as suggested by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Data analysis: In looking at Figure 2G we wonder is this special of pixel 1? How does it look like from other reference points? Can authors make perhaps 16 of these, with equally spaced 4 by 4 reference points?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this point up. We have now included a Supplementary Figure (Figure2- Supplement 3), where we systematically look at 16 reference pixels. The 16 pixels were identified from a 4x4 grid without manual selection and represent well the diversity in coherence score that we observed. Also, as expected, pixels in the non-signal region (no beating cilia present), do not synchronize with other pixels in the nose (these reference pixels are represented by circles instead of crosses).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Data analysis: Figure 2I: does panel I change at all if authors consider CBF regions with the highest (and lowest) frequencies, i.e. only work with subregions from C?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestion by the reviewer, we tested how the coherence-versus-distance distribution (Figure 2I) changes when selecting CBF regions according to their frequency (analogous to the example shown in Figure 2BC). Specifically, we selected either</p><p>– The bottom 33.3% of pixels (red) – low frequencies</p><p>– The top 33.3% of pixels (green) – high frequencies</p><p>(Note that selecting CBF regions with either the highest or lowest CBF results in only a small number of data points.)</p><p>We have not seen any obvious difference for this example case (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This observation is consistent with our finding that frequency is largely variable across individuals, but the mean coherence and fraction of synchronized pixel remain similar across individuals. Hence, we conclude that frequencies do not directly correlate with synchronization strength.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Coherence-versus-distance distributions for high and low frequencies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Histogram representing the CBF for all pixels and their segmentation into high and low CBF.

We have not observed any significant differences for median CBF, nose size, nasal cavity size, number of multiciliated cells (MCC) and the directionality of the flow. These data are now included in Figure5 – supplement 3.</p><p>We would like to also highlight that there is a large diversity across individual animals (see figure 2 supplement 1 panel A) and our biggest challenge is that we cannot image from both noses of the same fish due to the positioning of the animal. So all data are obtained from a left or a right nose of a different animal, and hence also include the inter-individual differences, which may mask subtle differences between left and right nose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Our biggest wish would be to see flow data, on the same experiments… could this be done? Flow visualization is quite easy, especially if tracers can be added e.g. by particle tracking or PIV? As it is, the connection to flow is made, but only by mapping to the simulation model, which has various differences (β, density, fixed waveform, etc). What exactly is the function of motile cilia in the nose? Is flow rate the critical factor, or flow directionality? More discussion would help.</p></disp-quote><p>As prompted by the reviewers, we have now performed CBF and flow measurement sequentially on the same animals. These new data are included in Figure 5F-H and Figure 5 – supplement 4. This new data confirmed the difference in wave direction between the left and the right noses, while net flow directions are approximately mirror symmetric. We observed a consistent wave direction for left noses and a larger variance for the right noses while performing these additional experiments (n=9 right and 10 left). We have now added this new set of data in Figure 5 F-H (green colors for wave directions), updated the quantifications and provided all examples in Figure 5 – supplement 1.</p><p>For flow measurement following the CBF measurements, we applied fluorescent beads and measured their movements over a period of 1 minute. We recovered the flow field upon projection of the time series and quantified the direction of the fluid flow at the exit of the nasal cavity, as shown in Figure 5 – supplement 4.</p><p>We would like to emphasize that the flow pattern is rather complex due to the 3D geometry of the nose pit and the complex cilia polarity. Hence, we are not able to measure the fluid flow generated solely by the region showing different wave direction, but only the entire output of the ciliated epithelium.</p><p>We did not observe any significant difference in the fluid flow direction between the left and right nose as indicated in Figure 5F-G. This provides evidence that the net flow generated by the ciliated epithelium remains identical irrespective of the different wave directions in the left and right nose, which is consistent with the predictions of our computational model.</p><p>We had previously published an article on the biological function of cilia-generated fluid flow for olfaction in the zebrafish larvae (Reiten et al., 2017). In this previous work, we showed that flow patterns are important to draw fluid containing odor molecules to the nasal cavity and to expel it afterwards, which improves the temporal resolution of odor detection. So far, we only analyzed the impact of a complete loss of cilia motility, and thus flow, on olfaction, but not yet of only a gradual reduction of flow speed. Notwithstanding, based on our prior work and the literature, we expect that both flow speed and flow direction are important for drawing and expelling odors to the epithelium in an efficient manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The model shows there is some tolerance to phase noise – how does this noise compare with data?</p></disp-quote><p>A direct comparison of phase noise of cilia dynamics in the zebrafish noise and in the computational model is difficult for three reasons, indicated below:</p><p>1.

Wave fronts of metachronal waves are clearly visible, corresponding to a well-defined direction of metachronal waves, whereas relative phase differences between neighboring cilia vary more. We assume that fluctuations in metachronal wave direction would result in hydrodynamic interactions favoring incompatible phase differences between neighboring cilia (and possibly steric collisions in dense carpets). This will in turn attenuate as compared to variations in wavelength, which will arise already from small variations in the relative phase difference between neighboring cilia.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77701-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This qualitative argument thus suggests that wave direction should be more stable than wavelength.

In fact, our own work and that of others showed that three-dimensional, chiral beat patterns of cilia give rise to anisotropic hydrodynamic interactions between neighboring cilia, which select the direction of emergent metachronal waves (Solovev and Friedrich, 2022a). We speculate that subtle differences in the cilia beat pattern between left and right nose could be the cause for the observed differences in metachronal wave direction. We assume that changes in wave direction would result in frustrated hydrodynamic interactions between neighboring cilia (and possibly steric collisions in dense cilia carpets) and are thus less pronounced that variations of wavelength, which result already from small changes in the relative phase difference between neighboring cilia.</p><p>Based on the literature, including our own work, we showed that metachronal wave direction depends on the shape of the beat pattern (Meng et al., 2021; Solovev and Friedrich, 2022b).</p><p>Given that we have not observed any differences between the left and the right nose for the anatomy, CBF and overall flow direction, but only for the metachronal wave direction, it is possible that this difference may reflect an epiphenomenon with no direct biological function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Have the authors checked carefully if there are any other differences between left and right noses, e.g. in terms of beat frequency, distribution/density of cilia, 3D beat pattern, cilia length etc? Is manual tracking of cilia shape possible say from light-sheet recordings (figure S3 showed this was at least possible in some cases)?</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above in point 9, we have not observed any statistically significant difference between cells in the left and in the right noses. It would be wonderful to compare cilia beat waveform from various cells taken from the right and the left nose.

Moreover, individual cells show high level of diversity, which may further mask differences between left and right nose.</p><p>High-precision tracking of cilia waveform is well established only for single cilia and planar beat patterns (Geyer, Howard, and Sartori, 2022), but remains a challenge for three-dimensional beat patterns and cilia in dense cilia carpets.</p><p>We trust that future technological advances will allow high-precision tracking also for individual cilia on multiciliated cells, thus allowing to address these questions in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The viscosity experiments – when viscosity is increased, the improvement in local coherence is not surprising. The increase is coherence was only slight and restricted mainly to ~20um. The results also didn't pick up any changes in the direction or wavelength of the metachronal waves – so what should be the main take-home message from these experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment.</p><p>We manipulated and quantified ciliary synchronization of an in vivo ciliary carpet to experimentally address the impact of viscosity on synchronization. However, we find that changing viscosity does not matter much. The limited increase in synchronization is consistent with predictions from simple theories of hydrodynamically coupled cilia. (The physical reason behind is that a change in fluid viscosity re-scales hydrodynamic forces but does not change the relative magnitude of hydrodynamic interactions.)</p><p>Any effect of viscosity on cilia synchronization should be indirect due to a slight change in cilia beat pattern by the changed viscosity (Brokaw, 1966). Unfortunately, we could not observe these changes directly due to the difficulty of measuring waveforms of individual cilia on multiciliated cells.</p><p>Notably, there are important differences between a ciliated epithelium in zebrafish exposed to high- viscosity fluid, and ciliated epithelium in mammalian airways transporting mucus.

How are frequency maps segmented in space into equal-frequency patches?</p></disp-quote><p>We realized early on that the power spectrum has a higher frequency resolution than necessary (0.1Hz) and that small variations in frequency could represent noise rather than cilia beating at different frequencies.

CBF were identified between 15Hz and half of the frequency of acquisition (Fs = 100Hz; Nyquist (1/2Fs) = 50Hz), based on the Nyquist formula. We used 15Hz as a threshold for the CBF based on the analysis of n=130 fish nasal epithelia (Reiten et al., 2017; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>), which identified 15Hz as the lowest frequency in the nasal multiciliated epithelium.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Histogram showing the average CBF of multiciliated cells in the nose of the zebrafish larvae (n=130 animals).</title><p>From Reiten et al., 2017.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77701-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This value needs to be adapted by future users to the tissue of interest based on their CBF. For instance, a cut-off of 10Hz was used for the ependymal cells of the zebrafish brain based on our earlier work (D'Gama et al., 2021).</p><p>We recognize that by imaging with a frame rate of approximately 100Hz, we miss out on higher frequencies. That is a technical limitation of the setup, which allowed us to image the entire nose rather than few cells with higher frequencies of acquisition. Nevertheless, selected control experiments with higher frequency of acquisition and smaller field of view (data not shown), revealed similar findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How do the subtleties compare in a different system?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed additional experiments on a different multiciliated tissue, i.e., the ependymal cells of the adult zebrafish brain (shown now in Figure 4-supplement 2). We have previously shown that the ependymal tissue is more sparsely populated by ciliated cells as compared to the nasal epithelium (D'Gama et al., 2021; Jeong, Hansen, Wachten, and Jurisch-Yaksi, 2022). Moreover, ciliated cells have different properties with regard to their CBF, apical size and numbers of cilia. Hence, we needed to optimize parameters for this particular tissue and we recommend experimenters to adapt these values for each ciliated system. Similarly, these parameters should be adapted to each acquisition system, and reflect the spatial resolution of the recordings. As a note, the experiments on the zebrafish brain and the new set of experiments on the zebrafish nose including fluid flow measurements were performed on a different microscope with a different camera. Since the results are highly comparable, we argue that our analysis tools are robust and can easily be adapted across recording setups and ciliated tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
