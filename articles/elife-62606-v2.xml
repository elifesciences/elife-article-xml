Neurons release K<sup>+</sup> ions as they repolarize during action potentials. If this K<sup>+</sup> builds up in the extracellular space, it can disrupt neuronal firing and set the stage for neuronal hyperexcitability. Conventional treatments for conditions of hyperexcitability mostly target neuronal channels. However, more than one-third of epilepsy patients suffer from medically intractable seizures, while others experience debilitating side effects as neuron-targeting treatments often interfere with healthy neuronal functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic approaches that improve seizure control. Here, we explore glial mechanisms that regulate K<sup>+</sup> balance to modulate neuronal excitability and seizure sensitivity.</p><p>Glia buffer K<sup>+</sup> stress by taking in excess K<sup>+</sup> ions and osmotically obliged water molecules from the extracellular space. This function allows glia to control the extracellular level of K<sup>+</sup> and thereby modulate neuronal excitability, raising the hope that glia may be targeted to restore K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and suppress hyperexcitability in epilepsy and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hübel and Ullah, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sontheimer, 1994</xref>). Glial-centric therapeutic strategies for these conditions have not been possible, largely due to a lack of understanding of mechanisms controlling the glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering capacity. We previously discovered a signal transduction pathway that controls the glial capacity to buffer K<sup>+</sup> and water in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>). SIK3 (salt inducible kinase 3) is an AMPK family kinase that sequesters histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) in the cytoplasm, thereby promoting myocyte enhancer-factor 2 (Mef2)-dependent expression of K<sup>+</sup> and water transport molecules, including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs of aquaporin-4 and SPAK, a kinase necessary for activating the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter NKCC1. This glial program suppresses extracellular nerve edema and prevents neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, suggesting that it plays an important role in glial maintenance of K<sup>+</sup> and water homeostasis and is required for a healthy level of neuronal activity. This glial program is best characterized in wrapping glia, which ensheathe axons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> peripheral nervous system (PNS) and are akin to vertebrate non-myelinating Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bittern et al., 2020</xref>), and so are well positioned to regulate the ionic composition around PNS axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While we have elucidated downstream effectors by which SIK3 regulates K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering, the upstream signals that work through the SIK3 pathway to control glial buffering capacity are unknown. In other contexts, SIK3 integrates signals from different signal transduction pathways, coupling extracellular signals to changes in cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wein et al., 2018</xref>). One of these pathways is G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-cyclic AMP (cAMP)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, in which PKA directly inhibits SIK3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). A better understanding of upstream signaling mechanisms that regulate the SIK3 pathway and extracellular cues that modulate glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering capacity will inform approaches to leverage this glial function for therapeutic benefits in diseases of hyperexcitability.</p><p>Here, we identify an octopaminergic circuit linking neuronal activity to glial K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering. Octopamine regulates the glial buffering program via GPCR-dependent regulation of PKA, which inhibits SIK3. At baseline, octopamine acts through the inhibitory octopaminergic GPCR OctβR to activate the glial SIK3 pathway to promote K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering and healthy levels of excitability. Under pathological K<sup>+</sup> stress, in contrast, octopamine functions through the stimulatory octopaminergic GPCR OAMB1 to inhibit SIK3 and downregulate the glial capacity to buffer K<sup>+</sup> and water. While loss of the SIK3 pathway leads to extracellular edema, constitutive activation of the pathway results in intracellular glial swelling and activation of stress signaling, suggesting that turning down this pathway protects glia. In <italic>eag shaker</italic>, a classic <italic>Drosophila</italic> hyperexcitable mutant with defective K<sup>+</sup> channels, the SIK3-mediated glial buffering program is turned off, likely as a self-protective mechanism for glia. However, reactivation of this glial K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering program dramatically suppresses neuronal hyperexcitability, seizures, and shortened life span in <italic>eag shaker</italic>. Therefore, the maintenance of a robust glial K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering program in response to extreme neuronal excitability is beneficial to the organism despite the risks posed to glial health. Taken together, this study identifies a neuromodulatory circuit that links neuronal activity to glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering and highlights the promise of a glial-centric therapeutic strategy that restores K<sup>+</sup> and water homeostasis for control of hyperexcitability in diseases such as epilepsy and stroke.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>G-protein/PKA signaling in glia regulates K<sup>+</sup> and water homeostasis</title><p>Glia modulate neuronal excitability by removing K<sup>+</sup> and water from the extracellular space. Our previous work identified SIK3 as a key regulator of glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering that suppresses extracellular fluid accumulation, neuronal hyperexcitability, and seizure sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we sought to identify upstream signaling pathway(s) that regulate SIK3 activity. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> fat body, cAMP-dependent PKA may phosphorylate and inhibit SIK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). We hypothesized that this signaling axis also functions in glia, and that PKA is a negative regulator of SIK3. If so, PKA activation in glia would phenocopy the SIK3 mutant phenotype and cause peripheral nerve extracellular edema which is visualized as discrete swellings, a readout of disrupted ionic and water homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leiserson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>). PKA exists as a tetramer of regulatory and catalytic subunits, in which the catalytic subunits are liberated from the regulatory subunits after cAMP binds. To test if activated PKA inhibits SIK3, we took two complementary approaches. First, we employed the pan-glial driver Repo-GAL4 to overexpress the catalytic subunit PKA-C1. Second, we knocked down the regulatory subunit PKA-R1, which should activate the endogenous catalytic subunit. Both manipulations phenocopied the loss of SIK3 in glia and induced dramatic localized edema in larval peripheral nerves, suggesting that PKA hyperactivity in glia disrupts ionic and water homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Since PKA is often regulated by GPCR-cAMP signaling, we tested if overexpression of constitutively active Gαs also phenocopies SIK3 loss-of-function (LOF) in glia. Indeed, this manipulation recapitulates the characteristic nerve swellings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A G-protein-coupled receptor-protein kinase A (GPCR-PKA) signaling axis regulates salt inducible kinase 3 (SIK3)-mediated glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of larval peripheral nerves stained for the nerve membrane marker HRP.

If so, the induction of these nerve swellings should require HDAC4, the major downstream effector of SIK3 and inhibitor of the SIK3 signaling pathway. Indeed, glial-specific knockdown of HDAC4 fully suppresses the nerve swellings caused by Gαs overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In our previous work, we demonstrated that SIK3 sequesters HDAC4 in the glial cytoplasm, thereby promoting gene expression of a K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we tested the model that Gαs and PKA also regulate HDAC4 localization to maintain glial K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis. We examined HDAC4 localization in glia by co-expressing a nuclear-localized GFP to label glial nuclei and a FLAG-tagged HDAC4 to measure HDAC4 intensity in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We then overexpressed PKA-C1 or Gαs in glia expressing FLAG-tagged HDAC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). In both cases, HDAC4 nuclear localization increases dramatically, resulting in an ~6-fold increase in the nucleo:cytoplasmic HDAC4 ratio. While glial overexpression of FLAG-tagged HDAC4 allows visualization of HDAC4 localization, it also causes HDAC4 hyperactivity in glia and induces nerve swellings. Consistent with the re-localization of HDAC4 into the nucleus induced by expression of Gαs and PKA-C1, these manipulations further increase the number of nerve swellings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Since Gα-cAMP-PKA signaling is usually regulated by GPCRs, we conclude that a GPCR signaling pathway likely controls SIK3 activity to regulate K<sup>+</sup> and water homeostasis. Next, we sought to identify the ligand/receptor pair that regulates this glial K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Octopamine signaling is required for K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering by glia</title><p>Studies of adipocytes have revealed a role for β-adrenergic signaling in cAMP-dependent regulation of SIK3 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berggreen et al., 2012</xref>). Norepinephrine is a stress hormone that suppresses seizures in several mammalian models of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mason and Corcoran, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szot et al., 1999</xref>). The fly equivalent, octopamine, is a neuromodulator that regulates stress responses such as aggression and starvation resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Suo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we hypothesize that octopamine controls the glial capacity to buffer K<sup>+</sup> stress in the nervous system. First, we tested whether octopamine is required for SIK3-mediated K<sup>+</sup> buffering. Octopamine synthesis occurs in a well-defined small subset of neurons, in which tyrosine is processed into tyramine and subsequently into octopamine. This two-step process is catalyzed by tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (tdc2) and tyramine beta-hydroxylase (tβh), respectively. Vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) then package octopamine into secretory vesicles for later release. To test whether glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering is disrupted in mutants deprived of octopamine, we examined HDAC4 localization in glia expressing FLAG-tagged HDAC4, which provides a simple ON/OFF readout for the K<sup>+</sup> buffering program. HDAC4 nuclear localization increases dramatically in octopamine synthesis mutants, <italic>tdc2<sup>R054</sup></italic> and <italic>tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic>, suggesting that SIK3 is inhibited and so cannot sequester HDAC4 in the cytoplasm. These mutations also enhance the nerve swellings caused by HDAC4 hyperactivity in this glial background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We observed similar results in dVMAT mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Simon et al., 2009</xref>), which cannot load octopamine into secretory vesicles and thereby have a defect in octopamine release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Next, we tested the hypothesis that octopamine signals through GPCR-cAMP-PKA signaling for this function. If so, octopamine regulation of HDAC4 localization should depend on PKA activity. Indeed, glial knockdown of PKA-C1 potently reverts HDAC4 nuclear localization in <italic>tdc2<sup>R054</sup></italic> mutants, pointing to PKA hyperactivity as the cause of HDAC4 mislocalization in octopamine synthesis mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Octopamine is required to activate salt inducible kinase 3 (SIK3)-regulated K<sup>+</sup> buffering program in glia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of peripheral nerves showing aberrant HDAC4 localization in octopamine synthesis and transport mutants.

We hypothesize that this function is specific to octopamine and that octopamine acts directly on glia to regulate the SIK3 pathway. To test this model, we developed an ex vivo preparation to test if exogenous octopamine is sufficient to bypass the requirement for endogenous octopamine for the regulation of HDAC4 localization. In <italic>tdc2<sup>R054</sup></italic> mutants, which cannot synthesize either tyramine or octopamine, HDAC4 accumulates in the nucleus. We dissected third-instar larvae and treated the larval fillet for 2 min with physiological saline or saline containing 30 mg/ml octopamine hydrochloride or tyramine hydrochloride and assessed HDAC4 localization in glial nuclei. <italic>tdc2<sup>R054</sup></italic> mutants treated with control or tyramine-containing saline exhibit pronounced HDAC4 nuclear localization with a high nucleo:cytoplasmic HDAC4 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). In contrast, 2 min exposure to octopamine induces rapid re-localization of HDAC4 to the cytosol. Hence, octopamine is sufficient to activate the SIK3 signaling pathway in glia, and the rapid time course strongly suggests that octopamine is acting directly on the glia.</p><p>If octopamine signals directly to glia, then there must be an octopamine receptor that mediates octopamine activation of glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering. Among the octopamine receptors that have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, OAMB, Octβ1R, Octβ2R, and Octβ3R can signal through cAMP as a second messenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">El-Kholy et al., 2015</xref>). Since octopamine is necessary for SIK3 signaling while PKA inhibits SIK3 signaling, we postulated that the relevant GPCR is coupled to an inhibitory Gα protein that normally suppresses PKA activity. Loss of this receptor from glia would result in PKA hyperactivity, inhibition of SIK3, and disrupted glial K<sup>+</sup> and water homeostasis. We performed RNAi-mediated knockdown of each candidate from above selectively in glia using Repo-GAL4 and assessed peripheral nerve morphology. From this screen, RNAi-mediated glial knockdown of Octβ1R results in the characteristic localized nerve edema phenotype that resembles SIK3 LOF mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Moreover, glial knockdown of either PKA-C1 or HDAC4 potently suppresses nerve swellings in larvae deprived of Octβ1R in glia. These findings strongly support the model that octopamine functions through Octβ1R to inhibit PKA, thereby de-repressing SIK3 to sequester HDAC4 in the cytoplasm and promote proper K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering. Having demonstrated that octopamine normally activates the glial K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering program, we next investigated the impact of elevated octopamine on the glial SIK3 pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Excess octopamine inhibits the glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering program</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, octopamine can activate distinct receptors that are localized in the same cell yet have antagonistic functions, potentially allowing for differential responses to low and high levels of octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koon and Budnik, 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that octopamine could have dual actions on glia to exert bidirectional control over K<sup>+</sup> buffering. We have demonstrated that octopamine functions through the inhibitory GPCR Octβ1R to activate SIK3 signaling and upregulate glial K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). If octopamine indeed has dual effects on glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering, then octopamine acting through a stimulatory GPCR would enhance PKA activity in glia and thereby inhibit SIK3 signaling. As a first test of this model, we asked whether chronic treatment with elevated levels of octopamine can disrupt glial regulation of K<sup>+</sup> and water homeostasis. We increased octopamine levels by raising third instar larvae on a diet supplemented with octopamine hydrochloride or tyramine hydrochloride and examined peripheral nerve morphology. Wild-type larvae raised on a control diet do not develop swellings in their peripheral nerves (0 out of &gt;100 larvae) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A high tyramine diet also does not impact larval nerve morphology. However, a high octopamine diet increases the susceptibility of wild-type larvae to nerve edema, with ~70% of larvae developing swellings in peripheral nerves. Hence, high levels of octopamine disrupt the larval ability to maintain ionic and water homeostasis. These nerve swellings can be suppressed by enhancing the glial SIK3 signaling pathway, as PKA-C1 knockdown and HDAC4 knockdown selectively in glia both significantly reduce the frequency of nerve swellings in larvae raised on a high octopamine diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The suppression by PKA-C1 knockdown demonstrates that the effect of exogenous octopamine works through active PKA, supporting the model that high levels of octopamine work through a stimulatory GPCR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Excess octopamine inhibits salt inducible kinase 3 (SIK3) signaling to downregulate glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Frequency of occurrence of nerve swellings in high octopamine-fed larvae with glial expression of LexA RNAi (<italic>Repo&gt;</italic>), PKA-C1 RNAi, or HDAC4 RNAi.

If exogenous octopamine downregulates the glial capacity to buffer K<sup>+</sup> by inhibiting SIK3, then this would lead to nuclear accumulation of HDAC4. Indeed, a high octopamine diet dramatically increases HDAC4 nuclear localization in glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). This regulation of HDAC4 localization by octopamine depends on PKA activity, as glial knockdown of PKA-C1 completely abolishes octopamine-induced nuclear shuttling of HDAC4. We previously demonstrated that in the PNS this SIK3/HDAC4 pathway primarily regulates ion buffering in wrapping glia, the glial subtype that directly ensheathes the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>). To assess whether octopamine regulation can occur in wrapping glia, we expressed FLAG-tagged HDAC4 under control of Nrv2-Gal4, which expresses exclusively in wrapping glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun et al., 1999</xref>). With a high octopamine diet, HDAC4 in wrapping glia is present at much lower levels in the cytoplasm leading to a high nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio of HDAC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, octopamine can inhibit the SIK3 pathway in the wrapping glia that primarily mediate ionic buffering around peripheral axons.</p><p>Having demonstrated that high levels of octopamine enhances PKA activity to inhibit SIK3 pathway in glia, we next searched for the relevant stimulatory GPCR in glia. OAMB is an octopamine receptor coupled to a Gαs protein that activates adenylyl cyclase to increase cAMP-PKA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Glial knockdown of OAMB potently blocks HDAC4 nuclear localization in larvae raised on a high octopamine diet, demonstrating that high levels of octopamine act directly on glia through OAMB to inhibit the SIK3 pathway and turn down glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering. Hence, octopamine can bidirectionally regulate the glial capacity to buffer K<sup>+</sup> and water, and this differential effect works through distinct octopamine receptors and may depend on variations in the level of octopamine release.</p><p>Like its mammalian counterpart norepinephrine, octopamine is normally maintained at a low level and released as a stress signal during bouts of high neuronal activity or in response to high K<sup>+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Orchard and Lange, 1987</xref>). Here, we postulated that octopamine links neuronal activity to glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering, and that octopamine release correlates with the level of K<sup>+</sup> stress. If the effect of K<sup>+</sup> stress is mediated by octopamine signaling, then high K<sup>+</sup> stress should induce the same effects as high levels of octopamine and modulate HDAC4 localization in wild-type glia. To test this model, we raised larvae on a diet supplemented with 200 mM KCl and examined HDAC4 localization in their glia expressing FLAG-tagged HDAC4. Indeed, a high K<sup>+</sup> diet mimics a high octopamine diet and dramatically increases HDAC4 accumulation in the glial nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This regulation of HDAC4 localization is potently suppressed by glial knockdown of the octopamine receptor OAMB, demonstrating that sustained K<sup>+</sup> stress requires octopamine signaling to alter SIK3 pathway activity. Since K<sup>+</sup> stress is correlated with the level of neuronal excitability, these findings suggest that sustained changes in neuronal excitability function through differential octopamine release to bidirectionally modulate glial K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering capacity, likely by acting through receptors with antagonistic functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Glia with enhanced K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering capacity undergo cellular swelling</title><p>Having demonstrated a seemingly counterintuitive relationship between high K<sup>+</sup> stress and reduced glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering capacity, we next explored the significance of this downregulation.

To test this idea, we assessed consequences of a constitutively active glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering program. We independently knocked down two components that each would enhance SIK3 signaling in glia: (1) OAMB, the octopamine receptor that enhances PKA activity to inhibit SIK3 signaling, and (2) HDAC4, the central negative regulator of SIK3 signaling. First, we hypothesized that glia with enhanced K<sup>+</sup> buffering capacity would undergo cellular swelling as a result of taking in an excess load of K<sup>+</sup> ions and water molecules. <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse mutants with glial swelling exhibit an increase in nerve width along the entire length of their peripheral nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Byun and Delpire, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rusan et al., 2014</xref>). This is in contrast to the localized extracellular edema caused by SIK3 LOF in glia, which occurs in discrete locations along the nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we raised larvae on control diet or a diet supplemented with 200 mM KCl and examined peripheral nerve morphology. Glial knockdown of OAMB results in a ‘non-localized’ nerve edema phenotype in both larvae raised on control diet and those on a high K<sup>+</sup> diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). As expected, this edema phenotype is dramatically different than the extracellular nerve swellings in SIK3 mutants, as it occurs uniformly along the entire nerve. HDAC4 LOF in glia induces a similar edema phenotype, but only when larvae were provided with K<sup>+</sup> stress by being raised on a high K<sup>+</sup> diet. To directly test if this phenotype reflects edema inside the glia, we knocked down OAMB or HDAC4 in glia labeled with cytoplasmic RFP. Thin optical sections of nerves with OAMB or HDAC4 knockdown in glia revealed a large increase in intracellular glial cytoplasm that is indicative of increased glial volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This is in direct contrast to the appearance of the large extracellular swellings caused by glial loss of SIK3, which appear as large unstained regions surrounded by glial cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results support our hypothesis that a constitutively active K<sup>+</sup> buffering program causes excess uptake of ions and osmotically obliged water and results in glial cellular swelling.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Glia with enhanced K<sup>+</sup> buffering capacity undergo swelling and stress responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of HRP-stained peripheral nerves demonstrating ‘non-localized’ edema in larvae with glial expression of LexA RNAi (<italic>Repo&gt;</italic>), OAMB RNAi, or HDAC4 RNAi.

Taken together, we conclude that constitutive activation of the SIK3 K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering program causes intracellular glial swelling and activates a molecular stress response pathway.

To test this idea, we performed glial-specific RNAi-mediated knockdown of HDAC4 to enhance SIK3-mediated glial K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering in the <italic>eag,Sh</italic> mutant. We observed dramatic suppression of a series of <italic>eag,Sh</italic> phenotypes. First, <italic>eag Sh</italic> mutants exhibit down-turned wings, a phenotype commonly observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> hyperexcitability mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This morphological abnormality is suppressed by glial knockdown of HDAC4. In fact, inhibition of glial HDAC4 in these mutants results in an upheld wing phenotype, which occurs in mutants with muscle hypercontraction as a result of altered neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Montana and Littleton, 2004</xref>). Next, we tested if HDAC4 inhibition suppresses neuronal hyperexcitability in the <italic>eag,Sh</italic> mutant at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In this system, the peripheral nerve is severed such that motor axons do not receive input from their cell bodies and so do not fire action potentials without exogenous nerve stimulation. When recording from postsynaptic muscles of wild-type larvae, only miniature excitatory junction potentials (mEJPs) generated by the spontaneous release of single vesicles are detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, <italic>eag,Sh</italic> displays not only mEJPs, but also much larger evoked junction potentials (EJPs) that result from the spontaneous firing of axons.

They also have much longer seizures, which last for up to a minute while in control flies seizing behavior lasts only a few seconds. Glial-specific inhibition of HDAC4 dramatically suppresses the seizure behavior of <italic>eag,Sh</italic> mutants, reducing the incidence of seizure by ~80% and seizure duration to a few seconds.

Here, we uncovered upstream regulatory mechanisms controlling the SIK3 pathway and demonstrated that activation of this glial program can dramatically ameliorate the pathological consequences of neuronal hyperexcitabiltiy. An octopaminergic circuit couples neuronal activity to glia buffering, exerting a dual effect on SIK3-mediated K<sup>+</sup> buffering: low levels of octopamine enhance the glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering capacity, while high levels of octopamine inhibit this buffering program, likely to protect glia against extreme K<sup>+</sup> stress. Glial-specific inhibition of HDAC4, a central repressor of SIK3 signaling, results in a constitutively active glial buffering program that dramatically suppresses seizure and extends life span in a classic epilepsy model. Hence, augmenting glial K<sup>+</sup> and water buffering holds promise as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of seizures.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Glial SIK3 signaling controls cell volume regulation</title><p>The glial SIK3/HDAC4/Mef2 pathway regulates expression of both fray/SPAK, a kinase controlling ion transporter activity, and aquaporin 4, a water channel essential for volume regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Leiserson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Papadopoulos et al., 2004</xref>). Our original analysis of SIK3 LOF mutants demonstrated that glial SIK3 inhibits extracellular edema, presumably by promoting the uptake of ions and water into glial cells. This is an essential activity of glia, since accumulation of K<sup>+</sup> in the extracellular space around axons leads to hyperexcitability and heightened seizure susceptibility. Since peripheral nerves must continuously fire, this raised the question of why expression of fray and aquaporin 4 would be regulated by SIK3, which is best understood to integrate opposing signals such as feeding and fasting to control the levels of downstream transcriptional targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). If ion and water buffering were so essential, then why is expression of essential buffering proteins not constitutive? Our findings suggest that the downregulating glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering capacity is a protective response that prevents pathological glial swelling. Activity-dependent glial swelling is a commonly observed physiological phenomenon, but when taking in an excess load of ions and water, glia may swell to the point of cytolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">MacVicar et al., 2002</xref>). We have shown that glia with enhanced K<sup>+</sup> buffering capacity undergo cell swelling that is exacerbated by extreme K<sup>+</sup> stress. These glia also exhibit enhanced JNK pathway activity, which responds to a variety of stressors, including mechanical stress caused by cell stretching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pereira et al., 2011</xref>). JNK plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis, suggesting that pathological swelling that results from enhanced K<sup>+</sup> buffering could promote cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhanasekaran and Reddy, 2008</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that overactivity of glial SIK3 activity leads to intracellular edema while underactivity of glial SIK3 signaling leads to extracellular edema. Hence, SIK3 balances the need for robust extracellular buffering with the health of the glial cell. We suggest that the ability of the SIK3 pathway to integrate disparate upstream signals is important for maintaining this balance between an extracellular milieu conducive to neuronal firing with intracellular volume regulation that maintains glial health.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dual actions of octopamine in controlling glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering</title><p>Norepinephrine is a stress hormone that can exert anticonvulsant effects in the mammalian nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szot et al., 1999</xref>).

Here, we propose a model in which octopamine release links activity-dependent K<sup>+</sup> stress to glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering. This model is supported by a number of key findings. First, octopamine is required for SIK3 signaling and this regulation occurs through the inhibitory octopaminergic GPCR Octβ1R. Second, elevated levels of either octopamine or K<sup>+</sup> each inhibit the glial SIK3 pathway, and both of these effects require the stimulatory octopaminergic GPCR OAMB. Hence, elevated K<sup>+</sup> works through octopaminergic signaling to regulate the SIK3 pathway and glial buffering. Finally, the glial SIK3 pathway is inhibited in the hyperexcitable <italic>eag,Sh</italic> mutant. We propose that basal levels of octopamine promote SIK3-dependent glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering to cope with physiological K<sup>+</sup> stress and maintain a healthy level of neuronal activity. When neurons become hyperexcitable, as would occur under pathological conditions, levels of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> rise and more octopamine is released. High levels of octopamine will inhibit SIK3 activity and turn down glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering, likely to protect glia from pathological cell swelling.</p><p>This model posits that different levels of octopamine differentially activate Octβ1R and OAMB to exert these dual effects on glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering. Octβ1R couples to the inhibitory Gαi protein, whereas OAMB can function through the excitatory Gαs protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koon and Budnik, 2012</xref>). How might octopamine differentially signal through both Octβ1R and OAMB when they bind to the same ligand, reside in the same cell, and have antagonistic functions? Potentially, Octβ1R and OAMB could have different binding affinities for octopamine, with Octβ1R having a higher affinity such that Octβ1R is preferentially activated at low levels of octopamine. Inhibitory Gαi-coupled Octβ1R would decrease cAMP levels and inhibit PKA activity, thereby relieving the inhibition on SIK3 to upregulate glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering capacity. Conversely, octopamine would bind to the lower affinity OAMB when octopamine levels are high, as would occur during hyperexcitability. High levels of octopamine signaling through the excitatory Gαs-coupled OAMB would enhance PKA activity and downregulate the glial capacity to buffer K<sup>+</sup> stress. Hence, different binding affinities would allow Octβ1R and OAMB to be activated by different octopamine concentrations. A similar differential regulation via opposing octopaminergic receptors residing in the same cell is described at the larval NMJ, where octopamine signals through inhibitory Octβ1R and excitatory Octβ2R to bidirectionally control synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Koon and Budnik, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We have defined an octopaminergic circuit that links neuronal activity to glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering to maintain K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis and neuronal excitability. Neuromodulators such as octopamine are useful for integrating synaptic activity over time and space rather than signaling rapidly and locally like classical neurotransmitters. Moreover, altering the glial transcriptional response will be reasonably slow to change physiological function since such changes require transcription and translation. Hence, this system is likely tuned to respond to average neuronal activity rather than to transient changes in neuronal firing. This pathway may work in concert with additional mechanisms for rapid tuning of glial ion transporter function as described in mammalian astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellot-Saez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>This model for octopaminergic regulation of the glial SIK3-dependent ionic buffering program leaves open a number of important questions. First, is the octopamine released locally or does release from the central octopaminergic neurons diffuse widely to set the glial tone for ionic buffering? Second, while we showed that a glial octopamine receptor is necessary for pathway modulation by octopamine, it would also be interesting to test whether direct activation of octopaminergic neurons is sufficient to regulate the glial SIK3 pathway. Similarly, is direct inhibition of octopaminergic neurons capable of rescuing the whole animal phenotypes of the <italic>eag, Sh</italic> mutants? Third, while we have focused on octopaminergic regulation, in other systems the SIK3 pathway is regulated by additional upstream signals including the kinase Lkb1 and the insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). Input from these additional pathways would allow for regulation of glial ion and water buffering in locations that may not be accessible for octopaminergic neuromodulation. Finally, we have focused our analysis on peripheral nerves and peripheral glia. In future studies it will be important to assess the role of this SIK3 buffering program in the cortex glia that buffer ions around neuronal cell bodies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Enhancing glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering can dramatically suppress neuronal hyperexcitability</title><p>With hyperexcitability, waves of action potentials can lead to increases in extracellular K<sup>+</sup> that, if not properly buffered, will lead to neuronal depolarization and further hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kofuji and Newman, 2004</xref>). We explored the role of glial buffering in a paradigmatic <italic>Drosophila</italic> seizure mutant, <italic>eag,Sh</italic>, that exhibits dramatic neuronal hyperexcitability, seizure behaviors, and shortened life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fergestad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ganetzky and Wu, 1983</xref>). Although we would expect <italic>eag,Sh</italic> larvae to have an increased need for glial buffering, we found that the glial SIK3 signaling pathway is downregulated, likely as part of the glial protective response described above. Since downregulating the glial SIK3 pathway is sufficient to cause hyperexcitability and seizures, we tested whether this inhibition of SIK3 could be exacerbating the <italic>eag,Sh</italic> phenotypes. HDAC4 is the key repressor of SIK3-regulated glial K<sup>+</sup> buffering, and so we activated SIK3 signaling by glial knockdown of HDAC4. Reactivation of the glial buffering program dramatically suppressed neuronal hyperexcitability, seizures, and shortened life span in <italic>eag,Sh</italic>. This result is quite remarkable, since the neurons are still deficient for two extremely important K<sup>+</sup> channels. Nonetheless, the pathological consequences for the organism are almost wholly mitigated by enhanced glial buffering. This highlights the potential of glial-centric therapeutic strategies for diseases of hyperexcitability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks and genetics</title><p>Fly stocks were maintained at room temperature using standard techniques.

Their peripheral nerves were imaged using 40×/1.15 NA oil immersion objective on the confocal microscope and other equipment mentioned above. Images were acquired under identical settings and shown as maximal Z-projections of confocal stacks. Fluorescence intensity of FLAG-tagged HDAC4 was analyzed using Image J (1.52 k, National Institute of Health). The method used to quantify HDAC4 localization in glial nuclei and cytosol was described in a previous study. In brief, we used the GFP channel to generate a nuclear mask and applied this mask to the FLAG channel to selectively measure HDAC4 levels in glial nuclei. To assess HDAC4 levels in glial cytoplasm, FLAG signals in the ‘non-nuclei’ areas were also analyzed by subtracting the mask from total area of the peripheral nerve. For wrapping glia, we used the Repo channel to generate a nuclear mask and applied this to the FLAG signals in the ‘non-nuclei’ areas marked by HRP. The nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio of HDAC4 intensity was then calculated using these two measurements.

glia, in response to K<sup>+</sup> stress.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Graeme Davis as Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: J Troy Littleton (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Li and colleagues describes a very nice follow-up analysis to the DiAntonio lab's original discovery of SIK3 AMPK control of a HDAC4-dependent transcriptional program for K<sup>+</sup> buffering capacity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wrapping glia. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has been used as a model system to study molecular functions of glia for over two decades. While there are clear differences with vertebrate glia, the similarities appear meaningful and powerful for the discovery of conserved functional principles. In general, glial control of excitability has been a bit of a vague area of research, and precise mechanisms have been difficult to pin down. The work here and in the authors' previous paper does a good job in implicating specific signaling systems in the response. Overall, all of the reviewers are very positive about the work and congratulate the authors for their nice study. There was consensus among the reviewers regarding a few major comments that should be address, listed below. revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear in the title, or even in the Abstract that the model system being used is <italic>Drosophila</italic>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> is mentioned once in the Abstract with respect to the hyperexcitability model, but not for the rest.

It seems essential for the authors to define the glial sub-type specific requirements for a number of reasons.

Unfortunately, we could not determine which glia subtypes (such as wrapping glia) express which receptors, because our marker for wrapping glia is also a Gal4 driver (Nrv2-Gal4). Since we could not identify the glia subtypes we did not include these data in the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
