Cells must sense and respond to nutrients in their environment, and specialized cells must synthesize metabolic products required for their function. Pluripotent stem cells have the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of specialized cells. How metabolic state contributes to stem cell differentiation is not understood. In this study, we show that RNA-binding by the stem cell translation regulator Musashi-1 (MSI1) is allosterically inhibited by 18–22 carbon ω-9 monounsaturated fatty acids. The fatty acid binds to the N-terminal RNA Recognition Motif (RRM) and induces a conformational change that prevents RNA association. Musashi proteins are critical for development of the brain, blood, and epithelium. We identify stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 as a MSI1 target, revealing a feedback loop between ω-9 fatty acid biosynthesis and MSI1 activity. We propose that other RRM proteins could act as metabolite sensors to couple gene expression changes to physiological state.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02848.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02848.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02848.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When an embryo is developing, stem cells must divide and develop into many specialized types of cells. However, if cell division doesn't stop, or if it restarts later in life, it can cause tumors to form.</p><p>Musashi-1 is a protein that binds to molecules of RNA and helps to promote cell growth during development: mice that lack this protein have serious brain defects and die shortly after birth. Musashi-1 is usually turned off in adult cells that are not dividing. Sometimes, however, it remains active and contributes to the growth of cancers in the brain and the gut. Reducing Musashi-1 levels in colon tumors slows their growth and causes the cancer cells to die.</p><p>To find a compound that would switch off Musashi-1, Clingman et al. screened more than 30,000 compounds and identified four inhibitors. One of these was oleic acid, a fatty acid that is found in olive oil and other animal and plant oils. Oleic acid interacts with Musashi-1 in a way that changes the shape of the protein. These changes mean that Musashi-1 is no longer able to regulate the genes that control cell proliferation.</p><p>Clingman et al. also found that Musashi-1 promotes the activity of a particular enzyme that makes fatty acids; molecules that are needed in large quantities when cells are dividing. Musashi-1 appears to act as a ‘nutrient sensor’, turning down the activity of this enzyme in cells when levels of oleic acid are high, and turning up enzyme activity when oleic acid levels are low. The findings of Clingman et al. further reveal how our diets can affect gene expression, and may aid the development of new treatments against cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02848.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02848.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocyte</kwd><kwd>post-transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM081422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryder</surname><given-names>Sean P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM098643</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryder</surname><given-names>Sean P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM098763</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Massi</surname><given-names>Francesca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The RNA-binding protein MSI1, which is required for stem cell and cancer cell proliferation in the brain and epithelial tissues, also directly senses the concentration of long non-esterified omega-9 fatty acids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The RNA-binding protein Musashi-1 (MSI1) is expressed in stem and progenitor cells of neural and epithelial lineage. In the central nervous system, MSI1 is expressed in astrocytes and committed glial and neural progenitor cells, but not in mature neurons and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kaneko et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dobson et al., 2008</xref>). In histological studies of neural and epithelial tissues, MSI1 is routinely used as a marker for stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>). Analysis in mice and primary cells shows that MSI1 regulates neural development. <italic>Msi1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> knockout mice are uncoordinated, ataxic, develop hydrocephaly, and die within 1–2 months after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sakakibara et al., 2002</xref>). Their brains are small, contain an expansion of early lineage progenitor cells, and display fewer mature cell types than normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sakakibara et al., 2002</xref>). Embryonic neurospheres cultured from <italic>Msi1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mouse brains have a reduced capacity to differentiate into mature neurons and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sakakibara et al., 2002</xref>). In primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, MSI1 promotes progenitor cell survival and prevents differentiation into mature oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dobson et al., 2008</xref>). The phenotype and expression pattern reveal that MSI1 plays an early role in regulating neurogenesis and gliogenesis.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02848.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MSI1 is inhibited by monounsaturated fatty acids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pattern of MSI1 (blue) in the CNS.

In vitro SELEX experiments identified a series of aptamer sequences that bind to MSI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Imai et al., 2001</xref>). Visual inspection identified a consensus sequence (G/A)U<sub>1–3</sub>AGU that was present in most but not all of the aptamers.

The crisis phase of myeloid leukemia is marked by low NUMB expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ito et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of MSI2 restores NUMB expression and impairs the blast crisis phase of myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ito et al., 2010</xref>).

First, we tested the ability of a purified, his6-tagged MSI1 dual RRM construct (amino acids 7–192, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to bind a fragment of a previously identified SELEX aptamer (CCCR005) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Imai et al., 2001</xref>) using two quantitative assays: fluorescence electrophoretic mobility shift (F–EMSA) and fluorescence polarization (FP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pagano et al., 2011</xref>).

The weakest inhibitor was the Chembridge compound 7409829 (K<sub>i, app, FP</sub> = 15 ± 2.8 µM, K<sub>i, app, F–EMSA</sub> = 54 ± 22 µM). The most potent inhibitor was aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA, K<sub>i, app, FP</sub> = 230 ± 30 nM, K<sub>i, app, F–EMSA</sub> = 1.55 ± 0.14 µM), a compound that readily polymerizes in aqueous solution to form a polyanion. This compound has been identified in many high throughput small molecule assays as a non-specific inhibitor of protein–nucleic acid interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lam et al., 1995</xref>). The next inhibitor was GW7647, a PPARα agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger and Moller, 2002</xref>). PPARα is a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated by long chain unsaturated fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gottlicher et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bocos et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Forman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kliewer et al., 1997</xref>). The K<sub>i, app</sub> for this compound was 6.5 ± 0.4 µM by FP and 21 ± 0.8 µM by F–EMSA. The final inhibitor was oleic acid, an eighteen-carbon monounsaturated fatty acid with one double bond located nine carbons from the aliphatic—omega—end of the molecule (18:1, ω-9). The apparent K<sub>i</sub> of this compound was 1.2 ± 0.4 µM by FP and 1.4 ± 0.7 µM by F–EMSA, and we observed decreased affinity for the RNA aptamer with increasing concentrations of oleic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The K<sub>i, app</sub> is approximately two orders of magnitude below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) in our equilibration buffer (pH 8.0) as measured by N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (CMC ≥ 75 ± 8 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Oleic acid has been screened in 754 bioassays reported in the PubChem database. Of these, oleic acid scored as positive in 4% of the assays. It should be noted that this figure overestimates the hit rate because it includes multiple bioassays that target the same protein. For example, oleic acid scored as a positive in eleven bioassays targeting fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) and seven assays that target membrane-associated potassium channels. Both are known to be sensitive to fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Capaldi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boland and Drzewiecki, 2008</xref>). Other proteins responsive to oleic acid include fatty acid synthase, estrogen synthase, factor VIIa complex, and enterotoxin. It also scored positive in a screen for membrane permeant biomolecules. In total, only 14 unique proteins are responsive to oleic acid. This suggests that oleic acid inhibition is specific.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MSI1 is specifically inhibited by 18–22 carbon ω-9 monounsaturated fatty acids</title><p>Oleic acid is the most abundant fatty acid in body fat and is produced by mature oligodendrocytes during myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Martinez and Mougan, 1998</xref>). Cells can produce almost any fatty acid by modifying existing fatty acids through precise metabolic pathways. Because oleic acid is structurally related to a large number of fatty acids, we obtained a library of fatty acids and analogs to assess the specificity of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). First, we measured inhibition by longer omega-9 monounsaturated fatty acids using the FP and F–EMSA dose response assays. Eicosenoic acid (20:1, ω-9) inhibited MSI1 with a potency similar to oleic acid (K<sub>i, app, FP</sub> = 1.2 ± 0.4 µM, K<sub>i, app, F–EMSA</sub> = 1.7 ± 0.6 µM). Erucic acid (22:1, ω-9) was a stronger inhibitor (K<sub>i, app, FP</sub> = 640 ± 150 nM, K<sub>i, app, F–EMSA</sub> = 820 ± 30 nM), and nervonic acid (24:1, ω-9) inhibited more weakly (K<sub>i, app, FP</sub> = 47 ± 25 µM, K<sub>i, app, F–EMSA</sub> = 23 ± 8 µM). Second, we assessed truncations and modifications of the aliphatic end of the fatty acid. Removing two carbons (palmitoleic acid, 16:1, ω-7) had a moderate effect on inhibition (K<sub>i, app, FP</sub> = 5.3 ± 0.5 µM, K<sub>i, app, F–EMSA</sub> = 12 ± 0.9 µM). The presence of a hydroxyl group at carbon 12 (ricinoleic acid, 12-hydroxy-oleic acid) had a stronger effect; inhibition is barely detectable by FP and reduced 15-fold in F–EMSA measurements (K<sub>i, app, F–EMSA</sub> = 18 ± 9). Third, we assessed esterification or other modification of the carboxylate group. Oleamide, ethyl oleate, and 4-methylumbelliferyl oleate failed to inhibit RNA-binding. In contrast, the presence of a Coenzyme A (CoA) substituent was apparently tolerated, although we noted some deacylation of acyl-CoA stocks by thin layer chromatography. Fourth, we assessed the requirement for the ω-9 double bond. Stearic (18:0), palmitic (16:0), and myristic (14:0) acids failed to inhibit MSI1 RNA-binding activity, indicating that the ω-9 double bond is required. Surprisingly, the orientation of the double bond is also critical. Elaidic acid (18:1, ω-9 <italic>trans</italic>) has the same molecular weight as oleic acid, and nearly identical refractive index and molar aqueous solubility (∼10 mM at pH 8.0), but its ω-9 double bond is <italic>trans</italic> rather than <italic>cis</italic>. Elaidic acid did not inhibit MSI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Linoleic (18:2, ω-9, ω-6) and arachidonic (20:4, ω-12, ω-9, ω-6, ω-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids also inhibit MSI1, but with a weaker apparent inhibition constant (Linoleic acid: K<sub>i, app, FP</sub> = 2.2 ± 0.2 µM, K<sub>i, app, F–EMSA</sub> = 1.2 ± 0.03 µM; Arachidonic acid: K<sub>i, app, FP</sub> = 3.0 ± 0.2 µM, K<sub>i, app, F–EMSA</sub> = 1.1 ± 0.3 µM). We conclude that omega-9 <italic>cis</italic> unsaturated fatty acids between 18 and 22 carbons specifically inhibit MSI1 RNA-binding activity and identify erucic acid as the most potent inhibitor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). MSI2 was inhibited with similar specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Oleic acid directly interacts with the RRM1 of MSI1 to effect inhibition</title><p>In principle, inhibitory fatty acids could inhibit by interacting with either MSI1 or its RNA target. We hypothesized that if the fatty acid bound to the RNA-binding domain of MSI1, the interaction might alter the local environment of its single tryptophan (W29), leading to a change in the intrinsic fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vivian and Callis, 2001</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we titrated oleic acid or elaidic acid (trans-oleic acid) into recombinant MSI1 protein or an n-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide (NATA) control and measured tryptophan fluorescence. Titration of oleic acid, but not elaidic acid, strongly quenched tryptophan fluorescence and altered the emission intensity curve shape from 300 to 400 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

We fit the emission at 350 nm to a quadratic, bimolecular association model in order to determine the apparent dissociation constant.

In RRM domain proteins, the beta sheet surface typically forms the RNA-binding platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kielkopf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clery et al., 2008</xref>). In the RNA-bound structure, several conserved amino acids located on the beta sheet surface and loops make sequence-specific contacts to the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ohyama et al., 2011</xref>). Notably, W29 directly contacts RNA by stacking on the first purine nucleotide. Our data reveal that fatty acid binding causes W29 fluorescence quenching, suggesting that binding changes the environment surrounding this amino acid. As such, fatty acid binding may inhibit MSI1 RNA-binding by an allosteric mechanism.</p><p>To assess whether oleic acid association induces a change in MSI1 secondary structure, we collected circular dichroism spectra as a function of fatty acid treatment. We observe a decrease in mean residue ellipticity centered around wavelength 220 nm upon treatment with oleic acid but not elaidic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To determine whether the spectral changes correspond to a change in oligomerization state, we performed velocity sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Demeler et al., 2011</xref>). We observe no significant change in the velocity sedimentation profile of MSI1 by van Holde-Weischet analysis after adding either oleic acid or elaidic acid, and the predominant species remains monomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Demeler and van Holde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Demeler et al., 2011</xref>). We conclude that oleic acid binding alters the secondary structure of MSI1, but this transition does not appear to induce aggregation at concentrations below the CMC.</p><p>After examining the published NMR structures, we were intrigued to note a hydrophobic cavity on the alpha-helical surface of RRM1, opposite the RNA-binding surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and adjacent to W29 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nagata et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Miyanoiri et al., 2003</xref>). MSI1 RRM2 does not have this feature. We hypothesized that this cavity comprises the fatty acid binding site. To test this idea, we first asked whether RRM1 is sufficient for ω-9 fatty acid inhibition. We purified his6-tagged MSI1 RRM1 (amino acids 7-103) and used FP and F–EMSA to determine whether RRM1 is sufficient for both RNA binding and inhibition by oleic acid. RRM1 bound to the aptamer RNA with an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of 75.2 ± 10 nM by FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Addition of oleic acid but not elaidic acid inhibits RNA-binding activity with similar K<sub>i, app</sub> compared to the full RNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Thus, RRM1 is sufficient for RNA recognition and fatty acid inhibition.</p><p>Next, we prepared an <sup>15</sup>N labeled sample of RRM1 for NMR spectroscopy, collected an <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectrum, and titrated aptamer RNA to identify amide proton chemical shift differences associated with RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The majority of the chemical shift differences map to the β-sheet surface and the loops, which is typical for RRM proteins. Notably, backbone amide protons corresponding to F23, G64, and F65, display large chemical shift changes upon RNA binding. In contrast, chemical shifts changes on the α helical face are small. The data are consistent with the model where the β-sheet surface recognizes RNA, and that binding involves a structural transition including F23, G64, and F65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ohyama et al., 2011</xref>). Next, we titrated oleic acid or elaidic acid into the sample of MSI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). We expected to observe chemical shift changes associated with oleic acid binding to the protein. The addition of increasing amounts of oleic acid did not result in significant changes in chemical shifts but in considerable reduction of the peak intensities and in line broadening. The largest loss of signal upon addition of substoichiometric concentrations of oleic acid was observed for W29, Q30, L36, C49, L50, R53, S60, G62, V74, T89, and K98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). The observed loss of signal is likely due to chemical exchange between the free and bound state. As expected, we detected a strong loss in signal intensity across the entire protein when the concentration of oleic acid exceeded the CMC (75 ± 8 µM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). The observed general loss of MSI1 signal is probably due to precipitation of the protein–oleic acid complex, or it could be attributed to the interaction of MSI1 with oleic acid micelles, or both. We note that a precipitant forms in the NMR tube at elevated oleic acid concentration. Because the CMC of oleic acid is below the concentration needed to make a saturated MSI1 sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we cannot form sufficient MSI1-oleic acid complex for NMR structural studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A model of the omega-9 fatty acid inhibition mechanism</title><p>Because the high concentrations needed for NMR spectroscopic studies precluded direct measurement of the MSI1 fatty acid interface, we performed computational docking calculations with eicosenoic acid or oleic acid with MSI1 RRM1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Friesner et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">2006</xref>).

The docked model explains the specificity of inhibition. Amide and ester derivatives lose the negative charge and cannot form charge–charge interactions with arginine (oleamide, ethyl oleate). Shorter omega-7 fatty acids will not fill the hole (palmitoleic acid). Modifications of the omega end limit insertion into the hole (ricinoleic acid). 18 carbons enable the carboxylate to reach R53 (oleic acid), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). 24 carbons position the group beyond the arginine (nervonic acid). Trans orientation of the double bond limits surface contact and prevents orientation of the carboxylate towards R53 (elaidic acid). Finally, saturation of the double bond would require a large entropic penalty in order to adopt the necessary conformation (stearic acid).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02848.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Model of RRM1 bound to oleic acid (yellow) calculated by Schrödinger GLIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Friesner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Friesner et al., 2006</xref>).

Each of the four simulations was equilibrated for 1 ns and data were collected during a subsequent 30 ns trajectory. Upon oleic acid binding, MSI1 underwent a transition to a more open state characterized by an increase in solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and radius of gyration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Direct visualization of the structure's time evolution showed that binding of oleic acid is associated with stabilization of the C-terminus of α-helix 1, fraying of α-helix 2 at both the N- and C-termini and, in one trajectory, formation of an additional β-sheet in loop 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Oleic acid binding stabilizes β-strand formation in loop 5 and alters its position relative to helix 1. The distance between the C-terminus of α-helix 1 and loop 5 in the free and oleic acid-bound state is greater than that observed in the RNA-bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The presence of oleic acid blocks loop 5 from approaching the C-terminus of α-helix 1. When loop 5 is in the more open conformation, K88 is not in position to interact with the first purine nucleotide of the consensus, in this case Gua1. In addition, binding of oleic acid causes W29 to stack against the side chain of Q30. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This observation is in agreement with the NMR signal intensity loss observed for certain residues during oleic acid titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>), as well as the strong quenching of MSI1 tryptophan fluorescence measured upon addition of oleic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). W29 directly stacks with the first RNA nucleotide, stabilizing the interaction between MSI1 and RNA. Stacking is eliminated in the presence of oleic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Finally, strand 4 is more flexible in the oleic acid-bound state than in free MSI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>). Strand 4 contains several residues that directly contact RNA. The simulations suggest that oleic acid weakens these interactions. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, we do not observe a dramatic change in the dynamics of F65 in the presence of oleic acid over the time course of the simulations.</p><p>The circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement1E</xref>) are consistent with a net gain in secondary structure upon oleic acid binding, as predicted by the MD simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, the change in tryptophan fluorescence observed upon oleic acid but not elaidic acid treatment is consistent with the changes in tryptophan solvent exposure observed in the simulation.</p><p>To test features of the model, we mutated residues predicted to interact with oleic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and measured the relative inhibition constant (K<sub>rel,</sub> <sub>app</sub>) by dose response FP. We observed no change in fatty acid inhibition when Q30 was mutated to a glutamate (K<sub>rel, app</sub> = 0.9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutation of H83 to leucine also had no effect on fatty acid inhibition. Mutation of H83 to phenylalanine reduced inhibition by almost twofold. H83 lines the hydrophobic pocket. Mutation of this residue to phenylalanine is predicted to make the pocket narrower. Mutation of G64 to alanine reduced inhibition by 3.1-fold. G64 forms the floor of the hydrophobic pocket, mutation to an alanine is expected to make the pocket more shallow. Mutation of G35 to aspartate and glutamate results in a twofold and sevenfold reduction of inhibition, respectively. This is possibly due to the addition of a negative charge near the mouth of the hydrophobic cavity.</p><p>To test whether the R53 and/or R61, which are predicted to interact with the carboxylate end of oleic acid, are important for inhibition, we made single glutamate mutations at each position (R53E or R61E). Oleic acid inhibition of the R53E mutant is reduced threefold, while R61E is reduced fivefold. Mutating both arginines (R53E/R61E) increases this effect to 35-fold. This indicates that R53 and R61 are both important for inhibition, and act in a partially redundant way. A triple mutant (R53E/R59E/R61E) weakens inhibition by a similar amount (27-fold). The R53E mutant has a small effect on RNA-binding, while the R61E mutant has a strong 18-fold effect. The interaction of R61 with oleic acid would preclude its interaction with RNA, and thus may contribute to the mechanism of inhibition.</p><p>Together, the MD simulations and experimental data are consistent with an allosteric model of inhibition, wherein fatty acid binding induces a change in conformation that modifies the secondary structure of RRM1 and perturbs the position of amino acids required for RNA recognition. Additional work will be necessary to determine whether fatty acid inhibition works via the mechanism suggested by the computational docking and MD simulations or through an alternative mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Oleic acid treatment reduces oligodendrocyte progenitor cell proliferation</title><p>To study the role of fatty acids in regulating MSI1 in a cell culture model, we investigated the effect of treating the immortalized rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cell line CG-4 with oleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Louis et al., 1992</xref>). CG-4 cells maintain normal precursor cell morphology, can be readily transfected, and can be induced to differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes by withdrawal of growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Louis et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Franklin et al., 1995</xref>). Mature oligodendrocytes produce myelin, a lipid-rich membrane structure that insulates neuronal axons to both protect them and to aid in saltatory impulse conductance throughout the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Griffiths et al., 1998</xref>). The lipid and fatty acid profiles of mature oligodendrocyte-rich white matter differ from that of the grey matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5–figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Martinez and Mougan, 1998</xref>). CG-4 cells also shift lipid profiles upon differentiation, as detected by quantitative lipidomics mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). As with primary OPCs, MSI1 is expressed strongly in the precursor state but decreases upon differentiation (OPCs: 1.0 ± 0.3, oligodendrocytes: 0.15 ± 0.01, p-value=0.0035). Treatment of CG-4 OPCs with oleic acid strongly inhibited the rate of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), matching the published phenotype of MSI1 knock down in primary OPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dobson et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, treating HEK293T cells—which do not express MSI1—with the same concentration of oleic acid had little or no effect on the rate of proliferation. Treatment with stearic acid, which does not inhibit MSI1, had no effect on proliferation rate in either cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We used FP and F–EMSA assays to test the ability of recombinant MSI1 to bind each of seven putative consensus sites present in the <italic>Scd1</italic> 3′-UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). MSI1 binds to all seven sites by FP and F–EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Site 2 and site 7 bind to MSI1 with comparable affinity to the selected aptamer. The slightly decreased binding affinity measured for these 7 fragments is likely due to the fact that our aptamer CCCR005 contains two MSI1 binding sites, while each <italic>Scd1</italic> 3′-UTR fragment contains only a single MSI1 binding site.

This indicates that SCD activity is upregulated in the presence of MSI1. Together, our binding data, co-immunoprecipitation, western blots, and lipidomics profiling results show that stearoyl-CoA desaturase expression is increased in the presence of MSI1, possibly through direct association with consensus motifs in the 3′-UTR of SCD transcripts. We note that of 2107 annotated 3′ UTRs for genes involved with lipid, cholesterol, fatty acid biosynthesis, and SREBP activity, 1275 contain at least one MSI1 binding element. While the presence of a binding element does not confer regulation, MSI1 regulation of lipid metabolism may be more complex than simple direct regulation of SCD. Indeed, a survey of 64 genes that associate with MSI1 in a RIP-ChIP experiment reveals that 8 are annotated to be involved with lipid metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Sousa Abreu et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data reveal that the long chain ω-9 fatty acids oleic acids between 18 and 22 carbons in length are allosteric inhibitors of MSI1 RNA binding activity. Our data also show that SCD, the enzyme that catalyzes the ω-9 desaturation, is a MSI1 regulatory target. The results are consistent with a model where MSI1 controls cellular proliferation through a feedback loop that includes SCD and its enzymatic products, such as oleic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02848.019</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of SCD regulation by MSI1, and subsequent downstream consequences of SCD activity changes.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02848.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02848.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02848-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Oleic acid is the precursor for synthesis of longer chain fatty acids such as eicosanoic, erucic, and nervonic acid, signaling molecules such as arachidonic acid, endocannabinoids, and prostaglandins, and membrane phospholipids. Oleic acid is abundant in the lipid-rich myelin membranes produced by mature oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Martinez and Mougan, 1998</xref>), and CG-4 OPCs show global changes in the lipid profile upon differentiation. OPCs express MSI1, but mature myelinating oligodendrocytes do not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dobson et al., 2008</xref>). In the oligodendrocyte lineage, oleic acid, and MSI1 levels are anti-correlated, which suggests a possible biological role for MSI1 inhibition by fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Martinez and Mougan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dobson et al., 2008</xref>). Another MSI1 inhibitor identified in our screen was the PPARα agonist GW7647. PPARs are nuclear hormone receptor proteins that regulate cellular processes including fatty acid metabolism, differentiation, cell cycling, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger and Moller, 2002</xref>). PPARγ agonists accelerate oligodendrocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Nuccio et al., 2011</xref>). Both GW7647 and oleic acid function as PPAR agonists, and both inhibit MSI1 RNA-binding activity, suggesting that MSI1 and PPARs possibly regulate gene expression in a reciprocal fashion.</p><p>We have identified the metabolic enzyme SCD as regulatory target of MSI1. The two human isoforms of SCD, SCD1 and SCD5, catalyze the conversion of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) into monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beiraghi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Minville-Walz et al., 2010</xref>). MUFAs are then used in the synthesis of numerous lipids, including phospholipids, di- and triacylglycerols, cholesterol esters, and signaling molecules such as eicosanoids. SCD is therefore an essential enzyme to normal cellular proliferation, metabolism, and signaling. It is also possible that MSI1 may be regulating other factors involved in lipid, fatty acid, and cholesterol metabolism. The Penalva group identified 64 putative MSI1 targets using a RIP-ChIP analysis in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Sousa Abreu et al., 2009</xref>). Of these putative targets, eight are annotated to play a role in lipid, fatty acid, or cholesterol metabolic processes. These include three variants of the fatty acid elongase ELOVL5, two variants of the glycolipid biosynthetic factor PIGF, two variants of Lamin B receptor (LBR), and aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (AASDHPPT).</p><p>SCD has been implicated in a number of disease states, including obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cancer. Obese and diabetic animals produce abnormally high levels of TAGs and cholesterol esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coleman and Lee, 2004</xref>). These energy storage molecules are also elevated in a hyperlipidemia mouse model that overexpresses SCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attie et al., 2002</xref>). Conversely, SCD1 knockout mice display impaired biosythesis of both TAGs and cholesterol esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Miyazaki et al., 2000</xref>). SCD is upregulated in tumor cells, including colonic and esophageal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li et al., 1994</xref>). Cancerous cells use newly synthesized lipids primarily for phospholipid production, which are used in new membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Swinnen et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, new evidence suggests that SCD1 activates the oncogenic Akt and AMPK signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Scaglia and Igal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Scaglia et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>SCD regulates SFA and MUFA homeostasis, and therefore plays an integral role in lipid signaling pathways. SFAs serve as proinflammatory factors by acting as ligands for immune receptors such as those in the Toll-like receptor family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>). MUFA products of SCD are further modified to become polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, which are converted into eicosanoids by cyclooxygenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">James et al., 2000</xref>). Eicosanoids serve as proinflammatory and immune signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Recent data also link SCD to Wnt signaling through mediation of the palmitic/palmitoleic acid conversion, as active Wnt proteins require conjugation of palmitoleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rios-Esteves and Resh, 2013</xref>). The balance between SFAs and MUFAs must be tightly controlled, and while SCD is not the only enzyme involved in the process, it does serve as an essential gatekeeper in the conversion of dietary SFA to MUFA.</p><p>Several examples of functional interactions between transcription factors and fatty acids have been published. For example, fatty acids associate with membrane-bound sterol responsive element binding protein (SREBP) to inhibit a cleavage event that produces the activated form of SREBP, a transcription factor involved in lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wang et al., 1994</xref>). Free fatty acids have been shown to stimulate proinflammatory cytokine expression while decreasing anti-inflammatory cytokine expression in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradley et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, treatment of various tumor lines with oleic acid results in transcriptional inhibition of the Her-2/<italic>neu</italic> (<italic>erb</italic>B-2) oncogene through PEA3, although the precise mechanism of regulation remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Menendez et al., 2006</xref>). In yeast cells, fatty acids bind oleate-activated transcription factors (OAFs) to effect transcription of genes responsible for fatty acid metabolism, glucose metabolism, stress response, and other related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gurvitz and Rottensteiner, 2006</xref>). Although numerous transcription factors are regulated by fatty acids, to our knowledge, MSI1 is the first example of a fatty acid-responsive RNA binding protein.</p><p>Integration of metabolite sensing and post-transcriptional regulation is widespread in bacteria, but relatively few examples have been found in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Winkler and Breaker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Roth and Breaker, 2009</xref>). Riboswitches regulate gene expression at the RNA level in response to intermediary metabolites. Small molecule metabolites bind mRNA transcripts, usually in the 5′ UTR, to induce a structural change that interferes with the transcriptional or translational machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Winkler and Breaker, 2005</xref>). In bacteria, riboswitches sensitive to a number of metabolites have been characterized, including guanine, adenine, coenzyme B12, glycine, lysine, and thyamine pyrophosphate (TPP), among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grundy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mandal et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sudarsan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vitreschak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mandal and Breaker, 2004</xref>).

A survey of RRM structures in the protein data bank reveals several with a surface cavity on the alpha helical face, which may comprise metabolite-binding pockets.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Douglas Black (Reviewing editor).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors identify an allosteric inhibitor of an RNA binding protein that allows inducible control of gene expression at the RNA level. This protein, Musashi, is an important regulator of translation during development and had not previously been suspected to have such properties. The authors show inhibition of RNA binding by a specific subset of fatty acids (18-22 carbon ω-9 monounsaturated fatty acids). They propose that the lipids bind to the first of two RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains in Musashi-1. They further identify stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), which produces non-dietary oleic acid, as an mRNA target of Musashi-1, indicating a feedback regulatory mechanism. This is perhaps the first example of RNA binding protein regulation by a small molecule ligand, similar to the many examples of transcriptional regulators, such as the nuclear hormone receptors, that are regulated by small ligands. The biochemistry is carefully done. However, many of the interpretations rest on structural modeling and some initial lipidomics in cell culture, and there are several experiments that would solidify their conclusions.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>1) The proposed binding site for oleic acid on Musashi RRM1 is supported almost exclusively from model building – in part because the concentration of fatty acid needed to solve the structure of the bound complex by NMR was not achievable. It would strengthen their conclusions considerably if they could test some of the predictions from modeling by mutagenesis. Can they eliminate the binding of oleic acid with precise point mutations? Would these mutants exhibit constitutive RNA binding in vitro and in cells? There are 2 possible arginines on the surface (R53 and R61) that are candidates for interaction with the fatty acid. Also, RRM2 lacks the fatty acid binding hole, so what fills the space? Could that information be used to engineer RRM1, so that it won't bind to oleic acid?</p><p>2) The authors introduce the CG-4 cells as a physiologically relevant context for MSI regulation. But they then primarily use the HEK system. Is there a technical reason for not using CG-4 cells? This would allow knockdown of MSI and assessment of oleic acid response, changes in SCD1 expression and changes in lipids in the absence of MSI.</p><p>3) The lipidomic data show extensive changes in lipid metabolism in response to MSI1. It seems likely that some of these may be due to direct or indirect effects on other regulators of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, in addition to SCD1. The authors should at least comment on this. For example, are there changes in SREBP proteins?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02848.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The proposed binding site for oleic acid on Musashi RRM1 is supported almost exclusively from model building – in part because the concentration of fatty acid needed to solve the structure of the bound complex by NMR was not achievable</italic>. <italic>It would strengthen their conclusions considerably if they could test some of the predictions from modeling by mutagenesis.

The results of the suggested experiments are consistent with our previous hypothesis and strengthen the manuscript considerably. They are presented in the Results section of the manuscript and in Figure 4–figure supplement 2. In short, mutations that make the hydrophobic pocket smaller weaken fatty acid inhibition. Mutation of a glycine at the top of the channel to a charged amino acid also reduces fatty acid inhibition. Mutation of R53 or R61 reduces fatty acid inhibition as well, and mutation of both at the same time has a large effect on inhibition. These data support our model, in which the hydrophobic cavity and one of two basic arginine residues on the flexible loop comprise the fatty acid binding site.</p><p><italic>2) The authors introduce the CG-4 cells as a physiologically relevant context for MSI regulation. But they then primarily use the HEK system. Is there a technical reason for not using CG-4 cells? This would allow knockdown of MSI and assessment of oleic acid response, changes in SCD1 expression and changes in lipids in the absence of MSI</italic>.</p><p>There are two primary technical reasons that prohibit use of CG-4 cells in our</p><p>SCD assays. First, it has been shown that MSI1 knockdown halts proliferation and induces apoptosis in primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dobson et al., 2008</xref>). We have confirmed this result in rat CG-4 oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Second, we attempted to blot for SCD from CG-4 cells, but were unable to detect SCD protein using commercially available antibodies. This is likely because CG-4 cells are a rat cell line, and there is no robust SCD antibody available that targets rat SCD. We have edited the manuscript accordingly to clarify our rationale for using HEK cells in these experiments.</p><p><italic>3) The lipidomic data show extensive changes in lipid metabolism in response to MSI1. It seems likely that some of these may be due to direct or indirect effects on other regulators of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, in addition to SCD1</italic>. <italic>The authors should at least comment on this. For example, are there changes in SREBP proteins?</italic></p><p>This is a good point, and we agree that indirect effects on lipid metabolism via deregulation of other MSI1 targets are a distinct possibility. To address this, we looked at all genes annotated to be involved with lipid, cholesterol, fatty acid biosynthesis, and SREBP activity. This list includes genes involved in biosynthesis, metabolism, positive and negative regulation, or simply known lipid/fatty acid binding factors. There were 2107 such genes with annotated 3’ UTRs in the human genome. Of these, 1275 contained at least one MSI1 binding site in its 3’ UTR. Eight of these have been shown to associate with MSI1 in published RIP-CHIP data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Sousa Abreau et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We have added these results to the manuscript. We have also modified our discussion to include the possibility of indirect regulation and/or more MSI1 targets in these pathways.</p></body></sub-article></article>
