to inform and update local processing. Yet it remains elusive how global signals like reward and punishment are represented in local cortical computations. Previously, we identified a cortical neuron type, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, in auditory cortex that is recruited by behavioral reinforcers and mediates disinhibitory control by inhibiting other inhibitory neurons. As the same disinhibitory cortical circuit is present virtually throughout cortex, we wondered whether VIP neurons are likewise recruited by reinforcers throughout cortex. We monitored VIP neural activity in dozens of cortical regions using three-dimensional random access two-photon microscopy and fiber photometry while mice learned an auditory discrimination task. We found that reward and punishment during initial learning produce rapid, cortex-wide activation of most VIP interneurons. This global recruitment mode showed variations in temporal dynamics in individual neurons and across areas. Neither the weak sensory tuning of VIP interneurons in visual cortex nor their arousal state modulation was fully predictive of reinforcer responses. We suggest that the global response mode of cortical VIP interneurons supports a cell-type-specific circuit mechanism by which organism-level information about reinforcers regulates local circuit processing and plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>neocortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neocortex contains a number of functionally distinct areas such as the visual, frontal, and motor (Mtr) cortical regions, each specializing in different roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>). Classical studies have established that the specialization of each region is reflected in their neural responses; for instance, neurons in the visual cortex respond to information about the visual world, while neurons in the Mtr cortex inform about actions. There is an additional layer of mechanisms known to modulate these cortical responses, spanning from the broad effects of arousal to the location-specific impact of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, there is also a growing body of evidence suggesting that each area can represent non-classical features such as reward timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Monk et al., 2020</xref>) and category representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goltstein et al., 2021</xref>) in visual cortex, visual stimuli and motor modulation in the auditory cortex (ACx; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>) and beyond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). Here we pursued a similarly unexpected response pattern based on our previous observation that ACx VIP interneurons respond not only to auditory stimuli but also to reward and punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) expression demarcates a small interneuron subpopulation (15–20%) located mostly in the upper layers of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Staiger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonchar et al., 2007</xref>). Previous studies have identified a cortical circuit motif controlled by VIP interneurons that preferentially inhibit other interneurons and thereby disinhibit principal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>). In this circuit, VIP interneurons mainly inhibit somatostatin interneurons, which tend to exert an inhibitory drive on the dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gentet et al., 2012</xref>). Such disinhibition could lead to the selective amplification of local processing and serve the important computational functions of gating and gain modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, one proposed role for VIP interneurons is to gate the integration and the plasticity of the synaptic inputs onto pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Letzkus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Williams and Holtmaat, 2019</xref>). The same stereotyped connectivity was found in functionally and cytoarchitectonically different regions of the brain, across the auditory, prefrontal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>), visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>), and somatosensory (SS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gasselin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) cortices, as well as in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krabbe et al., 2019</xref>) and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Francavilla et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tyan et al., 2014</xref>). However, it is not known whether VIP interneurons have similarly stereotyped functional roles across cortical regions.</p><p>VIP interneurons have been shown to have a multiplicity of roles in sensory processing, arousal modulation, learning, and plasticity. First, studies in the primary sensory regions – barrel cortex, ACx, and visual cortex – have demonstrated that tactile, auditory, and visual stimuli drive VIP neuron activity in diverse ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ibrahim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mesik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sachidhanandam et al., 2016</xref>). However, the sensory tuning of VIP neurons tends to be weak compared to that of principal neurons. Second, VIP interneuron activity is highly correlated with the changes in pupil dilation and locomotion, suggesting a role in modulating cortical processing across arousal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dipoppa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), while other reports show that locomotion modulates sensory processing independently from VIP activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yavorska and Wehr, 2021</xref>). Finally, optogenetic or pharmacogenetic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donato et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kamigaki and Dan, 2017</xref>) of VIP interneurons, as well as their developmental dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batista-Brito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2015</xref>) impairs learning and plasticity in sensory discrimination and memory-guided tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batista-Brito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kamigaki and Dan, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We sought to investigate common rules that recruit VIP interneurons. Our starting point was the observation that auditory cortical VIP neurons respond not only to auditory stimuli but also to reward and punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>). VIP cells have been reported to respond to reward in hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and to foot shock in amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krabbe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Turi et al., 2019</xref>). Those later observations fit the function of these areas in learning and plasticity. In contrast, such activity was not observed in the SS and visual cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Khan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sachidhanandam et al., 2016</xref>) calling into question the existence of a global reinforcement-related VIP interneuron recruitment mode. To address this, we set up to systematically record VIP interneurons across the whole dorsal cortex during an auditory decision task. To allow simultaneous monitoring of large number of VIP interneurons across a variety of cortical regions, we used three-dimensional (3D) acousto-optical (AO) two-photon microscopy, providing both a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and high temporal resolution across large volumes. To gain access to deeper lying cortical regions like mPFC and ACx, we used fiber photometry and measured the population activity of VIP interneurons. We show that most VIP interneurons across cortex are indeed robustly activated by reward and/or punishment, and regional- and task-related behavioral factors contribute to shape their response profile differently. This global mode of recruitment of VIP interneurons is distinct from known arousal modulation of their activity and separate from the local response mode of VIP interneurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Auditory discrimination task for mice</title><p>To probe the behavioral function of VIP interneurons, we trained head-fixed mice (n=22) on a simple auditory discrimination task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each trial began with the delivery of a 0.5 s auditory stimulus, and mice were trained to lick (go trials) or withhold licking (no-go trials) based on the tone identity. Successful licking after tone delivery during go trials was rewarded with water (Hit trials), while the absence of licking was not rewarded (Miss trials). Licking for no-go trials triggered a mild air-puff punishment (false alarm [FA]), which was omitted if the animal successfully withheld licking (correct rejection [CR]). Mice learned this task over 3 ± 0.6 (mean ± SD) sessions after introducing the no-go tone, reaching a performance level of 80% (percentage of correct responses, Hit or CR).

Because of their sparse cortical distribution, electrophysiological methods combined with optogenetics-assisted identification are less suitable for cortex-wide recordings of VIP interneurons. To overcome this challenge, we used random access, 3D AO two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Katona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nadella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Szalay et al., 2016</xref>). This method allows to restrict the measurement time solely to the regions of interest (ROIs). Additionally, two-photon fluorescence excitation results in high imaging penetration required for in vivo imaging while also delivering high spatial resolution, therefore limiting neuropil contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yildirim et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we used 3D chessboard scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Szalay et al., 2016</xref>) that generates small patches encompassing each neuron soma.

Overall, chessboard scanning produces an additional ~170-fold increase in measurement speed and ~15-fold increase in SNR, compared to a high-speed resonant mirror-based system scanning the same volume (Table S1).

This approach allowed us to simultaneously measure bulk calcium-dependent signals from VIP interneurons located in the right mPFC and left ACx by implanting two 400-µm optical fibers at these locations (n=6 sessions from n=6 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with our previous electrophysiological results in ACx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>) and two-photon imaging from dorsal cortical regions, calcium-related signals from VIP interneurons in the ACx and mPFC were increased after reward and punishment delivery (in ACx: Hit = 4.8 ± 0.32%, FA = 10.9 ± 0.03%; in mPFC: Hit = 4.3 ± 0.69%, FA = 6.6 ± 0.85%, ΔF/F peaks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We did not further analyze the FA responses in ACx as those responses also had a sensory component reflecting the white noise-like sound created by the air puff delivery. Because the cue delivery could prove as a confound to measure reward-mediated responses from VIP interneurons in ACx (see also methods), we also delivered random rewards in separate sessions. Water drop delivery recruited VIP interneurons in both ACx and mPFC in a similar fashion to water delivery during the discrimination task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Like our single-cell results, the PV-expressing interneuron population in ACx did not show any significant change in activity upon similar random reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Concurrent recordings of VIP interneuron populations in ACx and mPFC revealed heterogeneity in the dynamics of VIP interneuron activity during reward delivery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). VIP interneurons in the ACx showed phasic response to reward (peak time for Hit = 0.06 ± 0.036 s, decay time constant = 2.7 s). In contrast, medial prefrontal VIP interneurons were slowly activated (peak time for Hit = 3.08 ± 0.968 s, decay time constant = 7.75 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These population recordings confirmed the dominant contribution of reinforcement-related signals to VIP interneuron population responses and also revealed potential area-specific heterogeneity in the dynamics of VIP interneuron activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Heterogeneity in the dynamics of reinforcer-related activity of individual VIP interneurons</title><p>The difference in dynamics at the population level across different brain areas might be supported by heterogeneity in the individual response profiles of VIP interneurons. Thus, we sought to characterize the dynamics of VIP interneurons at a single-cell resolution and across dorsal cortex using chessboard 3D AO recordings. We first focused on VIP interneurons activated upon reward delivery during the sensory discrimination task (n=606 cells). We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to the average reward responses of individual neurons to reward. We then clustered these responses using k-means clustering. This approach did not readily separate neurons according to the recording sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Rather, our clustering approach allowed us to delineate five functional groups of VIP interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Based on visual inspection of their mean temporal profiles, we labeled these groups as: ‘fast’ (n=109), ‘delayed’ (n=88), ‘sustained’ (n=177), ‘biphasic’ (n=120), and ‘slow’ (n=112). Note that all of these response types share important similarities such as a phasic reward response and mostly differ in their subsequent temporal dynamics. We first considered the distribution of these five types of neuronal responses across different brain areas. We observed an overrepresentation of the ‘fast’ group in parietal cortex and of the ‘slow’ group in primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The ‘fast’ group was absent from visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). To quantify this heterogeneity across cortical areas, we defined five feature vectors as the mean response profile of each cluster to rewards and then projected the reward response of each VIP interneuron onto these features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We found that the projection associated with the ‘fast’ group was significantly higher for VIP interneurons located in parietal compared to those recorded in visual cortex (mean Δ<sub>Pta-V1</sub>=3.22, Mann-Whitney test, p=3.77 10<sup>–9</sup>), while the opposite was observed for the projection associated with the ‘slow’ group (mean Δ<sub>Pta-V1</sub>=−7.79, p=3.77 10<sup>–9</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Finally, we took advantage of the 3D AO imaging to investigate the heterogeneity in the responses of VIP interneurons located at different depth of the cortex. We were able to detect some differences in the amplitude of the average responses for reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <italic>F</italic>=9.5, p=0.002). However, we did not observe any differences in the distribution of the different clusters across depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <italic>F</italic>=1.16, p=0.36).</p><p>The groups delineated by the PCA-based cluster analysis possibly represent distinct subtypes with variable genetic and connectivity patterns. We addressed subtype diversity by measuring the diameter (full width at half maximum [FWHM]) of the somata and found bimodal distributions both at the level of individual mice (7/8 mice) and also the entire population examined (R<sup>2</sup>=97.7%, <italic>F</italic>=206.4, p&lt;0.001, n=8 mice n=439 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This separation might reflect distinct VIP subtypes categorized based on the expression of calretinin and cholecystokinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Staiger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1997</xref>). In contrast, the soma diameter of the responsive and non-responsive neurons was similar (Hit: 10.0 ± 0.1 vs 9.9 ± 0.1 µm, p=0.39, FA: 10.3 ± 0.2 vs 9.8 ± 0.1 µm, p=0.07, Mann-Whitney test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). We next considered whether there are differences across functional groups identified using PCA-based clustering. VIP-fast and VIP-sustained groups had somewhat larger cell bodies (fast: 10.2 ± 0.4 µm, delayed: 9.8 ± 0.2 µm, sustained: 10.4 ± 0.2 µm, biphasic: 10.0 ± 0.2 µm, slow: 9.4 ± 0.2 µm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>), further supporting the possibility that some of the identified functional VIP groups correspond to distinct genetic VIP interneuron subtypes.</p><p>The differences in average response dynamics from individual neurons could also arise from differential variability across trials. To evaluate this potential heterogeneity in the single-trial dynamics of VIP interneuron activity, we used tensor component analysis (TCA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). TCA allowed us to further characterize the trial identity-dependent dynamics of VIP interneuron activity. All recorded neurons from different sessions/cortical regions were grouped by keeping only the first 10 trials of each trial types (see Methods for additional information). After preprocessing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), we used non-negative tensor decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolda and Bader, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2018</xref>) and focused our analysis on rank 3 TCA as using higher rank showed signs of overfitting and did not improve the reconstruction error (22% for rank 3 vs 18% for rank 20). We found a latent temporal component that robustly separated Hit and FA trials from Miss and CR trials (second component, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, mean<sub>Miss&amp;CR</sub> vs mean<sub>Hit&amp;FA</sub>=0.02 vs 0.2, Mann-Whitney test, p&lt;0.001). The third latent temporal component showed a slower time course, with some reward specificity and was overrepresented in neurons from the visual cortex (mean<sub>SS,Mtr,Pta</sub> vs mean<sub>V1</sub>=0.02 vs 0.06 p&lt;0.001). TCA allowed us to quantify on the one hand, the brain-wide recruitment of VIP interneurons by reward- and punishment-associated responses and, on the other hand, brain region-dependent heterogeneity in dynamics (e.g. slower dynamics in the visual cortex) in an unbiased manner.</p><p>Beyond neuron-to-neuron and inter-trial variability, inter-individual (animal-to-animal) variability can also contribute to the heterogeneity experienced in the responses. Therefore, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV = SD/mean) of the peak of responses among the neurons of individual recordings (cell-to-cell) and compared the result to the CV calculated using the average peak amplitudes of the sessions (inter-individual). We conducted this analysis in parietal cortical measurements (n=4 mice, n=236 cells) separately in the four trial types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). The cell-to-cell CV was comparable among the trial types, Hit and FA being slightly less variable (Miss: 0.80, CR: 0.70, Hit: 0.57, FA: 0.58). The inter-individual variability in Miss and CR was similar in magnitude to the neuron-to-neuron variability, but in Hit and FA, it was surprisingly, ~2.6-fold lower (Miss: 0.94, CR: 0.69, Hit: 0.25, FA: 0.20). This reveals that while responses to the sound cue (without reinforcement) were as variable at the level of individual mice as at the level of individual cells, the reinforcement-related response was less variable across animals, and differences rather came from cellular differences. This agrees with the PCA-based clustering results that showed no separation according to mice and imaging sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Behavioral performance influences task-related VIP interneuron responses</title><p>Differences in individual animal performance of the discrimination task could also contribute to the heterogeneity in the activity of VIP interneurons. Hence, we tested whether differences in hit rate influenced the response of VIP interneurons during various epochs. We observed a positive correlation between the hit rate and the magnitude of the cue response of VIP interneurons during Hit trials (<italic>R</italic>=0.62, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Using a simple linear regression model, we found that the hit rate was able to explain 39% of the variance of cue responses (R<sup>2</sup>=39.0%; p=0.006). For comparison, the cue response was not influenced by the location of the imaging site (visual, SS, Mtr or parietal) from where the activity of the VIP interneurons was recorded (R<sup>2</sup>=18.2%; p=0.41).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Arousal modulation of reinforcement-mediated recruitment of VIP interneurons</title><p>Reward and punishment can induce changes in the arousal states of the animals, and the activity of VIP interneurons is known to be modulated by the arousal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>).

Reinforcement delivery associated with larger changes in pupil diameter led to a stronger recruitment of VIP interneurons in both the SS (large vs small pupil ΔF/F: 40 vs 29% n=26, t-test, p=0.01) and Mtr cortex (large vs small pupil ΔF/F: 28 vs 18%, n=111, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This modulation was strongest in the late response phase (difference between large vs small pupil associated ΔF/F at initial [0–1 s] and late [2–3 s] phase: 10.7 ± 0.01 vs 19.9 ± 0.01%, p&lt;0.001 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). A comparable modulation of VIP interneuron activity upon reinforcer presentation was observed when trials were split based on baseline pupil diameter (see Supplemental information and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In a subset of trials with high baseline arousal we found that reinforcement-related signals in VIP neurons were not associated with further increase in arousal (Hit ΔF/F: 4.4 ± 1.1% in 14.7% of the trials, t-test, p&lt;0.05, n=4 mice, FA ΔF/F: 20.4 ± 0.8%, in 11.4% of the trials, p&lt;0.01, n=3 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). The recruitment of VIP interneurons upon cue presentation only (i.e. Miss and CR trials, where trials were split using the mean cue-mediated pupil dilation for threshold) was similarly modulated by arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The positive correlation between pupil size changes and reinforcer-related activity of VIP interneurons was also present at single-cell level (median correlation coefficient 0.31). Interestingly, neurons with a larger correlation coefficient showed a slower activity profile of recruitment by reinforcers than those with a correlation coefficient below the median value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Because VIP interneuron population had slower dynamics in the mPFC than in the ACx, we hypothesize that the pupil size-dependent modulation of reward responses would be stronger in prefrontal cortex than in ACx. Indeed, reinforcer-mediated responses in mPFC were significantly larger in trials with greater changes in pupil diameter (large vs small pupil ΔF/F: 3.8 vs 1.4%, n=6 mice, p=0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This pupil size-dependent modulation was, however, absent in recordings of VIP interneurons in the ACx (large vs small pupil ΔF/F: 4.5 vs 3.2%, n=6 mice, p=0.08 in the ACx; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly to our single neuron measurements, arousal modulation was present at the population level in Miss and CR trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or when using the baseline pupil dilation as arousal index, except for the ACx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Overall, while we found arousal-related boosting of most response types, the fast recruitment of VIP interneurons by reinforcers was observed independently of the arousal state of the animal (high/low) at baseline or during reward/punishment delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Modulation of reinforcement-mediated recruitment of VIP interneurons by locomotion</title><p>We next examined whether running behavior modulates VIP neuron activity. Response profiles were split based on the median speed change during reinforcer delivery (average speed change for the two groups: 1.20 cm/s vs –0.23 cm/s <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Similar to what we observed with the pupil size, VIP interneuron responses to reward were stronger when the mice ran faster both for SS (high vs low speed change ΔF/F: 42 vs 27% n=26, t-test, p&lt;0.001) and Mtr cortex-located interneurons (high vs low speed change ΔF/F 30 vs 19%, n=86, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). A similar difference was also found for sensory responses during Miss and CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, the correlation was weaker at the single-cell level (median correlation coefficient, 0.11) compared to the pupil modulation. VIP interneuron population activity was modulated by running speed in mPFC (high vs low speed change, ΔF/F: 5 vs 3.5%, p=0.02) but not in ACx (ΔF/F: 5.4 vs 4.1%, p=0.44) similar to what found for pupil modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to quantify the motor- and reinforcement-related contributions to VIP interneuron activity, we built a generalized linear model using the behavior and imaging data from the SS and Mtr recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>, n=3 mice). This model was able to explain 18.8 ± 11.1% of the variance of the VIP population calcium signal and highlighted that arousal was the best predictor, followed by reward, punishment, locomotion velocity, and auditory cue (weights = 0.055, 0.031, 0.028, 0.020, and 0.018, respectively; all predictors, except the auditory cue in the case of one animal contributed significantly, p&lt;0.001). These analyses further underscore that running and arousal changes alone cannot fully explain the recruitment of VIP interneurons by reinforcers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Comparison between local and global recruitments of VIP neurons in visual cortex</title><p>VIP interneurons in ACx and visual cortex respond to sensory input, albeit their responses are weakly tuned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kerlin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mesik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>).

By monitoring VIP neural activity across dozens of cortical regions, we found that most neurons were strongly activated by water reward and air-puff punishment. This recruitment was boosted during high arousal states as previously observed for other sensory-mediated processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>). In visual cortex, the sensory tuning to visual gratings was not predictive of the VIP interneuron responses to reinforcers demonstrating the co-existence of both local and global activation modes.</p><p>VIP interneurons represent a small and sparsely distributed population across cortex rendering their investigation challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1997</xref>). We monitored the activity of a large population of VIP interneurons in behaving mice across the dorsal cortex. This was made possible by the use of 3D AO two-photon microscopy. The chessboard scanning method of 3D AO microscopy provided additional advantages to our ability to measure the spatial and temporal dynamics of VIP interneuron activity. According to our calculation, this method leads to several orders of magnitude increase in the measurement speed and SNR compared to piezo-based volume scanning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S1). Furthermore, it enabled robust off-line motion correction during behavioral experiments owing to the ability to actively extend the recordings beyond the soma of the neurons, thereby preserving fluorescence information during motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reid et al., 2016</xref>). Due to this large improvement in the SNR and recording speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S1), we were able to dramatically increase the number of simultaneously recorded neurons while maintaining a high sensitivity of detection of neuronal activity. This allowed us to demonstrate that VIP interneurons, throughout cortex and across cortical layers, responded homogenously and synchronously to reward and punishment delivery.</p><p>Several previous reports have shown that VIP interneurons can be activated by behavioral reinforcers in the ACx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>), the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pinto and Dan, 2015</xref>), the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Turi et al., 2019</xref>) and the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krabbe et al., 2019</xref>). Since interneurons are generally strongly connected with cortical circuitry and participate in region-specific local computations, it could be argued that in many of these cases VIP interneuron response properties fit the learning and plasticity roles of the relevant areas. Other reports about the behavioral responses of VIP interneurons in SS and visual cortices failed to observe reinforcement responses. This discrepancy may be explained by experimental differences, as these studies were done in highly trained animals, no air puff punishment was applied and reward delivery was fully predictable. In line with these possibilities, in our measurements from highly trained animals, the cue component dominated the signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Our observations also revealed heterogeneity in the temporal response of VIP interneurons to reinforcers. In addition to the single-trial and individual neuronal variability in the dynamics of reinforcer-related activity revealed by principal and tensor component analyses, we identified variability in behavioral performance as a source of heterogeneity in the cue-mediated recruitment of VIP interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). We found some heterogeneity across cortical regions in VIP interneuron responses. For instance, VIP interneurons showed a faster recruitment by reward in ACx than in mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Rapidly activated neurons were absent from visual cortical area whereas they could be observed throughout the rest of the dorsal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This variability might partially reflect different VIP interneuron subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Prönneke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Staiger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gonchar and Burkhalter, 1997</xref>). Perhaps the most distinct subclass of VIP interneurons is cholecystokinin (CCK+)-expressing interneurons with basket cell-type morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2016</xref>). These cells provide perisomatic inhibition in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tyan et al., 2014</xref>). We expect that the majority of the neurons we recorded in the upper layers are calretinin (CR+)-expressing bipolar cells, including intrinsic cholinergic acetyltransferase (ChAT+)-positive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). This separation into CCK-, CR-, or ChAT-expressing VIP interneurons has been recently partially validated using single-cell transcriptomic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Paul et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We identified five functional clusters of VIP interneurons based on differences in their temporal response dynamics. These VIP groups also showed small differences in their cell body diameter, which points to the possibility that genetically different VIP subtypes underlie response heterogeneity. Nevertheless, given the high proportion of VIP neurons responding to reward and punishment, multiple or even all VIP subtypes are expected to have this global response mode. Subtype-dependent differences in VIP activity were mostly present in the late response phase. Further studies using inter-sectional targeting strategies will be required to provide insight for the potential cell-type-specific origins of the heterogeneity in reinforcement responses.</p><p>The response heterogeneity of the local mode of VIP interneurons had already been appreciated for sensory stimuli. When local activation is examined in terms of tuning, VIP interneurons are significantly more heterogeneous and broadly tuned than principal neurons, as previously shown in the ACx and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mesik et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, we found that VIP interneurons respond with a low selectivity for drifting grating visual stimuli. There was only a weak positive correlation between the reinforcement-related and the visual stimulus-driven responses. This small correlation could reflect differences in excitability, but more importantly indicates that VIPs can play in both leagues: in region-specific sensory processing and in transmitting global signals to local microcircuits. This further suggests the absence of distinct populations specializing only in global or local processing.</p><p>We also observed arousal modulation of VIP interneuron activity in Mtr cortex, SS cortex, and mPFC, consistent with the previous reports in visual and pre-Mtr areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>). Arousal states are usually measured by changes in pupil diameter or running speed. One caveat of comparing reinforcement-evoked responses to arousal modulation is that the delivery of water reward and air-puff punishment usually also drives additional changes in arousal, leading to pupil dilation and/or locomotion. However, the relative change in pupil diameter between the small and large dilation groups was larger than the relative change in the corresponding average reinforcement responses indicating that reinforcement-associated change has a large, arousal-independent component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). Notable, reinforcers also drove VIP activity when additional pupil dilation and/or locomotion was not detectable. Nevertheless, we found that VIP interneuron recruitment by reinforcers was correlated with pupil dilation, similar to previously documented arousal modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>). The late response phase showed a stronger correlation with the pupil size, whereas the initial, transient phase followed the reinforcer delivery more closely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These differences might also explain the striking differences in temporal dynamics in simultaneously recorded mPFC and ACx VIP neuron populations.</p><p>The arousal modulation was surprisingly muted in ACx during reward and air puff delivery, as previously noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>). This observation may relate to the movement-induced suppression of activity in ACx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>) in contrast to the running-induced boosting of responses in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>). Alternatively, the lack of arousal modulation may be explained by the arousal-level-dependent, tone-induced network suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lin et al., 2019</xref>), a mechanism that is similar to lateral inhibition in V1 and controlled by somatostatin interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kato et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>High pupil change trials are usually associated with low baseline arousal and thereby with a high level of tone-induced network suppression, and this could reduce the activity of the VIP cells caused by the reinforcement-associated arousal increase itself, and as a consequence, pupil change - VIP cell activity correlation could be diminished. This effect however, only prevailed in Hit and FA, because 1., in Miss and CR high pupil change was not coupled with low baseline pupil that strictly, and 2., the difference of high vs low pupil change was only ~2-fold in Hit and FA, whereas ~14-fold in Miss and CR (considering the peaks).</p><p>Additionally, our behavioral paradigm did not encourage mice to run, hence their small movements produced only weak modulation in VIP activity (pupil: 0.31, locomotion: 0.11), measured over a longer temporal interval. Nevertheless, modulation was similar when restricted to the reinforcement time epoch (0–2 s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Taken together, these observations lead us to conclude that changes in arousal alone cannot explain the recruitment of VIP interneurons upon reward or punishment.</p><p>The circuit basis of the global signal is not yet known, although neuromodulatory systems are prime candidates, in particular, the forebrain cholinergic system. Indeed, central cholinergic neurons convey rapid reinforcement responses to cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hangya et al., 2015</xref>), and a type of layer 1 inhibitory neuron is activated by punishment through a nicotinic mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Letzkus et al., 2011</xref>). VIP neurons express fast, ionotropic nicotinic receptors and can be activated by acetylcholine in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alitto and Dan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Optogenetic cholinergic stimulation can also depolarize the membrane potential of VIP neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gasselin et al., 2021</xref>). Cholinergic activity in the neocortex was necessary for learning and modulated VIP cells during locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ren et al., 2022</xref>), and potentially also responsible for the co-activation in the auditory discrimination task. However, it remains unclear how this putative reinforcer-mediated cholinergic signaling would be ultimately integrated within cortex as multiple inhibitory neuron types other than VIP interneurons are known to respond to acetylcholine as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kuchibhotla et al., 2017</xref>). Another possibility is that the serotonergic system could convey this reinforcement signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, many (but not all) VIP neurons express 5HT3A, the ionotropic serotonin receptor, which could rapidly transduce information via serotonergic neuromodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>VIP interneurons have been found to target excitatory neurons as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kullander and Topolnik, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>), and the CCK+ VIP cells (a smaller subpopulation than the interneuron-specific cells) are known to primarily innervate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guet-McCreight et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, reinforcer-induced activation of VIP interneurons, is likely to produce a net disinhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>) and thereby provide gain modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pi et al., 2013</xref>) through changing the balance of inhibition across the somato-dendritic axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). Such reinforcer-induced disinhibition-mediated increase in cortical gain could provide a circuit-level explanation for the broad recruitment of dendrites observed during reinforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lacefield et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, VIP-mediated disinhibition through somatostatin interneurons will preferentially boost dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Larkum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). This could in turn support the role of VIP neurons in circuit plasticity in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2015</xref>) and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donato et al., 2013</xref>). As VIP neuron subtypes can have diversified functional roles in the microcircuit beside disinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kullander and Topolnik, 2021</xref>), future research should also focus on these sophisticated circuit operations.</p><p>In summary, we identified a cortex-wide or global activation mode for VIP interneurons, separate from their local circuit function specialized for each cortical region. By signaling reinforcement events, the global activation of VIP interneurons early in learning, may form a new information channel for cortical learning and explain how organism-level information about reinforcers regulates local circuit processing and plasticity. VIP interneurons specialize in disinhibition control over principal cells, producing selective amplification of response and gating of dendritic plasticity. This process could enable associating distant, co-active cortical ensembles predicting significant outcomes, whether reward or punishment. In other words, the VIP-mediated feedback signaling could provide the required global learning signal to strengthen functional connectivity across cortical representations. In this way, VIP neurons may transiently dial up the gain on learning, similar to how different learning phases are controlled in deep neural networks in artificial intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guerguiev et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV9.Syn.Flex.<break/>GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Penn Vector Core</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# AV-1-PV2819</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Vip<sup>tm.1(cre)Zjh</sup></italic>/J, B6.129P2-<italic>Pvalb<sup>tm1(cre)Arbr</sup></italic>/J,<break/>FVB/N-<italic>Tg(Thy1-cre)1Vln/J</italic>,</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:010908">IMSR_JAX:010908</ext-link><break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:017320">IMSR_JAX:017320</ext-link><break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:006143">IMSR_JAX:006143</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MathWorks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MES</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Femtonics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experimental procedures were carried out following the guidelines of the Animal Care and Experimentation Committee of the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with the Hungarian, EU, and National Institutes of Health regulations (reference number: PEI/001/194-4/2014).

Ropivacaine 0.2% was administered subcutaneously over the skull prior to the incision. After removing the skin over the top of the skull, which was then thoroughly cleaned and dried, a round craniotomy was performed using a 3-mm diameter biopsy punch and a dental drill. After the bleeding had been stopped, a double coverslip was implanted over the cranial window and fixed using a mixture of cyanoacrilate glue (Loctite Superbond) and luting cement (3 M ESPE RelyX). Finally, a metal headbar was cemented to the skull using dental cement (C&amp;B Superbond). The 3-mm diameter cranial window was positioned according to two main aspects. We centered the craniotomy on the injection site, except in Mtr and visual areas, where this would have resulted in transecting the sutures, which would have caused larger motion artifacts and severe bleeding from venous sinuses. During the procedure, the mice were head-fixed and laid on a heating pad to maintain stable body temperature. After the operation, the mice were woken up using a mixture containing nexodal, revertor, and flumazenil (1.2 mg, 2.5 mg, and 2.5 mg/kg body weight, respectively), and put on another heating pad where they stayed until recovered enough to be finally put back in their home cages. Post-operative care consisted of a daily intraperitoneal carprofen injection (0.5 mg/ml, 500 µl) for up to 5 days, and subcutaneous Ringer lactate injection (0.1–0.15 ml) to prevent dehydration. The cranial window implantation was usually performed 2 weeks after the virus injection. Injection sites of the 18 dorsal cortical regions from 16 mice were defined on the basis of coordinates from the Allen and Paxinos brain atlases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the visual cortex, the correct location was further confirmed by recording the responses of the cells to visual stimulation. Post hoc histology was performed in early experiments to ensure our bregma coordinates matched the Paxinos atlas.

The fiber optic cannulas (400 µm, 0.48NA, Doric lenses) were inserted 0.4 mm above the injection sites for both locations and sealed in place using Metabond, Vitrebond, and dental acrylic.

The 470-nm excitation light was delivered to the cannula implanted on the head of the animal using a second collimation lens (F240FC-A) coupled to a 400 µm, high NA, low autofluorescence optic fiber (FP400URT, custom made, Thorlabs).

The 470-nm excitation light was amplitude-modulated at a frequency of 211 Hz, with a max power of 40 µW, using an LED driver (LEDD1B) controlled through a National Instrument DAQ (NI USB-6341).

They had to lick when they heard a go tone (frequency: 5-kHz complex tones for sessions with two-photon recordings, 3-kHz pure tones for sessions with photometry recordings, duration: 0.5 s) to get small water droplets (5 µl) as a reward, and avoid licking after hearing a no-go tone (frequency: 0.5-kHz complex tones for sessions with two-photon recordings, 20-kHz pure tones for sessions with photometry recordings, duration: 0.5 s) which was associated with a 100-ms long mild air puff aimed into the eye. The absence of licking in go trials was not rewarded (Miss trials). If the animal correctly withheld licking to no-go tones (CR), the air puff was omitted. The time interval between tone and reinforcement onset was a function of the reaction time of the animal. In the figures, responses were aligned to reinforcement onset before averaging in FA and Hit, which resulted in a jitter in cue onset time. Reinforcement came 0.5 s after it was triggered, except for during the fiber photometry recordings where reinforcers were delivered upon licking (see below). The intensity of the air puff was set to yield a blink response. In some experiments, we introduced two additional stimuli that were less easy to discriminate (8 kHz for go and 10 kHz for no-go tones). The addition of these cues did not reveal any significant differences in GCaMP6f signals in VIP neurons, therefore these trial types were combined as go and no-go stimuli for further analysis. Licking was detected using a custom-made infrared sensor. Behavioral data were acquired using a Bpod device (Sanworks, LLC), and the tones were generated using a PulsePal device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sanders and Kepecs, 2014</xref>) and Logitech speakers. The photometry experiment used the updated version of Bpod that allows the tones to stop immediately when a mouse licks during the tone. Therefore, the duration of tone in the Hit and FA trials varied. Note that when the behavioral task was set up for the two-photon experiment, this function was not available in Bpod, and the tone duration was fixed to 0.5 s for all trial types. In one set of experiments we measured how pupil dilation changed during behavior. A ×4 objective was attached to a CMOS camera (Basler puA 1600–60 µm) to record pupil diameter and eye movements. In another set of experiments, we recorded running speed: mice were head-fixed over a rotating plastic plate allowing them to run freely. The rotation speed of the dial was recorded by an optical mouse (Urage reaper 3090, Hama) mounted upside down on the lower side of the plate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>3D AO microscopy</title><p>The improved microscope is designed and constructed based on the previous system reported earlier (see Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Szalay et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, short pulses were delivered by a femtosecond laser (Mai Tai, Spectra Physics). The coherent backreflection was eliminated by a Faraday isolator (BB9-5I, EOT). Thermal drift errors of optical elements were compensated for by an automatic beam-stabilization unit (BeamStab, Femtonics). The temporal dispersion was compensated for by a motorized four-prism sequence that could be automatically tuned in the 720–1100 nm wavelength range to provide the required large, negative, second- (up to 100,000 fs<sup>2</sup>) and third-order (up to 45,000 fs<sup>3</sup>) dispersion compensation (4DBCU, Femtonics). The 4DBCU unit was fine-tuned to provide the best image contrast and SNR at each wavelength in the depth. The first two water-cooled AO deflectors were filled with chirped acoustic waves whose frequencies form two orthogonal electric cylinder lenses (AO z-focusing unit). The second group of AO deflectors, with 15-mm clear optical aperture (Gooch and Housego), did the majority of lateral scanning and also compensated for the longitudinal and lateral drift of the focal spot in cooperation with the first two deflectors according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ1 equ3 equ4 equ5 equ1 equ1">equations S1-S70</xref> published earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reid et al., 2016</xref>). The deflectors are driven in the 55–120 MHz frequency range, therefore the noise emitted does not interfere with the auditory cues, as mice can’t hear it. This, in combination with the water cooling of the deflectors makes the AOD-based scanning the quietest technology for in vivo imaging. The two groups of deflectors were coupled together by a telecentric relay system (using two achromat lenses, #47–318, Edmund Optics) which contained a half wave plate (AHWP10M-980, Thorlabs) to set the optimal polarization for maximal diffraction efficiency. There is a one-to-one relationship (a bijection) between non-linear radiofrequency signals and the position, speed, and direction of the moving focus spot (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ1 equ3 equ4 equ5 equ1 equ1">Equations S1-S70</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Szalay et al., 2016</xref>). We used these quadratic equations to change the frequency of the sine wave drive to generate multiple 3D drifts from any arbitrary position at any desired speed. In this way, multiple small frames were generated (3D chessboard scanning) around each VIP cell from 10 to 25 lines. Therefore, not only the somatic signal but also the surrounding background information was detected: this enabled the somatic fluorescent signals to be preserved, even during brain movement, for off-line motion artifact compensation. A second telecentric relay system consisting of two achromatic lenses (#47–319, Edmund Optics, G322246525, Linos) focused the diffracted light beams onto the back aperture of the objective. The back-reflected fluorescence signal was separated from the excitation beam by a long-pass dichroic with a cut-on wavelength of 700 nm (700dcrxu, Chroma Technology). Red and green channels were split using a long-pass dichroic at 600 nm (t600lpxr, Chroma Technology). The absorption filters for green and red fluorescence was centered to 520 ± 30 nm and 650 ± 50 nm, respectively (ET520/60 m, ET650/100 m, Chroma Technology). Two extra infrared filters (ET700sp-2p8, Chroma Technology) blocked the back-scattered excitation beam from the GaAsP photomultiplier (H10770PA-40, Hamamatsu). The entire detector assembly was fixed to the objective and moved together during setting the nominal focal plane for the 3D AO imaging to minimize the detection pathway and maximize photon collection efficiency. A ×20 objective (XLUMPlanFI20×/1.0, water immersion, Olympus) with a 1.0 numerical aperture was used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Recording sparsely labeled networks in 3D with AO scanning</title><p>The main advantage of 3D AO microscopy is that the entire measurement time can be restricted to the required ROIs: this can result in a 10<sup>7</sup>-fold increase in the product of SNR<sup>2</sup> and the measurement speed (see Equations S82-S85 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Szalay et al., 2016</xref>).

This means that we can get over 5000-fold increase in SNR<sup>2</sup> or in the measurement speed (or even in the product of both) when AO-based 3D ROI scanning is used instead of point-by-point volume scanning.</p><p>To calculate this comparison more quantitatively, we compared 3D chessboard scanning with point-by-point scanning, volume scanning, and multi-layer imaging when AO scanning or resonant scanning with fast piezo z-drive were used (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S1). We limited our comparison to these point scanning methods because they allow whole-field detection and, therefore, deep penetration in vivo. We recorded 120 VIP cells in a 689 µm×639 µm×580 µm volume with 548×507×193 pixel resolution using 3D chessboard scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The 3D chessboard scanning method could image the 120 chessboards at 27.7 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S1). However, the measurement speed was only 0.00062 Hz when the same 120 neurons were recorded using point-by-point volume scanning when using the same, relatively long, pixel dwell time (30 µs). This means a 44,762-fold lower measurement speed. We saw a smaller reduction in measurement speed when we compared chessboard scanning with resonant scanning. The highest speed of the currently available resonant scanners is about 16 kHz, corresponding to ~0.1 µs (=1/16 kHz/548 pixel) pixel dwell time which results in a 0.16 Hz volume-scanning speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S1) which is too slow to resolve Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Moreover, as the pixel dwell time is 243-fold lower we would collect less signal from one pixel, resulting in a 41,506-fold decrease in the product of SNR<sup>2</sup> and measurement speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S1). We could accelerate measurement speed by restricting the numbers of the recorded z-layers to 19 because VIP neurons were present only in 19 z-layers in the exemplified measurement. However, in this case, we also needed to add about 20-ms setting time for each z-layer because the long-range z-drives required higher setting times according to the specifications of the piezo-actuators (see, e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.physikinstrumente.com">https://www.physikinstrumente.com</ext-link>). This resulted in a measurement speed of ~1 Hz and in 6654-fold decrease in the product of SNR<sup>2</sup> and measurement speed when compared to 3D chessboard scanning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table S1). The increased SNR of the 3D chessboard scanning allowed the reduction of the laser intensity which resulted in lower phototoxicity according to the LOTOS (low-power temporal oversampling strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). The LOTOS-based multi-photon imaging is one of the main advantages of AO scanning and provides long lasting imaging in chronic behavior experiments.</p><p>During these comparisons we did not consider two important technical factors in our calculations. First: the gain in SNR was calculated only for a single pixel (which is a volume element in space, therefore we can name it as voxel). However, both 3D chessboard scanning and volume scanning capture multiple voxels from a single VIP neuron (in our measurements for chessboard scanning: 105.2 ± 0.4 voxels/neuron and for volume scanning: 338.5 ± 0.1 voxels/neuron). Therefore, in a more precise calculation we need to divide the improvement shown in Table S1 for chessboard scanning with the ratio of 338/105.</p><p>Second: piezo actuators and resonant scanners are mechanically never perfectly balanced and are also sensitive to local mechanical vibrations and thermal turbulences which result in tumbling, wobbling, and jitter in the laser scans. These mechanical effects are difficult to precisely quantify into fluorescence changes although they would compensate the first factor. Therefore, for simplicity of calculation, both factors were ignored in our calculations.</p><p>Random-access targeting of ROIs by AO scanning is useful not only in 3D but also in two-dimension (2D). Because the ratio of the VIP cells in the cortex is about &lt;1% we can estimate the increase in measurement speed and SNR in 2D as follows:<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(S2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Visual stimulation</title><p>A liquid-crystal display (LCD) monitor was placed at a distance of 20 cm from the contralateral eye of the mouse, spanning 100° × 70° of the visual field. The objective was covered with a black rubber shield to prevent stray light entering through the gap between the animal’s head and the objective. A visual stimulation protocol was written in Matlab using the ‘Psychtoolbox’ package. The protocol consisted of eight differentially directed gratings with an angular interval of 45°. At the beginning of each trial, a gray screen was presented for 20 s. After that, a grating appeared and remained still for 1 s, and then moved orthogonally to its orientation for 6 s at 1 cycle/s speed, then it stayed still for 1 s, and finally the gray screen reappeared again. Gratings were repeated 10–20 times per direction in pseudorandom order. Pyramidal cell data were obtained from Thy-1-Cre mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Two-photon imaging data analysis</title><p>Motion correction, selection of ROIs corresponding to VIP cells on the frames of 3D chessboard scanning, background calculation, ΔF/F calculation, filtering, and data visualization were performed using the MES data acquisition software written in Matlab and C++ (Femtonics). Motion correction, if necessary, was conducted with a custom-written offline motion correction algorithm (see Off-line motion corrections section), and remaining artifacts were interpolated or smoothed with partial Gauss filtering under visual control.</p><p>For the trial-to-trial analysis, we considered a neuron in a given trial as active if the difference between the peak ΔF/F value of reinforcer delivery epoch (0–2 s interval after reinforcement onset) and mean ΔF/F value of baseline epoch (−2–0 s interval before tone onset) was higher than two SD. Peak ΔF/F value was defined here as the average ΔF/F value of the datapoints around the peak in the range of 250 ms. The results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> used two SD as a cutoff. We defined synchronicity as the number of active neurons divided by the total number of all neurons in a given a trial, i.e., how many neurons are activated simultaneously. Reliability was calculated as the number of active trials divided by the total number of trials, i.e., how reliably the neuron is activated in Hit and FA trials. Stability means the percentage of active neurons across trials and sessions.</p><p>We used linear regression models to address heterogeneity of the cue responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The explanatory variable for the first model was the hit rate (number of Hit trials divided by the number of go trials) to characterize behavior. The dependent variable was the relative size of the average cue response compared to the average reinforcement response as a reference. The values were calculated on the population average traces of the Hit trials from each measurement. In the second model we used categorical variables with dummy coding for four functional regions (Mtr, sensory, parietal, visual) as explanatory variables to describe regional differences. The regression was fitted using ordinary least squares method of Statsmodels package in Python 3 based Anaconda data science platform.</p><p>The clustering analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>) was done using a custom Matlab routine. Positive somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses recorded during Hit trials were extracted. 16 cells were excluded from this analysis as they disproportionately increased the reconstruction error. Data were z-scored using the mean and variance of fluorescence during the first second of recording. We further normalized using the maximal amplitude of the response calculated during the period from 0 to 4 s after reward delivery. We applied a dimensionality reduction along the time axis using a PCA on the period from 0 to 4 s after reward delivery. We then considered only the first four principal components (PCs) explaining 90% of the data for clustering purposes. K-means clustering with five replicates was used to cluster into five types the PCs of the responses of VIP interneurons.</p><p>We estimated cell diameters by recording the fluorescence profile of the somata placing two lines along the longest and the shortest diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Then the averaged and Gauss-filtered fluorescence profiles were used to calculate FWHM after subtracting the fluorescent baseline and normalization.</p><p>We applied TCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kolda and Bader, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2018</xref>) on somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses recorded during the discrimination task. After smoothing, single-trial neural activities corresponding to the reaction time periods for Hit and FA trials were time-warped to a fixed 1.5 s/30 data points in length. This step was necessary because (1) the reaction time varied from trial to trial; and (2) the variable number of neurons recorded in the different session led to a variable sampling rate for imaging. These factors led to a trial- and session-dependent number of images between the cue and the reward delivery. All recordings were rendered non-negative by subtracting the minimal fluorescence ΔF/F value for each cell. Data were finally normalized by dividing by the average maximum fluorescence ΔF/F value of Hit-only trials. Only the first 10 trials of each types were then selected for each cell and each session and assembled in a N×T×K matrix where N=771 neurons, T: time (s), K=40 trials. TCA reconstruction error was computed with different latent numbers [1,2,3,4,5,10,15,20] with 10 different initial conditions for each latent number. Using three latents led to a reconstruction error of 22%.</p><p>A generalized linear model was built to determine the contributions of the behavioral events to the VIP interneuronal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This model used auditory cue, locomotion velocity, pupil diameter, water, and air puff delivery as explanatory variables. Estimated amount of water accessible at the lick port was represented with a kernel consisting of a Gaussian fit that started at water delivery and peaked when the average licking activity of the three mice reached a top before a plateau phase. Then the kernel decayed in a linear fashion until it reached the baseline at a time point that was calculated to match the end of the plateau of licking activity (5% decrease from peak). Air puff was incorporated as a Gaussian kernel started at the onset of the air puff delivery and peaked at 0.2 s that matched the time of the valve closure. The trace representing pupil diameter was Gauss filtered. Variables were downsampled to match the frame rate of the calcium recordings. All predictors were standardized in order to have a fair penalization in the subsequent regularized regression. Then a lasso regression was fitted with automated hyperparameter tuning and fivefold cross-validation. This type of regression can handle data with multicollinearity and reduces overfitting. The penalty factor decreased the weights of the unimportant explanatory variables. Adding an explanatory variable containing random floating point numbers in the interval [0,1] did not change the predictive power of the model, and this variable did not contribute significantly to the prediction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Pupil diameter</title><p>The video recorded with the camera was first thresholded to isolate the pupil on the image. The pupil area was fitted to an ellipse, and the main diagonal was extracted. Missing frames caused by spontaneous or air puff-triggered blinking were interpolated manually. A Gaussian filter was applied to smooth eye movement-related artifacts. In analyzing the change of pupil diameter, the traces were normalized to <bold>∆</bold>P/P = (P(t)−P<sub>0</sub>)/P<sub>0</sub> using a 2-s period before tone onset as baseline (P<sub>0</sub>). Trials of each outcome were separated to high- and low-arousal groups on the basis of the change in the pupil diameter. The area under the pupil diameter curve was calculated in the 0–3 s interval after reinforcement onset, and the median value was selected. If the area under the curve value of a given trial was higher or lower than the median value, it was considered to be high- or low-arousal trial, respectively. For baseline pupil analysis, when we compared the VIP cell activity after reinforcement associated with low and high baseline arousal levels, the trials were again separated into low- and high-arousal trials, but here, the basis of the separation was the area under the pupil diameter curves in the [–2;0] s interval before the tone onset. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>, we separated a subset of trials in which reinforcement was not accompanied by pupil diameter and locomotion velocity increase or it did not step over two SD. Pupil diameter, velocity, and fluorescence calculations were made on the [1;0] s interval after the reinforcement onset in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Locomotion velocity analysis</title><p>Velocity traces were first Gauss filtered. They show the absolute speed of the movement, regardless of the direction. In Hit and FA trials, we defined the change in the running speed as the speed difference between the reinforcer delivery time period (0–2 s interval after reinforcement onset) and baseline time period (−2–0 s interval before tone onset). In Miss and CR trials, the speed difference was calculated between the tone delivery time period (0–2 sec interval after tone onset) and baseline time period (−2–0 s interval before tone onset). Trials were separated into low and high speed change groups according to the median speed change value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Visual stimulation</title><p>OSI and DSI were calculated as OSI = (R<sub>pref</sub> − R<sub>ortho</sub>)/(R<sub>pref</sub> + R<sub>ortho</sub>), and DSI = (R<sub>pref</sub> − R<sub>opp</sub>)/(R<sub>pref</sub> + R<sub>opp</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schumacher et al., 2019</xref>), where R<sub>pref</sub> denotes the amplitude of the response to the preferred orientation (OSI) or direction (DSI), R<sub>ortho</sub> denotes the response to the orthogonal orientation in the OSI formula, and R<sub>opp</sub> refers to the response to the direction that is opposite to the preferred one.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For all analyses, the activation/suppression period was set to be 0–2 s after stimulus onset: the statistical significance of the change of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses was then evaluated and compared to a stimulus-free baseline (−2–0 s before stimulus onset). The statistical significance of the activation and suppression was determined by a p-value cutoff of 0.05. First, the mean baseline values of each trial were subtracted from each Ca<sup>2+</sup> trace in order to directly compare the effect of stimuli on Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses and minimize the effect of unknown sources of noise. Lilliefors normality test was used to evaluate whether the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals of individual VIP neurons followed a normal distribution. The Lilliefors test showed that 76% of VIP neurons (Hit: 70%, FA: 82%) followed a normal distribution. The fraction of the neurons activated by reinforcers (see below) with normal distribution (91%) was similar to that of activated neurons with non-normal distribution. Therefore, we used a one-tailed one sample t-test to classify the activation and suppression (see Supplemental information for a more sensitive analytical method). Neurons were classified as responsive when either activation or suppression was statistically significant. Student’s t-test (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001) was also used to compare calcium responses associated with low and high arousal, or low and high running speed. PCA loadings of different areas and TCA trial factors of trial types with and without reinforcement were compared with Mann-Whitney test. If not otherwise indicated, data are presented as mean ± SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Off-line motion correction</title><p>In the case of chessboard scanning, neuronal somata were selected from a z-stack, then the selected square ROIs were arranged as a 2D chessboard. Since the motion of a single frame during the scanning period as well as the relative rotation between subsequent frames, were not relevant, the transformation to be corrected could be approximated by a simple translational transformation between the scanning periods of the different frames. For efficiency, an algorithm based on fast Fourier transformation was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuster and Bressler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guizar-Sicairos et al., 2008</xref>). The template images were chosen either manually or by selecting the best correlating 20% of the relevant ROIs on all frames.</p><p>In some cases, images were also preprocessed, by either adaptive histogram equalization or simple median filtering. The image registration algorithm also provided the error of matching the moving images to the template images. As the drifting and scanning parameters were identical for each scanned ROI, we calculated the final displacement vector as the median of a fixed percentage of all ROIs with the smallest matching errors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Code availability</title><p>Custom written analysis codes are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/QuentinNeuro">https://github.com/QuentinNeuro</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:eb4fcf3eb3b2af7ffdb60846321a0ce352f8046c;origin=https://github.com/QuentinNeuro/Bpod-FunctionQC;visit=swh:1:snp:a6f9eca7dd9ea169e9d8e35d6a3ef98831f9ad66;anchor=swh:1:rev:1ea70f47f0bd5fbf5441abe0dac3dc70ed3c9a8b">swh:1:rev:1ea70f47f0bd5fbf5441abe0dac3dc70ed3c9a8b</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevy, 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>is a founder of Femtonics Ltd</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf4"><p>is a founder of Femtonics Ltd. and a member of its scientific advisory board</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental procedures were carried out following the guidelines of the Animal Care and Experimentation Committee of the Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in accordance with the Hungarian, EU, and National Institutes of Health regulations (reference numbers: PEI/001/194-4/2014).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of different scanning methods.</title><p>Scanning speed was calculated according to the equations in the column ‘calculation of scanning speed’.

Thus, trials were split by the median value of the baseline pupil diameter.

For instance, when baseline arousal level was low, the reinforcers tended to induce a stronger increase in VIP activity. When baseline arousal level was high, the reinforcers induced a smaller increase (high vs low baseline: somatosensory: 30 vs 39% (ΔF/F), n=26, p&lt;0.01; motor: 23 vs 30% (ΔF/F), n=111, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The method is based on the following: (1) a thresholding method in which neurons with very poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are eliminated at the beginning of the analysis; (2) baseline calculation in the pre-stimulus period; and (3) one sample t-test in the response period.</p><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9-1"><title>1) The thresholding method</title><p>Majority of the cells showed robust spontaneous and reinforcement-related responses with variable amplitude and frequency. However, in some neurons, responses were below the detection threshold in a recording period of over 5 min. To eliminate neurons with low SNR, we calculated the mean amplitude of the 15 ± 5% largest peaks detected in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during the recording period of over 5 min and divided it by the average, pre-stimulus STD. Neurons with a (mean amplitude)/SD ratio below 5 were eliminated from the analysis.

The authors need to consider the current view of cortical VIP+ cells as of providers of both inhibition AND disinhibition (Zhou et al., 2017, Cerebral Cortex). In fact, VIP+ cells are highly heterogeneous, and their diversity and functional role across different cortical areas have been highlighted (Guet-McCreight et al., 2020; Kullander and Topolnik, 2021). This is especially important given functional heterogeneity in the response profiles of VIP+ cells observed in the current study across cortical regions. With the help of PCA and k-means clustering method, recorded VIP interneurons were categorized into 5 groups based on their temporal dynamics. These cells possibly belong to different subtypes of VIP interneurons. Post-hoc identification of these neurons using IHC would possibly provide more information on whether the 5 groups of neurons belong to distinct subtypes of VIP cells and ultimately if there are any differences in the distribution of VIP subtypes across depth.</p><p>2. Was there a small fraction of VIP+ cells activated by all tasks (Hit, Miss, CR and FA; Figure 1C)? Not sure, why the AVG response/area is shown. As different cell types were sampled, the best would be to arrange them by depth/layer using the full advantage of the fast volumetric imaging (as shown in Figure S2). Also, cells could be arranged by their soma size given that CR+/VIP+ have a smaller soma when compared to VIP basket cells (Luo et al. 2020).</p><p>3. TCA allowed authors to understand the variability in the activity dynamics due to inter-trial variability. The interpretation of the obtained results should be added to the main text (Figure 3H) for better understanding.</p><p>4. VIP interneurons from all regions under investigation but the auditory cortex showed arousal and locomotion modulation of reinforcement-mediated recruitment of VIP interneurons. The possible reasons need to be discussed in the main text. Similarly, the absence of arousal (pupil diameter change based) modulation of reinforcement response for Hit &amp; FA trials (unlike Miss &amp; CR trials) requires explanation.</p><p>5. Fiber photometry recordings from the auditory cortex (Figure 2A) reveal higher calcium transients for Hit and FA compared to CR and Miss trials, however, the data from Figure S4A shows higher ΔF/F (%) for Miss &amp; CR compared to Hit &amp; FA. Whether the results in Figure 2A and Figure S4A were obtained from different sets of mice should be mentioned.</p><p>6. Authors conclude in the Discussion section that – only the late response phase showed a correlation with the pupil size, whereas the initial, transient phase followed more closely the reinforcer delivery, however in the Figure 3 D-E, ΔF/F (%) for Hit &amp; FA from high vs low pupil size change trials in the late response phase (~2-3 sec from the outcome) show roughly similar responses (especially in motor cortex Figure 3D right). The clarification of how the initial and late response phase was defined is necessary for better understanding. A graph comparing the responses (ΔF/F) of VIP interneurons for high vs low pupil size change trials in initial vs late phase would clarify the extent of the influence of arousal on reinforcement-mediated recruitment of VIP interneurons. Moreover, comparison of ΔP/P in Figure 3C and Figure S4A reveals that reinforcement stimuli trials (FA &amp; Hit) lead to higher pupil size change compared to Miss &amp; CR trials. Considering the modulation of VIP recruitment due to arousal (pupil size change), the reinforcement-mediated recruitment of VIP interneurons might be strongly influenced by arousal. More clarification is needed to conclude about reinforcement-mediated VIP recruitment.</p><p>7. In the Discussion section (line 440-441), the authors claim that the VIP activity modulation due to locomotion is weak, but the comparison of activity change due to arousal (Figure 3 C-E) and locomotion (Figure 3 F-H) shows that the ΔF/F (%) values in all brain regions for arousal and locomotion modulation are comparable. The claim of weak locomotion modulation of VIP activity is not supported by the results. Also, speed modulation was assessed at a very low animal speed (avg 1.2 cm/s, which was used as a high speed).

In order to make the data less anecdotical, data from more animals need to be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and the editor for pointing out this potential misunderstanding in the method description. The AOD data presented in this manuscript are actually from 16 animals. Each animal has been recorded in one (14 mice) or two areas (2 mice). We have 4 recordings from the primary somatosensory cortex, 6 recordings from the primary and secondary motor cortices, 4 from the lateral and medial parietal cortices, and 3 from the primary visual cortex. Fiber photometry has been performed in a different 6 animals hence totaling 22 mice. In addition, our measurements were robust at the level of individual sessions: fluorescence signals were recorded in a high number of trials from multiple neurons. More specifically, Figure 1 shows recording of 128 trials from 120 neurons resulting in a total of n = 120 × 128 = 15,360 transients. Our main data set (e.g., Figure 2) is based on 811 cells × 95-195 trials ≈121,650 transients. Across all these animals and brain areas, we observed a consistent recruitment of VIP interneurons by reward and punishment. Although we reported the number of mice and sessions the recordings were obtained from, to clarify this misunderstanding we have now repeated this several times at the beginning of the Results section and in the figure legends to highlight the robustness of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A revised version of the manuscript should be able to distinguish between reinforcement and arousal, since the reinforcements used in this study may cause arousal</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point as it is indeed an important confound for the study of reinforcement-related signals. We had addressed this question in Figure 3A-E and related Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-C. Briefly, we showed that while arousal (as measured by pupil dilation) or locomotion influence the activity of VIP interneurons, the reinforcement response from VIP interneurons is maintained independently of the arousal or locomotion states of the animals during the different epochs of the task (baseline or reinforcement delivery period). To further confirm our findings, we are now adding a new supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2) showing a subset of trials in which the animals were in high arousal states (i.e., large pupil typically also associated with locomotor activity) prior to the start of the trial, and for which the reinforcement delivery did not trigger any additional elevation in arousal. For these trials, the VIP interneuron activity still increased upon reward delivery.</p><p>In addition, we also present a generalized linear model (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D) to quantitatively estimate the contributions of arousal, locomotion, and reinforcement on the VIP neuronal activity in a systematic way. The model showed that arousal does indeed contribute to the variance in VIP signal as previously reported. However, this systematic analysis also highlighted our new finding that VIP-IN activity reports reinforcement delivery. We hope that this can further strengthen our demonstration that reinforcement-related activity of VIP cells is not just a reflection of fluctuations in locomotion and arousal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The manuscript should assess whether well-trained animals display large responsiveness of VIP neurons to reward or reduced responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the editor and the reviewers on this important point. Many studies have started to address directly or indirectly the effect of learning on reinforcer-related responses of VIP interneurons (Turi et al., 2019, Krabbe et al., 2019, Ren et al., 2022). However, the overall goal of this paper is to focus on primary reinforcers (reward and punishment) to demonstrate that they globally recruit VIP interneurons. Now we emphasize this also in the abstract. Nevertheless, it was already evident that during this process the amplitude of the cue-associated responses are proportional with the hit rate: that was the reason why we added Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, which shows that the cue-associated component dominates over the reward-associated component in better-trained mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should revise their interpretation of the data based on the current view of cortical VIP+ cells as a diverse population of neurons that mediate both inhibition and dis-inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor and the reviewers for drawing our attention to this important topic. According to the question of Reviewer #1, we analyzed the distribution of the diameter of VIP somata. We have found that both at the level of the entire population and individual mice neuronal somata formed two separate distributions (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), possibly indicating two populations (CR+ and CR−) of VIP cells shown in a previous study (Luo et al., 2020).</p><p>As we did not find any significant differences in the cell diameter of neurons which were responsive or non-responsive to reinforcement (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B), we concluded that different subtypes of VIP interneurons are similarly activated by reinforcers, but the response variability characterized by the PCA (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C) can indeed reflect subtype-specific differences. We have strengthened the discussion about the complex nature of the VIP cells concerning inhibition and disinhibition in the local circuitry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Data analysis and representation should improve according to reviewers comments – see for example comments of reviewer 3 to submitted figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and the editor for raising these imprecisions in the description of some of the methods, especially the TCA. We have improved the methods and the figures according to the reviewers’ comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors need to consider the current view of cortical VIP+ cells as of providers of both inhibition AND disinhibition (Zhou et al., 2017, Cerebral Cortex). In fact, VIP+ cells are highly heterogeneous, and their diversity and functional role across different cortical areas have been highlighted (Guet-McCreight et al., 2020; Kullander and Topolnik, 2021). This is especially important given functional heterogeneity in the response profiles of VIP+ cells observed in the current study across cortical regions. With the help of PCA and k-means clustering method, recorded VIP interneurons were categorized into 5 groups based on their temporal dynamics. These cells possibly belong to different subtypes of VIP interneurons. Post-hoc identification of these neurons using IHC would possibly provide more information on whether the 5 groups of neurons belong to distinct subtypes of VIP cells and ultimately if there are any differences in the distribution of VIP subtypes across depth.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good comment and an extremely important point. As pointed out by the reviewer, the characterization of VIP interneuron subtypes is a very active field with on-going identification of functional, connectivity, and genetic diversity. Although we are not able to perform the IHC the reviewer suggested, we have tried to address the subtype diversity using soma size as a proxy (Luo et al. 2020). In Figure 2—figure supplement 3, we found that VIP cells can indeed be separated into two groups on the basis of cell diameter: however, these groups did not differ in their responsiveness to reinforcers (see also Essential revisions #4). But the PCA clusters indeed showed significant variability: VIP cells with larger diameters were more likely to belong to fast and sustained cluster profiles. One important observation from the cluster analysis is that virtually all clusters show a fast response to reward, but were instead coined mostly based on their late response. These differences in late responses could represent VIP subtype differences with different receptor subtypes, or different integration into the local cortical microcircuit. We have added this new information to the Results section and strengthened the discussion regarding the VIP interneuron subtypes; we also mention the inhibitory effect of the VIP cells.</p><p>We now say in the discussion:</p><p>“… An analysis performed to address cell-type diversity using diameter as a proxy separated the cells into two populations, maybe reflecting the CR+/− classification (Luo et al. 2020). Given the high proportion of VIP neurons responding to reward and punishment, it seems likely that multiple subtypes of VIP interneurons respond to reinforcers. A potential subtype--heterogeneity manifested itself in the late response phase. Further studies using inter-sectional targeting strategies will be required to provide insight for the potential cell-type-specific origins of the heterogeneity in reinforcement responses.”</p><p>“Although a substantial proportion of all VIP cell’ boutons directly target excitatory neurons (Kullander and Topolnik, 2021; Zhou et al., 2017), and the CCK<sup>+</sup> VIP cells (a smaller subpopulation than the interneuron-specific cells) are known to primarily innervate them (Guet-McCreight et al., 2020), at the functional level, reinforcer-induced activation of VIP cells, as a population is likely to produce a net disinhibitory effect (Lee et al., 2013; π et al., 2013) and thereby gain modulation (Pi et al., 2013) through changing the balance of inhibition across the somato-dendritic axis (Pfeffer et al., 2013).”</p><p>“… As VIP neuron subtypes can have diversified functional roles in the microcircuit beside disinhibition (Kullander and Topolnik, 2021), future research should also focus on these sophisticated circuit operations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Was there a small fraction of VIP+ cells activated by all tasks (Hit, Miss, CR and FA; Figure 1C)?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2C shows that 91 neurons were activated during all 4 trial types.

We wanted to emphasize in Figure 1C the high response ratio of the VIP interneuronal population in Hit and FA, this was the reason why we ordered the responses according to their maximum amplitude. Our analysis showed that responsiveness does not depend on subtype specificity, therefore we think that it is still rational to depict the transients of the entire VIP population together. But we agree that the suggested depth-dependent arrangement could be informative so we have rearranged the transients by depth and added the new panels to Figure 1—figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, cells could be arranged by their soma size given that CR+/VIP+ have a smaller soma when compared to VIP basket cells (Luo et al. 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>Similarly to the previous point, this is an excellent idea.

We have added the interpretation of the TCA into the Results section:</p><p>“TCA allowed us to quantify, on the one hand, the brain-wide recruitment of VIP interneurons by reward- and punishment-associated responses and, on the other hand, brain region-dependent heterogeneity in dynamics (e.g., slower dynamics in the visual cortex) in an unbiased manner”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. VIP interneurons from all regions under investigation but the auditory cortex showed arousal and locomotion modulation of reinforcement-mediated recruitment of VIP interneurons. The possible reasons need to be discussed in the main text. Similarly, the absence of arousal (pupil diameter change based) modulation of reinforcement response for Hit &amp; FA trials (unlike Miss &amp; CR trials) requires explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. First, we should note that the effects of running do not seem to be mediated by the VIP network in this cortical region (Yavorska et al., 2021), which agrees with our findings. We are uncertain about why VIP cells in the auditory cortex show less arousal modulation than those in other brain areas, but there is one mechanism that could possibly explain our findings. Similarly to lateral inhibition in V1 by SOM neurons, there is a tone-related network suppression in the auditory cortex (Kato et al., 2017). Interestingly, the intensity of the suppression depends on the arousal: it is weaker at higher arousal levels. As we mentioned in the supplementary information, when the baseline pupil diameter was small, the increase in pupil diameter tended to be higher, and vice versa (Figure 3—figure supplements 1A and B). It means that in trials with a high pupil change the baseline arousal was generally lower. Indeed, in Hit and FA the average peak amplitude of the low baseline pupil group was 1.9-fold larger than in the high baseline pupil group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of peak amplitudes of pupil trace averages split according to their baseline amplitudes in Hit &amp; FA.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78815-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Therefore, we can say that in the high pupil change trials, the network suppression could have a large effect, meaning that the SOM cells could successfully inhibit VIP activity after the tone onset, therefore the arousal change related activity could be reduced.</p><p>The reason why the arousal change modulation is still present in Miss and CR trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) is that the ratio of the average peak amplitude of low and high baseline pupil is smaller, meaning that the high pupil change was less straightforwardly coupled with low baseline pupil, so the effect of the network suppression was reduced.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of peak amplitudes of pupil trace averages split according to their baseline amplitudes in Miss &amp; CR.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78815-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Importantly, the difference between low and high arousal change was one magnitude larger in the case of Miss &amp; CR (considering the peaks: 14-fold) than for Hit &amp; FA (2-fold).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Comparison of peak amplitudes of pupil trace averages split according to the pupil change in Miss &amp; CR and Hit &amp; FA (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78815-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Summarizing the aforementioned factors, the tone-related network suppression could be accountable for reduced arousal change modulation in the case of Hit &amp; FA, but the difference between low and high pupil change groups was so high in Miss &amp; CR that the network suppression – that was already weaker in Miss &amp; CR – could not overwhelm this modulation in these trial types. We have strengthened our discussion regarding this point:</p><p>“The lack of modulation by arousal change in the auditory cortex can be explained by the arousal-level-dependent, tone-induced network suppression (Lin et al., 2019), a mechanism that in a similar way to lateral inhibition in V1 is controlled by SOM interneurons (Kato et al., 2017). High pupil change trials are usually associated with low baseline arousal and thereby with a high level of network suppression, reducing the activity of the VIP cells that is connected to pupil change and, as a consequence, diminishing pupil change – VIP cell activity correlation. As the connection between high pupil change and low baseline pupil was weaker in Miss &amp; CR trials – and also the difference of high vs. low pupil change was higher than in Hit &amp; FA (Hit &amp; FA: ~2-fold, Miss &amp; CR: ~14-fold, considering the peaks) – the effect of the network suppression did not prevail in these trial types.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Fiber photometry recordings from the auditory cortex (Figure 2A) reveal higher calcium transients for Hit and FA compared to CR and Miss trials, however, the data from Figure S4A shows higher ΔF/F (%) for Miss &amp; CR compared to Hit &amp; FA. Whether the results in Figure 2A and Figure S4A were obtained from different sets of mice should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>The data were obtained from the same mice. Unfortunately, in Figure 2A the baseline fluorescence values were calculated in the wrong time interval in this particular case, which shifted the calcium responses: we have now corrected this.</p><p>Indeed, although the peak of average FA signal was higher than Miss &amp; CR signals, the average ΔF/F (%) for Miss &amp; CR was larger during the 0-2 s interval than for Hit &amp; FA. This time window was chosen for analysis in order to capture the slow time course of the calcium signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Authors conclude in the Discussion section that – only the late response phase showed a correlation with the pupil size, whereas the initial, transient phase followed more closely the reinforcer delivery, however in the Figure 3 D-E, ΔF/F (%) for Hit &amp; FA from high vs low pupil size change trials in the late response phase (~2-3 sec from the outcome) show roughly similar responses (especially in motor cortex Figure 3D right). The clarification of how the initial and late response phase was defined is necessary for better understanding. A graph comparing the responses (ΔF/F) of VIP interneurons for high vs low pupil size change trials in initial vs late phase would clarify the extent of the influence of arousal on reinforcement-mediated recruitment of VIP interneurons. Moreover, comparison of ΔP/P in Figure 3C and Figure S4A reveals that reinforcement stimuli trials (FA &amp; Hit) lead to higher pupil size change compared to Miss &amp; CR trials. Considering the modulation of VIP recruitment due to arousal (pupil size change), the reinforcement-mediated recruitment of VIP interneurons might be strongly influenced by arousal. More clarification is needed to conclude about reinforcement-mediated VIP recruitment.</p></disp-quote><p>If we complete Figure 3C with a bar graph showing average ∆P/P (%) in high and low arousal change in Hit &amp; FA together, and we compare these bars with the calcium responses Figure 3D, we can see that the differences between the high and low arousal groups are not proportional (~5-fold difference in ∆P/P, ~1.5-fold in ∆F/F, red double-headed arrows in Figure 3), suggesting that a large part of the reinforcement-associated response below the dashed blue line is independent of arousal.</p><p>We performed multiple analyses to strengthen this part of the manuscript. As suggested, we have added a panel comparing the difference between high and low arousal-related calcium signal in the initial (0-1 s after reinforcement) and late (2-3 s after reinforcement) response phase: these show an approximately 2-fold larger difference in the late response phase (initial: 10.7 ± 0.01% late: 19.9 ± 0.01%). We have rephrased our conclusion in the Discussion section accordingly.</p><p>We now say in the results:</p><p>“This modulation was stronger in the late response phase (difference between large vs. small pupil at initial [0-1s] and late [2-3s] phase ΔF/F: 10.7 ± 0.01% vs. 19.9 ± 0.01%).”</p><p>We now say in the discussion:</p><p>“One caveat of comparing reinforcement-evoked responses to arousal modulation is that the delivery of water reward and air puff punishment usually also drives additional changes in arousal, leading to pupil dilation and/or locomotion. However, the relative change in pupil diameter between the small and large dilation groups was larger than the relative change in the corresponding average reinforcement responses indicating that reinforcement-associated change has a large, arousal independent component (Figures 3C and D). Reinforcement also drove VIP activity when additional pupil dilation and/or locomotion was not detectable. Nevertheless, we found that VIP interneuron recruitment by reinforcers was correlated with pupil dilation, similar to previously-documented arousal modulation (Fu et al., 2014; Garcia-Junco-Clemente et al., 2017; Jackson et al., 2016; Reimer et al., 2014). The late response phase showed a stronger correlation with the pupil size, whereas the initial, transient phase followed the reinforcer delivery more closely (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E).”</p><p>Finally, we estimated the distinct contributions of arousal, locomotion, and reinforcement in a systematic way with the help of a generalized linear model (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D, see response to Reviewer #3 for details), which revealed the high relative contribution of the reinforcement to the VIP activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In the Discussion section (line 440-441), the authors claim that the VIP activity modulation due to locomotion is weak, but the comparison of activity change due to arousal (Figure 3 C-E) and locomotion (Figure 3 F-H) shows that the ΔF/F (%) values in all brain regions for arousal and locomotion modulation are comparable. The claim of weak locomotion modulation of VIP activity is not supported by the results. Also, speed modulation was assessed at a very low animal speed (avg 1.2 cm/s, which was used as a high speed). Have authors tried to look at higher speed locomotion, which has been used in the previous studies?</p></disp-quote><p>Our major goal was not to assess VIP activity with locomotion per se, but rather to show that reinforcement signals are impacted, but couldn’t be explained, by locomotion – see for example Figure 3F and G low speed-change FA traces, where the average speed change is 0 or slightly negative (meaning the animals slow down), yet the reinforcement-related activity remained intact. We inserted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref> to illustrate the different locomotion profiles of the mice and how these relate to average calcium signals. If the animal was still, the correlation between locomotion and VIP responses was ~0, as shown in the example (see the red mouse in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). In contrast, the correlation between average pupil size and calcium level was higher, therefore the distribution is shifted towards more positive values, and it was also 2-fold wider (compare Figure 3B to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). We should note that the pupil vs. calcium and movement vs. calcium correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref> and Figure 3B) were calculated over a longer time window, whereas bar plots of Figure 3D-H show the average calcium levels in the 0-2 s time window after the reinforcement onset. Indeed, in this shorter temporal interval, which focuses on the time of reinforcement, the speed and pupil modulations are comparable (only slightly higher in case of the pupil, compare Figure 3D with G and E with H). In summary, this means that on average VIP activity correlated better with arousal than running, but if we restrict our analysis to the reinforcement time interval, the correlations are similar.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Left, correlation of locomotion and VIP activity (median=0.11).

However, in Miss and CR the CV values were surprisingly similar.

We conducted this analysis in parietal cortical measurements (n=4 mice, n=236 cells) separately in the four trial types (Figure 2—figure supplement 2E). The cell-to-cell CV was comparable among the trial types, Hit and FA being slightly less variable (Miss: 0.80, CR: 0.70, Hit: 0.57, FA: 0.58). The inter-individual variability in Miss and CR was similar in magnitude to the cell-to-cell variability, but in Hit and FA it was, surprisingly, ~2.6-fold lower (Miss: 0.94, CR: 0.69, Hit: 0.25, FA: 0.20). This means that while the response to tone (without reinforcement) was as variable at the level of individual mice as at the level of individual cells, the reinforcement-related response was less variable across animals, and differences rather came from the cellular level. This latter statement is in good agreement with the PCA results, where the separation did not happen according to the imaging section (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The stability of the VIP+ interneuron response to Hit and FA across trials should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed an analysis to check the stability of the VIP interneuron response.

We added this panel to Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A discrepancy exists with published data that do not show large responsiveness of VIP neurons to reward in visual and barrel cortices. The authors hypothesize that VIP neurons might only respond to reward and punishment during learning. This is the reason they use mice in the phase of task acquisition, that still have &quot;enough&quot; FA trials, while the published studies measure VIP activity in overtrained mice. To solidify this suspicion, the authors could show that, once their mice have fully mastered the task, the reinforcer responses in VIP cells are in fact reduced or absent. This could harmonize their results with these published studies and significantly strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point and actually true. We are working on a second manuscript addressing that in detail – see response to editor above.</p><p>However, in our opinion, data in Figure 2—figure supplement 2D already support this view: we show there and in the connected linear regression analysis the relative size of the average cue response compared to the average reinforcement response as a reference (as described in the methods), as a function of the hit rate, which is a behavioral performance parameter. ∆F/F<sub>tone</sub> is larger when the hit rate is higher, and the hit rate in our best-performing animals (70-79%) was just slightly lower than that found by Khan et al., 2018, Sachidhanandam et al., 2016 (~85% accuracy, hit rate&gt;80%). We have added a sentence to the corresponding part of the discussion for clarification:</p><p>“Those studies, however, used over trained animals for which little to no punishment was delivered and reward delivery was fully predictable. One study limited to the amygdala indeed showed that reinforcement recruits VIP neurons in a time-limited manner (Krabbe et al. 2019). In line with that, in our measurements from well-performing animals, the cue component dominated the signal (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: Why are the averages in Figure 1 C and D not corresponding? From the legend it appears all curves should be the averages of the above shown 120 VIP cells. Yet their relative amplitude, as well as time course is definitely different. The hit-curve in 1C seems to start to rise before reward delivery, yet this does not seem to be the case in 1D. In 1D it is unclear what the CR and miss trials are aligned to. Is there really error bars on the bottom plots in 1C as mentioned in the legend?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the legend of Figure 1 was not specific enough. Figure 1C top shows individual trials for Miss, CR, Hit, and FA from the 120 VIP neurons recorded simultaneously. The bottom 4 traces are the corresponding averaged activity of the 120 cells during the 4 individual trials. In contrast, Figure 1D indicates averages of 120 cells and 128 trials (session averages). We have now clarified this information in the legend. This also explains why the mean ± SEM values are not visible: mean, mean ± SEM transients overlap at this high n number (n = 120 × 128 = 15,360). We use thinner lines now and a darker shade of gray, therefore SEM values are more easily distinguished. We have also magnified the traces and aligned the baseline. In panel D Miss and CR traces were aligned to the expected onset of the reinforcement delivery, calculated as the sum of the time between triggering and receiving the reinforcement (fixed 0.5 s) and the time elapsed between stimulus onset and the lick that triggered reinforcement (reaction time). We used the same method to align Miss &amp; CR trials in Figure 2A.</p><p>In Figure 1D legend we now say:</p><p>“Left, average transients of a measurement session (128 trials) for Hit (green), FA (red), Miss (dark blue), and CR (light blue) responses recorded from the 120 VIP interneurons. Gray triangle marks the reinforcement onset in case of Hit and FA. Averages of Miss and CR trials were aligned according to the expected reinforcement delivery calculated based on the average reaction time. Right, average synchronicity (mean ± SEM) and trial-to-trial repeatability (reliability) of individual neuronal responses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was MPta chosen for this figure simply because it yielded the biggest n? In Figure 2 it appears to almost be an outlier of all the imaged areas, as it is one of very few areas where VIP neurons appear to entirely lack sensory responses.</p></disp-quote><p>The cortical location of the imaging site did not significantly affect the size of the cue response. For example, in our other Mpta recording, VIP cells were recruited mainly by the cue onset (Figure 2A). Consistently, we did not find any area-specific modulation of the sensory response within the dorsal cortex (p=0.41, see Behavioral performance influences task-related VIP interneuron responses), the hit rate is a better determining factor as it can cause ~5-fold change in the amplitude of the tone-associated component of the response. For better visibility we have made the arrowheads in Figure 2A smaller and used thinner traces to show the cue and reinforcement components more clearly.</p><p>However, it is true that we selected this particular Mpta measurement because of the high cell number and the high SNR, as it can demonstrate the main advantages of our random-access scanning system, recording sparsely-labeled interneuron populations from a large volume with good temporal and spatial resolution. As in Table S1 we made a theoretical comparison between imaging systems with different operation principles: it looked reasonable to represent this technical aspect on the first figure too.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: In panel A it is exceedingly hard to distinguish the thin lines from the same color thick lines and thus see potential sensory responses in any of the areas, perhaps one could change the hue slightly or use the different shade of blue as in panel H? In general, a different color scheme could be considered for accessibility reasons. And a legend should be added.</p><p>For the speaker sign at the bottom of B it is unclear where the start of the auditory cue is, and if it is the same for all the lines of a plot.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive comment. We have now used a different color code for Miss and CR and have modified the legend accordingly. Regarding the auditory cue, it is important to note that FA- and Hit-associated transients were aligned to reinforcement onset before averaging. Therefore, the cue onset time could vary from trial-to-trial covering a narrow interval (for example in fiber photometry measurements, reaction times in Hit and FA trials were 0.35 ± 0.147 s and 0.84 ± 0.108 s). To clarify the interpretation, we have added this information to the figure legends. In addition, we now use thinner lines for Hit and FA for better visibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The time courses here, as well as the ones in F make it seem as though in this data set there was a fixed interval between cue presentation and reinforcer delivery. Or is it similar to Pi et al., where the animals triggered the reinforcer by licking. This is not mentioned anywhere.</p></disp-quote><p>In this aspect our task was identical to the one used in Pi et al., 2013: the animal had to lick to receive reward, thus the interval between tone and reinforcement onset varied from trial to trial (for average traces aligned to the tone onset see Figure 2—figure supplement 2C about time warping).</p><p>Accordingly, in Figure 2A, speakers indicate the average and in Figure 2B the approximate time of tone onset in the Hit and FA trials. However, there was a difference between the 2-photon and the photometry setups: for photometry, the tone stopped immediately after the lick that triggered reinforcement. We have now added this information to the methods section and the figure legend.</p><p>In the methods section we now say:</p><p>“The absence of licking in go trials was not rewarded (Miss trials). If the animal correctly withheld licking to no-go tones (correct rejection, CR), the air puff was omitted. The time interval between tone and reinforcement onset was a function of the reaction time of the animal. In the figures, responses were aligned to reinforcement onset before averaging in FA and Hit which resulted in a jitter in cue onset time. Reinforcement came 0.5 s after it was triggered, except for during the fiber photometry recordings where reinforcers were delivered upon licking (see below).”</p><p>“The photometry experiment used the updated version of Bpod that allows the tones to stop immediately when a mouse licks during the tone. Therefore, the duration of tone in the Hit and FA trials varied. Note that when the behavioral task was set up for the two-photon experiment, this function was not available in Bpod and the tone duration was fixed to 0.5 s for all trial types.”</p><p>In Figure 2F, we applied PCA on the period from 0-4 s after reward delivery (see methods) in Hit trials to quantify sources of variance of the reward-related response. As the tone response occurred before this period, this component appears to be more homogenized across the clusters, especially because these clusters reflected cell-to-cell rather than animal-to-animal variance (compare Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and Figure 2F tSNE plots and see also the new analysis of inter-individual variance and the related Figure 2—figure supplement 2E). In addition, Figure 2F contains only data from cells that were significantly responsive in Hit trials, therefore the heterogeneity is already reduced compared to Figure 2A, as non-responsive cells are not depicted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One session in M1 (hits), as well as one session in M2 (FAs), VIP neurons seem to respond before the onset of the auditory stimulus (judging from the other areas time courses), why is this?</p></disp-quote><p>As we explained in the previous point, FA and Hit responses were aligned to the reinforcement onset time. The small jitter (~100 ms SEM) in the reaction time blurred the rise of the cue-associated component during averaging which resulted in a slowly rising, ramp-like component. Therefore the speaker sign in Figure 2B indicates the approximate, and not the exact, onset of the auditory stimulus. In the case of the M1 and M2 measurements referred to, both reaction time and jitter of the reaction time was ordinary, but a small positive trend was observed in the baseline period that resulted in a relatively large color change with the previous improper color settings, which we have now corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All abbreviations should be explained in the legend (esp. panels F,G,H)</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 C,D,E: why were these areas chosen, or which areas are included in each of these plots?

Why is this bump absent from hit and FA trials?</p></disp-quote><p>In our task design in the photometry experiment, if a mouse licked during go or no-go tones, the tones stopped immediately and a reward or punishment was delivered. The reaction time of mice in the Hit and FA trials were 0.35 ± 0.147 s and 0.84 ± 0.108 s, respectively. Considering the slow response time of GCaMP (compared to electrical signals) and photometry collecting population signals, it is a short time window for a bump to be developed. After a discussion and feedback from our colleagues, we decided to align the calcium traces of Miss and CR to the mean reaction time and added an explanation to the legend of Figure S1D, which is now Figure 1—figure supplement 1E. Traces in Figure 2A were also adjusted accordingly.

In Miss and CR trials, the speed difference was calculated between the tone delivery time period (0-2 s interval after tone onset) and baseline time period (−2-0 s interval before tone onset).

Reaction time periods are not even mentioned in the description of the task. Please explain time-wrapping. Why is 1.5s 30 data points when the sampling rate is 27.7 Hz and not 20Hz? Why are only 10 trials selected? Why the first? Why is K then 40?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now improved the TCA-related methods section according to the reviewer’s comment. As for the specific points raised by the reviewer:</p><p>1. The single-trial traces were smooth using the MATLAB smooth function</p><p>2. The sampling rate of our AOD-2p recordings varied depending on the number of cells being recorded. For the TCA, all trials were aligned to the start of the cue delivery. However, because of the varying sampling rate, the subsequent delivery of the outcome (Hit and FA) does not align across sessions. The jitter in reaction time also resulted in variance of the recorded frames across trials (see more about the reaction time in the “Auditory discrimination task” section of methods). Applying TCA or any type of clustering without fixing these sampling rate and reaction time related jitters could lead to a classification according to the sampling rate and not to the trial types or other task-related event. Thus, we decided to mitigate this risk by ‘time-warping’ the period corresponding to the cue delivery as described in Williams et al., 2018 (i.e., down- or up-sampling to 20 Hz and fixing the time between tone reinforcement delivery to 1.5 s).</p><p>3. The number of trials of each type varies across sessions. To build an N×K×T matrix where N is the number of neurons coming from different sessions, K the trial numbers (10 per trial type = 40 total) and T the time, we had to select the same number of trials for each neuron coming from different sessions. We used 10 trials per trial type per session/neuron as it allowed us to include all sessions (i.e., all neurons) while maintaining an equal representation of all trial types. Our rationale for using the first 10 trials of each trial type was that it would limit the variability in the animal states. However, we did try using 10 trials per trial type at random and observed the same effect.</p><p>We now say in the discussion:</p><p>“We applied Tensor Component Analysis (TCA) (Kolda and Bader, 2009; Williams et al., 2018) on somatic ca<sup>2+</sup> responses recorded during the discrimination task. After smoothing, single-trial neural activities corresponding to the reaction time periods for Hit and FA trials were time-wrapped to a fixed 1.5 s / 30 data points in length. This step was necessary because: 1, the reaction time varied from trial to trial; and 2, the variable number of neurons recorded in the different sessions led to a variable sampling rate for imaging. These factors led to a trial- and session-dependent number of images between the cue and the reward delivery. All recordings were rendered non-negative by subtracting the minimal fluorescence ΔF/F value for each cell. Data were finally normalized by dividing by the average maximum fluorescence ΔF/F value of Hit-only trials. Only the first 10 trials of each type were then selected for each cell and each session and assembled in an N×T×K matrix where N=771 neurons, T=time (s), K=40 trials. TCA reconstruction error was computed with different latent numbers [1,2,3,4,5,10,15,20] with 10 different initial conditions for each latent number. Using 3 latents led to a reconstruction error of 21%.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary figure S3C is never mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.
