which a given HC can respond to cues such as sound, head movements, and water pressure. Notably, vestibular sensory organs of the inner ear, the maculae, exhibit a line of polarity reversal (LPR) across which, hair bundles are polarized in a mirror-image pattern. Similarly, HCs in neuromasts of the zebrafish lateral line system are generated as pairs, and two sibling HCs develop opposite hair bundle orientations. Within these sensory organs, expression of the transcription factor Emx2 is restricted to only one side of the LPR in the maculae or one of the two sibling HCs in neuromasts. Emx2 mediates hair bundle polarity reversal in these restricted subsets of HCs and generates the mirror-image pattern of the sensory organs. Downstream effectors of Emx2 control bundle polarity cell-autonomously via heterotrimeric G proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23661.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23661.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>inner ear</kwd><kwd>neuromast</kwd><kwd>planar cell polarity</kwd><kwd>utricle</kwd><kwd>saccule</kwd><kwd>line of polarity reversal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kindt</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Doris K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Emx2 reverses hair bundle orientation in sensory hair cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The asymmetric location of cilia on the apical surface of epithelial cells is critical for many functions such as left-right asymmetry and normal flow of the cerebral spinal fluid. Abnormal positioning of the monocilium in the node and multicilia of ependymal cells lining the brain ventricles can lead to left-right asymmetry defects and hydrocephalus, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tissir et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, the asymmetrical orientation or polarity of hair bundle on top of sensory HCs provides the directional sensitivity for detecting sensory inputs in the form of vibrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shotwell et al., 1981</xref>). The mechanisms underlying the precise positioning of hair bundle are unclear.</p><p>Each hair bundle is comprised of specialized microvilli (also called stereocilia) arranged in a staircase pattern that are tethered to the kinocilium, a true cilium. Deflection of the hair bundle towards its kinocilium leads to the opening of the mechanotransduction channels located on the tips of stereocilia and depolarizes the HC. Hair bundle displacement in the opposite direction results in hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shotwell et al., 1981</xref>). Therefore, the orientation and positioning of the hair bundle determine the directional sensitivity of the HC.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23661.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Regional expression of <italic>Emx2</italic> in the maculae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Medial view of a mouse left inner ear with its six sensory organs (grey).

The organ of Corti (sensory organ for sound detection) and the three cristae (vestibular organs for detecting angular acceleration) exhibit a polarity pattern where all the hair bundles are polarized in the same direction (unidirectional). In contrast, maculae of the utricle and saccule, vestibular organs for detecting linear acceleration, are divided by the LPR into two regions with opposing hair bundle polarities. Across the LPR, hair bundles are oriented toward each other in the utricle and away from each other in the saccule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Similar to the hair bundle polarity pattern in the utricle, HCs in neuromast organs of the zebrafish lateral line are also oriented toward each other in a 1:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">López-Schier et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Asymmetric localization of the hair bundle begins with the docking of the basal body to the center of the apical surface to form the kinocilium. The nascent kinocilium then moves from the center to the periphery where adjacent specialized-microvilli gradually differentiate into a staircase architecture and establishes the intrinsic polarity of the hair bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu and Sipe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tilney et al., 1992</xref>). The directed movement of the kinocilium and subsequent staircase formation of the stereocilia in each HC require an intracellular complex, Insc/LGN/Gαi, which has been determined to mediate spindle orientation during mitosis in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morin and Bellaïche, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lu and Sipe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2016</xref>). This complex, tethered to the cell cortex of sensory HCs, presumably relocates the basal body/nascent kinocilium to the cell periphery via the attached microtubules, in a manner similar to relocating centrioles during mitosis. In humans, mutations of LGN (also known as GPSM2) cause a syndromic hearing loss suggesting that the directed kinocilium migration and bundle assembly are critical for hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doherty et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In addition to establishing the intrinsic polarity of individual HCs, precise arrangement of hair bundle patterns in each inner ear organ is regulated by global and intercellular signaling mechanisms as well. The global polarity signaling molecules Wnts are required for establishing directional polarity in the developing mouse limb bud and <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2011</xref>), as well as hair bundle alignment in the organ of Corti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dabdoub and Kelley, 2005</xref>). A highly conserved intercellular signaling pathway, the core planar cell polarity (cPCP) pathway, coordinates polarity between adjacent cells. This cPCP complex is comprised of transmembrane proteins Van Gogh (Vang), Frizzled (Fz), and Celsr as well as cytoplasmic proteins such as Dishevelled (Dvl) and Prickle (Pk) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goodrich and Strutt, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wallingford, 2012</xref>). Mutations of cPCP components such as Van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2), Fz, and Dvl, affect the coordinated alignment of hair bundles among HCs but not the peripheral positioning of the kinocilium or the intrinsic bundle polarity of individual HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Montcouquiol et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2006</xref>).</p><p>Hair bundles are misaligned in the maculae of <italic>Vangl2</italic> mutants and the LPR is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montcouquiol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is debatable whether this complex is directly involved in the LPR establishment because the distribution of cPCP components such as Prickle-like 2 (Pk2) and Vangl2 are not reversed across the LPR in normal maculae as predicted by the polarity of the hair bundle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deans et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, all hair bundles were orientated in the same direction and the LPR was reportedly absent in knockout maculae of <italic>Emx2,</italic> which encodes a homeobox-containing transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holley et al., 2010</xref>). This defect was attributed to an imbalance between proliferation and differentiation of sensory precursors rather than a specific role for Emx2 in directing hair bundle polarity.</p><p>In our study, we show that <italic>Emx2</italic> expression is required to reverse hair bundles from their ‘default’ polarity in the macula and neuromast. Ectopic expression of <italic>Emx2</italic> in HCs is sufficient to reverse the ‘default’ bundle polarity. Our loss- and gain-of-function experiments in both inner ear and neuromast indicate that Emx2 is necessary and sufficient to mediate hair bundle orientation in vertebrate HCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The border of <italic>Emx2</italic> expression domain coincides with the LPR in maculae</title><p>We investigated the reported hair bundle polarity phenotype in <italic>Emx2</italic> knockout maculae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holley et al., 2010</xref>) by examining the normal expression pattern of Emx2. Using both in situ hybridization and immunostaining, we found that Emx2 expression is restricted to the lateral extrastriolar region (LES) of the utricle and inner region (IR) of the saccule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C,C’,F,F’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). The border of the Emx2 expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C’,F’</xref>, green line bordering the green region) closely follows the LPR in the two maculae, at the lateral edge of the oncomodulin-positive striola in the utricle and at the center of the saccule bisecting the striola (blue outlined; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desai et al., 2005</xref>). The coincidence of the Emx2 border (green line) with the LPR (yellow line) was confirmed by comparing Emx2 immunoreactivity to hair bundle polarity. We used the absence of anti-spectrin staining at the kinocilium location for determining hair bundle polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E’,G–H’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deans et al., 2007</xref>). Using this approach, we found that only HCs lateral to the LPR in the utricle and internal to the LPR in the saccule are Emx2 positive and they show polarities different from the rest of the maculae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E’,G–H’</xref>, arrows). These results indicate that <italic>Emx2</italic> expression is restricted to one side of the LPR in the maculae that share the same hair bundle polarity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The LES and IR regions are preserved in <italic>Emx2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> maculae</title><p>Extrapolating from the normal restricted expression of <italic>Emx2</italic> shown above and the unidirectional polarity phenotype previously reported in <italic>Emx2</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holley et al., 2010</xref>) suggest that <italic>Emx2</italic> has a role in regional hair bundle polarity patterning. However, since <italic>Emx2</italic> encodes a transcription factor and has been implicated in regional patterning in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellegrini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyamoto et al., 1997</xref>), the lack of LPR in <italic>Emx2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> maculae could be caused by the loss of the <italic>Emx2</italic> expression domain rather than altering the hair bundle polarity. Indeed, the area of the maculae was reported to be smaller in <italic>Emx2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants than wildtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holley et al., 2010</xref>). To address this possibility, we took a genetic approach. First, we lineage-traced the descendants of <italic>Emx2</italic> expressing cells in wildtype by crossing <italic>Emx2<sup>Cre/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kimura et al., 2005</xref>) to <italic>Cre</italic> reporter mice, <italic>Rosa<sup>tdT/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Rosa<sup>mT/mG</sup></italic>. The lineage-traced domain of <italic>Emx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D,I–L</xref>) corresponded to its expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–H’</xref>), regionally restricted to the LES of utricle and IR of saccule. Within the <italic>Emx2</italic>-lineage domain of the two maculae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C,J–K</xref>, green), hair bundles were oriented in the opposite direction from the rest of the sensory organ. The border of the lineage domain in the maculae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C,I–K</xref>, cyan line) largely coincided with the LPR (yellow line). Immediately lateral or inside of the LPR in the respective utricle and saccule, there were occasional cre reporter-negative HCs with reversed polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, asterisks) but these cells were invariably positive for Emx2 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E’,H’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, asterisks). By contrast, medial or outside of the LPR in the respective utricle and saccule, there were also cre-reporter positive HCs with default polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, arrowheads) but they were negative for Emx2 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E’H’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, arrowheads). These cre-reporter positive HCs with default polarity were particularly abundant in the posterior-ventral region of the saccule where the border of <italic>Emx2</italic>-lineage domain and LPR diverged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, double-headed arrow). Overall, these results indicate that the border of the <italic>Emx2</italic>-lineage domain, though not as faithful as the immunostaining results, corresponds reasonably well with the LPR.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23661.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The Emx2 lineage domain is present in <italic>Emx2</italic> functional null maculae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) and (<bold>I</bold>–<bold>K</bold>) are the same specimens as (<bold>C</bold>–<bold>E’</bold>) and (<bold>F</bold>–<bold>H’</bold>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

For example, sensory progenitors expressing Emx2 may remain in the cell cycle longer and fail to respond to polarity signal(s) that are instructing post-mitotic HCs in non-Emx2 regions. We addressed this possibility by comparing the timing of HC terminal mitosis between <italic>Emx2</italic> heterozygous and knockout utricles. A thymidine analog, EdU, was injected intraperitoneally to pregnant dams between embryonic day (E) 11.5 to E16.5, and embryos were harvested at E18.5. Myosin VIIa-positive HCs with strong EdU labeling served as a proxy for the time of terminal mitosis. Although our results indicate that HC precursors in the LES (where Emx2 is normally expressed) undergo terminal mitosis later than the rest of the maculae, we did not observe any obvious difference in this timing between controls and <italic>Emx2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> utricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Compared to hair bundles pointing toward the LPR in control utricles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), the LPR was absent in GOF-SE early mutants.

This ability of ectopic <italic>Emx2</italic> to reverse hair bundle polarity is developmentally dependent. By delaying the tamoxifen administration to E15.5 and E16.5 (GOF-SE late), at which time many HC precursors have undergone terminal mitosis and started to differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), only a partial polarity phenotype was observed in the medial utricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I,P–Q</xref>, region M).

In other systems, the Insc/LGN/Gαi complex is often associated with one of the members of Par membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Pietro et al., 2016</xref>). By contrast, a Par protein, Par6, is found complementary to the Insc/LGN/Gαi complex in HCs and located opposite the kinocilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>). The distribution patterns of Gαi and Par6 are reversed across the LPR, in alignment with the position of the kinocilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>), in contrast to the cPCP proteins.

Therefore, these results suggest that by delaying ectopic <italic>Emx2</italic> expression until after E15.5, while Emx2 can no longer change the position of kinocilia that has already been established, it can still effectively alter the distribution of Gαi and Par6.

The relocated hair bundle to the same side of the HC in Ptx mutants where the cPCP protein Fz is located, is similar to other epithelial cells in the brain and wing, which we considered to be the default pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strutt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vladar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tree et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boutin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guirao et al., 2010</xref>). The bundle polarity phenotype caused by Ptx suggests that heterotrimeric G proteins are normally required to reverse the kinocilium from its default location in the cochlea. Since cochlear HCs express <italic>Emx2</italic> and ectopic <italic>Emx2</italic> is capable of affecting Gαi localization independent of the kinocilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N–O”</xref>), we hypothesized that Emx2 normally utilizes the Insc/LGN/Gαi complex to change the kinocilium from the default location in cochlear HCs. Under this scenario, Ptx should affect the hair bundle position in macular regions where <italic>Emx2</italic> is expressed and may have no effect in the <italic>Emx2</italic>-negative regions.

The molecular mechanisms of these cross-talks are not well understood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>). The regional expression pattern of Emx2 in the maculae and its role in reversing hair bundle polarity within its expression domain qualifies this transcription factor as a global polarity cue. Since distribution of the cPCP proteins in maculae is not changed between Emx2-positive and negative regions across the LPR suggests that HCs in the Emx2 domain normally do not undergo cellular rotation to acquire the polarity reversal pattern, as in the case of ommatidia formation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jenny, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the normal distribution of cPCP proteins in <italic>Emx2</italic> mutants indicates that <italic>Emx2</italic> effectors function either independently or downstream from the cPCP proteins.</p><p>In most other epithelial tissues, trichomes or cilia are associated with the side of the cell where Fz is located and opposite to the side where Vangl and Pk are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strutt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vladar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tree et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boutin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guirao et al., 2010</xref>). A similar pattern is observed in the medial utricle. However, the relationship between distribution of cPCP proteins and hair bundle polarity appears to be reversed in the presence of <italic>Emx2</italic>. For example, hair bundles in <italic>Emx2</italic>-positive domains are located opposite to the Fz expression in cochlear HCs and are associated with Pk in lateral utricular HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deans et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montcouquiol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang and Nathans, 2007</xref>).

The abnormal ratio of isoforms between <italic>pk</italic> and <italic>spiny-legs (pk:sple</italic>) does not affect the distribution of Dachsous or Fat but changes the effective dose of Dachs (atypical myosin), an effector of the Dachsous-Fat polarity pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olofsson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayukawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambegaonkar and Irvine, 2015</xref>). Consequently, localization of fz and strabismus (Vangl in mammals) as well as the trichomes are reversed in the wing and abdomen of fly mutants. In a similar manner, Emx2 could regulate downstream effectors of the cPCP proteins and alter the intrinsic hair bundle polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>). The cPCP effectors are known to affect the cilia position in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wong and Adler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carvajal-Gonzalez et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2016b</xref>) and centrioles/basal body positioning could be the level where the Emx2 effectors alter the interpretation of the intercellular polarity cues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Emx2 mediates hair bundle positioning via the heterotrimeric G proteins</title><p>As a transcription factor, Emx2 regulates diverse cellular pathways such as regional specification, cell proliferation and fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pellegrini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tole et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mallamaci et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that Emx2’s effects on hair bundle reversal is indirect, resulting from changing the HC fate or other cellular pathways. Nevertheless, whichever the pathway(s) might be, the outcome is a cell-autonomous switch in the location of the hair bundle by 180°, in part, via the heterotrimeric G proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref>). This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence. First, ectopic <italic>Emx2</italic> is sufficient to relocate Gαi and Par6 even after the kinocilium is established suggests that Emx2 effectors regulate intracellular polarity signaling. Second, the ability of Ptx to block hair bundle polarity of Emx2-positive HCs in cochlea and maculae, though variable in efficiency among different mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>), suggest that heterotrimeric G proteins are critical for this process. Third, the ability of Ptx to block ectopic Emx2’s effects on polarity further supports the requirement of G proteins by Emx2 effectors. Extrapolating from previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ezan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tarchini et al., 2013</xref>), Emx2 effectors most likely mediate the change in hair bundle position via the Insc/LGN/Gαi complex. Additionally, our results suggest that this Insc/LGN/Gαi complex is more important for <italic>Emx2-</italic>positive than negative regions and other mechanisms are required for targeting the kinocilium in <italic>Emx2</italic>-negative HCs. Taken together, our results illustrate a global polarity cue bypasses the cPCP proteins and functions at the intracellular level.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Other roles of Emx2</title><p>Our results link Emx2 to basal body positioning in sensory HCs.

Though speculative, it is possible that Emx2 effectors could function at multiple steps of a cell cycle: spindle orientation during mitosis and/or basal body positioning during differentiation. Identifying these effectors will be important. Furthermore, in both maculae and neuromasts, HCs with opposite hair bundle polarities are innervated by different populations of neurons that project, at least in the maculae, to different regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maklad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagiel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pujol-Martí et al., 2014</xref>). These innervation patterns could be guided by downstream targets of Emx2, and Emx2 has also been implicated in mediating neuronal migration in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shinozaki et al., 2002</xref>). In summary, our results demonstrated a conserved role of Emx2 in mediating hair bundle polarity in sensory HCs.

EdU-labeled cells were detected with a Click-iT reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bok et al., 2013</xref>; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Processed utricles were then flat-mounted and imaged using LSM780 confocal microscopy.</p><p>Under this injection regiment, HC precursors that underwent terminal mitosis soon after EdU incorporation should be strongly labeled, whereas precursors that have already exited from the cell cycle at the time of EdU delivery should not be labeled. HC precursors that underwent several rounds of cell division after EdU incorporation should have weak or no EdU labeling in the nucleus. Since weak EdU labeling can also be a result of HC precursors that incorporated EdU at the end of S phase of the last cell cycle, we scored all Myosin VIIa-positive HCs that have robust or distinct EdU labeling in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). For quantification of EdU-labeled HCs, the utricle was divided into three regions: striola, lateral and medial extrastriolar regions (LES and MES). Oncomodulin-positive region was marked as striola. The separation between LES and MES was defined by drawing a straight line linking the two ends of oncomodulin-positive striolar region to the edge of the utricle as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>.

Within regions 1 and 3, total number of HCs per 0.01 mm<sup>2</sup> and apical surface area of HCs were scored as representatives for the lateral and medial region of the utricle, respectively.</p><p>For hair bundle orientation analyses, regions 1 and 3 were further divided into three equal sections. Hair bundle angles were measured in the middle one-third, defined as regions L (lateral) and M (medial, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4P</xref>). Each region contains at least 50 HCs. The hair bundle angle of each HC was measured based on the position of the kinocilium on the apical surface by defining 0° as the anterior apex of the utricle and the medial side as 90<sup>o</sup>.

Briefly, larvae were anesthetized with 0.03% 3-amino benzoic acid ethylester (MESAB, Western Chemical, Ferndale, WA) in E3, and mounted with tungsten pins onto a Sylgard recording chamber. Larvae were then microinjected in the heart with 125 μM α-bungarotoxin (Tocris, Bristol, UK) to suppress muscle activity. After paralysis, calcium imaging was performed in extracellular solution in mM: 130 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3, 290 mOsm. A pressure clamp (HSPC-1, ALA Scientific, New York, NY) attached to a glass pipette (tip diameter ~30–50 μm) was filled with extracellular solution and used to mechanically stimulate HCs along the anterior-posterior axis of the fish. Calcium measurements were made on a Nikon Eclipse NiE microscope using a 60 × 1.0 NA CFI Fluor water-immersion objective and the following filter set: excitation: 480/30 and emission: 535/40. The microscope was equipped with an Orca D2 camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan), and images were acquired using Elements software (Nikon Instruments Inc., Melville, NY).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

I was, too.</p><p>I am including the three reviews (lightly edited) at the end of this letter, as there are a variety of specific and useful suggestions in them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Transcription factor Emx2 controls stereocilia polarity of sensory hair cells&quot; by Tao Jiang and colleagues, the role of the transcription factor Emx2 is analyzed within the context of the polarization of mechanosensory hair cells in the murine inner ear, as well as the ear of the chicken and the ear and lateral line of zebrafish.</p><p>This manuscript tackles an important question, and a problem that has remained puzzling. It is well written and generally of very high quality. Overall, I believe that it will have a major impact and be of general interest. I support its publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes the role of Emx2 in the development of planar polarity and specifically the role of Emx2 in coordinating the orientation of polarized stereociliary bundles about a line of polarity reversal (LPR) in the utricular and saccular maculae. This effort builds upon a prior study of Emx2 mutants that showed loss of the LPR and vestibular hair cells with bundles oriented in a single, uniform direction (Holley et al). The current work provides an in-depth analysis of Emx2 expression, characterization of a complementary overexpression model, and establishes a regulatory connection with the Gαi/Par signaling pathway. Based upon this body of work Emx2 is proposed to function as a global regulator of planar polarity, and principles of this function are shown to be conserved in zebrafish and chick. This is an important contribution to the planar polarity and inner ear research fields. Unfortunately, the figures are assembled in a very dense style which in some instances is a disservice to the complicated and beautiful anatomy of the system and may be difficult to interpret by readers outside of the inner ear field.</p><p>1) inconsistencies between <italic>Emx2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and stereociliary bundle orientation</p><p><italic>Emx2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> lineage tracing data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and K</xref> each reveal hair cells with stereociliary bundle orientations that match the lateral region of the utricle (2C) or the inner region of the saccule (2K), but do not show evidence of <italic>Emx2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> activity. This contradicts an untested theme of the manuscript that Emx2 (b/c it is a transcription factor) functions autonomously within cells to direct stereociliary bundle orientation.</p><p>An alternative interpretation raised by this lineage tracing data is that Emx2 functions non-cell autonomously. – Perhaps by regulating the expression of a short range secreted factor that is sufficient to initiate all of the cell polarity functions attributed to Emx2. At a minimum, the difference between <italic>Emx2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> lineage tracing and stereociliary bundle orientation should be a point of discussion. Preferably experiments can be conducted to test the autonomy of the Emx2 mutant phenotype or whether this difference is corrected postnatally.</p><p>2) No evaluation of maculae size or area</p><p>In the original Holley et al. paper it was reported that, in addition to the changes in stereociliary bundle orientation, there was a reduction in the overall area of the sensory epithelia of the saccule. This could be interpreted as evidence that this region of the saccule is specified by Emx2, and as a result is missing in Emx2 mutant thereby yielding a smaller saccule. The authors could address this lingering interpretation of the Holley et al. study, that Emx2 has a role in specification (in addition to or rather than global polarity), by measuring sensory epithelia area for the utricle and saccule in these Emx2 mutant lines. This would be a complement to the EDU experiments already presented.</p><p>3) Incomplete analysis of late-stage Emx2 overexpression (<italic>Sox2<sup>CreERt2</sup>, Rosa<sup>Emx2/+</sup></italic>) experiments</p><p>Based upon experiments in which Emx2 expression is activated at later stages of development it is proposed that Emx2 regulates stereociliary bundle orientation by directing the polarized distribution of Gαi/Par6 relative to the core PCP axis. In these experiments Emx2 is proposed to rapidly alter Gαi or Par6 distribution but occurs too late to alter stereociliary bundle orientation. However, in each figure there are also hair cells with misoriented stereociliary bundles that do not appear to have either a lateral or a medial orientation (blue arrows). Investigating the basis of these hair cells further may provide mechanistic insight.</p><p>One possibility is that the distribution of PCP proteins are also changed in these cells and that these bundles remain properly oriented along this new PCP protein axis – independent of Gαi. This could be evaluated by looking at Pk2 distribution in <italic>Sox2<sup>Cre</sup>, Rosa<sup>Emx2+</sup></italic> tissue. A second possibility is that the stereociliary bundles are dynamically reorienting in response to the Emx2-dependent changes in Gαi or Par6 distributions, and that hair cells represented by blue arrows in these figures are actually in a transition state. This latter point could be evaluated by looking at a later stage when reorientation might be complete.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>, this image should span the <italic>Emx2<sup>Cre</sup></italic> boundary (similar to 2C, 2G and 2K) in order to demonstrate these hair cells have the same orientation in Emx2 mutants.</p><p>2) It is very difficult to see the polarity of hair cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Are the overview images necessary and if removed could the hair cell images be enlarged?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> black boxes obscure the lateral region of the utricle in several panels.</p><p>4) Several instances where triple labeling is presented that might not be critical for presentation or data interpretation. Simplifying the figures might make the data more accessible. For example, 1E' and 1H' do not need the red channel, similarly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the relative distribution of EDU and the striola could be easier to see without myosin VII labeling (red, 3A', 3D', etc.)</p><p>5) Text and grammatical errors are present throughout.</p><p>A) 'Stereocilia bundle' is not the correct term for this structure. It is either a 'bundle of stereocilia' or a 'stereociliary bundle'.</p><p>B) 'Stereocilia polarity' is similarly not an accurate term. Individual stereocilia do not show planar polarity and instead are polarized based upon actin filament organization and the position of the barbed end. The organization that is being referred to in the manuscript is the 'polarity of the stereociliary bundle' and it should be described as such.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Jiang et al. reports the identification of the transcription factor Emx2 as a global regulator of hair bundle orientation in vertebrates. Specifically, hair bundles of sensory hair cells in vertebrate maculae and in zebrafish neuromasts adopt mirror-image polarity along the line of polarity reversal (LPR). Polarity reversal in one domain was found to correlate with Emx2 expression in all species examined (mouse, chick and zebrafish). The authors then performed a series of elegant genetic manipulations in mice and zebrafish to demonstrate that Emx2 is both necessary and sufficient to pattern and re-pattern hair bundle polarity in a cell-autonomous manner. Importantly, the effect of Emx2 on hair bundle polarity was not due to a loss of the Emx2 expressing cell lineage or altered timing of cell cycle exit in the affected region, indicating a specific effect on polarity establishment. At a mechanistic level, the authors provided evidence that Emx2 mediates polarity reversal in part through heterotrimeric G protein signaling. Interestingly, G protein signaling is not required for the &quot;default&quot; orientation of hair bundles in regions where Emx2 is not expressed, suggesting the existence of additional polarity mechanisms. Finally, calcium imaging in zebrafish demonstrated that Emx2-mediated polarity reversal is important for neuromast hair cells' directional response to mechanical stimuli.</p><p>While inter- and intra-cellular Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signaling mechanisms have been extensively studied, a long-standing question of PCP regulation is how positional information along the body axis generates global patterns of PCP. Through thorough loss- and gain-of-function analyses of Emx2 in both mice and zebrafish, this study convincingly demonstrated that Emx2 plays a key role in dictating global patterns of hair cell PCP in the ear and lateral line. While Emx2 target genes important for this process remain to be determined, they likely act to control basal body positioning through the hair cell-intrinsic polarity machinery. Thus, these findings provide significant new insights into the establishment of global PCP patterns essential for the proper function of these sensory end organs.</p><p>I have a couple of suggestions to help strengthen the conclusions of the manuscript:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and related text. In addition to the cell-autonomous effect of Emx2 OE (overexpression), which was nicely shown using the <italic>Gfi1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> driver, could the authors comment on whether there was any non-autonomous effect on re-orienting the hair bundles upon mosaic Emx2 OE driven by <italic>Sox2<sup>CreER</sup></italic> (i.e. were there any GFP negative hair cells being repolarized)?

This contradicts an untested theme of the manuscript that Emx2 (b/c it is a transcription factor) functions autonomously within cells to direct stereociliary bundle orientation.</italic></p><p><italic>An alternative interpretation raised by this lineage tracing data is that Emx2 functions non-cell autonomously. Perhaps by regulating the expression of a short range secreted factor that is sufficient to initiate all of the cell polarity functions attributed to Emx2. At a minimum, the difference between Emx2<sup>Cre</sup> lineage tracing and stereociliary bundle orientation should be a point of discussion. Preferably experiments can be conducted to test the autonomy of the Emx2 mutant phenotype or whether this difference is corrected postnatally.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out those cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and K</xref> that show reversed polarity but no ere reporter activity, which we have inadvertently neglected to explain. Those cells with reversed bundle polarity in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and K</xref>, though negative for cre reporter activity, are indeed positive for Emx2 immunostaining. We took advantage of the fact that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> are taken from the same specimen, and we are now showing identical regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,E’ and H,H’</xref> as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c and k</xref> to illustrate this relationship. In the utricle shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, we counted a total of only 18 hair cells that are immediately lateral to the LPR with reversed polarity and no cre-reporter activity, but these cells are invariably positive for Emx2 immunostaining. In addition, there are also a total of 21 hair cells in this specimen that are immediately medial to the LPR, which show the default polarity and are positive for cre-reporter activity but lack Emx2 immunoreactivity in the nucleus. A similar pattern is observed in the saccule except there are many more cre-positive hair cells with normal polarity but negative for Emx2 staining in the posterior-ventral region(numbers provided in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Together, these results indicate that Emx2 immunostaining is a much better indicator of hair bundle polarity than the Emx2-lineage reporter (subsection “The LES and IR regions are preserved in Emx2<sup>-/-</sup> maculae”, first paragraph and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>).</p><p>A model of non-cell autonomous effect of Emx2 in reversing bundle polarity would predict at least some hair cells with reverse bundle polarity that are negative for Emx2 staining. This was not the case. Hair bundle polarity reversal correlates extremely well with Emx2 immunoreactivities.To this end, we added data from another 2 samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> to illustrate this fact.</p><p><italic>2) No evaluation of maculae size or area</italic></p><p><italic>In the original Holley et al. paper it was reported that, in addition to the changes in stereociliary bundle orientation, there was a reduction in the overall area of the sensory epithelia of the saccule. This could be interpreted as evidence that this region of the saccule is specified by Emx2, and as a result is missing in Emx2 mutant thereby yielding a smaller saccule. The authors could address this lingering interpretation of the Holley et al. study, that Emx2 has a role in specification (in addition to or rather than global polarity), by measuring sensory epithelia area for the utricle and saccule in these Emx2 mutant lines. This would be a complement to the EDU experiments already presented.</italic></p><p>We did not observe a change in the size of the maculae or total number of hair cells in mutant utricles. Those results are now in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) Incomplete analysis of late-stage Emx2 overexpression (Sox2<sup>CreERt2</sup>, Rosa<sup>Emx2/+</sup>) experiments</italic></p><p><italic>Based upon experiments in which Emx2 expression is activated at later stages of development it is proposed that Emx2 regulates stereociliary bundle orientation by directing the polarized distribution of Gαi/Par6 relative to the core PCP axis. In these experiments Emx2 is proposed to rapidly alter Gαi or Par6 distribution but occurs too late to alter stereociliary bundle orientation. However, in each figure there are also hair cells with misoriented stereociliary bundles that do not appear to have either a lateral or a medial orientation (blue arrows). Investigating the basis of these hair cells further may provide mechanistic insight.</italic></p><p><italic>One possibility is that the distribution of PCP proteins are also changed in these cells and that these bundles remain properly oriented along this new PCP protein axis – independent of Gαi. This could be evaluated by looking at Pk2 distribution in Sox2<sup>Cre</sup>, Rosa<sup>Emx2+</sup> tissue.</italic></p><p>The specimen shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N-O&quot;</xref> was not processed for anti-PK2 staining, we have now added another specimen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> showing anti-Pk2 staining after tamoxifen treatment at E15.5 and E16.5. There is no change in the distribution of Pk2 in hair cells with reversed or misoriented bundles, supporting our interpretation that Emx2 functions independently from the cPCP proteins.</p><p><italic>A second possibility is that the stereociliary bundles are dynamically reorienting in response to the Emx2-dependent changes in Gαi or Par6 distributions, and that hair cells represented by blue arrows in these figures are actually in a transition state. This latter point could be evaluated by looking at a later stage when reorientation might be complete.</italic></p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot evaluate the polarity of misoriented hair cells later than the harvesting ages of E18.5 because the <italic>Sox2<sup>Cre</sup>, Rosa<sup>Emx2+</sup></italic> (now relabeled as GOF SE late) mice don't survive at birth. However, we do know that percentages of reversed or misoriented hair bundles in the utricles were even lower when tamoxifen was administered postnatally instead of E15.5 and E16.5, confirming that the ability of hair cells to respond to Emx2 is age-dependent.</p><p><italic>Other concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>1) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>, this image should span the Emx2<sup>Cre</sup> boundary (similar to 2C, 2G and 2K) in order to demonstrate these hair cells have the same orientation in Emx2 mutants.</italic></p><p>Corrected.</p><p><italic>2) It is very difficult to see the polarity of hair cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Are the overview images necessary and if removed could the hair cell images be enlarged?</italic>We have incorporated the reviewer's suggestions in the revised manuscript for both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> by replacing the low power views with schematic diagrams, which allowed more room to show higher magnifications of the hair cells.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> black boxes obscure the lateral region of the utricle in several panels.</italic></p><p>Corrected.</p><p><italic>4) Several instances where triple labeling is presented that might not be critical for presentation or data interpretation. Simplifying the figures might make the data more accessible. For example, 1E' and 1H' do not need the red channel, similarly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the relative distribution of EDU and the striola could be easier to see without myosin VII labeling (red, 3A', 3D', etc.)</italic></p><p>Yes, the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is much clearer now with the suggested changes. However, we feel the red channel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E' and H'</xref> helps to better delineate the boundary of individual hair cells and we kept it.</p><p><italic>5) Text and grammatical errors are present throughout.</italic></p><p><italic>A) 'Stereocilia bundle' is not the correct term for this structure. It is either a 'bundle of stereocilia' or a 'stereociliary bundle'.</italic></p><p>For simplification, we have changed the wording to hair bundle in most of the text.</p><p><italic>B) 'Stereocilia polarity' is similarly not an accurate term. Individual stereocilia do not show planar polarity and instead are polarized based upon actin filament organization and the position of the barbed end. The organization that is being referred to in the manuscript is the 'polarity of the stereociliary bundle' and it should be described as such.</italic></p><p>We now use the term hair bundle polarity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: […] I have a couple of suggestions to help strengthen the conclusions of the manuscript:</italic></p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and related text. In addition to the cell-autonomous effect of Emx2 OE (overexpression), which was nicely shown using the Gfi1<sup>Cre</sup> driver, could the authors comment on whether there was any non-autonomous effect on re-orienting the hair bundles upon mosaic Emx2 OE driven by Sox2-CreER (i.e. were there any GFP negative hair cells being repolarized)? This would be informative in gauging whether Emx2 had any role in regulating intercellular PCP signaling. It is difficult to see which hair cells are GFP positive in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and I</xref>. It would be helpful to enhance the signals of the GFP channel.</italic></p><p>In Emx2 OE driven by Sox2-creER (now labeled as GOF-SE) specimens, GFP is expressed in the entire sensory domain, including both hair cells and supporting cells and we cannot definitively identify any GFP negative hair cells. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref> showing only the green channel for Figure 4D-F and G-I. These data are not informative and we decided not to include them in the manuscript. However, please refer to our response to reviewer#2 item#1 for the lack of evidence for non-cell autonomous effect of Emx2 in altering hair bundle polarity.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23661.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23661.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23661.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-23661-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J-L</xref>.

It would be nice to also show that for the utricle, to further demonstrate the specific effect of Emx2 on hair bundle polarity</italic>.</p><p>The presence of oncomodulin in the Emx2 OE samples is variable but is consistent between the two maculae. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, the oncomodulin staining in the utricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) is sparsely labeled. A similar pattern is observed in the saccule of that specimen (not shown). In contrast, oncomodulin staining is clear in the saccule shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> as well as the utricle (not shown). However, this is the only specimen that shows good antioncomodulin staining out of the five that were processed in a similar manner. These results indicate that ectopic Emx2 does have other effects on hair cells that do not normally express this gene and this effect may be genetic background dependent. This information has been added in the text (subsection “Ectopic Emx2 reverses hair bundle polarity”, first paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
