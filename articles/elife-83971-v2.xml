Still uncertain, however, is how that brain structure participates in the dynamically evolving estimation of value that underlies the ability to delay gratification and wait patiently for a gain. To address that gap in knowledge, we studied the spiking activity of neurons in the STN of monkeys during a task in which animals were required to remain motionless for varying periods of time in order to obtain food reward. At the single-neuron and population levels, we found a cost–benefit integration between the desirability of the expected reward and the imposed delay to reward delivery, with STN signals that dynamically combined both attributes of the reward to form a single integrated estimate of value. This neural encoding of subjective value evolved dynamically across the waiting period that intervened after instruction cue. Moreover, this encoding was distributed inhomogeneously along the antero-posterior axis of the STN such that the most dorso-posterior-placed neurons represented the temporal discounted value most strongly. These findings highlight the selective involvement of the dorso-posterior STN in the representation of temporally discounted rewards. The combination of rewards and time delays into an integrated representation is essential for self-control, the promotion of goal pursuit, and the willingness to bear the costs of time delays.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>delay discounting</kwd><kwd>goal pursuit</kwd><kwd>subthalamic nucleus</kwd><kwd>cost–benefit valuation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 NS113817-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Robert S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 NS091853-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Robert S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cost–benefit integration between the desirability of the expected reward and the imposed delay to delivery is supported by STN signals that dynamically combined both reward-related attributes to form a single integrated value estimate along an antero-posterior axis in this nucleus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Imagine you are standing in a queue in front of a bakery. How long are you willing to wait for your favorite pastry? Many of us lose patience after about 5 min, while others persevere and keep waiting during longer delays. Our individual ability to delay gratification and maintain self-control depends on an internal process that estimates continuously the trade-off between the desirability of the benefit expected and the cost of waiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ainslie, 1975</xref>). All animals, including humans, prefer to receive rewards sooner rather than later, a phenomenon known as temporal discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frederick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loewenstein and Prelec, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mazur, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vanderveldt et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, people with low discount rates tend to pursue their long-term goals patiently, whereas people with high discount rates often abandon their goals impulsively and move on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Janakiraman et al., 2011</xref>). In economic behavior, the net payoff for such a cost–benefit dilemma is typically evaluated by integrating the magnitude of the future reward with a hyperbolic discounting function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Green and Myerson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kirby, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Loewenstein et al., 1992</xref>). Most studies of the neural correlates of temporal discounting have focused on the task instruction period, the point in a trial when the subject is informed of the size of the reward to be delivered and of the delay in time until its delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Berns et al., 2007</xref>). Far less is known about neuronal activity during the subsequent post-instruction delay period, during which subjects may exhibit varying degrees of patience (e.g., self-control) and anticipation of reward. It is quite possible that neuronal activity related to those factors also evolves dynamically across this time period. For example, as the subjective value of a future reward is updated with the passage of time, the motivation to achieve a delayed goal may vary gradually. Indeed, functional imaging studies in humans suggest that neural activity related to temporal discounting evolves dynamically during a post-instruction delay period in patterns that differ distinctly between brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jimura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McGuire and Kable, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tanaka et al., 2020</xref>). How such dynamically evolving encodings of temporally discounted subjective value are instantiated at the single-unit level remains poorly understood.</p><p>Because the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is thought to be crucial in inhibitory control by preventing impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bonnevie and Zaghloul, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</xref>) and modulating the performance of reward-seeking actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Baunez et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Baunez and Robbins, 1997</xref>), we hypothesized that this structure could contribute to the maintenance of adaptive behaviors by dynamically computing the temporally discounted value. The STN occupies a unique position for translating motivational drives into behavioral perseverance, standing at the crossroads between the basal ganglia indirect pathway and many hyperdirect inputs from prefrontal areas involved in motivational, cognitive and motor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haynes and Haber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>). Current functional models of the STN propose that increased activity in the STN extends the time to action initiation by elevating decision thresholds, preventing suboptimal early responses or decisions, especially in situations in which the motivational options are conflicting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mansfield et al., 2011</xref>). In support of these models, a series of lesion studies performed on rats provided causal evidence that STN restrains premature responding in instrumental tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Baunez and Robbins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wiener et al., 2008</xref>) and controls the willingness to work for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Baunez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baunez et al., 2002</xref>). Dysfunctions of STN circuits even produced perseverative actions with a reduced ability to switch between behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baker and Ragozzino, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Baunez et al., 2007</xref>), making this brain region a good candidate for regulating self-control and delayed gratification. Until now, however, existing evidence is mixed on whether the STN is involved in temporal discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aiello et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Evens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Seinstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Seymour et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Uslaner and Robinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Voon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Winstanley et al., 2005</xref>), and no previous study has investigated how STN neurons process value information across delays.</p><p>Aside from its role in motor control, clinical studies support the involvement of the STN in motivational functions. In particular, deep brain stimulation (DBS-STN), which is effective at alleviating motor symptoms in parkinsonian patients, may induce a variety of side effects related to altered motivation such as depression, excessive eating behavior, and hypomania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Berney et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Castrioto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Voon et al., 2006</xref>). Electrophysiological recordings collected from the STN of these patients have shown low-frequency oscillations (&lt;12 Hz) and spiking activities related to various aspects of reward processing, with neural signals modulated by the magnitude of monetary reward and cost–benefit value attribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fumagalli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Justin Rossi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zénon et al., 2016</xref>). In non-human animals, the ability of the STN to represent the subjective desirability of actions has also been evidenced by studies that show neurons firing as a function of the expected reward and the associated effort cost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Breysse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Espinosa-Parrilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nougaret et al., 2022</xref>). Although substantial effort has been directed to elucidate the role of the STN in valuation-related processes at the time of decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Coulthard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Frank et al., 2007</xref>) and in movement incentive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nougaret et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zénon et al., 2016</xref>), much less attention has been paid to STN involvement in the computation of temporally discounted value during a waiting period, when behavioral inhibition must be sustained patiently over time. In addition, it is still unclear how these roles for STN in cost–benefit valuation and motivational processing relate to the known organization of this nucleus into anatomically and functionally distinct territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alexander et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nambu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the STN conveys signals consistent with its predicted role in pursuing delayed gratification, we trained two monkeys to perform a delayed reward task in which animals were required to remain motionless during post-instruction delay periods of varying durations in order to obtain food reward. We hypothesized that STN neurons exhibit a dynamic encoding of temporally discounted value over the time course of the delay period consistent with a continuously evolving value attribution essential for self-control. Here we tested this hypothesis by studying spiking activity in the STN while monkeys performed the task. At the single-neuron and population levels, our results support a role for the STN in temporal discounting and indicate that neural signals underlying the valuation of reward size and delay are integrated dynamically into subjective value along an antero-posterior axis in this nucleus. Such dynamic value integration through the STN may regulate the expression of persistent behaviors for which a continuously evolving cost–benefit estimation is required to monitor and sustain goal achievement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monkeys’ behavior reflects reward size and delay in an integrated manner</title><p>Two monkeys (H and C) were trained to perform a delayed reward task in which they were required to align a cursor on a visual target and to maintain this arm posture for varying periods of time before delivery of food rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the beginning of each trial, an instruction cue appeared transiently signaling one of six possible reward contingencies. Cue colors indicated the size of reward (one, two, or three drops of food) and symbols indicated the delay-to-reward (short delay [3.5–5.6 s] or long delay [5.2–7.3 s]). Animals were given the option to reject a proposed trial by moving the cursor outside of the target (e.g., if they did not think it was worth waiting for the expected quantity of reward). In this task, the rejection rate (i.e., the proportion of trials with a failure to keep the cursor in the target) reflects the monkey’s motivation to stay engaged in the task and to successfully complete the trial according to its prediction about the forthcoming reward. The six instruction cues effectively communicated six different levels of motivation or subjective value as evidenced by consistent effects on the animals’ task performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Rejection rates were affected by both reward size (two-way ANOVAs; monkey H: <italic>F<sub>(2,666)</sub></italic> = 10.47, p&lt;0.001; monkey C: <italic>F<sub>(2,708)</sub></italic> = 5.36, p=0.0049) and delay to reward (H: <italic>F<sub>(1,666)</sub></italic> = 22.62, p&lt;0.001; C: <italic>F<sub>(1,708)</sub></italic> = 8.03, p=0.0047). Although the total proportion of rejected trials differed across monkeys (two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test; t<sub>(229)</sub> = 3.96, p&lt;0.001), a similar behavioral pattern was observed in both animals during the task. The proportion of rejected trials was higher for smaller rewards and longer delays, while both animals waited more patiently to obtain larger rewards.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Delayed reward task and behavioral performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Temporal sequence of task events. After the monkey initiated a trial by positioning a cursor (+) within a visual target (gray circle), an instruction cue was presented briefly signaling the reward size (one, two, or three drops of food) and the delay-to-reward (short or long).

To characterize how subjective value declined with delay, we fitted the averaged rejection rates to a hyperbolic discounting model (as expressed by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>). To be more specific, we inferred the temporal discount factor (<italic>k</italic>) that maximized the inverse relation between each monkey’s behavior and the subjective value calculated from a hyperbolic function. Consistent with other monkey studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hori et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Minamimoto et al., 2009</xref>), the animals’ task performance was well approximated by an inverse relation with hyperbolic delay discounting (H: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98; C: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.86; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The resulting discount rates calculated for the two animals were relatively similar in value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). In comparison, however, monkey C was a bit more impatient with a steeper delay discounting (<italic>k</italic> = 1.62 s<sup>–1</sup>), while the subjective value estimated by monkey H was slightly less impacted by the cost of waiting (<italic>k</italic> = 1.28 s<sup>–1</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Controls</title><p>We recorded EMGs from different muscles (trapezius, deltoid, pectoralis, triceps, biceps) while monkey H performed the behavioral task. During the post-instruction waiting interval, when the animal remained static, the maintenance of the arm posture resulted in a slight increase in the tonic activity of shoulder muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>). As evidenced by a series of two-way ANOVAs (reward × delay, p&lt;0.05/173-time bins), muscle patterns were not altered by reward contingencies. This suggests that monkeys controlled their posture with a constant motor output across trial conditions, independent of reward size and delay. Alternatively, as monkeys were not required to control their gaze while performing the task, we found that their eye positions varied according to the type of trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Eye position was affected by both the expected reward size and delay after the presentation of instruction cues (two-way ANOVAs, p&lt;0.05/173-time bins). Reward-by-delay interactions detected in eye position after instruction offset reinforce the view that cost–benefit parameters were integrated into a common valuation by monkeys.</p><p>To confirm the ability of our animals to recognize and evaluate appropriately the different instruction cues, the animals also performed a variant of the task that required decision-making. In this variant, the monkey was allowed to choose freely between two alternate reward size or delay conditions. We observed appropriately strong preferences for the cues that predicted large rewards and short delays. Monkeys selected the more advantageous option in terms of reward when the delays were equal (H: 97%, <italic>t</italic><sub>(14)</sub> = 26.99, p&lt;0.001; C: 99%, <italic>t</italic><sub>(16)</sub> = 30.55, p&lt;0.001) and the more advantageous delay option when reward sizes were held constant (H: 99%, <italic>t</italic><sub>(11)</sub> = 29.71, p&lt;0.001; C: 95%, <italic>t</italic><sub>(10)</sub> = 24.82, p&lt;0.001).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neuronal activity of STN reflects reward size and delay</title><p>While the monkeys performed the delayed reward task, we recorded single-unit activity from 231 neurons in the right STN (112 from monkey H; 119 from monkey C). Similar to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pasquereau and Turner, 2017</xref>), STN neurons were identified based on location and standard electrophysiological criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Most STN neurons exhibited changes in firing rate at one or more times in the task. Approximately 42% of neurons demonstrated a peak in activity in the first second following presentation of the instruction cues, while 32% of neurons exhibited highest discharge rates later during the waiting period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Despite the fact that phasic changes evoked by instruction cues dominated the population-averaged activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we found that the variability of neuronal activities across the six reward/delay conditions was maintained at an elevated constant level across several seconds of the trial, as evidenced by the Fano Factor shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. This suggests that task-relevant information was processed by STN neurons not only immediately after the presentation of the instruction cue, but also later in the course of the post-instruction delay period, when the animal was maintaining a stable arm position in anticipation of reward delivery.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons were modulated by reward size and delay.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Reconstruction of a trajectory used for STN recordings with a structural MRI and high-resolution 3-D templates of individual nuclei derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martin and Bowden, 1996</xref>.

Because the variability of neuronal activities across task conditions was sustained over time, we analyzed the spiking activity of each neuron in a time-resolved way across a continuous 3.5 s period following the presentation of the instruction cue. Of the 231 neurons recorded, 112 (48%; 21 from monkey H and 91 from monkey C) and 91 (39%; 18 from monkey H and 73 from monkey C) were modulated by reward size and delay, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–J</xref>). Interestingly, the two types of encoding occurred preferentially during different periods of the trial. Immediately following cue presentation, neurons were strongly influenced by the reward size signaled by the instruction while, later in the trial, as animals endured the waiting period, encoding of delay became more common. Among the 79 neurons (34%; 14 from monkey H and 65 from monkey C) sensitive to both parameters at some point over the course of the trial, 50 (22%; 8 from monkey H and 42 from monkey C) were influenced simultaneously by reward size and delay within the same time bins, thereby reflecting a direct integration of cost–benefit conditions by individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>). Reward-by-delay interactions were scattered in a roughly uniform distribution across the course of the post-instruction period. Overall, these results suggest that the way STN neurons represented task conditions evolved dynamically across the course of a trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Dynamic encodings of reward size and delay</title><p>To examine how reward size and delay were encoded by individual STN units and how that encoding changed across time in a trial, we performed time-resolved linear regressions with single-unit neural activity as the dependent variable. For each task-related neuron (i.e., neurons encoding at least one task parameter for a least one-time bin, n = 124), we tested whether the firing rate was modulated by the expected reward quantity and the delay to reward delivery (as expressed by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>). Because the STN contains an oculomotor territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Matsumura et al., 1992</xref>), we included measures of eye movements (i.e., gaze position and gaze velocity) in our model as nuisance variables. (Exclusion of eye parameters from this analysis produced very similar results – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.) As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> with three example neurons, task parameters were encoded in the STN at different stages of the trial following different modalities. (Thresholds for significant regression coefficients were calculated relative to their values during the pre-instruction period using a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, df = 46, p&lt;0.05.) Based on the polarity of the regression coefficients β<italic><sub>Reward</sub></italic>, we found neurons whose activity transiently indexed reward size by increasing (e.g., neuron #1) or decreasing (e.g., neuron #2) their firing rate. Similarly, by detecting changes in the regression coefficients β<italic><sub>Delay</sub></italic>, we found neurons that increased (e.g., neuron #2) or decreased (e.g., neuron #1) their activity as a function of the delay to reward. Neural activities were often influenced in opposite directions by the predicted amount of reward and the delay (positive β<italic><sub>Reward</sub></italic> with negative β<italic><sub>Delay</sub></italic>, or vice versa). The specific pattern of task encoding within individual cells, however, often changed over the course of the trial. For example, in the third exemplar unit activity shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (right column), the influence of reward size on firing rate (i.e., β<italic><sub>Reward</sub></italic>) reversed repeatedly in the post-instruction epoch.

In this space, vector angles indicated how a neuron’s activity reflected the combined effects of reward size and delay, while vector magnitude captured the strength of the combined encoding. To determine the predominant encoding of these two characteristics (angle and magnitude of moment-by-moment vectors) and their evolution during the post-instruction epoch, we summed across the time-resolved vectors across two consecutive phases of the waiting period (e.g., red dashed lines for phase 1 [0–2 s post-instruction] and phase 2 [2–3.5 s post-instruction] in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Over the two phases of the waiting period, some neurons exhibited a consistently positive encoding of reward combined with a negative encoding of delay (vector angles –90° &lt; θ &lt; 0°; referred to as the ‘Discounting–’ pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right), while others modulated their activity in the converse pattern with a negative β<italic><sub>Reward</sub></italic> and positive β<italic><sub>Delay</sub></italic> value (90° &lt; θ &lt; 180°; referred to as ‘Discounting+’ pattern; see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, middle).

First, in phase 1, the neural encoding of reward size and delay parameters predominantly followed a Discounting pattern as evidenced by the fraction of neurons with Discounting– type encodings (χ<sup>2</sup> = 17.1, df = 3, p=0.007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and the longer mean vector magnitude of Discounting– units (one-way ANOVA, <italic>F<sub>(3,121)</sub></italic> = 4.54, p=0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Of the 124 task-related neurons, 60 (48%) increased firing rates as a function of reward size while they decreased according to the temporal delay to reward delivery (i.e., consistent with a Discounting– pattern). The remaining neurons were distributed across the other three encoding patterns. Vector magnitudes for neurons with a Discounting– firing pattern were longer, on average, than those for neurons with either type of Compounding pattern, while the vector magnitude for neurons with a Discounting+ pattern fell in-between. Notably, the angle of the mean vector across all neurons (θ<sub>1</sub> = –12°, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) showed that, despite the wide diversity of encoding patterns across individual neurons in phase 1, the whole neural ensemble encoded information about reward size and delay in a pattern that was strongly consistent with a temporal discounting of value (i.e., Discounting–). The significance of this bias in the population encoding was supported further by the observation that the angles of individual vectors were distributed in a markedly non-uniform fashion (Rayleigh’s test, z = 12.5, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Hence, during the first 2 s of the post-instruction period, the neural ensemble combined information related to reward size and delay into a coherent population-scale signal that reflected subjective value according to a Discounting– pattern.</p><p>Then, in phase 2, the population encoding of reward size and delay parameters changed drastically to a predominantly Compounding pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Inconsistent with a temporal discounting of reward value, the angle of the mean vector across all neurons (θ<sub>2</sub> = 65°, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) showed that the whole neural ensemble encoded significantly a signal correlated positively with both the reward size and the time delay (Rayleigh’s test, z = 40.7, p&lt;0.001). This dynamic shift in the encoding of task-relevant information (i.e., rotation of the vectors between phases 1 and 2) was detected not only at the population level but also in the activities of 27 individual units (22%) in which the encoding pattern switched from Discounting– to Compounding+ in the transition from phase 1 to phase 2, respectively.</p><p>Remarkably, the neurons categorized as Discounting– in phase 1 and/or Compounding+ in phase 2 were located preferentially in the most posterior and dorsal portion of the STN (two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>t</italic><sub>(229)</sub> &gt; 3.04, p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

After projecting every unit’s time series of regression coefficients (β<italic><sub>Reward</sub></italic> and β<italic><sub>Delay</sub></italic>) into the orthogonal space composed of the reward size and delay, we used a principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the predominant patterns (i.e., the principal components [PCs]) of encoding across the population. Unlike the single-unit analyses, the estimation of regression coefficients (β values) here was calculated in non-overlapped temporal windows (100 ms) to maintain the independence of β values across time bins. Given that the activity of individual neurons encoded diverse time-varying representations of task-relevant information (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the PCA identified the patterns that accounted for the greatest variance within the neural population. In the resulting time series of eigenvectors, the angle of the eigenvectors indicated how reward size and delay parameters were integrated at the population level, while the magnitude of eigenvectors captured the relative strength of the encodings in the neural ensemble.</p><p>We identified the PCs that accounted for a significant fraction of variance relative to that accounted for by a population of control PCAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Surrogate control PCAs were computed by shuffling neural activity across trials before application of the PCA, thereby scrambling the relationship between task conditions and the neural activity. We found that the first four PCs from the real data exceeded the 95% confidence interval of variances accounted for by PCs from the surrogate control PCAs. In total, the first four PCs explained 72.4% of the total variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These four PCs were distinct from each other with respect to the pattern represented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and how it evolved across time in a trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We identified the timing of significant encodings of reward size and delay in PCs by comparing the magnitude of eigenvectors to the 95% confidence interval of those calculated from the surrogate control PCAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Consistent with our single-unit analyses, the first principal component (PC1, which accounted for 45.1% of variance) corresponded primarily to a temporal discounting of reward value (i.e., a signal that increased with increasing reward size and decreased with increasing delay; –90° &lt; θ &lt; 0°) that later evolved to a Compounding+ pattern (i.e., a signal in which reward size and delay were integrated in an additive manner; 0° &lt; θ &lt; 90°). As evidenced by the eigenvector time series of PC1, the neural ensemble encoded a delay-discounted reward value (pointing toward –18°) in a stable manner for approximately 2 s after the presentation of the instruction cue and then rotated progressively toward a nominally significant pattern (pointing toward 44°) in which activity increased with longer delays to reward. Thus, reward size and delay were combined into a common neural ensemble signal that evolved dynamically across the duration of the waiting period. The signal captured by PC2 (second column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; accounting for 13.9% of variance) differed markedly from that of PC1. In the 1 s after presentation of the instruction cue, the PC2 population signal was primarily sensitive to reward size only, with a transient encoding pointing toward 0°. Then, approximately 2 s after the instruction, PC2 deviated to a robust Discounting+ pattern (90° &lt; θ &lt; 180°) in which reward size and delay had opposing effects on the signal. Consistent with an encoding of temporally discounted values, this Discounting+ pattern was maintained throughout the later half of the waiting period, with a slow progressive rotation of the vector toward an increasing influence of delay the longer the delay period lasted (145–110°, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

At the single-neuron and population levels, we found a cost–benefit integration between the desirability of the expected reward and the imposed delay to delivery, with signals that dynamically combined both reward-related attributes to form a single integrated value estimate. The computation for such subjective value was increasingly observed along the antero-posterior axis of the STN, revealing that the most dorso-posterior-placed neurons are the most strongly involved in the representation of temporal discounting of value. These results expand our understanding concerning the involvement of STN in motivation and inhibitory control by providing evidence for complex dynamical codings consistent with a continuous cost–benefit estimation promoting the goal pursuit and the willingness to bear the costs of time delays.</p><p>To determine whether the STN conveys dynamic signals consistent with its predicted role in pursuing delayed gratification, we trained monkeys to perform a delayed reward task in which they were required to remain motionless for varying periods of time before the delivery of reward. We designed this task to investigate the ability of our animals to delay gratification and maintain a continuous self-control according to different levels of motivation. Previous studies have already tested monkeys’ behavior for delay maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Evans et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Evans and Beran, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Freeman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Freeman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Perdue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Szalda-Petree et al., 2004</xref>), but none to our knowledge have investigated the underlying neural mechanisms. Our analysis of animals’ performance confirmed that different levels of motivation or subjective value influenced their patience and willingness to sustain behavioral inhibition over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As evidenced by the more frequent rejection of trials offering small rewards and long delays, both cost–benefit parameters were integrated by monkeys to complete trials and finally obtain rewards. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Minamimoto et al., 2009</xref>), the likelihood of staying engaged in the trials for delayed rewards was well approximated by a model that calculates the subjective value with a hyperbolic delay discounting. This shows that monkeys estimated the cost–benefit conditions properly, and that active motivational processes were recruited during the time course of the post-instruction waiting period to maintain their behavioral inhibition.</p><p>In both human and non-human animal research, temporal discounting has been traditionally studied via the intertemporal choice task, which pits a small reward available sooner against a large reward available later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frederick et al., 2002</xref>). As the delay to the large reward becomes longer, agents tend to start discounting the value of the large reward, biasing their preference toward the small reward available sooner. This choice behavior is considered impulsive and it referred to as a failure of self-control because it would be more economical to wait for the larger reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ainslie, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Rachlin, 2004</xref>). To interpret individual choice behavior, the extent to which rewards are devalued over time have been inferred primarily using hyperbolic discounting models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mazur, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vanderveldt et al., 2016</xref>). Based on that approach, neuroimaging studies have identified a network of brain areas – involving the striatum, medial prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex – activation of which correlates with the subjective value of delayed rewards during decision-making processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kable and Glimcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McClure et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McClure et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Peters and Büchel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pine et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with a coding of cost–benefit integration for delays to reward, BOLD activity in these regions increases as the expected amount of a reward increases and, inversely, decreases as a function of the imposed delay to reward. At the single-neuron level, however, electrophysiological results have been more mixed concerning the integration of both reward-related attributes into a common currency value attribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Roesch and Bryden, 2011</xref>). While some studies have found strict dissociable representations of both neural signals by different populations of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Roesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Roesch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Roesch and Olson, 2005</xref>), two monkey studies have reported single-unit activities co-modulated by both reward size and delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Our results confirm and extend to the STN those findings by showing that the cost and benefit dimensions of the task are represented in different ways in different sub-groups of neurons, either independently or in an integrated manner during the waiting period. Respectively, 14 and 5% of STN neurons were exclusively modulated by the expectation of reward size and delay without any co-modulation by the other parameter, maintaining distinct dynamic encodings split between these subsets of cells. Signals related to reward size were represented preferentially shortly after cue presentation, while signals related to delay cost occurred primarily later as animals endured the waiting period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The fact we were able to dissociate in the STN these two types of neurons suggests that temporal discounting originates likely from different neural circuits than those that signal expected reward value. Alternatively, 34% of our STN neurons exhibited a dual coding of size and delay information, engendering a representation of both cost and benefit into a common dimension. Among those cells, the most prevalent activity pattern was characterized by opposing effects of reward magnitude and delay on their firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Specifically, STN neurons that fired more strongly for larger anticipated rewards tended to fire less strongly for longer delays (referred as Discounting–), consistent with the computation of temporally discounted value. Despite a high variability across individual neurons, we found that the whole neural ensemble sampled from the STN encoded and combined both reward size and delay into a strong population signal that corresponded with a temporal discounting of reward value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As evidenced by the eigenvector time series of different PCs, reward size and delay were integrated into a common signal that evolved dynamically while animals remained immobile, waiting for the reward. Such dynamics appear consistent with the hypothesized role for STN in self-control and perseverance.</p><p>Unlike most studies of temporal discounting that focus on decision-related neural processes at just one time point in the task, we investigated activity during the post-instruction delay period, during which animals were required to exert sustained commitment to an action with a continuous behavioral inhibition. It is quite likely that distinct components of self-control are measured during those two time periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addessi et al., 2013</xref>). Our approach offers the opportunity to investigate the dynamic processes engaged during the post-instruction period to support an animal’s ability to delay gratification. An important avenue for future research will be to determine how STN signals, such as those described here, change when animals run out of patience and finally decide to stop waiting. To do this, however, smaller reward sizes and longer delays might be used to promote more escape behaviors during the delay interval. Rejection rates were relatively low in the present version of our task. Given current models where STN is thought to prevent hasty decisions by elevating its activity to pause cortical commands via pallido-thalamocortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mansfield et al., 2011</xref>), signals underlying a steeper temporal discounting may be observed shortly before behavioral disinhibition if this nucleus effectively drives this type of inhibitory function. In addition, further studies relying on simultaneous multisite recordings are still necessary to clarify the neural origins of the information transmitted by the signals identified here. Although our results show that STN neurons process a dual dynamic coding of size and delay information, it remains undetermined whether the integration between these two reward-related attributes occurs primarily within this nucleus or upstream in other brain areas such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2008</xref>) or the anterior striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cai et al., 2011</xref>), for instance.</p><p>A growing number of animal studies have examined the involvement of STN in motivational functions using single-unit recordings. Neurons with phasic responses evoked by reward-predictive cues and the reward itself have been reported in different species and tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Breysse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Darbaky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Espinosa-Parrilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lardeux et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lardeux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Matsumura et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nougaret et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Teagarden and Rebec, 2007</xref>). However, it has been unclear how this reward processing relates to the known organization of STN into anatomically and functionally distinct territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alexander et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nambu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>). The STN receives topographically organized inputs from most regions of the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haynes and Haber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nambu et al., 2002</xref>), the pallidum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Karachi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shink et al., 1996</xref>), and the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sadikot et al., 1992</xref>). Together, tracing studies have indicated that the posterior-dorsal-lateral STN is interconnected with circuits devoted to sensorimotor function, whereas associative- and limbic-related territories are found in progressively more anterior, ventral, and medial regions of the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haynes and Haber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mettler and Stern, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Monakow et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shink et al., 1996</xref>). Based on this, a widely accepted tripartite model divides STN into segregated motor, associative, and limbic regions that are thought to play distinct roles in motor control, cognition, and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parent and Hazrati, 1995</xref>). Surprisingly, in previous primate studies, reward-responsive neurons were found to be scattered throughout all parts of the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Darbaky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Espinosa-Parrilla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nougaret et al., 2022</xref>), rather than showing a preferential location in the anterior portion that is held to be the zone with strongest connectivity to limbic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haynes and Haber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Karachi et al., 2005</xref>). That lack of anatomic specificity has been confirmed in human recordings for which reward-modulated neurons were also identified in sensorimotor regions of the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Justin Rossi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sieger et al., 2015</xref>). To date, these paradoxical observations were attributed to a bias in data collection and the inherent observational bias in data collected as part of DBS implantation surgeries due to the posterior-dorsal-lateral location of the target in those surgeries. By accumulating 231 neurons distributed across all portions of the STN, our study provides a more complete survey of this nucleus for regional variations in the representation of reward-related information. At the single-neuron and population levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), we found that the valuation of delayed rewards was represented preferentially in the most dorso-posterior portion of the STN, thereby challenging predictions from the classical tripartite model of STN functional topography. While earlier studies suggested segregated functional subdivisions, now more recent evidence points toward overlapping territories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Alkemade and Forstmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Emmi et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with a functional convergence within this structure, our results show that motivational signals were conveyed by neurons located in areas traditionally identified as part of the sensorimotor circuits. Because muscle activities were not altered by reward contingencies during the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>), we assume that these dynamic reward-related signals were primarily processed by cognitive circuits that monitor and manage goal achievement by translating motivational drives into behavioral perseverance. This role in self-control extends our understanding concerning the involvement of STN in the control of impulsive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Aron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jahanshahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zavala et al., 2015</xref>) and the willingness to work for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Baunez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baunez et al., 2002</xref>). By providing evidence for dynamic cost–benefit valuation by STN, our results imply that this structure promotes the pursuit of motivated behavior by computing which costs are acceptable for the reward at stake. Further research is needed to determine whether the neural signals identified here causally drive animals’ behavior or rather just participate to reflect or evaluate the current situation.</p><p>Impatience for reward and lack of perseverance are major facets of many psychiatric disorders. Numerous clinical studies have shown that these maladaptive behaviors are characterized by a disruption in the ability to weigh appropriately the amount of reward against the cost of delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kirby et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Madden et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mitchell, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reynolds, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Vuchinich and Simpson, 1998</xref>).

Our results merge existing lines of evidence that implicate the STN in motivation and inhibitory control, positioning this structure as a potential hub to regulate aberrant reward processing and the capability to postpone. This view agrees with the beneficial effects of DBS-STN on drug addiction reported in recent animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pelloux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rouaud et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wade et al., 2017</xref>), and with the battery of psychiatric side effects observed in parkinsonian patients after electrode implantation within the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Castrioto et al., 2014</xref>). However, an open question remains on how the STN contributes in these pathological states to distort defective valuation processes in terms of cost–benefit trade-off.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Two rhesus monkeys (monkey C, 8 kg, male; and monkey H, 6 kg, female) were used in this study.

When animals were not in active use, they were housed in individual primate cages in an air-conditioned room where water was always available. The monkeys’ access to food was regulated to increase their motivation to perform the task. Throughout the study, the animals were monitored daily by animal care staff and veterinary technicians for evidence of disease or injury and body weight was documented weekly. If a body weight &lt;90% of baseline was observed, the food regulation was stopped.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral task</title><p>Monkeys were trained to perform the delayed reward task with the left arm using a torquable exoskeleton (KINARM, BKIN Technologies, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). This device had hinge joints aligned with the monkey’s shoulder and elbow and allowed the animal to make arm movements in the horizontal plane. Visual cues and cursor feedback of hand position were presented in the horizontal plane of hand movements by a virtual-reality system. A detailed description of the apparatus can be found in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pasquereau and Turner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pasquereau and Turner, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In our delayed reward task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the monkey was required to align the cursor on a visual target (radius, 1.8 cm) and to maintain this position for varying periods of time before delivery of the food reward. In total, six combinations of reward size and waiting delay were used. A trial began when a gray-filled target appeared (the same location for all trials) and the animal made the appropriate joint movements to place the cursor in this circle. Maintenance of the cursor within the target required the animal to actively stabilize the posture of both shoulder and elbow joints in the horizontal plane. While the monkey maintained its arm position, an instruction cue was displayed over the gray-filled target for 0.5 s. After a variable interval (1.2–2.8 s), the gray fill disappeared from the circle, cueing the animal to remain motionless during an additional delay until the reward delivery. For the instruction cues, cue colors indicated the size of reward (one, two, and three drops of food) and symbols indicated the delay duration that the animal would have to wait before reward delivery (short delay [3.5–5.6 s] and long delay [5.2–7.3 s]). The Gaussian distributions of these two delay ranges overlapped for 9% of trials. Cue colors were calibrated to have the same physical brightness (~30 cd/m<sup>2</sup>). The six unique cue types (3 reward sizes × 2 delay ranges) were presented in pseudo-random order across trials with equal probability. At the end of each successful trial, food reward was delivered via a sipper tube attached to a computer-controlled peristaltic pump (1 drop = ~0.5 ml, puree of fresh fruits and protein biscuits). The trials were separated by 1.5–2.5 s intertrial intervals, during which the screen was black. Failures to maintain the cursor in the start position (radius = 1.8 cm) during the interval between instruction cue and reward delivery were counted as errors. After an error, the rejected trial was aborted and a blank screen appeared (1 s), followed by an intertrial interval.</p><p>To confirm the ability of our monkeys to evaluate appropriately the different instruction cues, we also trained them to perform a decision task in which they were allowed to choose freely between two alternate reward size or delay conditions. The overall structure of this task was similar to the delayed reward task except two instruction cues were presented simultaneously. The location of the cues alternated randomly between left and right sides. The animal chose its preferential option by positioning and maintaining the cursor on one of the targets. The pair of cues presented on a single trial differed only along one dimension, presenting either a reward-based decision (different colors but the same symbol) or a delay-based decision (different symbols but the same color).</p><p>Before the start of data collection, we trained the monkeys to perform these two behavioral tasks for more than 6 mo.

The chamber was positioned in the parasagittal plane with an anterior-to-posterior angle of 20°. The chamber was fixed to the skull with titanium screws and dental acrylic.

As the monkey maintained its arm position for varying periods of time before to obtain rewards, the sum of errors per session was the main variable of interest. Rejection rates were calculated by dividing the number of errors by the total number of trials for each task condition. Two-way ANOVAs were used to test these rejections for interacting effects of reward size (one, two, or three drops) and delay (short or long delay duration). Modulation in rejection rates reflected the monkey’s motivation to stay engaged in the task and to fully complete the different types of trials by maintaining the correct arm position. In this study, the motivational or subjective value linked to each task condition was estimated by integrating the forthcoming reward size and the delay discounting. The subjective value of delayed reward is commonly formulated as a hyperbolic discounting model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Green and Myerson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mazur, 1987</xref>) as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>SV</italic> is the subjective value (i.e., the temporally discounted value), <italic>R</italic> is the reward size, <italic>k</italic> is a discount factor that reflects an individual animal’s sensitivity to the waiting cost, and <italic>D</italic> is the delay to the reward.

Because the number of errors in task performance is inversely related to the subjective value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fujimoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Minamimoto et al., 2009</xref>), we have inferred the subjective value in each monkey by fitting the average rejection rate to the following model:<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>E</italic> is the rejection rate, <italic>R</italic> is the reward size, <italic>D</italic> is the delay, <italic>k</italic> is a discount factor, and <italic>a</italic> is a monkey-specific free parameter.

The width of action potential waveforms was calculated as the interval from the beginning of the first negative inflection (&gt;2 SD) to the subsequent positive peak, and the magnitude of the biphasic spike waveforms was measured between maxima and minima. Trials with errors were excluded from the analysis of neuronal data. Continuous neuronal activation functions (spike density functions [SDFs]) were generated around instruction cues (−1–3.5 s) by convolving each discriminated action potential with a Gaussian kernel (20 ms variance). Mean peri-event SDFs (averaged across trials) for each of the reward and delay conditions were constructed. A neuron’s baseline firing rate was calculated as the mean of the SDFs across the 1 s epoch preceding cue instruction. The Fano factor, defined as the variance-to-mean ratio of firing rates, was used to measure the variability of neuronal activities across the six trial conditions. For each single-unit activity, we tested for effects of reward size and delay using two-way ANOVAs combined with a sliding window procedure (200 ms test window stepped in 20 ms). Specifically, we extracted single-trial spike counts across a series of 200 ms windows and investigated for each step whether the neuronal activity was influenced by (1) reward size, (2) delay to reward, or (3) both task parameters. The ANOVA identified any interacting effects of reward size and delay. The threshold for significance in those ANOVAs was corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction (p&lt;0.05/n-time bins). Application of the same ANOVA analysis and statistical threshold (p&lt;0.05/n-time bins) to neuronal data during the 1 s period of the pre-instruction control epoch (i.e., from a time period when the animal had no information about the upcoming reward and delay) resulted in 0.12% of type 1 (false-positive) errors, thereby confirming that the threshold for statistical significance was appropriate. A neuron was judged to be task-related if its firing rate reflected a significant encoding of the reward size and/or delay for a least one-time bin.</p><p>To test how individual task-related neurons dynamically encoded the forthcoming reward and delay discounting through trials, we used time-resolved multiple linear regressions.

For each bin, we applied the following model:<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where all regressors for the ith trial were normalized to obtain standardized regression coefficients (Z-scored in standard deviation units). The β coefficients for each task-related unit were estimated using the ‘glmfit’ function in MATLAB. The threshold for significance of individual test β values was determined by comparing them against a population of 46 control β values calculated by applying the same sliding window linear regression approach to spike counts from a 1 s pre-instruction control epoch (one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, df = 46, p&lt;0.05).</p><p>To characterize how individual neurons integrate task parameters dynamically, time series of regression coefficients of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> (β<italic><sub>R</sub></italic> and β<italic><sub>D</sub></italic>) were projected into an orthogonal space where reward size and delay composed the two dimensions (axes) of interest. In this regression space, we used significant points (pairs of β<italic><sub>R</sub></italic>-β<italic><sub>D</sub></italic>) to produce vector time series originating from the control value of the pre-instruction epoch (averaged across time bins). Vectors were generated with significant regression coefficients calculated during the course of the hold period. In this context, vector angles (−180 to 180°) indicated how the neural activity encodes and combines reward size and delay, while vector magnitudes captured the strength of the signals transmitted. Considering these two characteristics (direction and magnitude of vectors), we summed all time-resolved vectors to identify the predominant encoding of task parameters for each neuron analyzed. Various patterns of neural encoding could be categorized from the angle (θ) of the resultant vector sum. For instance, θ indicated whether the neural activity was correlated (positive coding) or anticorrelated (negative coding) with the reward size, the delay to reward, or both. The angle of these vectors was interpreted as follows: 0° (positive β<italic><sub>R</sub></italic> values) indicated an exclusive positive reward size coding; ±180° (negative β<italic><sub>R</sub></italic> values) indicated an exclusive negative reward size coding; 90° (positive β<italic><sub>D</sub></italic> values) indicated an exclusive positive delay coding; and –90° (negative β<italic><sub>D</sub></italic> values) indicated an exclusive negative delay coding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In this way, a θ between –90 and 0°, or between 90 and 180°, indicated a coding of both reward size and delay consistent with a temporally discounted value in which benefit and cost parameters have opposing effects on the subjective encoding (i.e, positive β<italic><sub>R</sub></italic> with negative β<italic><sub>D</sub></italic>, or vice versa). In contrast, a θ between 0 and 90°, or between –180 and –90°, indicated a coding of reward size and delay in which the two parameters are integrated in a compound signal inconsistent with a temporally discounted value (i.e., positive β<italic><sub>R</sub></italic> and β<italic><sub>D</sub></italic>, or negative β<italic><sub>R</sub></italic> and β<italic><sub>D</sub></italic>).</p><p>For population-based figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), vectors were standardized between neurons by subtracting the mean values of the pre-instruction epoch and then dividing by 2 SD of this control period. The population encoding was considered significant if the distribution of the individual vector angles was non-uniform (Rayleigh’s test, p&lt;0.001). The population vector was calculated by vectorially summing standardized cell vectors.</p><p>We then performed an alternative population-based analysis to characterize the predominant patterns of neural encoding in the STN using all recorded neurons. We used a PCA to identify patterns of encoding (dimensions) of the neuronal ensemble in the polar orthogonal space composed of the reward size and delay. Our procedure was analogous to the analyses performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yamada et al., 2021</xref>. A two-dimensional data matrix <italic>X</italic> of size <italic>N</italic><sub>(neuron)</sub> × <italic>N</italic><sub>(<italic>C</italic>x<italic>T</italic>)</sub> was prepared with regression coefficients of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> (series of β<italic><sub>R</sub></italic> and β<italic><sub>D</sub></italic>), in which rows corresponded to the total number of neurons and columns corresponded to the number of conditions (<italic>C</italic>, reward sizes and delays) multiplied by the number of time bins (<italic>T</italic>). Unlike the single-unit analyses, the estimation of regression coefficients (β values) here was calculated in non-overlapped temporal windows (100 ms) to maintain the independence of β values across time bins. A series of eigenvectors was obtained by applying PCA once to the data matrix <italic>X</italic>. In our analysis, the eigenvectors represent vectors at different time bins in the orthogonal space composed of reward size and delay. PCs were estimated using the ‘pca’ function in MATLAB. As was the case for the vectors computed for single-units, vector angles (−180 to 180°) indicated how the ensemble encodes and combines reward size and delay, while vector magnitudes captured the strength of the signals transmitted. Adequate performance of PCA was estimated with the percentages of variance explained by PCs. To test whether the PCA performance was significant, we constructed a surrogate control population of PCs in which the neural activity (<italic>SC</italic>) was shuffled across trials before application of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>. Consequently, in the surrogate data the linear projection of neural activity into the regression subspace was randomized, eliminating any coherent modulation of activity with task parameters (reward size and delay) in the matrix <italic>X</italic>. We built a surrogate control population of PCs by repeating the shuffling procedure 1000 times and then compared percentages of variance explained by actual PCs against the 95% confidence interval of variances accounted for by the population of surrogate PCs. The percentage of variance accounted for by an actual PC was deemed significant if its value fell outside of the 95% confidence interval of the population of surrogate PCs. In addition, we identified the timing of significant encodings of reward size and delay in PCs by comparing the magnitude of eigenvectors to the 95% confidence interval of those calculated from the population of surrogate PCs.</p><p>To test how PCs mapped onto anatomical axes in STN, we correlated the component scores of the neurons with their locations (x–y–z coordinates). We performed this in standard stereotaxic space and also for a rotated set of anatomical axes (45° rotations along x–y–z axes). The rotated axis that best correlated with the scores of a component (maximal Spearman’s rho) was identified as the optimal axes for explaining that component’s variance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Two rhesus monkeys (monkey C, 8 kg, male; and monkey H, 6 kg, female) were used in this study.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hiroshi Yamada (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is thought to play important roles in self-control. In this study, the authors sought to characterize the activity of STN neurons while monkeys performed a task in which they had to withhold their response during a delay period whose length was defined by a specific cue. The reviewers thought that this study contains potentially important results but they raised various concerns in some analyses, which reduced their enthusiasm for the present study. We hope that the authors can address the following essential issues.</p><p>1) To identify neurons whose activity was modulated by reward size or delay, the authors analyzed many time bins (e.g. 188 sliding windows). The results must be properly corrected for multiple comparisons, yet the method used for correction is not fully described. It is therefore unclear whether the conclusions are well supported by the data.</p><p>2) The authors examined the STN activity aligned to the start of the delay and also aligned to the reward. Most of the &quot;delay encoding&quot; in the STN activity was observed near the end of the waiting period. The trouble with the analysis is that a neuron that responded with exactly the same response on short and long trials could appear to be modulated by delay. This is easiest to see with a diagram, but it should be easy to imagine a neural response that quickly rose at the time of instruction and then decayed slowly over the course of 2 seconds. For long trials, the neuron's activity would have returned to baseline, but for short trials, the activity would still be above baseline. As such, it is not clear how much the STN neurons were truly modulated by delay.</p><p>3) Another concern is the presence of eye movement variables in the regressions that determine whether a neuron is reward or delay encoding. If the task variables modulated eye movements (which would not be surprising) and if the STN activity also modulated eye movements, then, even if task variables did not directly modulate STN activity, the regression would indicate that it did. This is commonly known as &quot;collider bias&quot;. This is, unfortunately, a common flaw in neuroscience papers.</p><p>The reviewers raised a number of additional concerns and suggestions as detailed below. Please also address them as much as possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are a number of issues I noted:</p><p>The claim &quot;Accordingly, people with low discount rates tend to pursue their long-term goals patiently, whereas people with high discount rates often abandon their goals impulsively and move on.&quot; needs a citation.</p><p>The phrasing of &quot;Until now, however, existing evidence is mixed on whether the STN is causally involved in temporal discounting&quot; implies that this paper may provide causal evidence, which it does not.</p><p>The model of subjective value here assumes linearity in reward value; this should be made explicit in the text and supported by any evidence you have. It also assumes that the asymptotic rejection rate is zero, which may bias the estimate of k.</p><p>No analysis relates to the transition from the gray-filled circle to the unfilled circle and it is unclear of the relevance of this visual cue to the task design.</p><p>It is unclear what 'as a control' means when comparing the fits of the models described in Eq. 3 and Eq. 4 or what the relevance of this statistic is to any of the conclusions.</p><p>In figure 6, plotting the results in D and E is non-intuitive. Instead of plotting the polar coordinates, a plot of the cartesian coordinates, corresponding to the strength of reward and delay encoding, would be more approachable.</p><p>Some of the theory terminology is inconsistent and it would help temper the conclusions if they were used consistently. Specifically, subjective value is first used to mean the behaviourally-calibrated model of value (e.g. on page 7). It is also used when describing signals that integrate reward and delay (e.g. on page 14). It is also equated to motivation in the discussion, which often refers to a different phenomenon, and if motivation is going to be discussed it should be defined explicitly.</p><p>Vector size and vector length can be confusing terms, as they may refer to the number of elements or the magnitude. Using magnitude throughout the text would resolve this.</p><p>Figure 1 H and I, the lower y-axis should either be labeled log(p) or have exponents of 10 marked on the axis but not both.</p><p>There is at least one missing reference from the bibliography (Yamada et al., 2021), cited in the methods section.</p><p>There are typos that need to be corrected, for example, page 22, line 8 &quot;and a blank scream appeared&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There is good evidence that the subthalamic nucleus (STN) plays a role in self-control. The authors recorded from STN from monkeys that were trained to be still to obtain a reward. The STN seemed to integrate costs and benefits in this task to represent something like the utility of waiting.</p><p>The format of the paper – with captions separate from un-numbered figures added friction to the review process.</p><p>The data are &quot;available&quot; but there is no description of the data format, making the shared data not very useful.</p><p>I made the effort to understand the data_behavior.mat file. This only included per-session rejection rates, without detailed trial-by-trial information which might allow for deeper checks (order effects, reaction times, etc.). The other data are also shared at a very coarse level.</p><p>Overall, I found the claims were not strongly supported by the data. One flaw, that is impossible to correct with this dataset, is that the monkeys almost always wait. This means that the dataset does not permit a comparison of successful and unsuccessful trials of the same type. In addition, the analyses had other flaws (described in more detail in the public review and in the specific comments). I would advise the authors to read the series of papers by Murakami and Mainen (10.1038/nn.3826; j.neuron.2017.04.040) as examples of how to improve their visualizations and analyses.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>– Abstract: &quot;such that the most posterior-placed neurons represented the temporal discounting of value most strongly&quot; this is not clear to me. I think &quot;temporally discounted&quot; is more accurate.</p><p>– The introduction could be improved. 'self-control' is overly broad. Waiting for a future reward is a very specific aspect of self-control (compared with other elements, e.g. the Barrett Impulsivity Scale) There is a massive literature on delay-discounting, and it is not all relevant. As the authors are aware, different tasks probe different dimensions of impulsivity. For example https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2009.12.018. I think the paper would be improved by a clearer statement of the specific aspects of &quot;self-control&quot; that the authors are addressing. For example, The ephys data was collected during a task that does not involve intertemporal choice. The subjects' only &quot;choice&quot; was to wait or not. Many studies of intertemporal choice &quot;lock&quot; the subjects in. Once the delayed option is chosen, the subject cannot change their mind. The neural mechanisms of this &quot;locked-in&quot; kind of intertemporal choice differ quite a bit from the mechanisms underlying &quot;active waiting&quot;. The task described is even more strict than most – the subjects not only have to avoid making a specific action (e.g. pressing a button) but they have to suppress ALL action. This behavior seems to be quite far from the example they give – waiting in line at a bakery. While waiting in line, I can read a book, check email, etc. Interestingly, the authors did use a choice task during behavioral training – however, no data from this was shown.</p><p>– p3l18: If the delay is known, the subjective value of the future reward should grow as the subject gets ‘closer’ in time to the reward.</p><p>– Was the rejection rate predicted from the choice task behavior? i.e. what is the discount factor estimated by the choice task?</p><p>– Only analyzing rejection rates are insufficient. What is the distribution of wait times for each of the trial types? For example, if a monkey has a wait time distribution that only depended on reward size, then you would also see that the &quot;rejection rate&quot; was higher for the long delay.</p><p>– For the analysis in Figures 2 and 3, were only rewarded trials analyzed?</p><p>– In figure 2HJ and L the y-ticks are ‘fraction’ but the label says %, right?</p><p>– For figure 3C: this figure would be better if time was indicated by color or some other method.</p><p>– Including the eye &quot;nuisance&quot; variables could lead to spurious regression coefficients between task variables and STN activity if the task variables influence eye movement and STN influences eye movements. This is referred to as &quot;collider bias&quot; https://catalogofbias.org/biases/collider-bias/</p><p>– Although AIC is a common metric for model comparison, it is known to be flawed (10.1073/pnas.170283897). A better model comparison method would be the cross-validated likelihood (https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/tutorials/W1D2_ModelFitting/student/W1D2_Tutorial6.html?highlight=cross)</p><p>– It's a bit funny, from a narrative perspective, to say that your additive model (Eq 3) is better than the SV model (Eq 4), and then go on to say that overall the STN activity follows a pattern consistent with discounting.</p><p>– Were the neurons sampled from Anterior to Posterior over time? Could it be that the change that you have associated with the AP position is contaminated by changes in the animals' behavior over time?</p><p>– Figure 6C: same comment as above – need to represent time in some way. The colors for the pcs here don't really add anything, so you could use color for time.,</p><p>– I have concerns about the conclusion of increased delay encoding later in the waiting period. If neurons responded to the initiation of the waiting period with some long time-constant offset, then they would have time to return to baseline on long trials, but would not have time to return to baseline on short trials. This would appear (when analyzed relative to the reward) as a different level of activity on trials with different delays.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have several comments on the statistic and analysis details. If the authors improve these issues, the manuscript must be more solid and pre-dominant.</p><p>Major comments (sequentially ordered as appeared in the manuscript)</p><p>1) P7 lines 16, corrected for 143-time bins.</p><p>I wonder why the author applied the correction of the type 1 error in this manuscript.</p><p>(1.1) The way of the multiple comparisons was not clearly written in the method section. Thus, no one can evaluate it.</p><p>(1.2) Is this too strong correction if the authors use Bonferroni-like correction?</p><p>(1.3) If they are interested in the dynamic change, it is unclear the reason why they need correction. If they focused on the moment-by-moment signals, the signals are not dependent on each other in their hypothesis testing. In this case, type 1 error correction underestimates the authors results.</p><p>The same issue exists for neural analyses.</p><p>2) P8, lines 3-5</p><p>The authors should show the fitting results of the temporal discounting function during decision makings (hence, choice?), which is the standard way to estimate the discount function. Please compare these discounted functions between two different tasks. It must be helpful.</p><p>3) P9, Lines 1-2</p><p>The authors corrected the type 1 error to show the percentage of modulated neurons by reward size and delay. This is the correct way to perform hypothesis testing to ask whether each single neuron encodes some information through a trial. However, the way of the correction was not clearly described in detail and it is unclear whether among 188 time-bins comparisons, the correction is too strong or not. I wonder whether these type 1 error corrections underestimated the neural modulations that occur in the different task periods. If I looked at Figure 3H, J, L. % neurons encoding delay or size looks below the 5% chance (especially for the size). If the authors focused on the dynamic changes of neural signal, this correction is inaccurate, since neural activity changed moment-by-moment, and thus, this is not the case to require multiple comparisons through a trial. I guess that without correction more signals would be detected, and those signals must important for arguing the dynamics at the population level in the conventional analyses, like changes of modulated neurons across times.</p><p>4) P10, line 15</p><p>Please present this result by describing figures, box plots plus each data plot with a line for paired data. I guess the mistake of the statistical test occurred since too small a difference between AIC values between models. In this case, a very strong tendency of the paired data is required to get this statistical significance level.</p><p>5) P10, lines 25-26</p><p>Please specify the underlying assumption for why the authors take summed vector across times (i.e., average). This is opposite to their story in that STN neurons dynamically change their coding of information. In dynamical coding, analysis of the average is meaningless. In this point of view, I recommend dividing the analysis window into half or four periods to take a vector sum in each period. If I looked at figure 3C, it would be reasonable. After dividing the analysis window, then the authors can perform the analysis in figure 4 for each of the analysis periods.</p><p>6) P12, Dynamic encoding part.</p><p>In this analysis using PCA, the authors need to use a non-overlapped analysis window, since PCA analyzes the variance and covariance matrix. If the overlapped analysis windows are used, similar activity modulations are enhanced more that the actual neural data because of the activity overlap in the analysis. This causes a serious problem in using PCA. Please use non-overlapped and discrete analysis windows, in which the neural dynamics are described appropriately.</p><p>7) Figure 5A and 7</p><p>Please discuss the finding related to somatotopic representation in the posterior part of the STN. It is clearly important to interpret the results with the anatomical connection to the prefrontal cortex (anterior STN) and somatotopic representation to the cortices (posterior STN).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Neural dynamics underlying self-control in the primate subthalamic nucleus&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Michael Frank (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below. We believe that these comments could be mostly addressed by adding some clarifications or by revising text in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>In general, I find the authors have addressed most of the points raised in the letter. I think of the major points I consider points 2 and 3 to be adequately resolved.</p><p>Regarding point 1, they have used the Bonferroni correction in their ANOVAs used in Figure 2. This is probably unnecessarily strong, but their results have not changed significantly. It is now at least adequately described and so I believe they have addressed this point in this part of their analysis. In determining the significance of the betas for the analysis that underpins the PCA approach, I am still not fully clear on what they did from their description of their process to determine the cutoff value. In their response letter, they have referenced it as a commonly used approach, so they could perhaps provide a reference that has a more detailed description. Ideally, they would provide the code for these steps.</p><p>As part of their response to point 3, the authors provided a supplement to Figure 4. The difference in the profile of the p-values is different between the monkeys and while this in itself may not be significant, it did make me notice that the authors do not report any per-monkey statistics beyond the behavior. While I do not fully understand the data that they have provided on GitHub, I had a brief look at it and I am concerned that there may be significant differences between the two animals, specifically that most of the significant neurons may be coming from one animal. This point was not raised previously in the review but I think having some indication of how consistent the findings were between the two animals is appropriate. The examples given in Figure 3 could be labelled which subject it came from.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>The authors did a reasonable job responding to the reviewers' comments. However, I find some of their claims still not well supported.</p><p>First, the abstract claims &quot;This neural representation of subjective value evolved dynamically across the waiting period&quot; – in the response to reviewers, the authors acknowledge that they do not have sufficient variability in task parameters to estimate the functional form of subjective value. Thus, the change in activity over time may not be a dynamic evolution of representation, but a stable representation of a dynamic subjective value. So, I think this sentence of the abstract should be removed. Second, Also the phrase &quot;dynamically estimates&quot; (in the penultimate sentence of the abstract )implies that the computation is in the dpSTN, but the authors write (in the discussion) that the STN might simply reflect the subjective value computed elsewhere. The last two sentences of the abstract could be edited to read &quot;These findings highlight the selective role of the dpSTN in the representation of temporally discounted rewards. The integration of delays and rewards into an integrated representation is essential for self-control,.……&quot;</p><p>If the abstract (and related content in the results/discussion) are updated as suggested (or similarly) such that they are consistent with the authors' updated manuscript, I could endorse the paper as a valuable contribution with solid evidence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>The authors made significant improvements to their manuscript in general, and hence, their conclusion is now supported more strongly. However, I still have concerns about the two issues raised in the first revision.</p><p>1) Multiple comparison</p><p>This is a comment related to the Essential Revisions comment (1), and my comment (1) and (3) raised in the first revision.</p><p>After seeing the author's reply, I have further difficulty understanding whether their multiple comparison procedure is adequate or not. I will explain the detail below.</p><p>If I understand their procedure as their definition, Bonferroni correction methods give them p-value criterion at 0.05/n, where n is 175 (3.5/0.02) or at least more than 120. This means that the actual p-value used for detecting neural modulations is 0.00029 (0.05/175 or at least 0.0005) in each 200 ms time bin shifted every 20 ms. Then, they have these detections for all 175 (or more than 120) time bins that construct Figure 2G, I, and K. They said that in the methods &quot;The threshold for significance in those ANOVAs was corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction (P &lt; 0.05/ n‐time bins). The validity of that threshold was verified by calculating the likelihood of Type 1 (false‐positive) errors in a parallel analysis of activity extracted from a 1 s period of the pre‐instruction control epoch (i.e., from the time period when the animal had no information about the upcoming reward and delay).&quot; This description may mean that type 1 error correction may not be performed exactly the same as Bonferroni correction, and they may use some other levels of type 1 error correction, though I cannot understand the detail. However, I guess that they may use just p/n correction as Bonferroni method, because they say &quot;verified&quot; above. This is one critical point where the author did not provide clear information in their manuscript.</p><p>In their reply, they said how they check whether this is appropriate correction by &quot;The threshold for significance of individual β values was determined relative to a population of control coefficients calculated from a 1 s pre-instruction control epoch (one sample t-test, df=46, P &lt; 0.05).&quot; This is a critical issue because they used this correction for all of the neural and other response variable analyses, such as eye movement and EMG. The results depend on this correction, though I wonder why they find no significant neural modulation at the 1.0 sec pre-cue period (it would be found at around the 5% if they correctly improve the type 1 error) ? Is this too strong a correction, since n is more than 100?</p><p>If this point becomes clearer, I can understand the whole result, though I still do not evaluate this point well.</p><p>2) Dynamic analysis using overlapped analysis window.</p><p>This is the previous #6 comment of mine. In the first revision, they added the results for neural modulation dynamics with a discrete time window as in the supplemental figure for Figure 6. This is exactly the correct way to extract the neural dynamics to examine moment-by-moment signal change, and hence, this supplemental figure is better to be shown in the main text. Use of the overlapped analysis window is problematic theoretically and empirically if they further analyzed these dynamics. This is because overlapped extraction of information does not represent neural dynamics with fine time resolution. It is obvious that when analyzing the neural population dynamics, the smoothing in the dynamics analysis is totally different from the smoothing of information used in the conventional analysis the authors used in the first half of this manuscript. Thus, I strongly recommend presenting the results with a non-overlapped window in the main text.</p><p>However, the analysis with the non-overlapped time window may not give authors enough amount of population data for statistics (now it is 17 time points, 3.5 sec / 200ms). If they hope to present their results in more fine time resolution with non-overlapped time window, I recommend using the following procedure, without overlap.</p><p>1) First, please use spike density function for a bit wider distribution (like σ = 40 ms, now it is 20 ms) before applying regression analysis.</p><p>2) and then, applied a narrower time window without overlap (like 20 ms, not the 200 ms) which gives you 175 time points for (3.5 sec / 20ms).</p><p>If they use this procedure, then, they can extract finer dynamics without overlap.</p><p>The use of the overlapped time window is problematic. Please imagine the situation that the author met. They used 200 ms time window with 90 % overlap (20 ms shift). This means that if they define the time as 100 ms for the 0 to 200 ms bin (just take average time in the time bin). It does not give them precise dynamics at the moment. So, most of the study to extract neural population dynamics avoids using overlapped analysis window.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83971.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is thought to play important roles in self-control. In this study, the authors sought to characterize the activity of STN neurons while monkeys performed a task in which they had to withhold their response during a delay period whose length was defined by a specific cue. The reviewers thought that this study contains potentially important results but they raised various concerns in some analyses, which reduced their enthusiasm for the present study. We hope that the authors can address the following essential issues.</p><p>1) To identify neurons whose activity was modulated by reward size or delay, the authors analyzed many time bins (e.g. 188 sliding windows). The results must be properly corrected for multiple comparisons, yet the method used for correction is not fully described. It is therefore unclear whether the conclusions are well supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text in the manuscript to clarify our methods. First, the threshold for significance in ANOVAs was corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction (P&lt;0.05/n-time bins). The validity of that threshold (no overestimation as shown in Figure 2) was verified by calculating the likelihood of Type 1 errors during the control period preceding the instruction cues. We used that conservative approach to identify our task-related neurons before we tested how those selected neurons were influenced individually by task parameters over the course of the hold period. This second step in our analyses was performed with β coefficients calculated via multiple linear regressions (eq. 2). The threshold for significance of individual β values was determined relative to a population of control coefficients calculated from a 1 s pre-instruction control epoch (one sample <italic>t</italic>-test, df=46, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). This statistical approach, commonly used in neurophysiological studies, is similar to methods used to detect changes in spike density functions, for instance. We agree with reviewer 3 – studying dynamic changes of β values as done here does not formally require a strong correction for multiple comparisons. In any case, independent of any statistical thresholds, we found consistent results using an alternative unsupervised approach (PCA), thereby suggesting that our single-unit analyses were appropriate for detecting task encodings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors examined the STN activity aligned to the start of the delay and also aligned to the reward. Most of the &quot;delay encoding&quot; in the STN activity was observed near the end of the waiting period. The trouble with the analysis is that a neuron that responded with exactly the same response on short and long trials could appear to be modulated by delay. This is easiest to see with a diagram, but it should be easy to imagine a neural response that quickly rose at the time of instruction and then decayed slowly over the course of 2 seconds. For long trials, the neuron's activity would have returned to baseline, but for short trials, the activity would still be above baseline. As such, it is not clear how much the STN neurons were truly modulated by delay.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. Our original analyses using two-time windows had the potential to introduce biases in the detection of neuronal activities modulated by the delay. To overcome this issue, we modified the time frame of all of our analyses (neuronal activity, eye position, EMG). Now, the revised version of the manuscript only reports activities across one-time window aligned to the time of instruction cue delivery (i.e., -1 to 3.5s relative to instruction cue onset). This time frame corresponds to the minimum possible interval between instruction cues and reward delivery. We have revised all of the figures and we re-calculated all of the statistics using that one analysis window. Despite these major modifications, our key findings were not changed substantially. We found the same pattern in STN activities, with a strong encoding of reward (48% of neurons) preceding a late encoding of delay (39% of neurons). We also updated the text in Methods and Results sections to reflect the revised analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another concern is the presence of eye movement variables in the regressions that determine whether a neuron is reward or delay encoding. If the task variables modulated eye movements (which would not be surprising) and if the STN activity also modulated eye movements, then, even if task variables did not directly modulate STN activity, the regression would indicate that it did. This is commonly known as &quot;collider bias&quot;. This is, unfortunately, a common flaw in neuroscience papers.</p></disp-quote><p>Because the presence of eye variables did not influence how neurons were selected by the GLM, we do not think it likely that our analysis was susceptible to “collider bias”. Nonetheless, to control for that possibility directly, we have now repeated the GLM analyses with eye movement variables excluded. Results are shown in a new figure (Figure 4 – supplementary 1). Exclusion of eye parameters produced results that are very similar to those from the GLM that included eye parameters (differences &lt;3 degrees). We have added text to the manuscript describing this added control analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are a number of issues I noted:</p><p>The claim &quot;Accordingly, people with low discount rates tend to pursue their long-term goals patiently, whereas people with high discount rates often abandon their goals impulsively and move on.&quot; needs a citation.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a citation (pg. 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The phrasing of &quot;Until now, however, existing evidence is mixed on whether the STN is causally involved in temporal discounting&quot; implies that this paper may provide causal evidence, which it does not.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text (pg. 4)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The model of subjective value here assumes linearity in reward value; this should be made explicit in the text and supported by any evidence you have.

One flaw, that is impossible to correct with this dataset, is that the monkeys almost always wait. This means that the dataset does not permit a comparison of successful and unsuccessful trials of the same type. In addition, the analyses had other flaws (described in more detail in the public review and in the specific comments).

'self-control' is overly broad. Waiting for a future reward is a very specific aspect of self-control (compared with other elements, e.g. the Barrett Impulsivity Scale) There is a massive literature on delay-discounting, and it is not all relevant. As the authors are aware, different tasks probe different dimensions of impulsivity. For example https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2009.12.018. I think the paper would be improved by a clearer statement of the specific aspects of &quot;self-control&quot; that the authors are addressing. For example, The ephys data was collected during a task that does not involve intertemporal choice. The subjects' only &quot;choice&quot; was to wait or not. Many studies of intertemporal choice &quot;lock&quot; the subjects in. Once the delayed option is chosen, the subject cannot change their mind. The neural mechanisms of this &quot;locked-in&quot; kind of intertemporal choice differ quite a bit from the mechanisms underlying &quot;active waiting&quot;. The task described is even more strict than most – the subjects not only have to avoid making a specific action (e.g. pressing a button) but they have to suppress ALL action. This behavior seems to be quite far from the example they give – waiting in line at a bakery. While waiting in line, I can read a book, check email, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Many studies have addressed the psychology of queuing in situations where alternative activities were not allowed. We believe that long wait times impose a cost that requires patience to overcome, even if alternative activities are allowed.

I wonder whether these type 1 error corrections underestimated the neural modulations that occur in the different task periods. If I looked at Figure 3H, J, L. % neurons encoding delay or size looks below the 5% chance (especially for the size). If the authors focused on the dynamic changes of neural signal, this correction is inaccurate, since neural activity changed moment-by-moment, and thus, this is not the case to require multiple comparisons through a trial. I guess that without correction more signals would be detected, and those signals must important for arguing the dynamics at the population level in the conventional analyses, like changes of modulated neurons across times.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to comment #1 in Essential Revisions.

After dividing the analysis window, then the authors can perform the analysis in figure 4 for each of the analysis periods.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the manuscript and figures 3-5 by splitting the waiting period into two intervals (phase 1 and phase 2). This new approach allowed us to describe key aspects of the dynamic changes in coding of task information as a function of elapsed time during the waiting period.

This causes a serious problem in using PCA. Please use non-overlapped and discrete analysis windows, in which the neural dynamics are described appropriately.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we added a new figure and we revised the text in the Methods section (pg. 30). We compared our overlapping window PCA results against those from a PCA using non-overlapped temporal windows in the estimation of regression coefficients.

While I do not fully understand the data that they have provided on GitHub, I had a brief look at it and I am concerned that there may be significant differences between the two animals, specifically that most of the significant neurons may be coming from one animal.

Then, they have these detections for all 175 (or more than 120) time bins that construct Figure 2G, I, and K. They said that in the methods &quot;The threshold for significance in those ANOVAs was corrected for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction (P &lt; 0.05/ n‐time bins).

We have revised the cited section of Methods to read “Application of the same ANOVA analysis and statistical threshold (p&lt;0.05/n-time bins) to neuronal data during the 1 s period of the pre-instruction control epoch (i.e., from a time period when the animal had no information about the upcoming reward and delay) resulted in 0.12% of Type 1 (false-positive) errors, thereby confirming that the threshold for statistical significance was appropriate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In their reply, they said how they check whether this is appropriate correction by &quot;The threshold for significance of individual β values was determined relative to a population of control coefficients calculated from a 1 s pre-instruction control epoch (one sample t-test, df=46, P &lt; 0.05).&quot; This is a critical issue because they used this correction for all of the neural and other response variable analyses, such as eye movement and EMG. The results depend on this correction, though I wonder why they find no significant neural modulation at the 1.0 sec pre-cue period (it would be found at around the 5% if they correctly improve the type 1 error) ? Is this too strong a correction, since n is more than 100?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to clarify that the (p&lt;0.05/n-time bins) correction was used only for the ANOVA analyses. A different method was used to determine the significance of results from the linear regression analyses. More specifically, the significance of individual test β values was determined by comparing them against a population of 46 “control” β values calculated from a 1 second-long control epoch prior to the onset of the instruction cue. That approach precluded testing for Type 1 errors during the 1.0 sec pre-cue period.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Dynamic analysis using overlapped analysis window.</p><p>This is the previous #6 comment of mine. In the first revision, they added the results for neural modulation dynamics with a discrete time window as in the supplemental figure for Figure 6. This is exactly the correct way to extract the neural dynamics to examine moment-by-moment signal change, and hence, this supplemental figure is better to be shown in the main text. Use of the overlapped analysis window is problematic theoretically and empirically if they further analyzed these dynamics. This is because overlapped extraction of information does not represent neural dynamics with fine time resolution. It is obvious that when analyzing the neural population dynamics, the smoothing in the dynamics analysis is totally different from the smoothing of information used in the conventional analysis the authors used in the first half of this manuscript. Thus, I strongly recommend presenting the results with a non-overlapped window in the main text.</p><p>However, the analysis with the non-overlapped time window may not give authors enough amount of population data for statistics (now it is 17 time points, 3.5 sec / 200ms). If they hope to present their results in more fine time resolution with non-overlapped time window, I recommend using the following procedure, without overlap.</p><p>1) First, please use spike density function for a bit wider distribution (like σ = 40 ms, now it is 20 ms) before applying regression analysis.</p><p>2) and then, applied a narrower time window without overlap (like 20 ms, not the 200 ms) which gives you 175 time points for (3.5 sec / 20ms).</p><p>If they use this procedure, then, they can extract finer dynamics without overlap.</p><p>The use of the overlapped time window is problematic. Please imagine the situation that the author met. They used 200 ms time window with 90 % overlap (20 ms shift). This means that if they define the time as 100 ms for the 0 to 200 ms bin (just take average time in the time bin). It does not give them precise dynamics at the moment. So, most of the study to extract neural population dynamics avoids using overlapped analysis window.</p></disp-quote><p>We have run a new analysis using non-overlapping and shorter during time windows. In the revised manuscript, results from that analysis are shown in new Figures 6 and 7. It is worth noting that the patterns of evolving population encoding revealed in the original Figure 6, which was produced using overlapping analysis windows, are preserved in nearly every detail in this new analysis. The new analysis did reveal a significant anatomic gradient for principal component 2 as described in revised text and illustrated in the revised Figure 7.</p></body></sub-article></article>
