phytophagous insects to identify host plants. The taste organs of phytophagous insects contain bitter gustatory receptors (GRs). To explore their function, the GRs in <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> were analyzed. Through RNA sequencing and qPCR, we detected abundant <italic>PxylGr34</italic> transcripts in the larval head and adult antennae. Functional analyses using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system and 24 diverse phytochemicals showed that PxylGr34 is tuned to the canonical plant hormones brassinolide (BL) and 24-epibrassinolide (EBL). Electrophysiological analyses revealed that the medial sensilla styloconica of 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae are responsive to BL and EBL. Dual-choice bioassays demonstrated that BL inhibits larval feeding and female oviposition. Knock-down of PxylGr34 by RNAi attenuates the taste responses to BL, and abolishes BL-induced feeding inhibition. These results increase our understanding of how herbivorous insects detect compounds that deter feeding and oviposition, and may be useful for designing plant hormone-based pest management strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Plant-eating insects use their sense of taste to decide where to feed and where to lay their eggs. They do this using taste sensors called gustatory receptors which reside in the antennae and legs of adults, and in the mouthparts of larvae. Some of these sensors detect sugars which signal to the insect that the plant is a nutritious source of food. While others detect bitter compounds, such as poisons released by plants in self-defense.</p><p>One of the most widespread plant-eating insects is the diamondback moth, which feeds and lays its eggs on cruciferous vegetable crops, like cabbage, oilseed rape and broccoli. Before laying its eggs, female diamondback moths pat the vegetable’s leaves with their antennae, tasting for the presence of chemicals. But little was known about the identity of these chemicals.</p><p>Cabbages produce large amounts of a hormone called brassinolide, which is known to play a role in plant growth. To find out whether diamondback moths can taste this hormone, Yang et al. examined all their known gustatory receptors. This revealed that the adult antennae and larval mouthparts of these moths make high levels of a receptor called PxylGr34.</p><p>To investigate the role of PxylGr34, Yang et al. genetically modified frog eggs to produce this receptor. Various tests on these receptors, as well as receptors in the mouthparts of diamondback larvae, showed that PxylGr34 is able to sense the hormone brassinolide. To find out how this affects the behavior of the moths, Yang et al. investigated how adults and larvae responded to different levels of the hormone. This revealed that the presence of brassinolide significantly decreased both larval feeding and the amount of eggs laid by adult moths.</p><p>Farmers already use brassinolide to enhance plant growth and protect crops from stress. These results suggest that the hormone might also help to shield plants from insect damage. However, more research is needed to understand how this hormone acts as a deterrent. Further studies could improve understanding of insect behavior and potentially identify more chemicals that can be used for pest control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Plutella xylostella</kwd><kwd>gustatory receptor</kwd><kwd>functional analysis</kwd><kwd>RNAi</kwd><kwd>brassinolide</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>oviposition bioassays</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31830088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chen-Zhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019M660792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key R and D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFD0200400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chen-Zhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The gustatory receptor PxylGr34 is tuned to the steroid plant hormone brassinolide and mediates the deterrent effects of brassinolide on feeding and ovipositing behaviors in <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many phytophagous insects have evolved to select a limited range of host plants. Understanding the ultimate and proximate mechanisms underlying this selection strategy is a crucial issue in the field of insect–plant interactions. Insects’ decisions to feed and oviposit are mainly based on information carried via chemosensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schoonhoven et al., 2005</xref>). Insects discriminate among potential hosts after perceiving a combination of lineage-specific and more ubiquitous chemicals synthesized by plants. Some nutrients are ubiquitous across plant taxa. For example, various sugars and amino acids are feeding stimulants for the majority of herbivorous insects. Secondary plant metabolites occur in certain plant taxa at much higher concentrations than in others, and therefore are of greater significance in host-plant selection by insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jermy, 1966</xref>). They are usually deterrent or ‘bitter’ compounds for many phytophagous insects, except for some specialized species that use them as token stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schoonhoven et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Phytophagous insects have sophisticated taste systems to recognize deterrent or stimulant compounds, which direct their feeding and oviposition behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yarmolinsky et al., 2009</xref>). The taste sensilla of insects are mainly situated on the mouthparts, tarsi, ovipositor, and antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernays and Chapman, 1994</xref>). These sensilla take the form of hairs or cones with a terminal pore in the cuticular structure, and often contain the dendrites of three or four gustatory sensory neurons (GSNs). The axons of GSNs synapse directly onto the central nervous system. Analyses using the tip-recording technique for taste sensilla led to the discovery of a ‘deterrent neuron’ in the larvae of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa, 1966</xref>) and <italic>Pieris brassicae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma, 1969</xref>). Since then, GSNs coding for secondary plant metabolites have been identified in maxillary sensilla in larvae and tarsal sensilla of adults of many Lepidopteran species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glendinning et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). However, the molecular basis of these deterrent neurons remains unclear.</p><p>Gustatory receptors (GRs) expressed in the dendrites of GSNs determine the selectivity of the response of GSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thorne et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Since the first insect GRs were identified in the model organism <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clyne et al., 2000</xref>), the function of some of its bitter GRs have been revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dweck and Carlson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freeman and Dahanukar, 2015</xref>). Five <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> GRs (Gr47a, Gr32a, Gr33a, Gr66a, and Gr22e) are involved in sensing strychnine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poudel et al., 2017</xref>). Nicotine-induced action potentials are dependent on Gr10a, Gr32a, and Gr33a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rimal and Lee, 2019</xref>). Gr8a, Gr66a, and Gr98b function together in the detection of L-canavanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shim et al., 2015</xref>). Gr33a, Gr66a, and Gr93a participate in the responses to caffeine and umbelliferone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poudel et al., 2015</xref>). Gr28b is necessary for avoiding saponin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sang et al., 2019</xref>). However, only a few studies have focused on the function of bitter GRs in phytophagous insects. PxutGr1, a bitter GR in <italic>Papilio xuthus</italic>, was found to respond specifically to the oviposition stimulant, synephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ozaki et al., 2011</xref>). In recent studies, the insect bitter GRs BmorGr16, BmorGr18, and BmorGr53 showed response to coumarin and caffeine in vitro, and coumarin was found to have a feeding deterrent effect on <italic>B. mori</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasubuchi et al., 2018</xref>); another bitter GR in <italic>B. mori,</italic> Gr66, was reported to be responsible for the mulberry-specific feeding preference of silkworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Although some progress has been made in determining the functions of such receptors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and a few herbivorous insects, we still lack basic mechanistic information about the functions of bitter GRs from most herbivorous insect lineages.</p><p><italic>Plutella xylostella</italic> (L.) is the most widespread Lepidopteran pest species, causing losses of US$ 4–5 billion per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">You et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zalucki et al., 2012</xref>). It has developed resistance to the usual insecticides because of its short life cycle (14 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furlong et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>P. xylostella</italic> mainly selects Brassica species as its host plants, and its females pat the leaf surfaces with their antennae before egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qiu et al., 1998</xref>). This behavior may be related to certain chemical components in leaves of <italic>Brassica</italic> species, including sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, amines, glucosinolates, and plant hormones. Among these compounds, sinigrin and brassinolide (BL) have relatively higher concentrations in Brassica than in many other plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fahey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lv et al., 2014</xref>). Sinigrin is known to be a feeding/oviposition stimulant for <italic>P. xylostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta and Thorsteinson, 1960</xref>). The medial sensilla styloconica in the maxillary galea of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae contain a GSN sensitive to sinigrin and other glucosinolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Loon et al., 2002</xref>). BL is a ubiquitous plant hormone that has been widely studied in relation to its role in plant growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clouse and Sasse, 1998</xref>), but little is known about its effects on the behavior of phytophagous insects.</p><p>To uncover the molecular basis of the perception of feeding/oviposition stimulants and deterrents by <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, we re-examined all the GRs reported in previous studies on this insect. Through transcriptome analysis and qPCR, we identified one bitter GR (PxylGr34) highly expressed in the larval head and the adult antennae. We functionally analyzed this GR with the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system and RNAi, and found that PxylGr34 is tuned to BL as a feeding and oviposition deterrent in <italic>P. xylostella</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of <italic>PxylGr34</italic>, a highly expressed GR gene in <italic>P. xylostella</italic></title><p>To search for candidate GRs that may be involved in host selection by <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, we searched for candidates among those that had been annotated in the <italic>P. xylostella</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engsontia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">You et al., 2013</xref>), the transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), and the <italic>P. xylostella</italic> GRs deposited in GenBank (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We obtained 79 annotated GRs (69 GRs from the genome, 7 GRs from the transcriptome, and 3 GRs from GenBank). After removing repetitive sequences and deleting paired sequences with amino acid identity greater than 99%, we validated 67 of the GR sequences (61 GRs from the genome, 3 GRs from the transcriptome, and 3 GRs from GenBank) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). On this basis, we first analyzed the transcriptomes of the antennae, forelegs (only tibia and tarsi), and head (without antennae) of adults, and the mouthparts of 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae although the genomic data and antennae transcriptome of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> had been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">You et al., 2013</xref>). Next, we looked specifically for candidates that were highly expressed in these chemosensory organs by calculating the transcripts per million (TPM) values of these 67 GRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Those GRs with high expression levels in both adult and larval taste organs were considered to be candidates for those with key roles in the host-plant selection of this species. Intriguingly, the TPM value of <italic>PxylGr34</italic>, which clustered with bitter GRs, was much higher than those of other GR genes in the antennae, head and forelegs of adults, as well as the mouthparts of larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>PxylGr34</italic> was originally annotated from genomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engsontia et al., 2014</xref>), and then detected in the antennal transcriptomic data of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> (named as ‘<italic>PxylGr2</italic>’ in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). However, both studies provided only its partial coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Based on our transcriptomic data, we obtained the full-length coding sequence of <italic>PxylGr34</italic> through gene cloning and Sanger sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The protein encoded by <italic>PxylGr34</italic> is typical of most GRs with seven transmembrane domains, and a full open reading frame (ORF) of 418 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic tree of gustatory receptors (GRs).</title><p>Amino acid sequences are based on previously reported GRs.

Our results show that PxylGr34 is specifically tuned to BL and its racemate EBL, and that the medial sensilla styloconica of 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae have electrophysiological responses to BL and EBL. Our results also show that BL inhibits larval feeding and female oviposition of <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, and that knock-down of PxylGr34 by RNAi can attenuate the responses of sensilla to BL, and abolish the feeding inhibition effect of BL. This is the first study to show that an insect can detect and react to this steroid plant hormone. The results of the systematic functional analyses of the GR, the electrophysiological responses of the sensilla, behavioral assays, and behavioral regulation <italic>in vivo</italic> show that PxylGr34 is a bitter GR specifically tuned to BL. This receptor mediates the deterrent effects of BL on feeding and ovipositing behaviors of <italic>P. xylostella</italic>.</p><p>The larvae of Lepidopteran species have two pairs of gustatory sensilla (medial and lateral sensilla styloconica) located in the maxillae galea; these sensilla play a decisive role in larval food selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dethier, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schoonhoven and van Loon, 2002</xref>). Each sensillum usually contains four GSNs, of which one is often responsive to deterrents. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa, 1966</xref> described a ‘deterrent neuron’ in the medial sensillum styloconicum of silkworm, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, and showed that it responds to several plant alkaloids and phenolics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa, 1966</xref>). Similar neurons have been found in other Lepidopteran species, but their profiles vary. For example, the tobacco hornworm, <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, has a deterrent neuron in the medial sensillum styloconicum that responds to aristolochic acid, and another deterrent neuron in the lateral sensillum styloconicum that responds to salicin, caffeine, and aristolochic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glendinning et al., 2002</xref>). The diversity of GRs facilitates the detection of, and discrimination among, a wide range of diverse taste stimuli, implying that different sets of bitter GRs are expressed in these neurons. In this study, we proved that one GSN in the medial maxillary sensillum styloconicum of the 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae of the diamondback moth responds to sinigrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van Loon et al., 2002</xref>), and we identified one neuron responding to BL and EBL in the same sensillum. For <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae, sinigrin is a feeding stimulant whereas BL and EBL are feeding deterrents, together with sinigrin and BL/EBL have different spike amplitudes, we speculate that the GRs tuned to sinigrin and BL/EBL are located in different GSNs in the medial sensilla styloconica.</p><p>The GR family is massively expanded in moth species, and most of the GRs are bitter GRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). However, few studies have functionally characterized bitter GRs. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the loss of bitter GRs was found to eliminate repellent behavior in response to specific noxious compounds. For example, <italic>Gr33a</italic> mutant flies could not avoid non-volatile repellents like quinine and caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moon et al., 2009</xref>), and mutation of Gr98b impaired the detection of L-canavanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shim et al., 2015</xref>). When the bitter GR PxutGr1 of <italic>P. xuthus</italic> was knocked-down by RNAi, the oviposition behavior in response to synephrine was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ozaki et al., 2011</xref>). Knock-out of the bitter GR BmorGr66 in <italic>B. mori</italic> larvae resulted in a loss of feeding specificity for mulberry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, BL and EBL induced a strong response in the oocytes expressing PxylGr34, knock-down of PxylGr34 in the larvae of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> eliminated the feeding deterrence of BL, indicating that this bitter GR is specifically tuned to BL and EBL, and mediates the aversive response of larvae to BL and related compounds. Although the 24 tested compounds represent a wide range of compound profiles, the ligands of PxylGr34 could be more than BL and EBL. Given the high expression level of <italic>PxylGr34</italic> in the taste organs of <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, we could not rule out the possibility that this gene also functions together with other <italic>GRs</italic> to perceive other compounds.</p><p>BL was the first brassinosteroid (BR) hormone to be discovered in plants. It was first isolated and identified from a crude extract of pollen from oilseed rape (<italic>Brassica napus</italic> L.), and was found to induce rapid elongation of pinto bean <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> internodes distinct from gibberellin-mediated stem elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mitchell et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grove et al., 1979</xref>). Almost all plant tissues contain BRs, and they function to promote elongation and stimulate cell division, participate in vascular differentiation and fertilization, and affect senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clouse and Sasse, 1998</xref>). As a C<sub>28</sub> BR, BL exhibits the highest activity among all BRs and is distributed widely in the plant kingdom, along with other biosynthetically related compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clouse and Sasse, 1998</xref>). Exogenous application of BL and its analog 24-epibrassinolide (EBL) to plants has been shown to increase their stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clouse and Sasse, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Plant hormones, although generally found in small amounts and rarely toxic, play a key role in regulating plant growth, development, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bari and Jones, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krouk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu and Baldwin, 2010</xref>). Jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, ethylene, and abscisic acid have been shown to be involved in priming plant defense responses against herbivorous insects and plant pathogens by activating related signal transduction pathways and changing the expression of defense-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bari and Jones, 2009</xref>). Jasmonic acid plays an important role in plant resistance to insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Plants accumulate jasmonic acid and its derivatives upon wounding. Exogenous treatment with jasmonic acid activates the expression of hundreds of defense-related genes. Application of exogenous jasmonic acid to cabbage plants was shown to indirectly retard the development of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae and reduce the pupal weight and female fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lv and Liu, 2005</xref>). Therefore, signaling molecules associated with induced plant defenses may be used as reliable cues by herbivorous insects. Up to now, only one study showed that <italic>Helicoverpa zea</italic> reacts to jasmonate and salicylate in plants, resulting in the activation of four of its cytochrome P450 genes that are associated with detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2002</xref>). However, how the caterpillars eavesdrop the hormone signals remains a mystery. The present study provides the first evidence that <italic>P. xylostella</italic> can detect the plant hormone BL with a bitter GR. This reflects a new adaptation of insects to plant defenses.</p><p>Herbivorous insects have evolved counter adaptations against the chemical defenses of plants. The perception of bitter substances is an adaptation to avoid potentially toxic secondary plant metabolites. We can speculate that BL and EBL may influence insect development because BL and EBL have strikingly similar structures to that of ecdysteroid hormones in arthropods, such as 20-hydroxyecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujioka and Sakurai, 1997</xref>). Their structures are so similar that BL and EBL show agonistic activity with 20-hydroxyecdysone in many insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zullo and Adam, 2002</xref>). It has been shown that injection with 20 µg EBL was fatal to mid last-instar larvae of <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smagghe et al., 2002</xref>). The BL content differs widely among plant species; for example, it is 1.37 × 10<sup>−4</sup> g/kg in <italic>Brassica campestris</italic> L. leaves and 1.25 × 10<sup>−6</sup> g/kg in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lv et al., 2014</xref>). Our results show that BL has the inhibitory effects on feeding and oviposition of <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, and the threshold concentration of BL for such behavioral inhibitions of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> is in the range of 10<sup>−4</sup>–10<sup>−3</sup> g/kg, suggesting that BL plays a dual role of plant hormones and insect feeding/oviposition deterrents in plants.</p><p>There is a rich variety of bitter GRs in phytophagous insects, but only a few have been functionally characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasubuchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we showed that PxylGr34, a bitter GR highly expressed in larval head and adult antennae of <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, is tuned to the plant hormones BL and EBL, which mediates the aversive feeding/oviposition responses of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> to these compounds. These findings not only increase our understanding of the gustatory coding mechanisms of feeding/oviposition deterrents in phytophagous insects, but also offer new perspectives for using plant hormones as potential agents to suppress pest insects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Please note that <italic>eLife</italic> aims for an efficient peer review process and rejects submissions in cases where revisions are likely to take longer than two months. However, should you address the concerns summarized in the following paragraph, we would be happy to consider a revised study as a new submission.</p><p>As you will see from the reviews below, the reviewers thought that the topic is interesting but raised conceptual and technical concerns which would require additional experiments to fully address. Reviewers 1 and 2 raised concerns about the framing of the study that require addressing. Reviewer 3 raised concerns about the tip recordings and behavioral experiments that also require addressing. The reviewers agree that it is essential for the authors to perform additional SSR experiments including knockdown animals and e.g. sinigrin as a positive control. The reviewers also recommend that the authors revise the text and figures, including some reorganization (e.g. move EBL experiments to supplementals). Reviewer three noted that a more detailed molecular characterization of PxylGr34 would be interesting, but the reviewers and editors agree that this would be beyond the scope of the study and do not consider it to be an essential revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The vast majority of herbivorous insects are specialized on a set of host plants and use a combination of lineage-specific and more ubiquitous chemicals synthesized by plants to discriminate among potential hosts. Mechanistic information on this question is lacking, specifically regarding the identify and evolution of chemoreceptors that are responsible for mediating these behaviors, which are central to understanding the evolution of herbivorous insects. Although progress has been made on non-herbivorous drosophilids and two herbivorous drosophilids, we still lack basic mechanistic information from most herbivorous lineages. Here, Yang et al. focus on this question using the mustard-specialized diamondback moth <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>. Through RNA sequencing and qPCR, they identified PxylGr34 as being highly expressed in adult female antennae and in larval tissues. By expressing PxylGr34 in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> and subjecting them to 24 diverse phytochemicals, they found that the canonical plant hormones brassinolide and 24-epibrassinolide induce a strong response at increasing concentrations. This electrophysiological response is similarly seen from recordings from larval medial (but not lateral) sensilla styloconica. Behavioral assays with larvae and mated adult females in which individuals are given a choice between pea discs/plastic film, respectively, treated and untreated with BL, show aversion to BL in both life stages. In larvae, this aversion is reduced by feeding them PxylGr34 siRNA, which significantly, but not completely, reduced mRNA expression of PxylGr34 in their heads. Collectively, these results show compelling evidence that PxylGr34 very likely mediates the response to BL. While there is clearly still much to learn in terms of understanding the coding mechanisms of Grs, i.e. whether other Grs are necessary for this BL-induced response, this is significant because very few Grs have been implicated in the role of detecting plant compounds among truly herbivorous insects. This is also the first time a chemoreceptor has been identified that seems to be tuned to this particular plant hormone, a ubiquitous plant steroid. Where this manuscript can improve is the general framework and discussion and the importance of discriminating diverse phytochemicals and in particular how insects can use host cues associated with stress, including plant hormones, to avoid particular plants.</p><p>1) The expression patterns of PxylGr34 is really striking, which supports their interest in focusing on it. I think the framing of the paper isn't doing it justice. In the Results section under &quot;Identification of the GR gene PxylGr34 in <italic>P. xylostella</italic>&quot; they would benefit from framing it in a question driven way, i.e. they were interested in searching for candidate Grs that may be involved in host selection within a model herbivore, and they looked for candidates among those that had been annotated from the <italic>P. xylostella</italic> genome. They then looked specifically for candidates that were highly expressed, comparing several chemosensory organs. Intriguingly, PxylGr34 was highly expressed in the antennae, as well as in other gustatory tissues, relative to other Grs. Because the expression data across Grs provides the biggest piece of evidence for focusing on this Gr, I would pull Figure 1—figure supplement 2 out from the supplement and stick it in Figure 1 as an additional panel. That being said, just because it is highly expressed, doesn't mean that it is the most important Gr for enabling feeding discrimination on their host plants – it would certainly be interesting to do the same experiments with all the other Grs but that's out of the scope of this paper for now.</p><p>2) &quot;Brassinolide (BL) is a C28 brassinosteroid (BR)…&quot; this whole paragraph needs to be restructured so that it's clearer why they focused on brassinolides, a plant hormone, rather than the typical anti-herbivore plant defenses, as mentioned in the previous sentence, or rather than other plant hormones. They outline some interesting reasons, i.e. their ubiquity in the plant kingdom, their structural similarity to molting hormones, but more explanation would benefit their study-there is still a way to frame this that makes the choice to focus on BLs clearer. After reading the rest of the paper, it's clear now that they tested 24 different phytochemicals of various groups, and brassinolide was the one that activated PxylGr34. But it makes sense for the Introduction to discuss more generally what their initial thoughts or hypotheses were about the kinds of compounds that should be important for herbivorous insects. If they had an a priori reason to be interested in brassinolides, then discuss that here; otherwise, leave it for the Discussion section.</p><p>3) Subsection “BL and its analog EBL induced a strong response in the oocytes expressing PxylGr34” – it would be great to mention earlier in this paper that 24 phytochemicals were tested, in the Abstract and Introduction. It would have answered my earlier questions about why there was a focus on brassinolides. Also, it might be worth mentioning that brassinolides might not be the only stimulant of Gr34; although 24 is a rather large number of compounds to test, there still may be others. Also, I only see the chemical listed in Figure 2. It would be great to list them at least in the Materials and methods, with source information.</p><p>4) Discussion paragraph six – it would make sense if this last paragraph or some part of the discussion was framed around why insects would want to detect brassinolides. That's the main question I've had throughout this paper. Is there evidence that insects routinely detect plant hormones to regulate their behavior (I know this to be true, but a paragraph on this topic csould be important)? Do these hormones correlate well with the nutritional content, growth, stress, defense concentrations, etc. within the plants to provide a reliable cue for where to feed? From there, you can then speculate that perhaps the BL may influence insect development because of the structural similarity with ecdysteroids, and then that discussion flows well from there.</p><p>5) Subsection “Phylogenetic analysis” – neighbor joining (NJ) method – NJ is not a true phylogenetic method per se (it ignores character information completely), and so I suggest you repeated this analysis by using maximum likelihood inference or Bayesian inference (BI). NJ is based on genetic distances, whereas ML or BI uses the character information and a model of sequence evolution to explore the tree space before selecting the most likely tree. The general consensus is that more robust phylogenetic methods should be used for datasets like these.</p><p>6) Figure 1 and Figure 3: For Figure 1, I'd like to see all datapoints overlaid on each histogram. Same with Figure 3B and 3D and Figure 4, 5, 6 where practicable. All of the raw data should be deposited in an excel sheet that is easily accessible, so we can link each figure to a dataset readily (data for each figure on a different sheet in same file).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes the expression pattern of gustatory receptors in taste organs of larvae and females of the cabbage moth. One of these receptors (GR34) belonging to the bitter receptors was found to have an especially high expression level. Heterologous expression of GR34 in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> revealed a ubiquitous plant hormone, brassinolide, as the best ligand. Brassinolide turned out to be deterrent for foraging larvae and egg laying females. After silencing the expression of GR34 in larvae, the deterrent effect of the plant hormone was abolished. Although the manuscript adds valuable information about the function of gustatory receptors in insects, several points are not clearly enough explained to reach a broader audience.</p><p>1) Novelty of the research: The authors stress in the Introduction that the molecular basis of deterrent gustatory neurons in phytophagous insects has not been investigated yet. However, one publication they cite at the end of their discussion (Kasubuchi et al., 2018) could deorphanize several bitter GRs in the silk moth, and show the deterrent effect of a ligand of these GRs in larvae. It would be reasonable to mention this study already in the Introduction, and state in which way the present manuscript wants to add further insights, e.g. by silencing the receptor and testing oviposition behavior.</p><p>2) Role of the plant hormone brassinolide: It should be explained why it is interesting to test if insects can detect this ubiquitous plant hormone. Is brassinolide regularly tested in insect gustatory research? What kind of information might high doses of brassinolide that are necessary to elicit physiological and behavioral responses convey for the hungry larvae or egg-laying female? As the hormone is present across the plant kingdom and in almost every plant tissue it is difficult to imagine how it could be used to identify host plants.</p><p>3) Molecular work: A) How were the 21 GRs analyzed in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 selected from the 42 bitter GRs identified the phylogenetic tree? B) Why is there a difference in the expression pattern of GR34 in female tissue in Figure 1-S3 (antenna, head and foreleg) and in Figure 1 (only antenna)?</p><p>4) Effect of GR34 in egg laying behavior: The focus of the study was on larvae; however, it would be worth exploring the role of GR34 in female moths. Would it be possible to record from antennal gustatory sensilla of the female, and to silence GR34 also in females and investigate the effect on oviposition? It should be mentioned in the Introduction or Discussion that Plutella females touch the leaf surfaces with their antenna before egg laying to explain why gustatory receptors on the antenna might be useful for host plant choice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors characterized PxylGr34 of <italic>P. xylostella</italic>.

We also add several sentences in the Introduction as follows: “The chemical components in leaves of <italic>Brassica</italic> species, including sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, amines, glucosinolates and plant hormones, may be involved in such a process. Among these compounds, sinigrin and brassinolide (BL) have relatively higher concentrations in <italic>Brassica</italic> than in many other plant species (Fahey et al., 2001; Lv et al., 2014). Sinigrin has been proved as a feeding/ oviposition stimulant for <italic>P. xylostella</italic> (Gupta and Thorsteinson, 1960). The medial sensilla styloconica in the maxillary galea of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae contain a GSN sensitive to sinigrin and other glucosinolates (van Loon et al., 2002).

As the hormone is present across the plant kingdom and in almost every plant tissue it is difficult to imagine how it could be used to identify host plants.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We add the information in the Introduction as follows:</p><p>“The chemical components in leaves of <italic>Brassica</italic> species, including sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, amines, glucosinolates and plant hormones, may be involved in such a process. Among these compounds, sinigrin and brassinolide (BL) have relatively higher concentrations in <italic>Brassica</italic> than in many other plant species (Fahey et al., 2001; Lv et al., 2014). Sinigrin has been proved as a feeding/ oviposition stimulant for <italic>P.</italic></p><p><italic>xylostella</italic> (Gupta and Thorsteinson, 1960). The medial sensilla styloconica in the maxillary galea of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> larvae contain a GSN sensitive to sinigrin and other glucosinolates (van Loon et al., 2002). BL as a ubiquitous plant hormone has been widely studied in plant growth and development (Clouse and Sasse, 1998), but little is known about its behavioral effects on phytophagous insects.”</p><p>As far as we known, brassinolide (BL) was not tested in previous insect taste studies although BL shows agonistic activity with 20hydroxyecdysone in many insect species (Zullo and Adam, 2002).</p><p>This study shows that the hungry larvae avoid feeding and the egg-laying females avoid ovipositing on the plant with the high concentration of BL. We suggest that this is an adaptation of this insect species to potential toxic substances in plants because BL has a similar structure with insect molting hormones such as 20-hydroecdysone and may have detrimental effect on survival and development of <italic>P. xylostella</italic>.</p><p>The plant hormone BRs are present across the plant kingdom and in almost every plant tissue, but their content differs widely among plant 4 species. For example, the concentration of BL is 1.37×10<sup>-4</sup> g/kg in <italic>Brassica campestris</italic> L. leaves, while it is 1.25×10<sup>-6</sup> g/kg in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaves (Lv et al., 2014). Our results show that the threshold concentration of BL for behavioral inhibition of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> is in the range of 10<sup>-4</sup> –10<sup>-3</sup> g/kg, so we suggest that <italic>P. xylostella</italic> could detect the plants or plant tissues with higher concentration of BL with this receptor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Molecular work: A) How were the 21 GRs analyzed in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 selected from the 42 bitter GRs identified the phylogenetic tree? B) Why is there a difference in the expression pattern of GR34 in female tissue in Figure 1-S3 (antenna, head and foreleg) and in Figure 1 (only antenna)?</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the expression of all the 67 validated GRs of <italic>P. xylostella</italic>, by calculating the transcripts per million (TPM) values based on our transcriptome data. However, 46 GRs showed very low expression and TPM was zero, so we only list the 21 GRs. We add “The GRs that undetectable in the TPM analysis were not listed.” in the figure legend.</p><p>Generally, most genes showed consistent results between RNAsequencing and qPCR data. However, the inconsistent expression results would be observed between them especially when the genes were lower expressed in some tissues (Everaert et al., 2017). This fits the case of Gr34 here. In this study, the expression of Gr34 in the head and foreleg are much lower than in the antennae although Gr34 also has some expression in female head and foreleg based on the qPCR analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Effect of GR34 in egg laying behavior: The focus of the study was on larvae; however, it would be worth exploring the role of GR34 in female moths. Would it be possible to record from antennal gustatory sensilla of the female, and to silence GR34 also in females and investigate the effect on oviposition? It should be mentioned in the Introduction or Discussion that Plutella females touch the leaf surfaces with their antenna before egg laying to explain why gustatory receptors on the antenna might be useful for host plant choice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We agree that it would be worth exploring the role of Gr34 in female moths. However, the gustatory sensilla in the female moth antenna are very small and dense, we had tried but it is very hard to get recordings from the single gustatory sensillum from female antennae.</p><p>We totally agree that it would be very meaningful to silence Gr34 also in females and investigate the effect on oviposition. We had tried to inject the siRNA into the female pupae, but all failed because the pupae of <italic>P. xylostella</italic> is so small that the injection harmed the pupae severely. Therefore, we only successfully carried out the larval RNAi experiment and measured physiological and feeding effects in this work.</p><p>Sure, <italic>P. xylostella</italic> uses antennae to pat leaf surfaces before egg laying. We add “<italic>P. xylostella</italic> mainly selects <italic>Brassica</italic> species as its host plants, and its females pat the leaf surfaces with their antennae before egg laying (Qiu et al., 1998).” in Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors characterized PxylGr34 of P. xylostella. They identified the full-length coding sequencing of PxylGr34 based on public data and their unpublished RNA-seq data. They found that PxylGr34 is highly expressed in larva head as well as female antennae in a real-time PCR. Through functional studies, they show that PxylGr34 is specifically tuned to BL and EBL in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte in vitro system. They further show that BL evoked electrophysiological response in the medial sensilla styloconica on maxillary galea of larvae. Finally, they show BL inhibited larvae feeding and female oviposition of P. xylostella.</p><p>The authors have done a good job of characterizing PxylGr34 in vitro analysis. However, this manuscript has to remedy several limitations to be published in eLife.</p><p>1) It will be great if they can show the molecular properties of PxylGr34- for example, whether they are ligand-gated channels or G-protein coupled receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. The molecular properties of GRs are a very important aspect in GR studies. Insect GRs are evolutionarily related to the insect olfactory receptors (ORs). The insect ORs have an inverted topology relative to GPCRs, and functions both in ligand-gated channels and G-protein coupled (Sato et al., 2008; Wicher et al., 2008). Similarly, insect GRs also have an inverted topology relative to GPCRs (Xu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011), and may function in ligandgated ion channel (Sato et al., 2011). Given the close relationship between insect GRs and ORs, it could be that PxylGr34 functions both in ligandgated channel and G-protein coupled. We would further analyze the molecular properties of PxylGr34, and study its structure and function relationship in the next.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are several issues with tip-recording.</p><p>i) It is not clear whether PxylGr34 is required for BL-evoked in vivo electrophysiological responses. A knockdown experiment is recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept your suggestion. We carried out a new knockdown experiment and tested the electrophysiological responses, which result in the new figures, Figure 8B and 8C. We found that the frequency of spikes to BL elicited in the medial sensilla styloconica of the PxylGr34 siRNA treated larvae was decreased. We add this result in revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) Representative traces are hard to read, making it difficult to determine whether these are actual spikes upon BL stimulation. Also, please add a y-axis scale bar.</p></disp-quote><p>Good suggestions and we accept both of them. We rearrange the representative traces of BL stimulation in the revised Figure 4A; add the y-axis scale bar in the revised Figure 4A, 4C, 4E, and Figure 5A, Figure 8B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Since it has been reported that Sinigrin and glucosinolates stimulate the same sensilla, it is beneficial to show the spikes evoked by these chemicals as a control.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a very good suggestion and we accept it. We carried out a new electrophysiological experiment using sinigrin as a positive control. New data are present in two new figures, Figure 4E and 4F. As previously reported, the medial sensilla styloconica also exhibited vigorous responses to sinigrin. However, the spike amplitudes induced by sinigrin were larger than those induced by BL and EBL (Figure 4E and 4F). These results suggest that BL and EBL activate the same neuron, while sinigrin activates a different neuron in the sensillum. We add this result in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) Please show whether EBL can also stimulate the GSNs in the medial sensilla.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept your suggestion and run a new experiment to test the electrophysiological responses of the GSNs in the medial and lateral sensilla to EBL. The results show that of the two pairs of sensilla styloconica in the maxillary galea of 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae, the lateral sensilla styloconica had no response to EBL (Figure 4C and 4D); the medial sensilla styloconica exhibited vigorous responses to EBL at 3.3×10<sup>-4</sup> M, and the spike amplitudes induced by BL and EBL were about the same (Figure 4A, B, C, and D). The spike amplitudes induced by sinigrin were larger than those induced by BL and EBL (Figure 4E and 4F). These results suggest that BL and EBL activate the same neuron, while sinigrin activates a different neuron in the sensillum. We add this result in the revised Figure 4C and 4D, and in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v) It will be beneficial to show the schematic of larval taste organs.</p></disp-quote><p>It is a very nice suggestion, we accept it and add the schematic of larval taste organs in the revised Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The effect of EBL is not convincing. It will be helpful to provide a dose-response profile with a wide range of EBL.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept your suggestion and run a new experiment. In the revised version, we provide a dose-response profile with a wide range of EBL in the Figure 6—figure supplement 1. We found that the feeding areas of larvae were significantly smaller on the leaf discs treated with EBL at concentrations of 10<sup>-4</sup> M and above than on the control leaf discs, which is similar with BL. We add this result in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is hard to tell if the knockdown of PxylGr34 has an effect on feeding behavior. It seems that only control food feeding increased, in contrast to BL-containing food.</p></disp-quote><p>It is an important question, and then we repeated the treatment of the knockdown of PxylGr34 on the feeding behavior of 4<sup>th</sup> instar larvae. The results show that the PxylGr34 siRNA-treated larvae had no significant preference for control leaf discs over those treated with BL, which is consistent with the result in the original manuscript. It proves that the knock-down of PxylGr34 by RNAi abolishes BL-induced feeding inhibition, which is not caused by control food feeding increased.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is interesting whether PxylGr34 is only expressed in adult female antenna and involved in ovipositing. Is it expressed in male antenna? If it is, what is the role of PxylGr34 in male?</p></disp-quote><p>It is a nice question. We newly tested the expression of PxylGr34 in the male antennae, and found that PxylGr34 also has high expression in male antennae. For <italic>P. xylostella</italic> is a typical specialist and mate detection is closely related with the chemical cues of the host plants, we speculate that PxylGr34 may take part in the judgement of host plants in both male and females. We add this result in the revised Figure 2C, and in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There is no description for Figure 2D in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry. Now we add the description for it (now Figure 3D) in revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors have to provide the experimental condition and data of the survival test with BL.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. The experimental condition is provided in Materials and methods as “The axisymmetric pinnate leaf was freshly picked from 4-week-old pea plants grown in a climate-controlled room. One leaf was folded in half, and two leaf discs (diameter, 7 mm) were punched from the two halves as the control (C) and treated (T) discs, respectively. For the treated discs, 5 µL (13 µL/cm<sup>2</sup> ) of the test compound diluted in 50% ethanol was spread on the upper surface using a paint brush. For the control discs, 5 µL 50% ethanol was applied in the same way. Control (C) and treated (T) discs were placed in a C-T-C-T sequence around the circumference of the culture dish (60 mm diameter × 15 mm depth; Corning, NY, USA). After the ethanol had evaporated (15 min later), a single 4<sup>th</sup> instar caterpillar (day 1), which had been starved for 6 h, was placed in each dish. The dishes were kept for 24 h at 23°–25°C in the dark, to avoid visual stimuli. Each dish was covered with a circular filter paper disc (diameter 7 cm) moistened with 200 µL ddH<sub>2</sub>O to maintain humidity.”</p><p>Considering BL did not affect larval survival but may reduce development time or have other detrmental effects because of its simularity with ecdysone, we delete the survival test with BL in the revised version, as suggested by Reviewer 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Typo Figure 1 legend “4th instar larvae” to “adult female.”</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for this mistake. We correct it in the revised version.</p></body></sub-article></article>
