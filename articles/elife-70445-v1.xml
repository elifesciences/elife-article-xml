search during retrieval. We measured the activation of story-specific and schematic representations using fMRI while participants were presented with 16 stories and then recalled each of the narratives, and related these activations to memory for specific story details. We predicted that schema representations in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) would be correlated with successful recall of story details. In keeping with this prediction, an anterior mPFC region showed a significant correlation between activation of schema representations at encoding and subsequent behavioral recall performance; however, this mPFC region was not implicated in schema representation during retrieval. More generally, our analyses revealed largely distinct brain networks at encoding and retrieval in which schema activation was related to successful recall. These results provide new insight into when and where event knowledge can support narrative memory.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our day-to-day experiences are incredibly complex, so how does the brain remember them? Cognitive scientists have shown that memories rely on knowledge of common events that we have experienced before. Think about going to a restaurant: you arrive, you find a table, you order food, and then you eat. This kind of predictable sequence is called a schema. When humans make memories, our brains use schemas like these as scaffolding. They take a basic pattern constructed from past experience and fill it in with the specific details of an event. When memories are recalled, our brains use schemas as step-by-step guides to remember the events in the right order.</p><p>Most research so far on how the brain uses schemas for memory has involved showing participants pictures or words and then testing their memory by asking ‘true or false’ questions. This revealed that a brain area called the medial prefrontal cortex plays an important role in creating and retrieving memories for items related to a schema. But, studies have not yet assessed exactly how the brain uses schemas to understand and remember a long, realistic event that unfolds over several minutes.</p><p>To answer this question, Masís-Obando et al. scanned people’s brains while they watched or listened to clips of two familiar experiences: eating at a restaurant or catching a flight at an airport. Then, the participants were scanned while they tried to retell each story in their own words. The volunteers were graded based on how many details they recalled. The scans showed that when volunteers’ medial prefrontal cortex kept track of the schema throughout the whole time that an event was happening, they were more likely to score well on the memory test. But it wasn’t necessary for medial prefrontal cortex to hold the schema in mind when remembering the story. Instead, a different set of brain regions maintained schema information during successful remembering.</p><p>This study reveals new information about how memories and schemas work that could help explain why people develop problems making or recalling memories in diseases such as Alzheimer’s. The findings could also be used to help people make experiences or stories more memorable.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>schema</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>fmri</kwd><kwd>encoding</kwd><kwd>retrieval</kwd><kwd>narrative</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH112357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Norman</surname><given-names>Kenneth A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F99 NS120644-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masís-Obando</surname><given-names>Rolando</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neural representations of both general event schemas and story-specific details predict memory performance in narrative recall, with distinct brain networks tracking schematic information during perception versus retrieval.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How do we remember real-world events? Over the past half-century, the cognitive psychology literature has shown that we leverage event schemas – our knowledge of how events generally unfold – to support memory for specific details from those events (for reviews of early work, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graesser and Nakamura, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alba and Hasher, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brewer and Nakamura, 1984</xref>; for more recent cognitive neuroscience studies, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Kesteren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghosh and Gilboa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schlichting and Preston, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang and Morris, 2010</xref>). For example, when we go into a restaurant, we can anticipate a stereotyped sequence of events that includes getting seated, ordering food, and eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bower et al., 1979</xref>). The cognitive psychology literature has demonstrated that knowledge of this ‘restaurant script’ can help memory in at least two possible ways: At encoding, the restaurant script can provide a scaffold onto which we can attach specific event details (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bransford and Johnson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alba and Hasher, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tompary and Thompson-Schill, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McClelland et al., 2020</xref>); later, at retrieval, the restaurant script provides a structured way of cueing memory, by stepping through the various stages of the script in sequence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schank and Abelson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Pichert, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bower et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alba and Hasher, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mandler, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The goal of this study is to understand the neural mechanisms of how event schemas support memory for real-world, temporally extended events, both at encoding and at retrieval. To meet this objective, we track schema representations in the brain during both encoding and retrieval of temporally extended events, and then relate these neural measures to behavioral recall on a story-by-story basis. While there has been an explosion of recent neuroscientific research into how schemas benefit memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maguire et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Kesteren et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Kesteren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van Kesteren et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spalding et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brod et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brod and Shing, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Buuren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wagner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schlichting and Preston, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Webb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raykov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reagh et al., 2021</xref>), most of this research has relied on univariate contrasts of brain activations evoked by schema-consistent vs. schema-inconsistent learning materials, rather than trying to track the degree to which schematic information is represented for individual stimuli. Also, existing studies have mostly looked at relatively simple forms of schematic knowledge (e.g., seashells at the beach vs. lamps at a playground; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McAndrews et al., 2016</xref>) rather than knowledge about the structure of real-world, temporally extended events. Lastly, because existing paradigms have mostly tested memory with recognition or short associative recall tasks, the neural mechanisms of how schemas are instantiated and maintained during unconstrained memory search for naturalistic events have not been thoroughly explored; our use of free recall allowed us to address this gap in the literature.</p><p>The present study builds on our prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref>), in which participants were scanned as they watched movies or listened to audio-adaptations of preexisting films, half of which followed a restaurant script and half of which followed an airport script. A key benefit of this paradigm is that it allowed us to identify sequences of neural patterns that are unique to particular stories (e.g., sequences of patterns that are reliably invoked by a particular airport narrative, more so than by other airport narratives) and sequences of patterns that represent the underlying script (e.g., sequences of patterns that are shared across different airport narratives, more so than across restaurant and airport narratives). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref> leveraged this to identify a range of areas that represented schematic information (i.e., restaurant vs. airport) in a modality-independent fashion. Of the regions of interest (ROIs) investigated, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was the only one that was sensitive to the specific temporal order of events in a schema. Here, we extend the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref> results by analyzing neural and behavioral data from a separate phase of the experiment (not reported in the 2018 study) in which participants were scanned while freely recalling each of the 16 narratives. This allowed us to look at how schemas are represented in the brain during recall, and how neural measures of schema representation at encoding and recall are related to recall of specific story details, on a story-by-story basis.</p><p>Because mPFC has been frequently implicated in previous schema research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Kesteren et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Kesteren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Kesteren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raykov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raykov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reagh et al., 2021</xref>) – in particular, with regard to integrating new knowledge into existing schemas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schlichting and Preston, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang and Morris, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Kesteren et al., 2012</xref>) – we predicted that robust mPFC schema representations at encoding would lead to improved subsequent memory for the narrative. Based on prior work implicating the hippocampus in schema representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Kesteren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Kesteren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brod et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raykov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Webb et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Linden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonasia et al., 2018</xref>), we also hypothesized that hippocampal schema representations at encoding would support subsequent memory; more specifically, based on work showing that hippocampus has a coarse-to-fine gradient of representations along its long axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Collin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo and Yang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audrain and McAndrews, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poppenk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunec et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schlichting et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sekeres et al., 2018</xref>), we predicted that anterior hippocampus (which has coarser and thus more general representations than posterior hippocampus) would contain schematic representations that contribute to subsequent memory, whereas posterior hippocampus would contribute to subsequent memory by representing story-specific details.</p><p>As described below, our prediction about mPFC was upheld: An anterior region of mPFC was among the network of cortical regions – also including left visual cortex, right lateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), prostriata, and entorhinal cortex – where the degree of schema representation at encoding predicted subsequent memory for story details. Our prediction about hippocampus received partial support: While the degree of schema representation in anterior hippocampus during encoding showed a nonsignificant, positive numerical relationship to subsequent memory for story details, posterior hippocampus showed a negative correlation between schema representation at encoding and subsequent memory, and a positive correlation between the representation of story-specific details at encoding and subsequent memory – both of which are consistent with a role for posterior hippocampus in encoding story-specific (i.e., non-schematic) information. Interestingly, the set of regions where schema representation at encoding predicted recall of story details was mostly distinct from the set of regions where schema representation at retrieval predicted recall of story details – the latter analysis revealed a distinct network including bilateral visual cortex, right superior parietal lobule (SPL), bilateral middle frontal gyrus (MFG), bilateral medial SFG, bilateral parahippocampal cortex (PHC), left fusiform gyrus, right angular gyrus (AG), as well as bilateral posterior superior temporal sulcus, but notably <italic>excluding</italic> mPFC. This pattern of results provides converging neural support for the idea that schemas play different roles at encoding and retrieval in supporting memory for story details.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our primary goal was to understand how we use schemas at encoding and recall to support memory for recently encoded naturalistic stories. To do this, we used 16 narratives that conformed to one of two schematic scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bower et al., 1979</xref>): eating at a restaurant or catching a flight at an airport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Each narrative followed a four-event temporal structure specific to its schema (<italic>restaurant stories</italic>: entering the restaurant, being seated, ordering and eating food; <italic>airport stories</italic>: entering the airport, going through security, boarding at gate, and getting seated on plane). During the encoding phase, participants were scanned while they watched or listened to each of these 3 minute narratives. Afterwards, during the recall phase, participants were cued with the titles of each of the stories and were asked to freely verbally recall one story at a time.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Methods.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Stimuli.

Within each story, we computed the mean spatial pattern evoked during each of the four events for each participant. Then, for each pair of stories (call them story A and story B), we applied leave-one-participant-out spatial intersubject correlation, correlating the four story A event patterns from the left-out participant with the four story B event patterns from the other participants. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref>, this correlation was computed in an event-wise fashion (correlating event 1 in story A with event 1 in story B, event 2 in story A with event 2 in story B, etc.), and then the four event-wise correlations were averaged together to obtain a single correlation score for the pair of stories.

Here, we build on prior work on neural reinstatement (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staresina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ritchey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wing et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tompary et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) by using a hidden Markov model (HMM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>) to track reinstatement of sequences of patterns from the encoding phase. We first created ‘encoding pattern templates’ for each of the four events in each story by averaging the evoked response during encoding across all participants experiencing that event. We used these templates to construct 16 different HMMs (one for each story), where the states of each story-specific HMM corresponded to the sequence of four event patterns for that story during encoding. We then applied each of the 16 story-specific HMMs to each recall timeseries, to measure the degree to which each story’s sequence of patterns was reinstated in that recall timeseries. Essentially, this HMM-fitting process involved – for a given story-specific HMM (from story A) and a given recall timeseries (from story B) – trying to model story B’s recall timeseries under the assumption that it contained the same four ‘template’ event patterns (in the same order) as story A. The result of the HMM-fitting process was to subdivide the story B recall timeseries into four contiguous sections that best matched the four encoding event patterns from story A (see Materials and methods for more details). To measure neural reinstatement, we took the average neural patterns from each of these four sections of the story B recall timeseries and correlated these patterns with the actual encoding templates from story A (i.e., we correlated the part of the recall timeseries that the HMM matched to event 1 with the actual encoding pattern for event 1, likewise for events 2–4, and then we averaged these four correlations together). By the end of this process, each of the 16 story recalls for a given participant had been compared to each of the 16 story templates from the encoding period. Analogously to the encoding period, we computed – for each participant and each story – a <italic>reinstatement story score</italic> comparing the reinstatement of the matching story to the reinstatement of other stories from the same schema, and a <italic>reinstatement schema score</italic> comparing the reinstatement of other stories from the same schema to the reinstatement of other stories from the other schema.

Given that our primary searchlight analysis revealed a relationship between encoding schema scores and subsequent memory in the most anterior part of mPFC, but this relationship was not significant in our whole-mPFC ROI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), we decided to perform a post-hoc clustering analysis to determine whether subregions of mPFC contributed to memory differently. Thus, in order to identify functional differences within mPFC, we ran a k-means clustering analysis. We first pooled the results of our eight whole-brain searchlight results together (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>: story and schema encoding and reinstatement scores as well as their relationships to subsequent memory for story details) to obtain an eight-feature representation for each searchlight location (i.e., the eight features were the eight searchlight values for that location). We then ran a silhouette analysis on these eight-feature representations to determine the optimal number of clusters to use within a bilateral mPFC ROI mask (restricting the number of clusters k to be less than the number of input features). The analysis revealed that k = 2 yielded the highest average silhouette coefficient (s = 0.39). With this k = 2 solution, we found that the two clusters separated along the anterior-posterior axis in both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We then reran our previous analyses (e.g., encoding story score, encoding schema score, etc.) using these clusters as ROIs to identify (post-hoc) how the properties of these regions differed. We found that both clusters exhibited story and schema effects at encoding, but the contributions of these effects to subsequent memory differed across clusters: The encoding schema effect predicted subsequent memory in the anterior cluster but not the posterior cluster; by contrast, the relationship between the encoding story effect and subsequent memory was much larger in the posterior cluster than the anterior cluster. This flip in subsequent memory contributions between the anterior and posterior mPFC regions is consistent with a gradient of story representation to schema representation within mPFC, with schema representations in anterior (vs. posterior) mPFC being most critical for behavior.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mediation analysis with medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) subclusters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) k-Means clustering results.

To test this hypothesis, we looked at whether the relationship between encoding schema scores in the anterior mPFC cluster and behavioral recall was mediated by PMC story information at recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Indeed, we found that PMC story information acted as a partial mediator between mPFC_c0 schema information at encoding and later memory (indirect effect A * B = 0.029, 95% bias-corrected bootstrap CI [0.006, 0.056]).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated how our schematic knowledge about the sequential nature of common real-life experiences shapes memory for specific narratives during two distinct phases: when we initially encode a new experience, and when we search our memory to retrieve it. We examined regions in the brain that exhibited schematic patterns at encoding and retrieval and measured the degree to which schematic information in both of these stages predicted subsequent memory for story details. In our prior work using this airport/restaurant paradigm, we had identified a large region of mPFC that represents schema information at encoding. Here, we found that an (anterior) subset of this region had the property that the level of schema representation during encoding predicted subsequent memory for the story (measured using free recall). We also found that, while mPFC played an important role in schema representation during encoding of the stories presented here, it did not reliably represent schema information during recall of these stories, and the degree of schema representation in mPFC during recall did not reliably predict behavior. Consistent with ongoing research on functional differences along the long axis of the hippocampus (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poppenk et al., 2013</xref>), we found a major difference in how schema representations in anterior and posterior hippocampus contributed to subsequent memory at encoding. Anterior hippocampus showed a high level of schema representation at encoding and a nonsignificant positive relationship between schema representation at encoding and subsequent memory; in contrast, the level of schema representation in posterior hippocampus at encoding was significantly <italic>negatively</italic> correlated with subsequent memory for the stories. Furthermore, neither hippocampal region showed significant relationships between schema representation and behavior at recall. More generally, the brain regions where schema representation during encoding predicted behavioral memory performance (visual cortex, left posterior temporal sulcus, prostriata, entorhinal cortex, left subcentral gyrus, postcentral sulcus, right lateral SFG, and anterior mPFC) were surprisingly distinct from the brain regions where schema representation during recall predicted behavioral memory performance (bilateral visual regions that were generally more medial/anterior than the regions identified at encoding, posterior superior temporal sulcus, left fusiform gyrus, right SPL, right AG, PHC, medial SFG, and MFG). As a whole, these results provide evidence that event schemas support memory for the details of naturalistic narrative stimuli, and that the brain networks that provide this support are different when we are integrating situational information during perception and when we search for memories during retrieval.</p><p>Importantly, follow-up analyses revealed that, both at encoding and at recall, our ability to predict recall behavior based on neural schema scores and neural story scores (together) was better than prediction based on neural story scores alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This implies that neural schema representations provide an extra benefit to recall, beyond what is obtained by merely representing story-specific details. The fact that different regions were involved at encoding and recall suggests that the mechanism by which schemas provide this extra benefit may be different at encoding and recall. As discussed in the Introduction, one way that activated event schemas can benefit encoding is by acting as a scaffold, providing a structured set of ‘attachment points’ for specific event details (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bransford and Johnson, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alba and Hasher, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tompary and Thompson-Schill, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McClelland et al., 2020</xref>); at retrieval, one way that schemas can benefit memory is by supporting a sequential memory cueing strategy, where participants step through the various stages of an event and ask themselves which specific details were associated with each stage (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schank and Abelson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Pichert, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bower et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alba and Hasher, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mandler, 2014</xref>).

Importantly, our design allowed us to neurally estimate the degree of story-specific and schematic representation for each individual story, at both encoding and retrieval, across cortex and also in hippocampus; we were able to leverage this to explore how all of these factors related to behavioral memory for story details in a story-by-story fashion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relationship between schematic representations during encoding and subsequent memory</title><p>As was shown in a previous analysis of this dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref>), schema representations were present at encoding in many regions previously identified in other studies of schemas, including mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Kesteren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Kesteren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raykov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brod and Shing, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sommer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonasia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reagh et al., 2021</xref>), PMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maguire et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sommer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonasia et al., 2018</xref>), SFG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonasia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brod and Shing, 2018</xref>), PHC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keidel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Kesteren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonasia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Linden et al., 2017</xref>), AG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keidel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonasia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Linden et al., 2017</xref>), and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Kesteren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Raykov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). We also identified strong schema representation in prostriata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mikellidou et al., 2017</xref>), a region anterior to V1 and in between restrosplenial cortex (RSC) and PHC.</p><p>Since having similar patterns across multiple stories is partially in conflict with having highly distinct story-specific patterns, it is not immediately obvious that maintaining schematic patterns that are shared across stories should be helpful for remembering story-specific information (for evidence of a tradeoff between recall of item-specific vs. shared information, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>). However, we found multiple regions in which maintenance of this abstract schematic information was associated with improved memory for story details, including anterior mPFC, lateral frontal cortex, and portions of visual cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Previous studies have shown that greater levels of mPFC activation at encoding are associated with better memory for schema-consistent stimuli (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raykov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Kesteren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Kesteren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brod and Shing, 2018</xref>); our results extend the literature by revealing a within-subjects (across-story) relationship between the activation of anterior mPFC schema representations at encoding and memory for details of temporally extended naturalistic stimuli. These findings are compatible with the idea that mPFC might provide a schematic scaffold to which detailed representations are attached at encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilboa and Marlatte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schlichting and Preston, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Kesteren et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, we also found that schema representations in visual cortex contribute to memory. It is possible that certain visual features (e.g., visual features of security lines for airports, or tables for restaurants) are central to the mental representations of these airport and restaurant schemas; as such, increased attention to these visual features (for movies) and/or visualization of these features (for audio narratives) may reflect stronger schema representation, leading to improved memory encoding.</p><p>In the hippocampus, we found diverging effects in posterior and anterior subregions, with schematic patterns at encoding being nonsignificantly helpful for memory in anterior hippocampus but significantly harmful to memory in posterior hippocampus (the difference between these effects was also significant). Furthermore, while both posterior and anterior hippocampus exhibited significant story-specific representation at encoding, the correlation between encoding story scores and subsequent memory was significantly larger for posterior hippocampus. Taken together, these results suggest that posterior hippocampus plays an especially important role in representing story-specific details, consistent with theories of gist vs. detail representations in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo and Yang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audrain and McAndrews, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poppenk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunec et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schlichting et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Collin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sekeres et al., 2018</xref>; for data suggesting a reversed gradient, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dandolo and Schwabe, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relationship between schematic representations during retrieval and memory performance</title><p>We identified a set of regions in which schematic codes were reactivated during retrieval, and the degree of reactivation was related to behavioral recall performance.

In our study, we did not observe strong mPFC schema reinstatement, nor were we able to relate it to a behavioral memory benefit. It is possible that schema representations in mPFC contribute to retrieval, but we failed to detect this contribution, for example, because they only emerge at specific time points during recall, or they only arise after sleep consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Linden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brod et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Kesteren et al., 2010b</xref>), or they contribute through interactions with other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo and Yang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Kesteren et al., 2010b</xref>). Alternatively, schematic representations in mPFC during recall may be associated less with accurate recall of specific story details and more with verbal descriptions of schematic elements of the narrative. Because the rubric we made for scoring memory performance tracks recall of story-specific details, it is not ideal for measuring the extent to which a recall conforms to the general (restaurant or airport) schema.

First, in contrast to the between-subject results, there was no significant relationship between mPFC encoding schema scores and behavior. Also, the negative relationship between encoding schema scores in posterior hippocampus and subsequent memory was no longer significant (but the positive relationship between reinstatement schema scores in posterior hippocampus and subsequent memory was still significant).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In our study, we derived neural measures of story-specific and schematic representations in the brain during the perception and recall of narratives conforming to naturalistic event schemas.

We found converging support for the idea that schema representations in mPFC play an important role in memory encoding, but also striking differences between regions where schema representation at encoding was useful for memory, and regions where schema representation at retrieval was useful for memory. These findings can serve as a foundation for future work that seeks to further delineate the contributions of these encoding-specific and retrieval-specific schema networks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Data were collected from a total of 31 participants between the ages of 18–34 (15 females, 16 males).

To compute the similarity for a given pair of stories (call them A and B), the pattern vectors for each of story A’s four events were correlated with the pattern vectors for each of story B’s four events (i.e., the event 1 pattern for story A was correlated with the event 1 pattern for story B from the N-1 other participants; the event 2 pattern for story A was correlated with the event 2 pattern for story B from the N-1 other participants, etc.).

For each participant, this sequence of steps was used to compare that participant’s representation of each story to the N-1 other participants’ representation of each story. The net result of this process was a 16 × 16 correlation (similarity) matrix for every participant, containing the (intersubject) neural similarity of each story to every other story (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Because prior work has shown that between-participant analyses can uncover shared neural event representations across participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zadbood et al., 2017</xref>) and boost signal-to-noise ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simony et al., 2016</xref>), we used an across-subject encoding similarity matrix as our default analysis. However, we also included a within-subject encoding similarity matrix for comparison purposes. To create this within-subject similarity matrix, we followed the same steps described in the previous paragraph, but – rather than comparing a participant’s event-specific patterns of a particular story against the average patterns derived from the other N-1 participants – we compared that participant’s event patterns for a particular story against their own event-specific patterns for every other story. This results in a 16 × 16 symmetric correlation matrix with valid off-diagonal entries, corresponding to the event-specific similarity of one story to another, and ones in the principal diagonal, corresponding to the perfect similarity of a story’s patterns with itself.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Reinstatement similarity matrix</title><p>First, we created a template for each of the four events in each story by using a GLM to extract the multivoxel BOLD pattern for that event within each participant, and then averaging across participants to get a single spatial pattern for that event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We then sought to measure the extent to which these story-specific patterns were reinstated during the free recall period with the HMM approach used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldassano et al., 2017</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldassano et al., 2018</xref>. The model makes the assumption that, when recalling a story, the event pattern templates from encoding are replayed in the same ordered sequence. The variance parameter for the model was calculated per participant by measuring the variance of that story’s mean event patterns at perception. Given a template pattern for a story (i.e., its four-stage encoding pattern), and the timeseries for the recall of that story, the model computes a probability that each time point of the recall belongs to each of the four template events. We then computed a weighted average spatial pattern for each event during the recall using the probability matrix as the weights. To determine the strength of reinstatement between the template story and the recalled story, each of the four encoding event template patterns was correlated with all of the four recall event patterns, the strength of reinstatement was measured as the difference between the correlations for corresponding (e.g., encoding template event 1 and recall event 1) and noncorresponding events (e.g., encoding template event 1 and recall event 2). This difference measure per event was averaged and was repeated for all combinations of template story and recall story, yielding a 16 × 16 encoding-recall similarity matrix per participant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, while our HMM method is biased to recover patterns that match the encoding templates, this bias applies equally regardless of which stories are being compared; our reinstatement story and schema measures control for this bias by looking at the <italic>relative</italic> degree of reinstatement across different comparisons (e.g., comparing reinstatement of stories from the same schema vs. stories from the other schema).</p><p>Just as we created a within-subjects version of our encoding similarity matrix, we also created a within-subjects version of our reinstatement similarity matrix. To do this, we followed the same steps described in the previous paragraph with the exception that we skipped the averaging-across-participants step. Specifically, an encoding template for each of the four events in each story was made for each participant by using a GLM to extract the multivoxel BOLD pattern for each event within each participant. Rather than averaging these event patterns across participants to get a single four-event template for each story, each participant had their own four-event story template, resulting in 16 unique story templates per participant. Then, just as before, to determine the degree to which story-specific patterns (i.e., encoding templates) were reinstated at recall, but this time in a within-subjects approach, we used an HMM, as previously described, to calculate the strength of reinstatement for the encoding patterns of a particular story within their corresponding free recall of that story and every other story. This yielded a 16 × 16 (within-subject) encoding-recall similarity matrix per participant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Story and schema scores</title><p>Because we generated both an encoding and reinstatement similarity matrix for every participant, we could then perform contrasts for each stimulus for each participant (during encoding or recall) to measure the extent to which neural representations contain story-specific or schematic information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Story score</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>): To compute the <italic>story score</italic> for a particular story, we contrasted that story’s similarity to itself (a square on the diagonal of the similarity matrix) with the average of that story’s similarity to other stories from the same schema and modality (the modality restriction was done to avoid effects driven by overall modality differences unrelated to this particular story). We determined statistical significance for the difference in similarity using a nonparametric permutation test in which we randomly permuted the stories within a schema (and within modality) 1000 times to generate a null distribution of differences. A p-value was computed as the proportion of times a difference in the null distribution was greater than or equal to the difference of the correctly labeled data.</p><p><italic>Schema score</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>): To compute the <italic>schema score</italic> for a particular story, we contrasted the average of that story’s similarity to other stories from the same schema with the average of that story’s similarity to other stories from the other schema (using only stories from the same modality). Statistical significance was determined in a nonparametric permutation test in which schema labels of stories (within the same modality) were randomly permuted 1000 times.</p><p>For completeness, we also computed an across-modality schema score for each story by contrasting the average of that story’s similarity to other stories from the same schema and different modality with the average of that story’s similarity to other stories from the other schema and different modality. This means that for a particular <italic>video</italic> story we contrasted the average similarity of that story to <italic>audio</italic> stories from the same schema against the similarity of that story to <italic>audio</italic> stories from the other schema, and vice versa. Statistical significance was determined as described in the previous paragraph.</p><p>Note that, for the within-subjects <italic>encoding</italic> similarity matrix described earlier, a story score cannot be computed because the similarity of a participant’s encoding template to itself is always going to be 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, for the within-subjects encoding similarity matrix, only a schema score was calculated, but for the within-subjects reinstatement similarity matrix, both story and schema scores were computed.</p><p>To generate brainmaps of these scores, story and schema information was extracted from the encoding and reinstatement similarity matrices computed at each searchlight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To convert searchlights back to the cortical surface, the score for each vertex was computed as the average scores of all searchlights that included that vertex. Similarly, we averaged the null distributions for all searchlights that included a vertex to get a single null distribution per vertex. p-Values were obtained per vertex through a two-sided nonparametric permutation test that looked for the proportion of times an absolute value in the null distribution (created by shuffling story labels separately for each participant) was greater than the absolute value of the original averaged story or schema score. We then converted these p-values to q-values using the false discovery rate correction from AFNI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cox, 1996</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavior</title><p><italic>Verbal recall analysis</italic> (<italic>rubrics</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>): Hand-scored rubrics were used to provide a quantitative behavioral measure of memory recall performance for details within a story (available <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rmasiso/SchemaEncodeRecall/tree/main/_data/Rubrics">here</ext-link>). Rubrics for videos included points for recalling unchanging (‘static’) details (e.g., character appearance, set design) and ‘dynamic’ details (e.g., combined dialogue and visual descriptions). For audio stories, only ‘dynamic’ details were tracked (given the lack of visual information). Transcripts for audio stories were split into sentences and points were awarded if a detail from at least a fraction of a sentence was recalled. Participant audio was recorded during free recalls and was manually timestamped, transcribed, and scored for memory performance using the rubrics. Memory performance was measured by the number of details remembered (sum of points) and normalized by total possible details for a given story (as measured by max possible rubric score for a story). Two independent coders scored every participant’s memory performance (intercoder reliability, Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.95), and final scores per story were averaged across both independent coders.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Predicting behavioral performance from neural scores</title><p>We next wanted to identify whether the story and schema scores at encoding or recall predicted behavioral memory performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In other words, how does the neural representation of story and schema information at either encoding or recall predict later memory?</p><p>To answer this question, we conducted four separate leave-one-participant-out linear regression analyses for each ROI or searchlight. Each of the four regression analyses used a particular neural score (either encoding story, encoding schema, reinstatement story, or reinstatement schema) to predict behavioral recall performance on a story-by-story basis. The regression models were trained on neural scores and behavioral scores from all but one participant; we then used the trained model to predict the left-out participant’s 16 behavioral recall scores (one per story; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) based on that participant’s neural scores. Each of the four regressions was run with each of the 30 subjects as a test subject, providing a 30 × 16 matrix of behavioral predictions on held-out subjects. With these predictions, model performance was measured by variance explained (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>) compared to a baseline model of simply predicting the average rubric score of the N-1 group. Statistical significance was determined through nonparametric permutation testing, in which a null distribution of 1000 values was made by shuffling the story scores within each subject (thereby keeping the subjects intact) before running the leave-one-out regression. Given this type of permutation, any significant results observed are due to within-subject (but across-stories) relationships between neural measures and behavior. Using a mixed-effects model could potentially increase the sensitivity of our regression analysis by removing across-subject variance when measuring the relationship between neural and behavioral measures. However, since our analysis requires fitting this model for each searchlight, permutation, and left-out subject, it was computationally infeasible to fit this kind of model. Note that our choice to use a simpler model should lead only to false negatives (reducing sensitivity to subtle effects) and not to false positives in our results. To visualize searchlight results on the cortical surface, we averaged <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> scores across searchlights in the same way that was described above for the story and schema scores (i.e., each vertex was assigned the average <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> across all of the searchlights that included that vertex).</p><p>With simple linear regression, predictions of rubric scores below zero were possible, despite zero being the lowest possible rubric score. To enforce realistic predictions of rubric scores of greater or equal to zero, we also ran the same regression procedure with a logistic output layer; the results of this analysis were highly similar to the results that we obtained when we used linear regression. Consequently, for the sake of simplicity, we only describe the results for simple linear regression here.</p><p>These same analyses were rerun using story and schema scores derived using a within-subjects approach and also using the across-modality schema scores described previously.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>ROI to ROI correlations</title><p>Because story information was most strongly reinstated in PMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and this reinstatement was highly predictive of behavioral rubric scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we examined whether there were neural signals during encoding that were predictive of later PMC story reinstatement. To do this, we ran a linear regression with PMC’s reinstatement story score as the dependent variable and each searchlight’s encoding schema score as the independent measure. To test for significance, we generated a null distribution in which story labels for the dependent variable were shuffled within subjects. In this nonparametric permutation two-sided test, p-values were computed by calculating the proportion of absolute values above the test value. Searchlights were converted back to vertex space before converting the p-values to q-values with AFNI’s FDR correction. To visualize the results on a brainmap, vertices were thresholded at q &lt; 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Schema representation and subsequent behavior</title><p>To identify regions where schema information was represented and the degree of that schema representation influenced memory, we intersected positive schema effects (thresholded by FDR &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) with regions that were positively correlated with later memory (thresholded by FDR &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We did this for encoding and recall separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>To quantify how schema representations influenced memory at both encoding and recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we compared their model coefficients (encoding – reinstatement). Statistical significance was computed via two-sided nonparametric testing of a null distribution of differences between model coefficients at encoding vs. reinstatement. p-Values were then converted to q-values with AFNI’s FDR correction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Benefit of schema representation for detail memory</title><p>In order to determine the degree to which neural schema scores at encoding or retrieval improved prediction of behavioral memory for story-specific information (beyond what could be predicted from neural story scores alone), we compared a single-regressor baseline model with story scores as the sole predictor against a nested model with schema scores as an additional predictor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We computed an F-statistic to measure the degree to which the nested model, with the additional model term, better explains the data. To test for statistical significance, we ran a nonparametric permutation test, in which a null distribution of F-statistics was generated for 1000 model comparisons after shuffling labels. Extracted p-values were converted to q-values using AFNI’s FDR correction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>k-Means clustering and mediation analysis</title><p>Although the full mPFC ROI showed strong schema representation during perception (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the behavioral prediction searchlights revealed that schema information only predicted behavior in the most anterior portion of mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To explore the differential functional roles of mPFC subregions, we ran a post-hoc k-means clustering analysis to segment our mPFC ROI into two clusters with distinct functional profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Using the results of eight different searchlights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) as features, we generated clusters across multiple k’s bilaterally on searchlight vertices using our a priori mPFC ROI as a mask. We first ran a silhouette analysis to determine the optimal k (restricting k to be less than the number of input features); then, for each resulting cluster, we calculated new similarity matrices, extracted story and schema scores, and ran our behavioral prediction analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>We also ran an additional mediation analysis to identify the extent to which PMC and mPFC subregions interacted to support recall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Our goal was to determine whether the behavioral impact of schematic representations in mPFC at encoding was mediated through the reinstatement of story information in PMC. To do this, we ran a traditional single-mediator model in which the causal, mediator, and outcome variables were mPFC subregion schema information at encoding, PMC story information at recall, and rubric scores, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baron and Kenny, 1986</xref>). The total effect of the causal variable mPFC schema at encoding on the outcome rubric scores (path c) was calculated by running a linear regression with each regressor standardized. The significance of the effect was computed by generating a null distribution from shuffling the labels of the outcome variable, generating a corresponding z-value for the original effect, and converting to a p-value from the survival function of the normal distribution. This same procedure was used to test for the significance of each individual component in the indirect effect (paths a and b) as well as the direct effect (path c′). To test for statistical significance of the indirect effect (i.e., mediated effect), we performed a bias-corrected bootstrap test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Efron and Tibshirani, 1994</xref>). To determine the specificity of this effect, we also ran a variant of this analysis where we swapped the roles of the two ROIs using the PMC encoding schema score as the causal variable and mPFC subregion reinstatement story score as the mediator. We found no significant effects in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data and code</title><p>All data is openly available for download at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001510/versions/2.0.2">OpenNeuro</ext-link>.</p><p>Scripts used for analysis also available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rmasiso/SchemaEncodeRecall">GitHub</ext-link>, (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:f67b9c0141b501e29ce934975a1fc94c1a6d29ec;origin=https://github.com/rmasiso/SchemaEncodeRecall;visit=swh:1:snp:1a0b45a59839cce279d88851b70e0883c348ab57;anchor=swh:1:rev:af3cf26ee9a82ffa898708ecc3c2cfdfd9bd6633">swh:1:rev:af3cf26ee9a82ffa898708ecc3c2cfdfd9bd6633</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Masís-Obando, 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Princeton University and all participants provided their written informed consent (IRB Protocol number 7225).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70445-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>fMRI data for all portions this study are publicly available in OpenNeuro under accession code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds001510/versions/2.0.2">ds001510</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a David Badre as the Reviewing Editor, and Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Brice Kuhl (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were positive overall about the manuscript, and though they identified some points of weakness, they felt these could be addressed in a revision. Their essential comments are provided here.</p><p>1. Both reviewers raised interpretational issues related to the behavioral measures of story-specific recall. I provide their comments on this point together here.</p><p>Reviewer #1 – There should be a little more consideration of why schema representations predict recall of story-specific information. Is the neural measure 'missing' the information that is actually being recalled and instead is just capturing the scaffold upon which the event-specific information is laid? This point is acknowledged in the Discussion, but it feels like it warrants a bit more emphasis (i.e., not to just note that this is a limitation but to speculate a bit more about why schema representations are related to story-specific recall).</p><p>Reviewer #2 – From a theoretical perspective, I am struggling with the behavioral outcome measures being exclusively at the &quot;specific&quot; story level, and whether/how that should impact our interpretation of the findings. In other words, the behavioral outcome of interest has to do with participants' ability to recall story-specific details, and a score was given to each subject for each story to summarize the quality of their memory for that particular narrative. By necessity, of course, this means knowledge at the &quot;schematic&quot; level is not tested or operationalized in any way. (In fact, it would I believe be impossible to do this on a narrative-by-narrative basis.) The authors address this in their setup, discussing how a schema can be used to guide the retrieval of details, and also touch upon this in the Discussion (lines 404-410). However, I am struggling with the contrast between the memory ~ encoding and memory ~ reinstatement findings being whopping and widespread for the story neural representation (Figure 3A, C), and much smaller (and nonsignificant in many ROIs) for the schema neural representation (Figure 3B, D). Is this showing us that (detailed, specific) story representation supports recall of (detailed, specific) memories, and (general, abstracted) schema representation does not? Does that mean schema representation does not relate to memory, or just that it doesn't relate to <italic>specific</italic> memory (i.e., but could have in theory been related to schematic memory, had that been tested)? I suppose from some vantage points, it could be viewed as merely a replication of many other findings that representing specific memories at either encoding or retrieval is helpful for recall of those details. And similarly, one could argue that schema representations haven't been given a fair shake because the behavior was tested at a different level of specificity. In other words, in their analysis for Figure 3 B and D the authors separately considered the relationship between schema representation and behavior, without simultaneously considering the level of specific story representation, which is a bit hard to reconcile with the framework that schemas would guide retrieval via reinstatement of specific details (i.e., theoretically, should we expect that they can support detail recall on their own? or should it be that schema representation supports specific memory, but only when detail recall is also high?). With the exception of the mediation analysis in Figure 5 (which I think does speak to this point in a nice way), the earlier, primary analyses do not take this complexity into account. To be clear, I am not sure answering these questions requires new analyses, and am not asking the authors to change their approach. I am more hoping the authors could provide us more of their thoughts on these points in the paper and perhaps soften their conclusions if appropriate.</p><p>2. The regions that predicted behavior during encoding are described as &quot;surprisingly distinct&quot; from those that predicted behavior during retrieval. However, direct statistical comparisons of encoding vs. retrieval are not reported. Rather, it is more of an informal, qualitative comparison of which regions turned up in each analysis. While the results are appropriately described (statements are carefully worded), I do think the conclusions that can be drawn about differences between encoding and retrieval are somewhat limited without more direct statistical comparisons. For example, differences between anterior and posterior hippocampus (in relation to how schema vs. story-specific representations predict behavior) are supported by a direct statistical contrast of these regions.</p><p>3. The clustering analysis that is depicted in Figure 5 is a bit convoluted or hard to follow. For example, I found it very difficult to map the figure legend (particularly part A) to the actual figure. More generally, the rationale for using the clustering analysis could benefit from some elaboration.</p><p>4. The rationale (including potential advantages and disadvantages) for relying on intersubject analyses should be elaborated. In particular, it seems very possible-or very likely-that intersubject consistency is going to differ during encoding (when the pacing and order of information is dictated by the stimuli) compared to recall (when the pacing, details, and order could be idiosyncratic). This just feels like a non-trivial aspect of the design, yet it receives virtually no consideration.</p><p>5. It was not clear how the audio vs. video difference was worked into the analysis, or why for the schema scores, different-modality patterns were not also considered. It would seem as though comparing patterns derived from the presentation of video vs. audio as part of the schema measure would allow the researchers to get around potential confounds like visual presentation of the same type of stimuli across narratives of the same type to drive the &quot;schema&quot; representation (e.g., restaurant videos presumably show a lot of the same types of objects as one another, but those same objects would not be presented visually in the audio clips). Similarly, perhaps audio clips contained similar words for a given schema. It seems as though airport 1 video being more similar to airport 1-4 audio than it is to restaurant 1-4 audio (all different modality comparisons) would be a powerful way to demonstrate schema representation (I believe the authors have done this in past work; Baldassano et al. 2018 J Neuro). In any case, I think this detail and reasoning should be added to the main paper, and potentially worked into the visualizations.</p><p>6. It was unclear from the methods how the models relating neural scores with behavioral performance were set up. It sounds as though perhaps the researchers ran a simple linear regression, such that all participants' data was combined into a single model but subjects were not treated as random effects. If this were the case, then variability in memory performance across subjects is going to contribute to the estimate of the within-subject relationship between neural scores and memory performance on a story-by-story basis. It seems from the paper as though the authors are more interested in the within-subject variability. Can the authors clarify this point (e.g., by expanding the methods section beginning on line 585)?</p><p>7. Some references to figure panels that don't appear to exist. For example, there is reference to figure 4A and 4B, but figure 4 does not have any sub-panels.</p><p>8. Line 52 – the theoretical importance of free recall was a little unclear from the writing.</p><p>9. Figure 1 panel – just a suggestion that it may be helpful to orient correlation matrix schematic on the right hand side in the same was as the one in panel C, because I believe the &quot;encoding templates&quot; (currently on the y-axis for panel D) would be the same as the &quot;n-1 encoding story&quot; on the panel C schematic. It may help comprehension to put these both on the x-axis (for example) and/or match the labels and/or draw attention to this parallel in the legend. Could &quot;Recall story&quot; also be described as &quot;subj i Recall story&quot; to match the earlier panel?</p><p>10. It might be worth explicitly noting earlier in the paper (specifically, before the reader gets to Figure 1) that the videos are in fact taken from real feature films, rather than constructed narratives. This was a little ambiguous from the phrasing in the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70445.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were positive overall about the manuscript, and though they identified some points of weakness, they felt these could be addressed in a revision.

Both R1 and R2 raise important questions about how to interpret the relationship between neural schema scores and recall behavior (which is relatively localized in the brain) in light of the more widespread relationship between neural story scores and recall behavior – do these (more localized) neural schema effects reflect the same underlying process as the neural story effects, or is neural schema representation contributing something “extra” to memory performance, beyond what is provided by neural story effects? Inspired by R2’s comment about analyzing story and schema effects together, we ran a new analysis to address this issue. Specifically, we used a nested model comparison analysis (reported in Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure 2) to assess whether neural schema scores improve our ability to predict behavioral memory for specific details, beyond how well we can predict memory based on neural story scores alone. This analysis revealed that the neural schema scores do indeed provide this “extra” benefit in predicting recall, beyond what we can do using neural story scores alone. We have added this new analysis to the paper, along with discussion of possible mechanisms that could give rise to this finding (in which we both speculate about possible mechanisms and also acknowledge limitations of our analysis).</p><p>In accordance with this change, we added a new subsection to the Methods titled “Benefit of schema representation for detail memory”:</p><p>“In order to determine the degree to which neural schema scores at encoding or retrieval improved prediction of behavioral memory for story-specific information (beyond what could be predicted from neural story scores alone), we compared a single-regressor baseline model with story scores as the sole predictor against a nested model with schema scores as an additional predictor (Figure 3 – Supp 2). […] Extracted p-values were converted to q-values using AFNI's FDR-correction.”</p><p>Finally, we have amended the Discussion section in a few places to discuss these results and possible mechanisms that could give rise to these results:</p><p>“Importantly, follow-up analyses revealed that, both at encoding and at recall, our ability to predict recall behavior based on neural schema scores and neural story scores (together) was better than prediction based on neural story scores alone (Figure 3 – Supp 2). […] The results of the present study do not speak to the validity of either theory – more specialized designs will be needed to test these accounts.”</p><p>We also modified a later paragraph of the discussion:</p><p>“… our results extend the literature by revealing a within-subjects (across-story) relationship between the activation of anterior mPFC schema representations at encoding and memory for details of temporally-extended naturalistic stimuli. These findings are compatible with the idea that mPFC might provide a schematic scaffold to which detailed representations are attached at encoding (Gilboa and Marlatte 2017; Schlichting and Preston 2015; van Kesteren et al., 2012).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The regions that predicted behavior during encoding are described as &quot;surprisingly distinct&quot; from those that predicted behavior during retrieval. However, direct statistical comparisons of encoding vs. retrieval are not reported. Rather, it is more of an informal, qualitative comparison of which regions turned up in each analysis. While the results are appropriately described (statements are carefully worded), I do think the conclusions that can be drawn about differences between encoding and retrieval are somewhat limited without more direct statistical comparisons. For example, differences between anterior and posterior hippocampus (in relation to how schema vs. story-specific representations predict behavior) are supported by a direct statistical contrast of these regions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this opportunity to strengthen the claims of the paper by quantitatively comparing the effects at encoding vs. retrieval. We have added a new analysis to compare the schematic model coefficients at encoding vs those at retrieval in a searchlight analysis across cortex. We have added a new paragraph starting on line 246 of the Results section to introduce the analysis:</p><p>“To formally compare how schematic representations at encoding and retrieval predict subsequent memory differently, we ran a model coefficient comparison analysis in which we contrasted the encoding coefficients against the reinstatement coefficients (Figure 4B). This analysis corroborated our conjunction analysis (Figure 4A), revealing one set of regions that had significantly stronger relationships to subsequent memory at encoding than at recall (portions of left visual cortex, left posterior temporal sulcus, right prostriata, entorhinal cortex, left subcentral cortex, postcentral sulcus, frontal gyrus, and portions of anterior mPFC) and another set of regions that had significantly stronger relationships to subsequent memory at recall than encoding (visual cortex, SPL, clusters in posterior parietal regions, SFG, regions in frontal gyrus, and PHC).”</p><p>These results have been added to panel B on Figure 4.</p><p>We have also modified the Methods section “Schema representation and subsequent behavior” by adding a new paragraph starting on line 725 with the following:</p><p>“To quantify how schema representations influenced memory at both encoding and recall (Figure 4B), we compared their model coefficients (encoding – reinstatement). Statistical significance was computed via 2-sided non-parametric testing of a null distribution of differences between model coefficients at encoding vs reinstatement. P-values were then converted to q-values with AFNI's FDR-correction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The clustering analysis that is depicted in Figure 5 is a bit convoluted or hard to follow. For example, I found it very difficult to map the figure legend (particularly part A) to the actual figure. More generally, the rationale for using the clustering analysis could benefit from some elaboration.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this confusion up. The source of confusion may have been due in part to a labeling error in the caption, which we have corrected. To further clarify the caption, we changed some of the wording and added location pointers in the figure descriptions. See changes below:</p><p>“We performed post-hoc k-means (k=2) clustering within a bilateral mPFC ROI to identify subregions showing different profiles of results across our 8 searchlight analyses; that is, each searchlight was assigned an 8-dimensional vector reflecting the scores assigned to that region in the 8 searchlight analyses, and clustering was done on these 8-dimensional vectors (Figure 2 and Figure 3). […] Consistent with our searchlight results, we find that encoding schema scores in voxels in the anterior cluster (c0) were associated with increased memory performance (top-right graph).”</p><p>We also added text to the Results section expanding on our motivation for the clustering analysis starting right after the first sentence of the “K-means clustering” section.</p><p>“Given that our primary searchlight analysis revealed a relationship between encoding schema scores and subsequent memory in the most anterior part of mPFC, but this relationship was not significant in our whole-mPFC ROI (Figure 3B), we decided to perform a post-hoc clustering analysis to determine whether subregions of mPFC contributed to memory differently.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The rationale (including potential advantages and disadvantages) for relying on intersubject analyses should be elaborated. In particular, it seems very possible-or very likely-that intersubject consistency is going to differ during encoding (when the pacing and order of information is dictated by the stimuli) compared to recall (when the pacing, details, and order could be idiosyncratic). This just feels like a non-trivial aspect of the design, yet it receives virtually no consideration.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this point. We have added supplementary figures to both Figure 2 and Figure 3 where we ran the same analyses under a within-subjects approach. We modified multiple sections of the Methods to account for this inclusion.</p><p>In the Methods subsection “Encoding similarity matrix” we added a second paragraph that introduces the within-subjects approach for the encoding similarity matrix:</p><p>“Because prior work has shown that between-participant analyses can uncover shared neural event representations across participants (Baldassano, Hasson, and Norman, 2018; Baldassano et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Zadbood, Chen, Leong, Norman, and Hasson, 2017) and boost signal-to-noise-ratio (Simony et al., 2016), we used an across-subject encoding similarity matrix as our default analysis. […] This results in a 16x16 symmetric correlation matrix with valid off-diagonal entries, corresponding to the event-specific similarity of one story to another, and ones in the principal diagonal, corresponding to the perfect similarity of a story's patterns with itself.”</p><p>Similarly, we added another paragraph in the “Reinstatement similarity matrix” subsection:</p><p>“Just as we created a within-subjects version of our encoding similarity matrix, we also created a within-subjects version of our reinstatement similarity matrix. […] This yielded a 16x16 (within-subject) encoding-recall similarity matrix per participant.”</p><p>To clarify that a story-score cannot be computed at encoding when using a within-subjects approach, we added a paragraph in the Methods where story scores are explained:</p><p>“Note that, for the within-subjects <italic>encoding</italic> similarity matrix described earlier, a story score cannot be computed because the similarity of a participant's encoding template to itself is always going to be 1 (Figure 2 – Supp 1). Therefore, for the within-subjects encoding similarity matrix, only a schema score was calculated, but for the within-subjects reinstatement similarity matrix, both story and schema scores were computed.”</p><p>Similarly, we added a sentence at the end of the “Predicting behavioral performance from neural scores” section of the Methods:</p><p>“These same analyses were re-run using story and schema scores derived using a within-subjects approach, and also using the across-modality contrast described previously.”</p><p>Figure 2 – Supplementary Figure 1 includes the searchlight and specific ROI results of the within-subjects approach. New figure caption below:</p><p>“Neural story and schema strength during encoding and retrieval in whole-brain and specific cortical and hippocampal ROIs, computed within-subjects. […] Starred points indicate significant differences after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.”</p><p>Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure 3 includes the searchlight and specific-ROI results for the analyses in which within-subjects encoding and reinstatement scores were used to predict memory. New figure caption below:</p><p>“Predicting behavioral memory for story details with neural measures from encoding and recall within-subjects. […] Point colors indicate directionality of prediction with red and blue for positive and negative associations, respectively.”</p><p>Finally, brief discussion of these results can be found in the new Discussion section “Within-subject and across-modality supplementary results”:</p><p>“Prior work has also shown that between-subject analyses can improve signal-to-noise ratios while revealing shared representations across people (Baldassano, Hasson, and Norman, 2018; Baldassano et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2017; Zadbood, Chen, Leong, Norman, and Hasson, 2017; Simony et al., 2016). […] Also, the negative relationship between encoding schema scores in posterior hippocampus and subsequent memory was no longer significant (but the positive relationship between reinstatement schema scores in posterior hippocampus and subsequent memory was still significant).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It was not clear how the audio vs. video difference was worked into the analysis, or why for the schema scores, different-modality patterns were not also considered. It would seem as though comparing patterns derived from the presentation of video vs. audio as part of the schema measure would allow the researchers to get around potential confounds like visual presentation of the same type of stimuli across narratives of the same type to drive the &quot;schema&quot; representation (e.g., restaurant videos presumably show a lot of the same types of objects as one another, but those same objects would not be presented visually in the audio clips). Similarly, perhaps audio clips contained similar words for a given schema. It seems as though airport 1 video being more similar to airport 1-4 audio than it is to restaurant 1-4 audio (all different modality comparisons) would be a powerful way to demonstrate schema representation (I believe the authors have done this in past work; Baldassano et al. 2018 J Neuro). In any case, I think this detail and reasoning should be added to the main paper, and potentially worked into the visualizations.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great observation. As suggested, we have added an extra supplementary figure to both Figure 2 and Figure 3 in which we re-run the same schema analyses but across modalities.</p><p>We also added another paragraph in this section in which we explain how we computed a schema score across-modality:</p><p>“For completeness, we also computed an across-modality schema score for each story, by contrasting the average of that story's similarity to other stories from the same schema and different modality with the average of that story's similarity to other stories from the other schema and different modality. […] Statistical significance was determined as described in the previous paragraph.”</p><p>To clarify how these scores were used when predicting behavior, a sentence at the end of the “Predicting behavioral performance from neural scores” section of the Methods was added:</p><p>“These same analyses were re-run using story and schema scores derived using a</p><p>within-subjects approach, and also using the across-modality schema scores described previously.”</p><p>Figure 2 – Supplementary Figure 2 includes the searchlight and specific ROI results of the across-modality approach:</p><p>“Neural schema strength during encoding and retrieval in whole-brain and specific cortical and hippocampal ROIs, computed across-modality. […] Starred points indicate significant differences after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.”</p><p>Figure 3 – Supplementary Figure 4 includes the searchlight and specific ROI results of the across-modality approach:</p><p>“Predicting behavioral memory for story details with across-modality neural schema measures from encoding and recall. […] Point colors indicate directionality of prediction with red and blue for positive and negative associations, respectively.”</p><p>Finally, brief discussion of these results can be found in the new Discussion section “Within-subject and across-modality supplementary results”:</p><p>“Baldassano et al., (2018) found that schema representation at encoding across many of the same regions reported here (Figure 2) was modality-independent. […] When we related these across-modality neural schema scores to behavior (Figure 3 Supp4), we again found positive relationships to memory performance in mPFC at encoding; among a sparser set of regions at recall, we also found a positive relationship to memory in anterior hippocampus, suggesting that hippocampus can generalize across both <italic>content</italic> (i.e., shared structure across stories) and the surface form of content (i.e., modality).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It was unclear from the methods how the models relating neural scores with behavioral performance were set up. It sounds as though perhaps the researchers ran a simple linear regression, such that all participants' data was combined into a single model but subjects were not treated as random effects. If this were the case, then variability in memory performance across subjects is going to contribute to the estimate of the within-subject relationship between neural scores and memory performance on a story-by-story basis. It seems from the paper as though the authors are more interested in the within-subject variability. Can the authors clarify this point (e.g., by expanding the methods section beginning on line 585)?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. To clarify our approach, we fit a linear regression to all but one subject, and then use this model to predict story-by-story behavioral scores in the last subject (repeated for all choices of the held-out subject). We computed statistical significance by creating a null distribution in which story scores were shuffled within each participant before running the analysis. Therefore any significant results we observe must be due to within-subject (across stories) relationships between neural measures and behavior. Using a mixed-effects model could potentially increase the sensitivity of our regression analysis, by removing across-subject variance when measuring the relationship between neural and behavioral measures. However, since our analysis requires fitting this model for each searchlight, permutation, and left-out subject, it was computationally infeasible to fit this kind of model. Note that our choice to use a simpler model should lead only to false negatives (reducing sensitivity to subtle effects) and not to false positives in our results.</p><p>We have added an explanation before the last sentence of the second paragraph in the subsection starting at line 690 labeled “Predicting behavioral performance from neural scores” to clarify this point:</p><p>“Given this type of permutation, any significant results observed are due to within-subject (but across-stories) relationships between neural measures and behavior. […] Note that our choice to use a simpler model should lead only to false negatives (reducing sensitivity to subtle effects) and not to false positives in our results.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Some references to figure panels that don't appear to exist. For example, there is reference to figure 4A and 4B, but figure 4 does not have any sub-panels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for pointing this out! We have removed the incorrect placement of these references and have double checked all caption references to avoid any future confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Line 52 – the theoretical importance of free recall was a little unclear from the writing.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to clarify the difference between traditional memory recall tasks that are not self-paced and tend to assist participants in their memory search with rich associative cues or images, we have amended line 53 to include this distinction.</p><p>“Lastly, because existing paradigms have mostly tested memory with recognition or short associative recall tasks, the neural mechanisms of how schemas are instantiated and maintained during unconstrained memory search for naturalistic events have not been thoroughly explored; our use of free recall allowed us to address this gap in the literature.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 1 panel – just a suggestion that it may be helpful to orient correlation matrix schematic on the right hand side in the same was as the one in panel C, because I believe the &quot;encoding templates&quot; (currently on the y-axis for panel D) would be the same as the &quot;n-1 encoding story&quot; on the panel C schematic. It may help comprehension to put these both on the x-axis (for example) and/or match the labels and/or draw attention to this parallel in the legend. Could &quot;Recall story&quot; also be described as &quot;subj i Recall story&quot; to match the earlier panel?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion and we have switched the axes as well as re-labeled them to be “N Encoding Templates (Stories)” for the x-axis label and “subj i Recall Story” for the y-axis label.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. It might be worth explicitly noting earlier in the paper (specifically, before the reader gets to Figure 1) that the videos are in fact taken from real feature films, rather than constructed narratives.
