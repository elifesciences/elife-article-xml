mechanism. Cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans are known to play an essential role in this process. Unexpectedly, we found that among the diverse subclasses consisting of syndecans, perlecans, glypicans, and others, Glypican-1 (GPC1) is the principle and rate-limiting factor that drives unconventional secretion of FGF2. By contrast, we demonstrate GPC1 to be dispensable for FGF2 signaling into cells. We provide first insights into the structural basis for GPC1-dependent FGF2 secretion, identifying disaccharides with N-linked sulfate groups to be enriched in the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1 to which FGF2 binds with high affinity. Our findings have broad implications for the role of GPC1 as a key molecule in tumor progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>unconventional protein secretion</kwd><kwd>fibroblast growth factor 2</kwd><kwd>glypican</kwd><kwd>protein translocation across membranes</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositides</kwd><kwd>biochemistry of biological membranes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB/TRR 83 - A5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sparn</surname><given-names>Carola</given-names></name><name><surname>Nickel</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB/TRR 186 - A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dimou</surname><given-names>Eleni</given-names></name><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Annalena</given-names></name><name><surname>Saleppico</surname><given-names>Roberto</given-names></name><name><surname>Ewers</surname><given-names>Helge</given-names></name><name><surname>Nickel</surname><given-names>Walter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan with a dedicated function in unconventional protein secretion reveals an intimate relationship between fibroblast growth factor 2 and Glypican-1 in cancer biology.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteoglycans are components of the extracellular matrix and play essential roles in the storage and protection of growth factors, chemokines, and morphogens that bind to the glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans on cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schlessinger et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ori et al., 2011</xref>). These post-translational modifications are polymerized into unbranched chains of repetitive disaccharide building blocks. They can be classified into four categories defined by (i) heparan sulfates (HSPGs), (ii) chondroitin sulfates, (iii) keratan sulfates, and (iv) hyaluronic acid. Heparan sulfates are characterized by about 20–300 negatively charged residues with almost infinite structural modifications such as epimerization and sulfation patterns that are dynamically processed by enzymes resulting in variations between tissues, developmental stages, and the type of core protein they are attached to (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turnbull et al., 2001</xref>). Different classes of HSPGs also differ in terms of how they are anchored to membranes in that glypicans (GPCs) contain a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor whereas syndecans (SDCs) carry transmembrane spans. Based on their differential modes of membrane association, GPCs and SDCs partition into liquid ordered and disordered domains, respectively, providing a structural basis for distinct roles in growth factor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gutiérrez and Brandan, 2010</xref>). As part of their functions to modulate cell growth and differentiation, various kinds of proteoglycans are known to play key roles in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Their expression patterns along with the structural aspects discussed above and their potential release from cell surfaces play crucial roles in the coordination of their biological functions. These may differ between different kinds of proteoglycans depending on tissue types, developmental stages of tumors, and different tumor microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackhall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Pasquale and Pavone, 2020</xref>; ). Proteoglycans are also known to play key roles in the development of chemoresistances making them suitable drug targets for anti-cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lanzi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Among the proteins that bind to the alternating negatively charged disaccharide units of heparan sulfate chains in HSPGs is fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lindahl et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Murphy et al., 2004</xref>), a pro-angiogenic factor involved in cell proliferation and differentiation during development. In addition, under pathophysiological conditions, FGF2 has a strong impact on tumor-induced angiogenesis triggering the formation of new blood vessels to provide the large demands of malignant cancers for nutrients and oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carmeliet, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akl et al., 2016</xref>). FGF2 also plays a critical role as a tumor cell survival factor blocking programmed cell death through both autocrine and paracrine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okada-Ban et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Traer et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, blocking the biological functions of FGF2 by either limiting its secretion into the extracellular space or inhibiting FGF2 signaling into cells are suitable strategies in anti-cancer treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pallotta and Nickel, 2020</xref>).</p><p>While the majority of extracellular proteins contain N-terminal signal peptides for ER-Golgi-dependent protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palade, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rothman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rothman and Wieland, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schekman and Orci, 1996</xref>), FGF2 lacks a signal peptide and thus does not have access to the ER/Golgi-dependent secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nickel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nickel, 2007</xref>). Instead, FGF2 is secreted into the extracellular space by an unconventional mechanism of protein secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabouille, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimou and Nickel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pallotta and Nickel, 2020</xref>). Various kinds of such pathways have been identified that were collectively termed ‘unconventional protein secretion’ (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Malhotra, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabouille, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimou and Nickel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pallotta and Nickel, 2020</xref>). The mechanism by which FGF2 is transported into the extracellular space is based on direct protein translocation across the plasma membrane (UPS Type I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schäfer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zehe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabouille, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steringer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimou and Nickel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dimou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pallotta and Nickel, 2020</xref>).</p><p>All molecular components known to date to play a role in unconventional secretion of FGF2 are physically associated with the plasma membrane. These factors include the Na,K-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zacherl et al., 2015</xref>), Tec kinase which is recruited to the inner leaflet via binding to PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ebert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">La Venuta et al., 2016</xref>), and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Temmerman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Temmerman and Nickel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nickel, 2011</xref>), the most abundant phosphoinositide at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>). In the above-mentioned studies, FGF2 has been demonstrated to engage in direct physical interactions with all three of these components with the Na,K-ATPase being the first contact for FGF2 at the inner plasma membrane leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Legrand et al., 2020</xref>). Through subsequent interactions with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> mediated by a cluster of basic amino acids on the molecular surface of FGF2 (K127, R128, and K133 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Temmerman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steringer et al., 2017</xref>]), the core mechanism of FGF2 membrane translocation is triggered. This process involves membrane insertion of FGF2 oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steringer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steringer and Nickel, 2018</xref>) whose biogenesis depends on two surface cysteines in FGF2 that drive oligomerization through the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steringer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimou and Nickel, 2018</xref>). Membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers are accommodated within a lipidic membrane pore with a toroidal architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steringer and Nickel, 2018</xref>). This conclusion was derived from several independent observations including simultaneous membrane passage of fluorescent tracers and transbilayer diffusion of membrane lipids triggered by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependent FGF2 oligomerization and membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steringer and Nickel, 2018</xref>). In further support of this, diacylglycerol, a cone-shaped lipid that interferes with membrane curvature stabilized by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, was found to inhibit membrane insertion of FGF2 oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steringer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steringer and Nickel, 2018</xref>), a typical phenomenon for toroidal membrane pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>). Based upon these findings, the role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in unconventional secretion of FGF2 has been proposed to be threefold with (i) mediating recruitment of FGF2 at the plasma membrane, (ii) orienting FGF2 molecules at the inner leaflet to drive oligomerization, and (iii) stabilizing local curvature to allow for a toroidal membrane structure surrounding membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers that are accommodated within a hydrophilic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimou and Nickel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steringer and Nickel, 2018</xref>).</p><p>As discussed above, membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers have been proposed to act as key intermediates in FGF2 membrane translocation based on an assembly/disassembly mechanism driving directional transport of FGF2 across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimou and Nickel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steringer and Nickel, 2018</xref>). This process depends on membrane-proximal HSPGs on cell surfaces that capture and disassemble FGF2 translocation intermediates, thereby mediating the final step of FGF2 transport into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zehe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nickel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nickel and Seedorf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nickel and Rabouille, 2009</xref>). A critical property of heparan sulfates for this function is their ability to out-compete PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with regard to physical interactions toward FGF2. These are mutually exclusive with heparan sulfates having an about 100-fold higher affinity for FGF2 compared to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steringer et al., 2017</xref>). FGF2 on cell surfaces undergoes intercellular spreading by direct cell-cell contacts, probably mediated by direct exchange between heparan sulfate chains that are physically associated with opposing cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zehe et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, during the lifetime of an FGF2 molecule, the role of HSPGs is threefold with (i) mediating the final step of FGF2 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zehe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nickel, 2007</xref>), (ii) protecting FGF2 on cell surfaces against degradation and denaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nugent and Iozzo, 2000</xref>), and (iii) mediating FGF2 signaling as part of ternary complexes containing FGF2, heparan sulfate chains, and FGF high-affinity receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Presta et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ribatti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belov and Mohammadi, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, based upon sequential interactions of FGF2 with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the inner plasma membrane leaflet and, following the formation of membrane-spanning FGF2 oligomers, interactions with heparan sulfates on cell surfaces, the proposed mechanism of FGF2 membrane translocation offers a molecular basis for directional FGF2 transport into the extracellular space. It has recently been confirmed in a fully reconstituted system using giant unilamellar vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steringer et al., 2017</xref>) and is consistent with earlier observations demonstrating that membrane translocation depends on a fully folded state of FGF2 that permits PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependent FGF2 oligomerization and interactions with heparan sulfate chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Backhaus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torrado et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>- and heparan-sulfate-dependent translocation of FGF2 across the plasma membrane has also been visualized in living cells using single molecule TIRF microscopy. These studies revealed the real-time kinetics of this process with an average time interval for FGF2 membrane translocation of about 200 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dimou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pallotta and Nickel, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, we made the intriguing and unexpected discovery that HSPGs of different kinds cannot serve equally well in capturing FGF2 on cell surfaces as the final step of its unconventional secretory mechanism. Instead, using a proteome-wide BioID screen, we identified GPC1 as the principle HSPG driving this process. Even though HeLa cell lines lacking GPC1 were found to contain normal amounts of total glycosaminoglycans, FGF2 secretion was severely impaired. This phenotype could be reversed by re-expression of GPC1. By contrast, GPC5, the second family member of GPCs expressed in HeLa cells, failed to rescue the GPC1 knockout as did SDC4, an HSPG from the SDC family. Following the purification of various ectodomains from GPCs and SDC4, the quantification of the binding kinetics revealed a strong preference of FGF2 for GPC1. These findings were corroborated by a strongly increased binding of recombinant FGF2-GFP to the surface of cells overexpressing GPC1. Furthermore, using purified components, FGF2 was found to bind to the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1 with much higher affinity compared to those of GPC5 and SDC4. Based on analytical methods, we found disaccharide units enriched in the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1 that are known to play a role in recruiting FGF2. The strong FGF2 binding efficiency toward GPC1 could therefore be based on a unique arrangement of the corresponding hexasaccharide FGF2 binding units forming clusters with high avidity in the glycosaminoglycan chains of GPC1. As opposed to its critical role driving efficient secretion of FGF2, we found GPC1 to be dispensable for FGF2 signaling. Our studies reveal a novel and unexpected functional specialization of an HSPG with major implications for the prominent role of GPC1 in tumor progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GPC1 and FGF2 are in proximity to cell surfaces</title><p>To unveil so far unidentified proteins that are in proximity to FGF2 at any time of its lifetime in intact cells, we conducted a proteome-wide BioID screen.

This analysis revealed distinct patterns of biotinylated proteins when cell lines expressing FGF2-BirA were compared with those expressing BirA alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 5 versus lane 7). By contrast, a post-lysis addition of biotin did not affect the patterns of biotinylated proteins, irrespective of whether conditions with or without biotin in the culture medium were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In addition, FGF2 itself was identified likely due to its ability to oligomerize at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.</p><p>The strongest hit of this screen was GPC1, a GPI-anchored HSPG associated with cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This was a surprising finding for several reasons. First, BioID screens typically return intracellular proteins as hits since ATP is needed to activate biotin to be transferred by BirA to target proteins. The half-life of the BirA-biotinyl-5’-AMP complex of the BirA* R188G mutant enzyme used in our BioID screens is in the range of 5 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kwon and Beckett, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oostdyk et al., 2019</xref>). By comparison, FGF2-GFP has been shown to translocate across the plasma membrane within an average time interval of 200 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dimou et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the observed biotinylation of cell surface GPC1 mediated by FGF2-BirA* is consistent with the kinetic data on the stability of the BirA*-biotinyl-5’-AMP complex and the time interval it takes for FGF2 to translocate from the inner to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Second, no other cell surface HSPGs were found in proximity to FGF2. These observations were taken as evidence that GPC1 may represent an HSPG that is intimately linked to sites of FGF2 membrane translocation with a specialized function in unconventional secretion of FGF2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GPC1 is a rate-limiting component of the FGF2 secretion machinery</title><p>Following the identification of GPC1 as a cell surface HSPGs in cellular proximity to FGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we engineered cell lines with knockouts of GPC1 and GPC5, the two family members expressed in HeLa S3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

These experiments revealed a strong decrease in FGF2 secretion efficiency when GPC1 was absent. By contrast, a knockout of GPC5 did not impact this process. Consistently, a double knockout of GPC1 and GPC5 did not further intensify the FGF2 secretion phenotype observed in cells in which only GPC1 was knocked out.

Strikingly, all types of cell lines overexpressing GPC1 were characterized by significantly increased binding capacities for FGF2-GFP. Again, GPC5 overexpression did not result in increased binding of FGF2-GFP to cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

It revealed a strong interaction of FGF2 with GPC1 that was detectable already at the lowest FGF2 concentration being used at 0.8 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). By contrast, even at the highest concentration of FGF2 (60 nM), GPC5 only showed weak interactions with FGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) that were barely above the levels of the negative controls, GPC1-ΔHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) or heparan sulfate binding mutants of FGF2 tested against GPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Since there is no methodology available to sequence the disaccharide units of heparan sulfate chains, we treated the recombinant purified forms of GPC1, GPC5, and SDC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) with a mixture of heparinase I, II, and III to convert their heparan sulfate chains into disaccharides. Using an established HPLC protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carnachan and Hinkley, 2017</xref>; see Materials and methods for details), a total of 12 different heparan sulfate disaccharide standards with different sugar combinations and sulfation patterns (Iduron, UK) were analyzed for their retention times on an HPLC ion exchange column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These were compared with the retention times of the spectrum of dissacharide units released from GPC1, GPC5, and SDC4 upon treatments with heparinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The relative abundances of each of the identified disaccharides in the heparans sulfate chains of GPC1, GPC5, and SDC4, respectively, were quantified. The observed differences were tested for statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This analysis revealed the enrichment of disaccharides in GPC1 over GPC5 that correspond to the disaccharide standards 1, 2, and 5. All of these disaccharides contain N-linked sulfates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). The biggest difference between GPC1 and GPC5 was found to be the disaccharide standard 1 that represents a tri-sulfated disaccharide with two O-linked and one N-linked sulfate group. Intriguingly, when FGF2 was co-crystallized with synthetic heparin molecules, the binding site was found to contain three disaccharides of the type represented by the disaccharide standard 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raman et al., 2003</xref>). By contrast, disaccharides lacking both O- and N-linked sulfations corresponding to the disaccharide standards 6 and 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) were more abundant in GPC5 compared to GPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). When the spectrum of disaccharides from GPC1 and GPC5 was compared with SDC4, most features were similar to GPC1 (disaccharide standards 1, 2, 6, and 12) while the abundance of the disaccharide corresponding to standard 5 was rather similar to GPC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). These findings suggest that, beyond the overall abundance of certain sulfated disaccharide units in heparan sulfate chains, their combination into trimers of sulfated disaccharides plays a key role in forming a high-affinity binding site for FGF2. The strong interaction of GPC1 with FGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) therefore indicates that GPC1 carries heparan sulfate units consisting of three disaccharides corresponding to standard 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) as identified in structural in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raman et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1 may contain multiple copies of these FGF2 hexasaccharide ligands in a clustered manner producing high avidity and, therefore, a strong apparent affinity toward FGF2. Based on our findings, such binding sites are likely to be less abundant in GPC5 and SDC4 resulting in weaker interactions with FGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

While we found that the total amounts of glycosaminoglycans including heparan sulfate chains are not significantly altered in GPC1 knockout cells, we observed a pronounced decrease in FGF2 secretion efficiencies in the absence of GPC1. Overexpression of GPC5 (the second GPC family member expressed alongside GPC1 in HeLa cells) or SDC4, a member of the SDC family of HSPGs, did not rescue this process in a GPC1 knockout background. By contrast, overexpression of GPC1 in GPC1 knockout cells not only restored but rather caused a substantial increase of FGF2 secretion efficiencies. Therefore, GPC1 is a rate-limiting component of the FGF2 secretion machinery that is required for efficient transport of FGF2 into the extracellular space. These findings have implications for the molecular mechanism by which GPC1 is functioning in this process. Beyond the role of cell surface heparan sulfate chains in capturing and disassembling FGF2 oligomers at the outer plasma membrane leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zehe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nickel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabouille, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimou and Nickel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pallotta and Nickel, 2020</xref>), they further suggest that GPC1 is already required for membrane insertion of FGF2 oligomers, an upstream step that is initiated at the inner plasma membrane leaflet. Based upon the unique positioning of the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1 in close proximity to its GPI anchor and therefore the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prydz and Dalen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackhall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakato and Kimata, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Pasquale and Pavone, 2020</xref>), the FGF2 binding sites in GPC1 appear to be required for stabilizing the first subunits of membrane-spanning FGF2 oligomers as they surface at the outer plasma membrane leaflet. In this way, the likeliness of these intermediates to be formed could be strongly increased when GPC1 is overexpressed. This, in turn, would result in FGF2 membrane translocation events occurring more frequently. These observations are consistent with previous findings demonstrating that, compared to wild-type cells, higher forms of membrane-inserted FGF2 oligomers do not accumulate in cells lacking cell surface heparan sulfates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dimou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To obtain insight into the molecular mechanism by which GPC1 drives unconventional secretion of FGF2, we conducted quantitative binding studies of FGF2 with GPC1 and other HSPGs using recombinant components purified from HEK cells. These experiments revealed GPC1 to be the strongest FGF2 binding partner with the heparan sulfate chains being essential for this interaction. Based on a quantitative analysis of the disaccharide subunits in the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1, GPC5, and SDC4, we found disaccharides with N-linked sulfate groups corresponding to the standards 1, 2, and 5 enriched in GPC1 over GPC5 and SDC4. In particular, a tri-sulfated disaccharide (corresponding to standard 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) was found enriched in GPC1 over GPC5. By contrast, disaccharides lacking O- or N-linked sulfates (such as the ones corresponding to standards 6 and 12) were found enriched in GPC5 and SDC4 compared to GPC1. Consistently, a trimer of the tri-sulfated disaccharide enriched in GPC1 (corresponding to standard 1) has been found to be a strong binding motif for FGF2 in structural in vitro studies using synthetic heparin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raman et al., 2003</xref>). However, the differences in the overall abundance of the various disaccharide units found in GPC1 versus GPC5 versus SDC4 alone could not explain the dramatic differences regarding their affinity toward FGF2. Therefore, we propose the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1 to contain multiple copies in a clustered manner of the FGF2 hexasaccharide ligands containing three tri-sulfated disaccharides. Such an arrangement would produce a high avidity and, therefore, a strong affinity of GPC1 toward FGF2. While it remains a goal for future studies to identify the precise structure of the FGF2 binding sites in the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1, our interpretation of the current findings provides a plausible explanation for the observed differences regarding the FGF2 binding efficiencies toward GPC1, GPC5, and SDC4. Along with the unique spatial organization of the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1 being arranged in close proximity to the plasma membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prydz and Dalen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackhall et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakato and Kimata, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Pasquale and Pavone, 2020</xref>), the identification of GPC1 being a high-affinity binding partner of FGF2 provides insights explaining its prominent role in driving unconventional secretion of FGF2 from cells.</p><p>Based on the results presented in this study, one may wonder whether GPC1 is also relevant for unconventionally secreted proteins other than FGF2. While a comprehensive analysis looking into this aspect will be a goal of future studies, we tested galectin-1 and galectin-3 as potential binding partners of GPC1. They belong to a family of lectins that are known to be secreted by unconventional means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabouille, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dimou and Nickel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Popa et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to FGF2, despite being lectins as well, both galectin-1 and galectin-3 were incapable of interacting with GPC1. These findings suggest that GPC1 is not a general component of unconventional secretory processes but may represent a highly specific molecular component driving FGF2 secretion.</p><p>Another intriguing finding of this study was the observation that GPC1 is dispensable for FGF signaling. This was evident from experiments demonstrating that FGF2-induced signaling leads to similar levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in GPC1 knockout versus wild-type cells. Likewise, overexpression of GPC1 did not affect FGF2-induced activation of ERK1/2. These findings suggest that other HSPGs such as SDCs are sufficient to support FGF2 signaling. By contrast, unconventional secretion of FGF2 largely depends on the presence of GPC1 as the key factor that determines the efficiency of this process. With these observations, while GPC1 is not essential for FGF signaling, our study reveals an intimate relationship between FGF2 and GPC1 in the secretion of FGF2 from cells. Since both FGF2 and GPC1 are key components of tumor progression for a wide range of cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pan and Ho, 2021</xref>), we propose that the prominent function of GPC1 in driving efficient unconventional secretion of FGF2 might play a key role for tumor development such as acute myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Traer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Javidi-Sharifi et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Hela S3 cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin at 37°C with 95% humidity and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Peptides were separated using strong cation exchange (SCX) fractionation before 1D nano-LC-MS/MS of each SCX fraction. The resultant mass spectrometry data from each fraction was merged prior to Mascot database search using the MaxQuant software (V1.5.5.1) with the human Uniprot sequence database (UP000005640, 9606 – <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, 26.08.2015) for protein identification. Digestion mode was set to specific Trypsin/P with maximal two missed cleavages. Carbamidomethyl was set as fixed modification, acetylation of the N-terminus, oxidation (M), and biotinylation at lysine were chosen as variable modifications. Protein quantification was performed with unique and razor peptides. Protein intensities from the resulting ProteinGroups.txt file of three independent biological replicates were analyzed using the Perseus software (V1.5.5.1). Only proteins detected in the FGF2-BirA sample of at least two out of three biological replicates were considered for the analysis. The fold change between the FGF2-BirA and BirA-group was calculated from the means and log<sub>2</sub>-tansformed with standard imputation based on normal distribution. Significant differences between the groups were analyzed by two-sided t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>FGF2 secretion experiments based on cell surface biotinylation</title><p>3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells were seeded 48 hr prior to biotinylation and incubated with 1 µg/ml doxycycline after 24 hr for induction of FGF2-GFP expression.

This prevented the expression of FGF2-GFP so that endocytosis experiments with purified FGF2-GFP and fluorescent transferrin could be conducted without interference. For live cell imaging, cells were washed twice with cold Live Cell Imaging Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 5 min on ice. Cells were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope using a Zeiss Plan-APOCHROMAT 63×/ 1.4 Oil DIC objective.

For the quantification of FGF2-GFP translocation to cell surfaces, CHO K1 cells were seeded in μ-Slide 8 Well Glass Bottom plates (ibidi) followed by incubation for 24 hr in the presence of 1 μg/ml doxycycline to induce FGF2-GFP expression (for the experimental condition at high FGF2-GFP expression levels) or without doxycycline incubation (for the experimental condition at low FGF2-GFP expression levels). Following incubation, the medium was removed and cells were rinsed three times with Live Cell Imaging Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were further incubated on ice with membrane impermeable Alexa Fluor 647-labeled anti-GFP nanobodies (Chromotek) for 30 min. Afterward, they were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 20 min at RT. GFP fluorescence was excited with an Olympus 488 nm, 100 mW diode laser. Nanobody fluorescence was excited with an Olympus 640 nm, 140 mW diode laser. The quantification of FGF2-GFP particles on cell surfaces was achieved through a quantitative analysis of TIRF images. The frame of each cell was selected by wide-field imaging. For the experimental condition at low FGF2-GFP expression levels, the EM Gain for the wide-field (GFP) was adjusted in order to properly select the cell area. The number of nanobody particles were normalized to the cell surface area (μm<sup>2</sup>). The total number of nanobody particles per cell was quantified employing the Fiji plugin TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>).

Upon immobilization of the ligand to the biosensor, a shift in the interference spectrum of the reflected light is induced and can be detected. As soon as the analyte binds the ligand, a further increase of the optical thickness on the biosensor surface is detected by the additional wavelength shift, which is then reported as the wavelength change (nm) over time (s). Measurements were performed on the OctetRed96e system (Sartorius) using the Streptavidin sensors (18-5019 SA, Sartorius). Data were evaluated with the Data Analysis HT 12.0 software (Sartorius). Proteins were measured in black 96-well plates (655209, Greiner) in 200 µl for all samples. Biosensors were hydrated for 10 min before measurements in Octet Buffer (PBS, 0.02% Tween and 0.1% BSA) to remove sucrose coverage. Measurements were conducted with the plates shaking at 1000 rpm. All assays were performed with SA biosensors and the ligands were biotinylated. Proteins were labeled with EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-Biotin (Thermo Scientific A39259) in a 1:1 ration at 37°C for 30 min. Proteins were separated from non-bound biotin by Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Thermo Scientific 89882). Biotinylation does not interfere with the binding kinetics, as the interaction takes place at the heparan sulfate chains. A loading scout was performed to find the optimal amount of bound ligand to the biosensor surface. All kinetic experiments were performed with 6 µg/ml of biotinylated ligand loaded to the sensor for 10 min. If not stated otherwise in the figure legends, the assay setup was as follows: (i) baseline in Octet Buffer (2 min), (ii) load with ligand (6 µg/ml, 10 min), (iii) wash in octet buffer (1 min), (iv) baseline II in octet buffer (1 min), (v) association of FGF2 (60 µM dilution series, 1 or 5 min), (vi) dissociation in octet buffer (1 or 5 min), (vii) recovery in glycine pH 1.7 and octet buffer (3 × 5 s each).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>FGF2 signaling assays</title><p>Hela S3 cells with a FGF2 and GPC1 knockout background were induced with recombinant FGF2 (1 and 10 ng/ml) for 20 min.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor.

GPC1 was identified in a proteomic screen for proteins that interact with FGF2. GPC1 facilitates export of FGF2, acts as a highly specific surface receptor for FGF2, but is not required for FGF2-induced activation of ERK.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers found the study to be significant, clearly written and mostly convincing. Please submit a revised version that addresses the following. Items 1-3 are considered major.</p><p>1. FGF2 binding to GPC1 is glycan dependent, based on the loss of binding after deglycosylation. However, the proposed increased concentration of the hexasaccharide ligand relative to other HSPGs has not been sufficiently demonstrated. Assuming that the critical disaccharide is trimerized to make the ligand for FGF2 (Figure 6 and Raman 2003), then the difference in trimer concentration between GPC1 vs. SDC4 is 1.2<sup>3</sup>=1.7-fold, based on random assembly of the glycan chain. This concentration difference is not enough to cause the huge difference in apparent binding affinity shown in Figure 6. Nevertheless, based on the effects of deglycosylation, binding is clearly glycan dependent. Therefore, there must be another source of the affinity difference. Two possibilities come to mind. First, the interaction between FGF2 and GPC1 would be dependent on FGF2-glycan binding, but also includes other high affinity/high specificity sites. A second possibility is that the hexasaccharide ligand is clustered in GPC1 but not in other GAGs. That clustering would specifically raise the avidity and apparent affinity of the interaction. These issues should be addressed.</p><p>2. Figure 2 shows a strong reduction of FGF2 secretion upon GPC1 KO using the surface biotinylation assay (approx. 75% with little error). This is the critical evidence that GPC1 is required, yet in Figure 4A and D the result looks much less convincing (50% with large error). For Fig4D the WT data are present and it seems questionable whether there is a significant difference. This needs to be explained and/or corrected. Statistical significance of WT vs KO should be reported in Figure 1 and the result should be reproducible throughout, if using the same assay.</p><p>3. Is there a pool of FGF2 arrested at the plasma membrane in cells lacking GPC1? Is this pool attached to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane? Some level of understanding of the step where the function of GPC1 in the overall translocation of FGF2 across the plasma membrane is essential. The authors have shown before that Tec kinase and Na, K-ATPase are required for FGF2 secretion. I presume these two proteins are up stream of GPC1 in FGF2 translocation pathway.

Therefore, as proposed by Reviewer #1, a possible explanation would be that the corresponding high affinity FGF2 hexasaccharide ligand is contained in multiple copies that cluster in the GPC1 heparan sulfate chains of GPC1, resulting in high avidity and therefore strong apparent affinity towards FGF2. In our view, this is indeed the most likely explanation for the observed differences in the apparent affinities of FGF2 towards GPC1 versus GPC5 and SDC4 (Figure 6). Unfortunately, this hypothesis currently cannot be tested experimentally since there are no methodologies available to sequence heparan sulfate chains derived from different types of proteoglycans. It is also technically not possible to swap authentic heparan sulfate chains between different types of proteoglycans, so it is also difficult to test whether there is a second non-glycan FGF2 binding site in the core protein of GPC1 that, combined with the heparan sulfate chains, generates a high affinity binding site for FGF2, a second possible explanation put forward by Reviewer 1. Of note, however, a heparan sulfate binding deficient variant of FGF2 (KRK127/128/133QQQ) does not bind to GPC1 (see Figure S4). This observation suggests that the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1 provide the sole binding site for FGF2. Therefore, the first possibility put forward by Reviewer 1 is clearly the most likely scenario, a clustering of the critical hexasaccharide FGF2 binding motifs in the heparan sulfate chains of GPC1. In the revised manuscript, these aspects are now discussed in great detail providing a compelling explanation for the observed high affinity interaction between FGF2 and GPC1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As requested by Reviewer 2, in the revised versions of Figures 2 and 4, we have now indicated the statistical analysis for all conditions. While it is true that the absolute reduction in FGF2 secretion efficiencies is not the same, for all experiments done as part of this study, a GPC1 knockout always caused a significant reduction of FGF2 secretion efficiencies. In the redesigned Figure 4, there is an additional experimental condition that emphasizes this point, the reduction of FGF2 secretion in a GPC1 knock-out background when SDC4 is overexpressed. Again, a highly significant phenotype is observed with SDC4 overexpression not being able to rescue a GPC1 knock-out. So, while there is a certain degree of variation in the absolute reduction of FGF2 secretion rates in different series of experiments, the observed phenotypes are always statistically significant. At the same time, overexpression of GPC1 always causes a strong increase in FGF2 secretion efficiencies in a statistically significant manner. Therefore, even though there are certain variations between different series of experiments that were conducted independently by different authors of this manuscript, the described phenotypes are consistent and statistically significant in every single case. They fully support our conclusions with GPC1 being the predominant heparan sulfate proteoglycan driving efficient secretion of FGF2. This conclusion is further corroborated by our findings demonstrating GPC1 to have a much higher apparent affinity toward FGF2 compared to GPC5 and SDC4. In the revised manuscript, along with the new versions of Figure 2 and 4, we improved the discussion of these findings to make them more accessible to a broad readership.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As summarized in recent review articles on the topic (Dimou and Nickel 2018, Curr Biol; Pallotta and Nickel 2020, J Cell Sci), various lines of experimental evidence suggest the Na,K-ATPase, Tec kinase and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (in this order) to be upstream of GPC1. First, a previous study from our lab has shown that the Na,K-ATPase acts upstream of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, most likely forming the first contact of FGF2 at the inner plasma membrane leaflet (Legrand et al., 2020, Commun Biol). This could be demonstrated by various kinds of FGF2 mutants with binding defects towards either the Na,K-ATPase or PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. These experiments demonstrated that, in a cellular context, an FGF2 mutant that cannot bind to the Na,K-ATPase also fails to bind to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. The other way around, an FGF2 mutant that cannot bind PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was found to still bind to the Na,K-ATPase. These experiments were done in living cells using single molecule TIRF microscopy to quantify FGF2 recruitment at the inner plasma membrane leaflet (Legrand et al. ,2020, Commun Biol). Likewise, Tec kinase was also shown to act upstream of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> because Tec kinase-mediated phosphorylation of FGF2 enhances FGF2 oligomerization and membrane pore formation (Steringer et al., 2012, J Biol Chem). Regarding the role of heparan sulfate chains, in previous studies, we compared wild-type cells with heparan sulfate deficient cells. These studies demonstrated that FGF2 oligomers do not accumulate at the inner plasma membrane leaflet when heparan sulfate chains including those from GPC1 are absent from the cell surface (Dimou et al., 2019, J Cell Biol). Finally, we reconstituted FGF2 membrane translocation with purified components demonstrating that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and heparan sulfate chains need to be on opposing sides of the membrane to promote FGF2 membrane translocation (Steringer et al., 2017, <italic>eLife</italic>). This shows that GPC1 is acting downstream of the other components which is consistent with its localization on cell surfaces and the transport direction of FGF2 across the plasma membrane.</p><p>The findings from previous studies match our interpretations from the current manuscript. Since we demonstrate GPC1 overexpression to cause the rate of FGF2 secretion to go up strongly (Figures 2 and 4), a plausible explanation would be that GPC1 is not only capturing and disassembling FGF2 oligomers at the outer leaflet (Steringer et al., 2017, <italic>eLife</italic>; Dimou et al., 2019, J Cell Biol) but rather is already required in a preceding step facilitating membrane insertion of FGF2 oligomers. An interesting model would be that, at the inner plasma membrane leaflet, the likeliness of FGF2 to assemble into membrane-spanning oligomers in a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-dependent manner is increased when a binding site is available at the outer leaflet. We believe this binding site for FGF2 is produced by the high affinity heparan sulfate chains of GPC1. This mode of action provides a compelling explanation of how GPC1 can act as the rate-limiting factor of the unconventional secretory pathway of FGF2. This hypothesis is put forward in detail in the first paragraph of the discussion of our manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
