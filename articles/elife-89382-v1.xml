microbial peptides presented on MHC II. However, it remains largely unknown whether distinct or shared repertoires of Treg TCRs are mobilized in response to different challenges in the same tissue or the same challenge in different tissues. Here we use a fixed TCRβ chain FoxP3-GFP mouse model to analyze conventional (eCD4) and regulatory (eTreg) effector TCRα repertoires in response to six distinct antigenic challenges to the lung and skin. This model shows highly ‘digital’ repertoire behavior with easy-to-track challenge-specific TCRα CDR3 clusters. For both eCD4 and eTreg subsets, we observe challenge-specific clonal expansions yielding homologous TCRα clusters within and across animals and exposure sites, which are also reflected in the draining lymph nodes but not systemically. Some CDR3 clusters are shared across cancer challenges, suggesting a response to common tumor-associated antigens. For most challenges, eCD4 and eTreg clonal response does not overlap. Such overlap is exclusively observed at the sites of certain tumor challenges, and not systematically, suggesting transient and local tumor-induced eCD4=&gt;eTreg plasticity. This transition includes a dominant tumor-responding eCD4 CDR3 motif, as well as characteristic iNKT TCRα CDR3. In addition, we examine the homeostatic tissue residency of clonal eTreg populations by excluding the site of challenge from our analysis. We demonstrate that distinct CDR3 motifs are characteristic of eTreg cells residing in particular lymphatic tissues, regardless of the challenge. This observation reveals the tissue-resident, antigen-specific clonal Treg populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TCR repertoire</kwd><kwd>lung challenges</kwd><kwd>treg</kwd><kwd>CD4+ T cells</kwd><kwd>antigenic specificity</kwd><kwd>homing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012190</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>075-15-2019-1789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chudakov</surname><given-names>Dmitriy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Digitalized TCR repertoire-based view on antigenic specificity, plasticity, and tissue residence of regulatory T cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Treg, which constitute 5–10% of peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are indispensable for the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Rudensky, 2020</xref>) and regulation of ongoing immune responses to microbiotal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Suffia et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Muschaweck et al., 2021</xref>) and foreign (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Betts et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arpaia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Popovic et al., 2017</xref>) antigens, contributing to tissue and metabolic homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Rudensky, 2020</xref>). Treg suppresses immune responses through various mechanisms, but primarily does so via antigen-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Levine et al., 2014</xref>) interaction with professional and non-professional antigen-presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mehrfeld et al., 2018</xref>). There is considerable data suggesting that Treg employs higher-affinity T cell receptor (TCRs) and CTLA4 to compete with conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in an antigen-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tekguc et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Most Treg cells are produced by the thymus as a functionally distinct FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T cell subset. Thymic Treg is generated based on positive selection against self-peptide/MHCII (pMHCII) complexes in the thymic medulla, where multiple immune cell types may further contribute to this process, including medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), resident and immigrating dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell and Rudensky, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Klein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zegarra-Ruiz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sawant and Vignali, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the TCR landscape of conventional (eCD4) and regulatory (eTreg) effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in lungs, spleen, skin, and three lymph node locations after response to six distinct antigenic challenges to the lungs or skin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We used FoxP3-GFP mice with a fixed TCRβ context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marrack et al., 2017</xref>) and analyzed the TCRα repertoire composition for eCD4 and eTreg cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study design.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89382-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The adaptive immune system in this mouse model relies entirely on TCRα diversity to generate antigen-specific responses. On one hand, the relatively limited TCRα repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marrack et al., 2017</xref>) results in highly convergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Venturi et al., 2006</xref>) responses that are easily traceable across groups of mice facing the same challenge. The selection of the same or highly similar TCRα sequences against each antigen leads to the formation of clusters of homologous TCRα CDR3s within and between mice. On the other hand, this model allows for the tracking of all challenge-specific or tissue-specific features of the TCR repertoire using only one chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marrack et al., 2017</xref>). Overall, compared to conventional mice, this model provides a more powerful means of monitoring convergent TCR responses. At the same time, the model generally mimics the natural behavior of the full-fledged TCRαβ T cell repertoire.</p><p>Both for eCD4 and eTreg subpopulations, our analysis of the TCRα repertoire on the fixed TCRβ background revealed a highly focused response which was distinct for each of the antigenic challenges. The response was clonotypically shared between individual mice and between different tissues and formed clear convergent TCRα CDR3 sequence motifs responding to the challenges.</p><p>In conditions with such a highly convergent TCR response involving multiple independently-primed T cell clones with similar TCRα CDR3 sequences, one could expect a similar repertoire of clonotypes to dominate within the eCD4 and eTreg subpopulations, given the assumption that both subsets may start from the same pool of antigen-inexperienced naïve T cells. However, we demonstrate that the TCR landscape of eCD4 and eTreg responses was distinct, suggesting that these effector cell types originate from distinct T cell subsets.</p><p>The exceptions were the antigenic challenges with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and MMTV-PyMT-derived tumor cells (PYMT), where we observed increased overlap between the eCD4 and eTreg repertoires at the site of challenge, but not systemically. A dominant eCD4 TCRα motif was also present in corresponding eTreg subsets in the LLC and PYMT challenge.</p><p>Similarly, the characteristic innate natural killer T cell (iNKT) TCRα variants (that were abundant within eCD4 subsets upon challenge with LLC, bleomycin, and the helminth <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic>) were exclusively represented in the eTreg subset in the LLC challenge but not in the bleomycin and helminth challenges. We attribute these observations to the transient plasticity of effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the context of an immunosuppressive tumor burden.</p><p>Furthermore, we reveal tissue-specific eTreg TCRα CDR3 motifs that were always present in specific tissue locations irrespectively of the applied antigenic challenge. This observation highlights the existence of the diverse homing-specific, antigen-specific resident Treg populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TCRα repertoire sequencing</title><p>Six distinct challenges including influenza virus, <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, bleomycin-induced injury, LLC, PYMT, and B16 melanoma were applied to the lung and skin of <italic>Foxp3<sup>gfp</sup> Tcra<sup>−/+</sup></italic> mice bearing the DO11.10 TCRβ transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2015</xref>) (3–7 mice per group, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for details on each tissue and challenge experiment). After incubation, mice were sacrificed and tissue from the lungs, spleen, skin, and three types of lymph nodes (lung-draining mediastinal, MLN, axillary, AXLN, and intraglandular, IGLN) were isolated and digested to generate single-cell suspensions. eCD4 and eTreg CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted based on FoxP3-GFP signal. RNA-based unique molecular identifier (UMI)-labeled TCRα cDNA libraries were obtained using a previously-reported technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Izraelson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Logunova et al., 2020</xref>) with minor modifications, and then analyzed using MIGEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Shugay et al., 2014</xref>) and MiXCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolotin et al., 2015</xref>) software. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for the experimental scheme. Altogether, we sequenced 524 TCRα cDNA libraries, yielding 13,605±14,948 UMI-labeled TCRα cDNA molecules and 3392±3076 TCRα CDR3 clonotypes per eTreg sample, and 37,412±33,129 UMI-labeled TCRα cDNA molecules and 5518±4601 TCRα CDR3 clonotypes per eCD4 sample (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for details on each cloneset).</p><p>Lungs are exposed to a myriad of different insults during their lifetime and are constantly in need of a T cell response to resolve inflammatory insults. Furthermore, Treg with an effector phenotype accumulates in the inflamed lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fulton et al., 2010</xref>) but it remains poorly understood whether there is a common antigenic denominator driving TCR specificities in the tissue or whether there are selective TCR subsets expanded upon a particular inflammatory insult. In the following analyses, we mainly focused on TCR repertoires obtained from T cells infiltrating the lung tissue, for which we have also obtained the largest collection of samples, with several more specific cross-tissue analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Clonality of eCD4 and eTreg repertoires in the lung</title><p>First, we explored the clonality of eCD4 and eTreg responses in the lungs following distinct antigenic challenges. TCRα repertoire diversity was assessed using several widely used metrics, including observed diversity (number of distinct clonotypes), normalized Shannon Wiener index (repertoire evenness and the extent of clonal expansion), and Chao 1 (estimates lower bound of total diversity based on relative representation of small clonotypes). For normalization, all of these metrics were obtained from datasets that had been down-sampled to 1000 randomly chosen UMI-labeled TCRα cDNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Izraelson et al., 2018</xref>). We observed a prominent clonal response to each of the challenges compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). The decrease in diversity metrics was comparable for the lung-infiltrating eCD4 and eTreg cells. This indicates that the amplitude and focusness of the effector and regulatory T cell response in the lungs are generally comparable.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Clonality, diversity, and overlap of eTreg and eCD4 subsets.</title><p>(<bold>a-c</bold>).

We used F2 similarity metrics in the VDJtools software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shugay et al., 2015</xref>), which employs a clonotypewise sum of geometric mean frequencies that takes into account the relative size of shared clonotypes. As such, F2 metrics generally enable comparison of pairs of TCR repertoires with regard to the relative share occupied by common clonotypes. This analysis showed that the eTreg and eCD4 repertoires are highly distinct across distinct challenges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>). eTreg response is convergent and differs for distinct challenges.</p><p>We next zoomed in on the eTreg repertoire in order to investigate how focused their antigen-specific response is in the lungs. Repertoire overlap analysis showed that eTreg repertoires were highly similar across mice for each of the challenges, and differed between challenges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>).

Each mouse is exposed to one of a few distinct immune challenges, sacrificed, and T-cells are sampled from multiple tissues. FACS is used to sort CD4 and Treg cell populations from each sample, and TCR repertoire sequencing from UMI-tagged cDNA is done.</p><p>Various analyses using repertoire diversity, overlap, and clustering are presented to support several principal findings: (1) TCR repertoires in this fixed beta system have highly distinct clonal compositions for each immune challenge and each cell type, (2) these are highly consistent across mice, so that mice with shared challenges have shared clones, and (3) induction of CD4-to-Treg cell type transitions is challenge-specific.</p><p>The beta chain used for this mouse model was previously isolated based on specificity for Ovalbumin. Because the beta chain is essential for determining TCR antigen specificity, and is highly diverse in wildtype mice, I found it surprising that these mice are reported to have robust and consistently focused clonal responses to very diverse immune challenges, for which a fixed OVA-specific beta chain is unlikely to be useful. The authors don't comment on this aspect of their findings, but I would think it is not expected <italic>a priori</italic> that this would work.If this does work as reported, it is a valuable model system: due to massively reduced diversity, the TCR repertoire response is much more stereotyped across individual samples, and it is much easier to detect challenge-specific TCRs via the statistics of convergent responses.</p></disp-quote><p>This was to some extent expected, since these mice live almost normally and have productive adaptive immune responses and protection. In real life, there are frequent TCR-pMHC interactions where the TCR-alpha chain dominates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701794/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701794/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37047500/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37047500/</ext-link>). On the fixed TCR-beta background this mechanics starts working full-fledged, essentially substituting TCR-beta diversity, at the extent of relatively simplified TCRab repertoire and probably higher cross-reactivity.</p><p>We agree that this is a valuable model, for sure, and indicated this in the last sentence of our Discussion. Now we are also adding this point to the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the data and analyses present interesting signals, they are flawed in several ways that undermine the reported findings. I summarize below what I think are the most substantive data and analysis issues.</p><p>(1) There may be systematic inconsistencies in repertoire sampling depth that are not described in the manuscript. Looking at the supplementary tables (and making some plots), I found that the control samples (mice with mock challenge) have consistently much shallower sampling-in terms of both read count and UMI count-compared with the other challenge samples. There is also a strong pattern of lower counts for Treg vs CD4 cell samples within each challenge.</p></disp-quote><p>The immune response of control mice is less extensive, as it should be. Just like the fact that the number of Tregs in tissues is lower than CD4, this is normal. So this all follows the expectations. But please note that we were very accurate everywhere with appropriate data normalisation, using all our previous extensive experience (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/</ext-link>).</p><p>In particular (now adding more relevant details to Methods):</p><p>For diversity metrics calculations, we randomly sampled an equal number of 1000 UMI from each cloneset. Samples with UMI &lt; 700 were excluded from analysis.</p><p>For amino acid overlap metrics calculations, we selected top-1000 largest clonotypes from each cloneset. Samples with clonotype counts &lt; 700 were excluded from analysis.</p><p>For nucleotide overlaps metrics calculations (eCD4-eTreg), we selected top-100 clonotypes from each cloneset. Samples with clonotypes &lt; 100 were excluded from analysis.</p><p>The top N clonotypes were selected as the top N clonotypes after randomly shuffling the sequences and aligning them in descending order. This was done in order to get rid of the alphabetical order for clonotypes with equal counts (e.g. count = 1 or 2).</p><p>Downsampling was carried out using software vdjtools v.1.2.1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) FACS data are not reported. Although the graphical abstract shows a schematic FACS plot, there are no such plots in the manuscript. Related to the issue above, it would be important to know the FACS cell counts for each sample.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree that this is valuable information that should be provided. Unfortunately, this data has not been preserved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For diversity estimation, UMI-wise downsampling was performed to normalize samples to 1000 random UMIs, but this procedure is not validated (the optimal normalization would require downsampling cells). What is the influence of possible sampling depth discrepancies mentioned above on diversity estimation? All of the Treg control samples have fewer than 1000 total UMIs-doesn't that pose a problem for sampling 1000 random UMIs?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, I simulated this procedure and found systematic effects on diversity estimates when taking samples of different numbers of cells (each with a simulated UMI count) from the same underlying repertoire, even after normalizing to 1000 random UMIs. I don't think UMI downsampling corrects for cell sampling depth differences in diversity estimation, so it's not clear that the trends in Fig 1A are not artifactual-they would seem to show higher diversity for control samples, but these are the very same samples with an apparent systematic sampling depth bias.</p><p>We evaluated this approach through all our work, and summarised in the ref: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/</ext-link>. Altogether, normalising to the same count of randomly sampled UMI seems to be the best approach (although, preferably, the initial sequencing depth should be essentially higher for all samples than the sampling threshold used). Initial sorting of identical numbers of cells and ideally uniform library preparation and sequencing is generally not realistic and does not work in the real world, while UMI downsampling does the same work much better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The Figures may be inconsistent with the data. I downloaded the Supplementary Table corresponding to Fig 1 and made my own version of panels A-C. This looked quite different from the diversity estimations depicted in the manuscript. The data does not match the scale or trends shown in the manuscript figure.</p></disp-quote><p>There was a wrong column for Chao1, now correcting. Also, please note that we only used samples with &gt; 700 UMI. Supplementary Table now corrected accordingly. Also, please note that Figure 1 shows the results for lung samples only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) For the overlap analysis, a different kind of normalization was performed, but also not validated. Instead of sampling 1000 UMIs, the repertoires were reduced to their top 1000 most frequent clones. It is not made clear why a different normalization would be needed here. There are several samples (including all Treg control samples) with only a couple hundred clones. It's also likely that the noted systematic sampling depth differences may drive the separation seen in MDS1 between Treg and CD4 cell types. I also simulated this alternative downsampling procedure and found strong effects on MDS clustering due to sampling effects alone.</p></disp-quote><p>That’s right, for the overlap analysis (which values are mathematically proportional to the clonotype counts in both compared repertoires, so the difference in the counts causes major biases) the right way to do it is to choose the same number of clonotypes. See Ref. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/</ext-link>.</p><p>We kept only samples with &gt; 700 for the overlap analyses.

The clusters reported in the main text have illegibly small logo plots, and no information about V/J gene enrichments. More importantly, as the caption states they were chosen from the columns of a large (and messier-looking) cluster matrix in the supplementary figure based on association with each specific challenge. There's no detail about how this association was calculated, or how it controlled for multiple tests. I don't think it is legitimate to simply display a set of clusters that visually correlate; in a sufficiently wide random matrix you will find columns that seem to correlate with any given pattern across rows.</p></disp-quote><p>Particular CDR3 sequences and VJ segments do not mean much for the results of this manuscript. Logos are given just for visual explanation of how the consensus motifs of the clusters look like.</p><p>We now add two more Supplementary Tables and a Supplementary Figure with full information about clusters.</p><p>We disagree that the Supplementary Figure 1 (representing all the clusters) looks “messy”. Vice versa, it is surprisingly “digital”, showing the clear patterns of responses and homings. This becomes clear if you visually study it for a while. But yes, it is too big to let the reader focus on this or that aspect. That is why we need to select TCR clusters to illustrate this or that aspect discussed in the work, but they were selected from the overall already structured picture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The findings on differential plasticity and CD4 to Treg conversion are not supported. If CD4 cells are converting to Tregs, we expect more nucleotide-level overlap of clones. This intuition makes sense. But it seems that this section affirms the consequent: variation in nucleotide-level clone overlap is a readout of variation in CD4 to Treg conversion. It is claimed, based on elevated nucleotide-level overlap, that the LLC and PYMT challenges induce conversion more readily than the other challenges. It is not noted in the textual interpretations, but Fig 4 also shows that the control samples had a substantially elevated nucleotide-level overlap. There is no mention of a null hypothesis for what we'd expect if there was no induced conversion going on at all. This is a reduced-diversity mouse model, so convergent recombination is more likely than usual, and the challenges could be expected to differ in the parts of TCR sequence space they induce focus on. They use the top 100 clones for normalization in this case, but don't say why (this is the 3rd distinct normalization procedure).</p></disp-quote><p>Your point is absolutely correct: “This is a reduced-diversity mouse model, so convergent recombination is more likely than usual”. Distinct normalisation procedure was required to focus on the most expanded clonotypes to avoid the tail of (presumably cross-reactive) and identical TCRs present in all repertoires in these limited-repertoire mice. So we downsampled as strictly as possible to minimise this background signal of nucleotide overlap, and only this strict downsampling to the top-100 clonotypes allowed us to visualise the difference between the challenges. This is a sort of too complicated explanation that would overload the manuscript. But your comments and our answers will be available to the reader who wants to go into all the details.</p><p>The observed (at this strict downsampling) overlaps between the top-nucleotide clones in both LLC and PYMT challenges are prominently above the average, and this result is reproducible in lungs and skin, so we have no doubts in interpretations based on these data.
