Histamine, a monoamine neurotransmitter, is synthesized through decarboxylation of histidine by histidine decarboxylase (Hdc). However, little is known about how histidine is presented to Hdc as a precursor. Here, we identified a specific histidine transporter, TADR (torn and diminished rhabdomeres), which is required for visual transmission in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Both TADR and Hdc localized to neuronal terminals, and mutations in <italic>tadr</italic> reduced levels of histamine, thus disrupting visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior. These results demonstrate that a specific amino acid transporter provides precursors for monoamine neurotransmitters, providing the first genetic evidence that a histidine amino acid transporter plays a critical role in synaptic transmission. These results suggest that TADR-dependent local de novo synthesis of histamine is required for synaptic transmission.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>histidine transporter</kwd><kwd>histamine</kwd><kwd>de novo synthesis</kwd><kwd>monoamine neurotransmitter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81870693</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81670891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TADR (torn and diminished rhabdomeres)-dependent histidine transporting is required for de novo synthesis of histamine and for maintaining synaptic transmission of photoreceptor neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Monoamine neurotransmitters including dopamine, serotonin, and histamine are formed primarily by the decarboxylation of amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKinney et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Watanabe et al., 1984</xref>). Deficiencies in the biosynthesis of monoamine neurotransmitter such as dopamine contribute to a range of neurological disorders, such as dystonic and parkinsonian syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kurian et al., 2011</xref>). It has been proposed that precursor amino acids are taken up into synaptic terminals by specific transporters, followed by the synthesis and packaging of neurotransmitters within the nerve endings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellipanni et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lebrand et al., 1996</xref>). However, to date, amino acid transporters specific for the synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters have not been identified. Moreover, biosynthetic enzymes involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters localize to both the soma and axonal terminals. Thus, it is possible that neurotransmitters are made in the cell body of presynaptic cells and then packed into synaptic vesicles and transported to axonal terminals via fast axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broix et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roy, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Histamine was first identified as a neurotransmitter that localized to the tuberomamillary nucleus where it was synthesized from the amino acid histidine through a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme histidine decarboxylase (Hdc), which removes a carboxyl group from histidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Taguchi et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Watanabe et al., 1984</xref>). As a neurotransmitter, histamine plays important roles in regulating multiple physiological processes, including cognition, sleep, synaptic plasticity, and feeding behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekkers, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Haas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parmentier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vorobjev et al., 1993</xref>). Disruption of histaminergic neurotransmission is associated with a range of neurological disorders, including schizophrenia and multiple neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haas and Panula, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klaips et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim and Yue, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olivero et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Panula and Nuutinen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, loss-of-function mutations in the HDC gene lead to Tourette syndrome, a neurological disorder characterized by sudden, repetitive, rapid, and unwanted movements in both human patients and mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baldan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ercan-Sencicek et al., 2010</xref>). However, a specific histidine transporter that maintains the histidine pool and delivers histidine to synaptic Hdc for histamine synthesis has not been identified.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor cells use histamine as the dominant neurotransmitter to convey visual signals. Thus, generation of high levels of histamine in photoreceptor neuronal terminals is important for rapid and high-frequency visual signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borycz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardie, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stuart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Montell, 2007</xref>). Similar mechanisms of histamine synthesis, storage, and release between mammals and flies make the fly a powerful molecular-genetic system for studying the metabolism of neuronal histamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaturvedi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deshpande et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gengs et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gisselmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardie, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin and Krantz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wyant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu and Wang, 2019</xref>). Histamine signals are enriched in photoreceptor terminals, and disrupting histamine synthesis by <italic>Hdc</italic> mutation results in reduced levels of axonal histamine and loss of visual transduction. This indicates that histamine is synthesized directly within photoreceptor terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chaturvedi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Melzig et al., 1996</xref>). In support of this notion, LOVIT, a new vesicular transporter required for the concentration of histamine in photoreceptor terminals, is exclusively found in synaptic vesicles at photoreceptor terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu and Wang, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Given the high demand for histamine to maintain visual transmission at high frequencies, we hypothesized that a histidine-specific transporter must localize to neuronal terminals, and that this transporter would be required for de novo synthesis of histamine through Hdc. In support of this hypothesis, we found that Hdc localized exclusively to photoreceptor terminals. We performed a targeted RNAi screen for transporters involved in visual transmission and identified TADR (torn and diminished rhabdomeres), a plasma membrane transporter capable of transporting histidine into cells. TADR localized predominantly to photoreceptor terminals and specifically transported the amino acid histidine. Mutations in the <italic>tadr</italic> gene disrupted photoreceptor synaptic transmission, phototaxis behaviors, and levels of axonal histamine in photoreceptors. We therefore propose that a specific amino acid transporter provides precursors for the synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters. We further provide evidence that neurotransmitters can be synthesized de novo in a specific location.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hdc localizes to neuronal terminals</title><p>Histamine acts as major neurotransmitter at photoreceptor synaptic terminals, transmitting visual information to interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardie, 1989</xref>). Further, histamine de novo synthesis in photoreceptor cells is essential for maintaining visual transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burg et al., 1993</xref>). Interestingly, we have identified a vesicle transporter specific for histamine, LOVIT, which is concentrated exclusively in photoreceptor terminals and helps to maintain levels of histamine at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu and Wang, 2019</xref>). Together with the fact that visual neurotransmission requires rapid and high-frequency firing, we hypothesize that the fast neurotransmitter histamine is synthesized directly in axon terminals. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor cells, histamine is initially synthesized from histidine by the eye-specific enzyme, Hdc. To determine the subcellular localization of Hdc in photoreceptor cells, we raised an antibody against an Hdc-specific peptide. Endogenous Hdc was detected predominantly in the lamina layer, which contains terminals of the R1–R6 photoreceptors, and in the medulla, which contains terminals of R7–R8. In these regions, Hdc co-localized with LOVIT and the presynaptic marker, CSP (cysteine string protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, Hdc was largely absent from the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Cross sections of the lamina neuropil that contained R1–R6 terminals revealed that Hdc was surrounded by the glial marker Ebony and co-localized with synaptic vesicle protein CSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To confirm the subcellular pattern of Hdc, we expressed mCherry-tagged Hdc in photoreceptor cells using the <italic>trp</italic> promoter (<italic>transient receptor potential</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montell and Rubin, 1989</xref>). The chimeric Hdc was functional, as the <italic>trp-Hdc-mCherry</italic> transgene completely restored visual transmission in <italic>Hdc</italic> mutant flies. Consistent with what we observed for endogenous Hdc, Hdc-mCherry was also highly enriched in the lamina and medulla. In contrast, GFP signals were detected in the retina, lamina, and medulla in <italic>trp-GFP</italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The finding that Hdc protein was enriched in photoreceptor terminals is consistent with the assumption that the neurotransmitter histamine is synthesized directly in axon terminals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Histidine decarboxylase (Hdc) localizes to neuronal terminals.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Cryosections of <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and <italic>Hdc</italic> mutant heads were labeled with antibodies against Hdc (red), 24B10 (<bold>A</bold>) (green, photoreceptor cell marker), CSP (cysteine string protein) (<bold>B</bold>) (green, localized to synaptic vesicles), and LOVIT (blue, labeling photoreceptor terminals).

Because a histamine transporter has not yet been identified, we first asked whether TADR can transport histamine. Histamine uptake assays revealed that TADR does not exhibit histamine uptake activity. As a control, the human organic cation transporter (OCT2), which is known to take up histamine, exhibited high levels of histamine transport when expressed in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Busch et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Histidine efficiently blocked [<sup>3</sup>H]-histidine uptake, whereas the other amino acids and carcinine did not affect TADR-mediated histidine uptake. The only exception was lysine, which slightly reduced [<sup>3</sup>H]-histidine uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Histidine is directly transported into photoreceptor cells at neuronal terminals by TADR, where it is used as a substrate to synthesize histamine by the decarboxylase, Hdc. Newly generated histamine is then loaded into synaptic vesicles by a LOVIT-dependent mechanism. Histamine, serving as a neurotransmitter, is released by photoreceptor cells (PR) to activate histamine-gated chloride channels (HisClA) on postsynaptic neurons (large monopolar cell [LMC]) to start visual transmission.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig6sdata1"><label>Figure 6—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for histidine uptake assay and source data for quantitative of electroretinogram (ERG) transients and phototaxis behaviors.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-75821-fig6-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75821-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig6s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Both CG13248 and Slif do not transport histamine.</title><p>CG13248 and Slif did not transport histamine into S2 cells.

In most cases, the enzymes necessary for neurotransmitter synthesis are translated in the soma and then transported down the axon, where they then generate neurotransmitters. However, tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase, the rate-limited enzymes for dopamine and serotonin synthesis, respectively, are cytosolic and reside both in the neuronal cell body and axon, suggesting that the de novo synthesis of these neurotransmitters occurs in both the soma and axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cartier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walther et al., 2003</xref>). If neurotransmitters are generated in the cytosol of the cell body, the slow rate of diffusion for these small molecules could potentially limit the pool of axonal neurotransmitters and affect synaptic transmission. One possibility is that neurotransmitters are loaded into storage vesicles and that these vesicles are then taken to the nerve endings through fast axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broix et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Roy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vallee and Bloom, 1991</xref>). However, the recently identified vesicular transporter, LOVIT, which is responsible for packaging histamine, is absolutely restricted to synaptic vesicles within the photoreceptor axon. Histamine is exclusively detected in wild-type photoreceptor terminals, but absent from <italic>lovit</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu and Wang, 2019</xref>). Consistent with this, we found that Hdc and its product histamine are enriched in photoreceptor terminals, suggesting that the de novo synthesis of histamine occurs exclusively in axons. If histidine, the substrate of Hdc, is transported to axonal terminals from the cell body, the rate of histamine biosynthesis would be limited. Therefore, it is possible that neurotransmitter precursors are taken up into terminals by specific transporters, and that neurotransmitter synthesis and packaging take place primarily within the axon. In support of this, we have characterized a new histidine transporter, TADR, which localized predominantly to photoreceptor terminals and was required for the de novo synthesis of histamine in photoreceptor terminals. Furthermore, TADR specifically transported histidine in vitro, and <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic> null mutant flies exhibited normal neuronal growth and survival, but disrupted visual transmission. Therefore, TADR and Hdc function synergistically within axonal terminals to provide a local pool of neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Although de novo synthesis provides a starting pool of neurotransmitters, recycling neurotransmitters after release is a critical pathway for maintaining neurotransmitter content within axon terminals. Ebony, the histamine recycling pathway involved in a previously identified <italic>N</italic>-β-alanyl-dopamine synthase, is expressed in epithelial glia and converts histamine to carcinine. The inactive histamine conjugate, carcinine, is transported back into photoreceptors where it is hydrolyzed back into histamine by Tan, an <italic>N</italic>-β-alanyl-dopamine hydrolase, to restore the neurotransmitter pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borycz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Richardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richardt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wagner et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike Hdc, Tan localizes non-selectively to both the soma and axon, suggesting that the regeneration of histamine may take place in the soma as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aust et al., 2010</xref>). However, a recently identified transporter specific for carcinine, CarT, predominantly localizes to the terminals of photoreceptor neurons, rather than to the cell bodies, suggesting the regeneration of histamine from carcinine through axonal Tan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chaturvedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stenesen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, both de novo synthesis and regeneration of the neurotransmitter histamine is restricted to neuronal terminals by a similar mechanism – the transportation of substrates.</p><p>TADR belongs to the CAT subfamily within the SLC7 family, and is homologous to the human membrane proteins, SLC7A4 and SLC7A1, which are predicted to be involved in importing basic amino acids across the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verrey et al., 2004</xref>). It has been reported that flies carrying a missense mutation in <italic>tadr</italic>, namely <italic>tadr<sup>1</sup></italic> (generated from an EMS mutagenesis screen), exhibit retinal degeneration. This may indicate that TADR functions to provide amino acids to support photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ni et al., 2008</xref>). However, our <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic> null mutant flies fail to exhibit photoreceptor degeneration or growth defects. In addition, the morphologies of <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic> somas and axons are comparable to those of wild-type flies. In support of this, we found that TADR specifically transported histidine, with only a low affinity for lysine, suggesting that TADR is not involved in the general metabolism of amino acids. The neurodegeneration phenotype observed in <italic>tadr<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants may be due to other mutations generated by EMS mutagenesis or the neomorphic <italic>tadr<sup>1</sup></italic> point mutation, which may disrupt Gq signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ni et al., 2008</xref>). The CG13248 transporter, a member of the CAT subfamily, is able to rescue the vision defects of <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic> mutant flies, but another member of the CAT subfamily, the transporter Slif, failed to do so. This is consistent with their ability to transport histidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, SLC38A3, which belongs to the SLC38 subfamily, is known to mediate sodium-dependent transport of multiple amino acids, including histidine, and the expression of SLC38A3 fully restores visual transduction and phototactic behavior in <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bröer, 2014</xref>). The lack of sequence homology between SLC38A3 and TADR strongly suggests that TADR primarily acts as a histidine transporter to maintain visual transduction. Although TADR is a specific histidine transporter, its expression patterns suggests that it is not the only histidine transporter. Supporting this, null <italic>tadr</italic> mutants are viable and exhibit no growth or cell death phenotypes. If photoreceptor cells uptake histidine via other histidine transporters, they could have a small histidine pool and Hdc would be able to synthesize some histamine. In agreement with this, histamine levels in <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic> mutant are higher than in <italic>Hdc</italic> mutant, although histamine levels in both mutants are greatly reduced. Consistent with these relative histamine levels, <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic> mutation exhibit more phototactic behavior than <italic>Hdc</italic> mutants.</p><p>Amino acid transporters play fundamental roles in multiple metabolic processes, including mTOR activation, energy metabolism, nutritional stress, and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colombani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicklin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rebsamen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wyant et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with these functions, the amino acid transporters SLC7A5 and SLC6A14 are upregulated in tumors, making then potential targets for the pharmacological treatment of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanai, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nałęcz, 2020</xref>). Our experiments suggest that amino acid transporters provide amino acids that are critical for the de novo synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters. Since inhibitors of monoamine transporters have been widely used as antidepressants, amino acid transporters specific for monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis (such as TADR) may provide new treatment options for neurological diseases associated with the dysregulation of monoamine neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaste</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>tadr</italic> (cDNA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Resource Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBcl0168145</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase symbol: LD25644</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaste</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>slif</italic> (cDNA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Resource Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBcl0167622</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase symbol: LD37241</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaste</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>CG13248</italic> (cDNA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Resource Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBcl0718746</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase symbol: FI04531</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>SLC38A3</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCBI database</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID: 10,991</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Synthesized from GENEWIZ, China.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>tadr<sup>RNAi1</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC:v330472RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:FlyBase_FBst0492187">FlyBase_FBst0492187</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">P{VSH330472}attP40</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Drosophila melanogaste</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">S2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBtc0000181; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_Z992">CVCL_Z992</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line maintained in N.

Briefly, S2 cells were cultured in Schneider’s <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) in 12-well plates, and transfected with vigofect reagent (Vigorous Biotechnology, Beijing, China). The transfected cells were washed with 1 mL extracellular fluid (ECF) buffer consisting of 120 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3 mM KCl,1.4 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>,1.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.4 mM K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM D-glucose, and 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4) at 37°C. Uptake assays were initiated by applying 200 μL DMEM (for histidine uptake) or ECF buffer (for histamine and β-alanine uptake) at 37°C. After 10 or 30 min, the reaction was terminated by removing the solution, and cells were washed with 1 mL ice-cold ECF buffer. The cells were then solubilized in 1 N NaOH and subsequently neutralized. An aliquot was taken to measure radioactivity and protein content using a liquid scintillation counter and a DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Berkeley, CA), respectively. To perform histidine competition assays, [<sup>3</sup>H]-histidine (30–60 Ci/mM, 2.5 μM) in combination with L-amino acid including serine, alanine, cysteine, glutamine, asparagine, arginine, and lysine, at higher concentration (0.5 mM) were added into DMEM buffer. Carcinine was added to the medium to yield a final concentration of 20 μM. After incubation for 3 hr, S2 cells were transferred to poly-L-lysinecoated slices, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and incubated with rabbit anti-carcinine/histamine antibodies (1:100, ImmunoStar, Hudson, WI).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Helmut Krämer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another and all agreed on an invitation to resubmit based on the strengths of the manuscript. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide a more detailed analysis of the difference between the previous allele that was shown to cause degeneration with the new one. Experimental additions would be welcome, but a new detailed analysis of the old allele should not be necessary.</p><p>2) Please see reviews 2 and 3 for some important experimental suggestions to substantiate conclusions, in particular:</p><p>– Despite the strong ERG phenotype, some 50% of the TADR mutant flies still show behavioral responses in the phototaxis axis, strongly arguing for a pathway acting in parallel to TADR.

In the abstract and lines 107, 111, 211 the authors refer to HDC colocalizing with TADR, Lovit or CSP. None of the experiments referred to are up to modern standards to support co-localization.

This is a clever experiment although it is not completely convincing without knowing what else CG13248 and Slif can transport, and whether there are other differences besides histidine.</p><p>The authors present a well-executed series of experiments and a convincing set of data supporting the idea that tadr is a histidine transporter essential for the function of photoreceptor cells. The manuscript nicely complements other papers from this group and others on transporters required for histaminergic signaling at photoreceptor cells. Indeed, this is an important paper for understanding synaptic signaling in the fly visual system and as such may be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, the first order synapse in the insect visual system is relatively unusual. To determine if tadr serves a more general role in histaminergic signaling, it would be useful to assess its localization in the CNS and PNS and possibly test other histamine dependent-behaviors such as grooming. It is possible that tadr is not expressed in other hdc(+) neurons in the fly and has nothing to do with grooming. This would not negate the importance of the paper. However, this information would seem to be an important component of characterizing tadr and whether it serves a more general role in histaminergic neurons. Labeling in the CNS would also help to establish whether tadr is specific for histidine. If so, it might not be expressed in non-histaminergic neurons.</p><p>It has been previously suggested that the histamine cycle involves conversion to carcinine via conjugation to β-alanine in glia prior to transport back to photoreceptors. The authors played an important role in this work. Tadr may have nothing to do with carcinine and the authors point out interesting differences in the localization of tan and tadr. Nonetheless, it is surprising that they did not test whether carcinine inhibited tadr and this would be useful to include in the manuscript.

Although TADR is a specific histidine transporter, its expression pattern suggests that it is not the only histidine transporter. Supporting this, null <italic>tadr</italic> mutants are viable and have no growth phenotype. As photoreceptor cells may uptake histidine from other histidine transporters, they have a small histidine pool and synthesize some histamine via Hdc. Supporting this, histamine levels in <italic>tadr</italic> mutants are higher than in <italic>Hdc</italic> mutants, although histamine levels are greatly reduced in both mutants (Figure 5D). Consistent with reduced histamine levels, <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic> mutants exhibit weak phototactic behavior, indicating the presence of another histidine transporter in <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor cells. However, given that <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic> mutants displayed a complete loss of ON and OFF transients, greatly reduced histamine levels, and much less phototactic behavior, we speculate that TADR is the major histidine transporter, responsible for maintaining the histidine pool and keeping visual transmission at high frequencies.

Hdc and LOVIT are exclusively involved in photoreceptor synaptic transmission and predominantly localize to neuronal terminals. By contrast, TADR is widely expression. As an essential amino acid, histidine is used for a variety of functions, including protein synthesis, proton buffering, metal ion chelation, scavenging of reactive oxygen, and erythropoiesis, in addition to the generation of histamine. Therefore, it is not surprising that the histidine transporter, TADR, is expressed more widely than Hdc and LOVIT. However, although TADR shows widespread expression, we found that TADR localizes predominantly to photoreceptor terminals, and the only phenotype we characterized is its functions in maintaining visual transmission at high frequencies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Issues that need to be addressed:</p><p>1.

Since the <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic> mutation is a null <italic>tadr</italic> allele, TADR is not required to maintain photoreceptor integrity. In contrast to <italic>tadr<sup>2</sup></italic>, <italic>tadr<sup>1</sup></italic> is a point mutation generated via EMS mutagenesis. As EMS creates random mutations throughout the genome, mutations in other loci may cause the retinal degeneration phenotype. It is also be possible the <italic>tadr<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant is a neomorphic allele. We explain this point in the manuscript as:</p><p>“The neurodegeneration phenotype observed in <italic>tadr<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants may be due to other mutations generated by EMS mutagenesis or the neomorphic <italic>tadr<sup>1</sup></italic> point mutation, which may disrupt Gq signaling.”</p><p>Please see our discussion for details.
