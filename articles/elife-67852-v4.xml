Our data thus support contemporaneous imports of EA1 and EA2 in the late 1980s or early 1990s, shortly after the emergence of H58 in South Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2015</xref> (circa 1982, 95% HPD 1974–1990), and show that both lineages have persisted and diversified locally alongside one another in the intervening decades. H58 sublineage EA3 was introduced later (we estimate that the Kenyan mrca existed circa ~2012 [95% HPD 2009 to 2014]), and consistent with this the lineage displays less diversity and accounts for a smaller fraction of cases and controls (11%). The topology of our global phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggests that South Asia is the most likely origin of EA3 (as it is for EA1 and EA2), and that EA3 appears to have spread between Uganda and Kenya. This in line with multiple reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feasey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2018</xref> of H58 strains spreading through East Africa, mainly arising from intracontinental and transcontinental travel and concomitant risk factors associated with WASH conditions.</p><p>The sublineages of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi H58 in Kenya exhibit different antibiotic resistance profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Notably, EA1 has a large Kenyan sublineage of MDR strains with IncHI1 plasmids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2018</xref> (which are commonly associated with outbreaks in East Africa and Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holt et al., 2011</xref>) but also a Kenyan sublineage with chromosomally integrated MDR. Chromosomal integration of MDR has not previously been reported in <italic>S</italic>. Typhi from Kenya (see supplementary data), but has been reported in Malawi and Tanzania <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2015</xref> and our new data suggests that the variant may have been transferred to these locations from Kenya (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). MDR H58 isolates are now widespread across East Africa, having been detected in Malawi, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Mozambique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feasey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ingle et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>The three East African lineages differed markedly in their patterns of mutations conferring Decreased Ciprofloxacin Susceptibility (DCS). GyrB-S464F was conserved among all EA2, whereas all EA3 isolates carried the GyrA-S83Y mutation. The GyrA-S464F mutation was also detected at low frequency in EA1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This data indicates that ciprofloxacin resistance has been selected independently multiple times and is ongoing. Increasing rates of ciprofloxacin resistance have also been observed following similar introductions of H58 elsewhere in East Africa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2018</xref>, and likely reflect a change in treatment practise following widespread dissemination of MDR <italic>S</italic>. Typhi elsewhere including South and Southeast Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Britto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Britto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>The different <italic>S</italic>. Typhi lineages appeared to be fairly evenly distributed between both acute cases and carriers, with the most common subgroup (EA2) accounting for 46% of acute cases and 50% of carriers. Similarly, all <italic>S</italic>. Typhi genotypes were identified throughout the study period and spatially across the study site, with most case/carrier monthly counts and geographic regions containing a diversity of genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data therefore provides no evidence for major point-source single-genotype outbreaks, but is consistent with persistent contamination of water supplies with multiple <italic>S. Typhi</italic> genotypes. Higher temperatures were associated with lower <italic>S. Typhi</italic> case and carrier counts, however, no association with high rainfall was observed among our culture data. These findings are in line with previous studies focusing on seasonal trends in nearby Kibera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breiman et al., 2012</xref>. However, they contrast with trends previously observed in other settings including Malawi, where higher temperatures and rainfall were associated with increased risk of disease albeit with a time lag of multiple months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thindwa et al., 2019</xref>, and South Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dewan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kanungo et al., 2008</xref>.</p><p>In our phylogenetic trees, branch lengths and SNP counts can be interpreted as measures of evolutionary time, and thus terminal branches and isolate-specific SNP counts as a measure of time since that isolate shared a mrca with another sampled isolate. This total time includes (i) time from mrca to the acquisition of infection in the sampled host, plus (ii) time from initial acquisition of the infection to time of sampling (ie time within the sampled host). Variation in the latter is more likely to be explained by the symptom status of the sampled host (rather than the former which occurs prior to the infection of the sampled host). Hence the higher mean branch lengths and SNP counts in asymptomatic controls is consistent with the expectation that carriers have had, on average, a longer duration from acquisition of the infection to sampling in the clinic (which is triggered by routine visits and unrelated to symptoms or colonisation status), compared to acute cases who are presenting due to febrile illness triggered by a recently acquired S. Typhi infection. This supports the interpretation that <italic>S</italic>. Typhi-positive controls identified in this study represent genuine medium- to long-term typhoid carriers, rather than simply reflecting transient presence in the gut. The greater diversity observed here amongst controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) further supports this interpretation. Longer branch lengths among carrier samples were also observed in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thanh Duy et al., 2020</xref> of <italic>S</italic>. Typhi isolated from bile samples from the gallbladders of cholecystectomy patients in Nepal. The differences in terminal branch lengths were non-significant in our study, possibly reflecting low statistical power or, perhaps less likely, that our control data constitute a mix of multiple carriage types including convalescent (3 weeks to 3 months), temporary (3e to 12 months), and chronic (more than 1 year) carriers. Also in line with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thanh Duy et al., 2020</xref>, our analyses provide evidence of positive selection among carriage isolates, with a higher proportion of non-synonymous mutations detected among carriers in specific biological pathways including surface polysaccharides and antigens, transport/binding proteins, and anaerobic respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp13">Supplementary file 13</xref>). This is exemplified in the genes encoding surface antigens, notably those responsible for biosynthesis of Vi capsule and O-antigen lipopolysaccharide.</p><p>Our study is not without limitations, firstly, our data are from a single informal settlement community in Nairobi, and thus may not be representative of the overall population structure and AMR patterns of typhoid in Kenya more broadly, or in older age groups. Similarly, our sample size yielded a relatively small number of isolates for WGS, and we thus lack statistical power for some genetic analyses.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study is the first case-control study to identify and sequence both typhoid carriers and cases contemporaneously in an endemic community setting. High rates of AMR among both infection types in Kenya combined with high carriage and case rates, especially in the younger age groups, highlight the need for enhanced AMR and genomic surveillance in this region to inform both treatment guidelines and control strategies that keep pace with the local evolution and spread of AMR. Intervention strategies are urgently needed including the introduction of the new Vi conjugate vaccine in a programme that includes targeting of paediatric age groups in the short term, and improvements to WaSH infrastructure in the long term.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: The study was approved by the Scientific and Ethics Review Unit (SERU) of the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) (Scientific Steering Committee No. 2076).

Typhi H58 into Kenya based on the 239 available genomes (n = 128 from this study, and n = 111 from previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong et al., 2016</xref>), we used several methods. First, we used TempEst (v1.5.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rambaut et al., 2016</xref> to assess temporal structure (i.e. clock-like evolution) by conducting a regression analysis of the root-to-tip branch distances of the ML tree as a function of sampling date (expressed as decimal years at a resolution of days), using the heuristic residual mean squared method with the best fitting root selected. To estimate divergence dates for the three <italic>S</italic>. Typhi H58 sublineages we detected in Kenya (EA1-3), we used BEAST (v1.10) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suchard et al., 2018</xref> to fit a phylodynamic model to the SNP alignment and isolation dates (as decimal years at a resolution of days). Note that as EA1-3 almost exclusively comprise Kenyan strains in the global H58 tree and the parent node for each of EA1-3 is the parent node for all Kenyan isolates of EA1-3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), the divergence dates for the EA1-3 parent nodes in the tree of 239 Kenyan isolates is taken as the divergence date for each of EA1-3 generally, as well as the lower bound for the date of introduction of each of these sublineages into Kenya.</p><p>We ran separate models using constant-coalescent population size and Bayesian skyline tree priors, in combination with a strict clock model or a relaxed (uncorrelated log normal distribution) clock model, to identify the best fitting model for our data. For BEAST analyses the GTR+Γ substitution model was selected, and sampling times (tip dates) were used to calibrate the molecular clock (for isolates collected in this study the precise day of isolation was used; for the previously published genomes, only the isolation year was known, so tip dates were assigned to the first of July for that year with an uncertainty of 0.5 years). For all tree prior and model combinations, a chain length of 100,000,000 steps with sampling every 5,000 steps was used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duchene et al., 2016</xref>. The relaxed (uncorrelated lognormal) clock model, that allows for evolutionary rate variations among branches of the tree and the constant-coalescent model were found to best fit our data. To assess the temporal signal of these Bayesian estimates, we conducted a date-randomisation test where sampling times were assigned randomly to the sequences, and the analysis re-run 20 times with the best fitting models (constant-coalescent demographic and uncorrelated lognormal clock) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duchene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Firth et al., 2010</xref>. The date-randomisation test revealed that these data displayed ‘strong’ temporal structure (meeting the criterion CR2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duchene et al., 2016</xref>). Our preliminary BEAST runs resulted in implausible tree topologies and dated the most recent common ancestor (mrca) of H58 <italic>S</italic>. Typhi in Kenya ~ 1927 (95% highest posterior density = 1847–1984), conflicting with previously inferred divergence dates for the emergence of H58 (5,7,26). Fixing the tree topology to that obtained from ML inference yielded more plausible date estimates (~1968, 95 % HPD = 1957–1977), however, sampling from the prior (without the sequence alignment) using the same model showed that this estimate was driven entirely by the priors provided to the model, with no information contributed by the sequence data. Taken together, these preliminary analyses suggested that while a temporal signal is present in the alignment, the signal is weak and would benefit from the specification of sensible priors to calibrate the root height. Previous analyses of the H58 divergence date, inferred using global data spanning a wider sampling period and with stronger temporal signal, estimate it emerged circa 1989 (95% HPD, 1981–1995) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2015</xref>, and we have previously reported the presence of H58 lineage one in Kenya in the late 1980s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kariuki et al., 2010</xref>. We therefore specified a log-normally distributed root height prior with mean 1989 and standard deviation 4 years. Use of this root height prior (without fixing the tree topology) yielded a plausible tree topology (i.e. consistent with the outgroup-rooted maximum likelihood tree inferred from the same alignment, with the expected separation of H58 sublineages into monophyletic clades), showed evidence of temporal signal (via date randomisation testing), and was not driven by priors alone; hence this approach was used for the final analyses presented here.</p><p>For the final analyses, 2 independent runs each conducted with a chain length of 100,000,000 steps sampling every 5,000 iterations were combined using LogCombiner (v1.10.0) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suchard et al., 2018</xref>, after removing the first 10% of steps from each as ‘burn-in’.

Typhi H58 lineage II (genotype 4.3.1.2) isolates from our study belonged to two distinct clades of the global phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which were each exclusively populated by East African isolates. The largest of these clades (n = 80 isolates, of which 81.3 % derive from the current study) formed a monophyletic group in which isolates from this study were intermingled with those obtained from previous studies in Kenya (n = 14, 17.5%), and a single Tanzanian strain isolated in 2012 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggestive of a single inter-country transmission event from Kenya into Tanzania. This clade is nested within a deeper clade of diverse South Asian isolates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), and corresponds to the previously reported introduction of H58 lineage II into Kenya from South Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2018</xref>.

The smaller East African H58 lineage II clade (n = 43 isolates) comprised two sister clades, separated by ≥13 SNPs, one involving isolates from Kenya (n = 13, all from this study) and the other isolates from Uganda (n = 30, which accounted for 100 % of the typhoid burden at the Ugandan site in the TSAP study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park et al., 2018</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Both EA2 and EA3 genotypes have been added to the GenoTyphi scheme.</p><p>The three East African H58 subgroups circulating in our setting all had high rates of MDR (84%, 74% and 94%, respectively); however in EA2, MDR was exclusively associated with the PST6-IncHI1 plasmid, and in EA3 exclusively with the chromosomal insertion (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). In EA1, most MDR was associated with the PST6-IncHI1 plasmid. However, a subclade of isolates (associated with spread to Tanzania and Malawi) carried the chromosomal insertion instead (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Chromosomal integration of MDR strains has not previously been reported in <italic>S</italic>.

Interestingly, MDR in the Ugandan subclade of EA3 was associated with the IncHI1-PST6 plasmid, suggesting that migration of the transposon from plasmid to chromosome may have occurred in situ in Kenya after divergence from the Ugandan branch. The three East African lineages also differed markedly in their patterns of mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones: GyrB-S464F was conserved among all EA2, whereas all EA3 isolates carried the GyrA-S83Y mutation, and three distinct GyrA mutations, and the GyrA-S464F mutation were detected at low frequency in EA1 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67852.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Lewnard</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of California Berkeley</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Cowley</surname><given-names>Lauren</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Senghore</surname><given-names>Madikay</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health</institution></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.03.10.434750">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.10.434750v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The findings highlight the role of asymptomatic carriage in the spread, drug-resistance mechanisms and the emergence of typhoid strains in Kenya. The authors also contribute a small number of sequences from both carriage and acute disease, most sequenced cases are associated with acute disease, making this deposit of publicly available carriage sequences extremely valuable. This work will be of interest to a broad readership, including but not limited to clinicians, biologists, and public health experts.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Multiple introductions of multidrug-resistant typhoid associated with acute infection and asymptomatic carriage, Kenya&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Most recommendations from the reviewers are for clarifications; a modest list of suggested analyses for the revision follows before the public reviews and evaluation summary:</p><p>1) One major factor that is overlooked in the investigation, is the sampling of acute cases both from blood and fecal culture. In the reviewers' opinion, these should be considered as separate conditions and separate sample types (so not grouped together for some of the analysis.) This would affect results in figure 5 that could be further separated out into three groups; controls, enteric cases and invasive cases. It might be expected that positive selection had happened in the differing environments of the acute cases, either in invasive blood cultured specimens or enteric fecal cultured specimens that could be investigated and detailed (see further details on this point in the comments from Reviewer 2)</p><p>(2) Another aspect of the paper that could have borne more scrutiny was the PTS6-IncHI1 plasmid present in two of the east African lineages. Although short read sequencing limits its resolution or the level of comparative analysis possible, some attempt at comparing the short reads generated in this study to previously published full sequences of PTS6-IncHI1 plasmids in H58 Typhi would be warranted. This could inform horizontal transfer of this plasmid and whether these plasmids sampled in two separate lineages in the same location contemporaneously were highly similar or not.</p><p>(3) The authors rightly mention that recombinant regions were excluded in the genomes prior to phylogenetic tree construction. The reviewers wondered if the phylogenies with and without recombinant regions filtered out could be compared. This would provide a sense of the overall impact of recombination in the evolution of the S. Typhi strains. Also, it's not clear if the recombination events removed in the phylogeny of only Kenyan isolates, specific clades and global isolates. Considering that Gubbins was developed to identify recombination events in clonal bacterial population, the authors should comment on whether it is appropriate to run the analysis using a diverse global dataset. It would also be great to mention the recombination rate inferred from Gubbins.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I really enjoyed reading this paper and think that, on the whole, the analysis produced and conclusions drawn are very well justified and carefully prepared. I have just two small suggestions to provide further detail to this paper that I think would be extremely valuable to the readers.</p><p>(1) Separate the acute infections into two groups, those sampled from fecal culture and those from blood culture. This is an important distinction that would be important to the analysis performed to produce figure 5. There could be a distinct signal in NS mutations from the fecal vs. blood acute samples. Furthermore, the carriage fecal and acute fecal samples could have mutations that differentiate them from the blood culture samples or vice versa. Some consideration of this or inclusion of this in your analysis would be worthwhile.</p><p>(2) To interrogate the PTS6-IncHI1 plasmid further, I suggest blasting the contigs from your plasmid-identified samples against previously published and finished PTS6-IncHI1 plasmid sequences. You might be able to piece together more about the content of this plasmid and how similar the PTS6-IncHI plasmids from EA1 are to those from EA2. Otherwise some similar style of analysis that investigates horizontal transfer further.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors present a well written manuscript based on a case contact study of diarrheal aetiology among children in Kenya. They implement robust bioinformatics pipelines and derive conclusions that can guide intervention strategies. Below are some specific comments.</p><p>Line 159 – The authors mentions that for carriers, rectal swabs or stools samples were cultured on selenite F, however, it is not specified whether the isolates from cases were recovered using the same procedures. Please clarify</p><p>Line 185-186. Could the authors explain why there is such a huge discrepancy and how they ensured that this was not the result of sample mix-ups.</p><p>Table 1 – the authors use the results from culture to determine whether there are correlates for S. typhi carriage and disease. Given the discrepancies between the genomic data and the serotyping data why did the authors choose to use the serotyping data instead of the genomic confirmation. Are the results of this analysis reproducible if the genome confirmed data are used instead of the serotyping data?</p><p>Line 406 – The authors present evidence suggesting that higher temperatures were significantly associated with decreased case counts. However, this includes isolates that were not confirmed by sequencing and generally the per month case counts were low. Was there a correlation between weather and the general numbers of patients presenting at the clinic? Additionally, when the unconfirmed isolates are excluded from the analysis does this observation still hold?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67852.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As noted by the reviewers, the authors present a novel and high quality study elucidating further aspects of the role of asymptomatic carriage within typhoid epidemiology and placing East African lineages in the geographic context of introductions from south Asia.

Typhi (see lines 137-141). We include stool culture within this definition because blood culture is known to be only ~50% sensitive (see e.g. Antillon et al. 2018, J Infect Dis, doi: 10.1093/infdis/jiy471), and the presence of febrile illness with culture-proven presence of S. Typhi is generally considered to represent an acute infection as opposed to asymptomatic carriage. However, we agree with the reviewer’s point that for the purposes of examining positive selection in the bacteria, there could potentially be a distinction between selective pressure on isolates recovered from stool vs blood of febrile cases. We have therefore reanalysed the data as suggested and updated Figure 5, which now shows the data stratified into three groups: (i) stool isolates from asymptomatic controls; (ii) blood isolates from febrile cases; and (iii) stool isolates from febrile cases. The results show that, for the functional groups noted in text (surface polysaccharides and lipoproteins), the stool isolates from cases are similar to blood isolates and distinct from stool isolates from asymptomatic carriers.</p><p>We have updated the Results section (lines 548-551) to reflect this:</p><p>“Notably, carriage samples were associated with significantly higher frequencies of terminal-branch NS mutations in genes responsible for the synthesis of surface polysaccharides and antigens (9.3% of carriers vs 1.2% of acute cases (all of which were blood isolates), p=0.043, Fisher’s exact test).

Further, the H58 (4.3.1) genotype is considered a single clone (Wong et al. 2015, Nat Genet, doi: 10.1038/ng.3281; Roumagnac et al. 2006 Science, doi: 10.1126/science.1134933) and thus suitable for recombination filtering using Gubbins. Gubbins analysis of H58 (Kenya or global isolates) consistently identifies two regions of recombination occurring at the root of the H58/genotype 4.3.1 branch (see Phandango screenshot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The first of these spans CT18 (accession AL513382) reference sequence coordinates 954,115–970,731 (genes STY0961-STY0976), and the second spans 1,438,676-1,467,273 (genes STY1485-STY1508). Including these two recombinant patches in the SNP alignment results in lengthening the relevant branch but has no meaningful impact on the inferred relationships between lineages or isolates. Therefore, all phylogenies reported in the manuscript are inferred from the alignment that excludes these gubbins identified regions.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67852-sa2-fig1-v4.tif"/></fig><p>We have updated the Methods section to clarify this (lines 234-245):“Analysis with Gubbins (v2.3.2) identified two regions affected by recombination (coordinates 954,115–970,731 (genes STY0961-STY0976), and 1,438,676-1,467,273 (genes STY1485-STY1508) in the CT18 reference genome), which were excluded from the alignment<sup>40</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I really enjoyed reading this paper and think that, on the whole, the analysis produced and conclusions drawn are very well justified and carefully prepared. I have just two small suggestions to provide further detail to this paper that I think would be extremely valuable to the readers.</p><p>(1) Separate the acute infections into two groups, those sampled from fecal culture and those from blood culture. This is an important distinction that would be important to the analysis performed to produce figure 5. There could be a distinct signal in NS mutations from the fecal vs. blood acute samples. Furthermore, the carriage fecal and acute fecal samples could have mutations that differentiate them from the blood culture samples or vice versa. Some consideration of this or inclusion of this in your analysis would be worthwhile.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment has been addressed as detailed above (please see ‘Essential revisions’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) To interrogate the PTS6-IncHI1 plasmid further, I suggest blasting the contigs from your plasmid-identified samples against previously published and finished PTS6-IncHI1 plasmid sequences. You might be able to piece together more about the content of this plasmid and how similar the PTS6-IncHI plasmids from EA1 are to those from EA2. Otherwise some similar style of analysis that investigates horizontal transfer further.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment has been addressed as detailed above (please see ‘Essential revisions’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors present a well written manuscript based on a case contact study of diarrheal aetiology among children in Kenya.

Regardless, we report our results both in terms of sero-identified, and WGS-confirmed, S. Typhi and there is little difference except in terms of sample size and thus statistical power for testing (see Tables 1 and Figure 4—Figure Supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table 1 – the authors use the results from culture to determine whether there are correlates for S. typhi carriage and disease.

We did also show results for linear regression of infection rates on age, stratified by sex, for WGS-confirmed as well as serologically-defined infections, in Table S4 (now Supplementary File 6) which show the same associations.</p><p>However to improve clarity and robustness, we have now added logistic regression analyses for WGS-confirmed S.
