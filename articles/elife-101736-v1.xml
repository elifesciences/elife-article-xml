Recent data support the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) and its projections to the dorsal hippocampal CA1 area (RE→dCA1) in this process. However, it remains poorly understood how RE impacts dCA1 neurons during contextual fear extinction (CFE). Here, we reveal that the RE→dCA1 pathway contributes to the extinction of contextual fear by affecting CFE-induced molecular remodeling of excitatory synapses. Anatomical tracing and chemogenetic manipulation in mice demonstrate that RE neurons form synapses and regulate synaptic transmission in the stratum oriens (SO) and lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) of the dCA1 area, but not in the stratum radiatum (SR). We also observe CFE-specific structural changes of excitatory synapses and expression of the synaptic scaffold protein, PSD-95, in both strata innervated by RE, but not in SR. Interestingly, only the changes in SLM are specific for the dendrites innervated by RE. To further support the role of the RE→dCA1 projection in CFE, we demonstrate that brief chemogenetic inhibition of the RE→dCA1 pathway during a CFE session persistently impairs the formation of CFE memory and CFE-induced changes of PSD-95 levels in SLM. Thus, our data indicate that RE participates in CFE by regulating CFE-induced molecular remodeling of dCA1 synapses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>fear extinction</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016/23/N/NZ4/03304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ziółkowska</surname><given-names>Magdalena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004281</institution-id><institution>Narodowe Centrum Nauki</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020/38/A/NZ4/00483</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radwanska</surname><given-names>Kasia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Confocal and electron microscopy analyses reveal that contextual fear extinction induces structural remodeling of thalamic projections to the CA1 area of the hippocampus.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The distinction between dangerous and safe contexts, as well as the ability to update such information in a changing environment, is crucial for animal survival as mistakes can have costly consequences. Impairments in context-dependent behaviors have been associated with pathological conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lissek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garfinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grodin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maren et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie the updating of contextual memories is crucial for developing new therapeutic approaches to alleviate persistent and unmalleable contextual fear or compulsive context-induced drug seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ji and Maren, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maren and Quirk, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Myers and Davis, 2002</xref>).</p><p>One way to study contextual memories in the laboratory animals is through contextual fear conditioning (CFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maren et al., 2013</xref>). In CFC, a spatial context, referred to as the conditioned stimulus (CS), is repeatedly paired with a noxious unconditioned stimulus (US), typically a mild shock. Freezing behavior serves as a quantifiable measure of contextual fear memory. With continued exposure to the CS in the absence of the US, freezing behavior generally decreases and exploratory behavior increases. This process is termed contextual fear extinction (CFE) and occurs as animals learn over time that the context no longer predicts shocks. For extinction to take place, mice must actively recall and update contextual memories. Therefore, mechanisms must exist in the brain to allow for these processes.</p><p>The classic neuronal circuit of CFE includes medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), amygdala, and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orsini and Maren, 2012</xref>). However, recent data also support the role of the thalamus in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Venkataraman and Dias, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cassel et al., 2013</xref>). In particular, nucleus reuniens (RE), a ventral midline thalamic nucleus, sends axon collaterals to mPFC and the hippocampal CA1 area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoover and Vertes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Varela et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vertes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goswamee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dolleman-Van der Weel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wouterlood et al., 1990</xref>), forming a disynaptic link that can coordinate neural activity between the two structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jayachandran et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Totty et al., 2023</xref>). Activity-dependent brain mapping studies have revealed increased cfos expression in the RE following CFE learning and recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Silva et al., 2019</xref>). Activity of RE is synchronized with freezing bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Silva et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratigan et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that activity patterns in the RE are related to the suppression of fear responses. Indeed, muscimol-induced inactivation of RE following a weak fear conditioning procedure enhances fear memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Troyner et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, inactivation of the RE prior to extinction training prevents extinction learning, while RE inactivation prior to retrieval impairs retrieval of the extinction memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, inactivation of the RE also impairs the precision of contextual fear memories and results in fear generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Troyner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>), a process that requires both the HPC and mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rozeske et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zelikowsky et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that RE is critical for mPFC-HPC synchrony during the retrieval and updating of contextual memories. This hypothesis is supported by recent studies linking RE→dCA1 activity with recall of fear and extinction memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Totty et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratigan et al., 2023</xref>). Still, it remains unknown how RE impacts the dCA1 function to participate in CFE.</p><p>Here, we sought to determine whether the RE→dCA1 projection plays a role in updating context memories and characterize underlying synaptic processes. First, we used chemogenetic manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>) and conducted ex vivo field recordings in mice to analyze the impact of the RE afferents on synaptic transmission in three strata of the hippocampal CA1 area: the stratum oriens (SO), radiatum (SR), and lacunosum-moleculare (SLM). Secondly, we employed virally mediated labeling of RE afferents in Thy1-GFP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2000</xref>) to analyze structural changes of the RE boutons and dendritic spines (as a proxy for glutamatergic synapses) in dCA1 during contextual fear memory extinction. This approach was complemented by serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denk and Horstmann, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Śliwińska et al., 2021</xref>) to analyze structural synaptic changes induced by CFE with nanoscale resolution. Finally, using chemogenetic manipulations, we tested the role of the RE in CFE-induced synaptic changes in dCA1, and the role of RE→dCA1 projection in the CFE. Overall, our data support the notion that the RE→dCA1 pathway contributes to the extinction of contextual fear by affecting CFE-induced molecular synaptic changes in dCA1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assessment of projections from RE to dorsal CA1 area (RE→dCA1)</title><p>To examine RE axons in dCA1 (RE→dCA1), mice were stereotaxically injected into RE with adeno-associated viral vector (isotype 2.1) encoding red fluorescent protein, mCherry, under <italic>camk2a</italic> promoter (AAV<sub>2.1</sub>:camk2a_mCherry) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), resulting in mCherry expression in more than 60% of RE cells spreading from Bregma –0.46 mm to –1.5 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

This combinatorial manipulation enabled hM4Di expression specifically in RE neurons projecting to dCA1 (RE→dCA1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). It is, however, likely that some of these neurons bifurcate and also innervate PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoover and Vertes, 2012</xref>). Mice received i.p. injection of saline or hM4Di agonist (CNO, 3 mg/kg) and were sacrificed 30 min later.

CNO decreased fEPSP in SO and SLM, and tended to decrease FV in SLM. No effect of CNO on these synaptic measures was observed in SR. Hence, our data indicate that RE innervates and efficiently regulates excitatory synaptic transmission in SLM and SO.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Analysis of dCA1 synapses after CFE</title><p>dCA1, RE, as well as RE→dCA1 projections have been implicated in the extinction of contextual fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Venkataraman and Dias, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cassel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Totty et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratigan et al., 2023</xref>).

Similarly in SLM, the density of RE boutons did not differ between the experimental groups. However, the Ext mice had significantly larger RE boutons compared to the 5US animals, and no difference was observed between the Ext and Naive mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Hence, our data suggest that the behavioral training did not affect RE→SO presynapses, while CFC decreased the size of RE→SLM pre-synapses and this process was reversed by CFE.</p><p>To check if the presynaptic changes were coupled with postsynaptic alterations, we analyzed dCA1 dendritic spines in the same mice. We distinguished RE+ dendrites (with at least one dendritic spine in close proximity to RE boutons), RE+/+ dendritic spines (in close proximity to RE bouton), RE+/- spines (located on RE+ dendrites but without detected contact with RE boutons) and RE- dendrites and spines (that did not colocalize with RE boutons within the analyzed tissue brick) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The average length of the analyzed dendritic fragments per tissue brick (67.7 × 67.7 × 5.4 μm) was 50 μm in SO, 53 in SR, and 40 μm in SLM. They contained on average respectively 25, 37, and 32 dendritic spines, including 1–3 RE+/+ in SO and 1–4 RE+/+ in SLM. The analysis of SO found that the density and size of dendritic spines in the Ext group did not differ from those analyzed in the Naive animals. However, the 5US animals tended to have more spines, and these spines were smaller and contained less PSD-95 as compared to those in the Naive and Ext animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a–c</xref>). Interestingly, these spine changes were specific for the RE- dendrites. Hence, CFE reversed synaptic changes on RE- dendrites induced by CFC. On the other hand, we did not observe any CFE-specific changes of RE+/- and RE+/+ spines. However, RE+/- spines in 5US and Ext groups contained less PSD-95 compared to the Naive animals. Hence, our observation confirmed our former findings of CFE-induced synaptic plasticity in SO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziółkowska et al., 2023</xref>) and specified that these global changes result mostly from the alterations of the RE- dendrites. These observations also match the lack of CFE-induced changes on RE buttons in SO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>In SR, we did not observe any significant training-induced changes in density and size of dendritic spines. However, PSD-95 levels per dendritic spine were decreased in the Ext and 5US groups compared to the Naive animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d–f</xref>).</p><p>In SLM, no significant changes in dendritic spine density were observed globally or on RE- dendrites; however, we found increased density of RE+/+ dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref><bold>,</bold> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1g–i</xref>). There were also more RE+/+ spines in the Ext group compared to the 5US animals. Moreover, the median dendritic spine area and PSD-95 expression per dendritic spine were higher in the Ext group compared to 5US animals, and these differences were specific for the RE+ dendrites. Again, no such changes were observed on the RE- dendrites. Hence, in SLM, CFE resulted in synaptogenesis of RE+/+ spines, growth of RE+/+ and RE+/- spines, and accumulation of PSD-95 in RE+/- spines, supporting the idea of CFE-induced strengthening of RE→SLM projections.

However, only in SLM CFE-induced synaptic changes are likely to be directly regulated by RE inputs as they appear on RE+ dendrites and spines. Since such changes of SLM synapses were not observed in the animals re-exposed to the neutral context, our data support the role of the described structural plasticity at the RE→SLM synapses in CFE, rather than in processing contextual information in general. Moreover, as some CFE-specific synaptic changes spread on RE+ dendrite beyond RE+ synapses, our data suggest a more global impact of RE on synaptic plasticity in dCA1. It is, however, important to mention that the analysis of RE- spines and dendrites should be approached with caution due to methodological limitations. We assume that the identification of RE- dendritic spines had only 68% accuracy due to 68% penetrance of mCherry AAV in RE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nanoscale resolution analysis of SLM synapses after CFE</title><p>Next, to verify whether CFE induces the growth of SLM synapses, we utilized SBFSEM.

In particular, these differences seemed to occur among small dendritic spines (volume &lt; 0.04 μm<sup>3</sup>). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the density and volume of macular PSDs, which are usually small, and complex PSDs, which are usually large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borczyk et al., 2021</xref>). Neither density of macular nor complex PSDs differed between the experimental groups. However, the volume of macular, but not complex, PSDs in the Ext group was significantly larger than in the 5US animals. The volumes of PSDs of both categories were larger in the Ext group compared to naive animals.</p><p>Overall, SBFSEM analysis confirmed that CFE results in the growth of SLM dendritic spines and excitatory synapses located on the spines, suggesting their strengthening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Patterson and Yasuda, 2011</xref>). In particular, we observed growth in the category of small macular PSDs, possibly explaining how such synaptic changes could occur so rapidly. No volume changes were observed in complex PSDs in the Ext groups compared to the 5US animals possibly because large synapses are more stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borczyk et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, our correlation analysis for PSDs and dendritic spines demonstrates that the analysis of dendritic spine volumes, as a proxy of synaptic changes, likely underestimates the actual changes of the synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Functional analysis of RE→dCA1 pathway during CFE</title><p>The structural analysis of RE axons and RE+ dendrites in dCA1 suggests that CFE strengthens RE→dCA1 synapses.

Mice underwent CFC, followed by a CFE session (Extinction 1). Next, we tested short-term (Test 1, 2 hr post Extinction 1) and long-term CFE memory (Extinction 2, 24 hr post Extinction 1) as well as fear generalization in the context B (CtxB, 2 hr post Test 2).

They showed, however, no difference in freezing levels in the CtxB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Twenty-one days after the surgery and virus expression, mice underwent CFC, followed by a CFE session and Test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>). During the training, mice had low levels of freezing before US (pre-US) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Freezing levels increased across a CFC session (post-US) and did not differ between the drug groups. Twenty-four hours later, mice received bilateral intra-hippocampal injection of CNO (3 μM) or saline and were re-exposed to the training context (Extinction). In the hM4Di virus group, mice injected with CNO showed higher freezing during the first 5 min of Extinction compared to the mice injected with saline. During Extinction, the freezing level decreased and did not differ between the groups at the end of the session. However, when CFE memory was tested (Test), the hM4Di mice injected with CNO had higher levels of freezing compared to the mice injected with saline. Similarly, as in our former study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tomaszewski et al., 2024</xref>), freezing levels in the control CNO and saline groups differed neither during the CFC, nor during Extinction and Test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results indicate that transient inhibition of RE→dCA1 has no effect on working memory (changes of freezing behavior within CFE session) but impairs both short- and long-term CFE memory even after two CFE sessions.

Here, we demonstrate that RE axons are present in SO and SLM of dCA1 and chemogenetic inhibition of RE impairs excitatory synaptic transmission in both striata. Moreover, we discovered that in the SLM CFE upregulates the levels of synaptic scaffold protein, PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">El-Husseini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kornau et al., 1995</xref>), accompanied by structural plasticity of RE→dCA1 synapses—growth of RE boutons and dendritic spines located on the RE+ dendrites. Finally, chemogenetic inhibition of the RE→dCA1 pathway impaired CFE, while chemogenetic inhibition of RE blocked the CFE-induced expression of PSD-95 in SLM. In summary, our observations support a framework in which the RE→SLM pathway participates in the updating of fearful context value by actively regulating CFE-induced molecular and structural synaptic plasticity in the SLM.</p><p>RE projects to the hippocampal formation and forms asymmetric synapses with dendritic spines and dendrites, suggesting innervation of excitatory synapses on both excitatory and aspiny inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wouterlood et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Herkenham, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kajiwara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vertes et al., 2006</xref>). This conclusion was confirmed by the electrophysiological studies showing that RE modulates function of the pyramidal cells by monosynaptic excitatory and polysynaptic inhibitory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dolleman-Van der Weel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kajiwara et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we observed RE boutons in close apposition to dCA1 dendritic spines containing PSD-95-positive puncta, confirming innervation of the pyramidal neurons via excitatory synapses. The RE axons were found both in SO and SLM of dCA1, with the latter having much bigger boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–G</xref>). Furthermore, we recorded field excitatory synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in dCA1 while chemogenetically inhibiting RE axons. This manipulation decreased fEPSPs both in SO and SLM, and had no effect on this parameter in SR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and K</xref>). Hence, our data supports the notion that RE activity increases excitatory synaptic transmission both in SO and SLM. Since RE projections were described so far only in SLM, the observation of RE axons in SO is surprising. This discrepancy with former studies may stem from the fact that RE axons in SO are thinner and have much smaller boutons compared to SLM. Hence, RE axons in SO are clearly visible only with confocal imaging of high magnification (×100, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C vs. D</xref>). This fact could have been overlooked in the former studies that either used light microscopy or show confocal microphotographs taken with low magnification. Hence, in the future, it will be important to clarify the functional differences between RE→SO and RE→SLM pathways.</p><p>Both formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bliss and Collingridge, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Radwanska et al., 2011</xref>) and extinction of contextual fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziółkowska et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schuette et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stansley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garín-Aguilar et al., 2012</xref>) involve structural synaptic plasticity in dCA1. While most of the former studies focused on training-induced synaptic changes at more remote time points (&gt;2 hr after training), some experiments have demonstrated that behavioral training may result in rapid (&lt;45 min) synapse remodeling, synaptogenesis, and synapse elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziółkowska et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gipson et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gipson et al., 2013b</xref>). In particular, we have previously demonstrated that 30-min-long CFE session induced structural synaptic plasticity in dCA1 pyramidal neurons in a stratum-specific manner, and it was accompanied by phosphorylation of PSD-95 at serine 73 and alterations of PSD-95 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziółkowska et al., 2023</xref>). We also showed that phosphorylation of PSD-95 at serine 73 in dCA1 is required for CFE and CFE-induced structural plasticity of SO synapses. Thus, rapid and PSD-95-dependent structural synaptic plasticity is an important step in the regulation of the dCA1 circuit during CFE. Here, we observed that CFE-induced increase of PSD-95 levels per dendritic spine and morphological changes of dendritic spines occurred in SO and SLM, but not SR, while the changes of dendritic spine density were observed only in SO. Hence, we confirmed the earlier findings. The only minor discrepancy with our former work is the observation of slightly bigger dendritic spines in SLM in the Ext vs. 5US group that we report here. As we assumed that this discrepancy could be a result of small differences between the groups, the analysis was repeated using 3D SBFSEM. We confirmed that the mice in the Ext group had larger dendritic spines in SLM compared to the 5US group. Interestingly, they also had much larger PSDs. Hence, our data indicate the importance of the analysis of structural synaptic plasticity using 3D SBFSEM and indicate that the confocal analysis of dendritic spine volume as a proxy of synaptic changes may underestimate the actual changes of the synapses. So far, coupling of PSD size to spine volume was assumed to be a permanent spine feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arellano et al., 2007</xref>). Uncoupling of PSD and spine volumes was shown to be transient (&lt;7 min) after glutamate uncaging and caused by slower growth of a PSD compared with a spine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>). Here, similarly as in our former studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziółkowska et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borczyk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Śliwińska et al., 2020</xref>), we show that PSD-core growth exceeds dendritic spine growth for at least 30 min. The precise reasons for the correlation between dendritic spine volume and PSD-core volume, and their coupling during synaptic plasticity, remain unknown. Changes in the ratio between these two compartments likely impact the stoichiometry between proteins in the PSD and those in the dendritic spine, influencing the properties of their complexes, long-term synaptic stability, synaptic strength, and dendritic spine sizes.</p><p>In addition, the current study specifies that CFE-induced structural and molecular changes of dendritic spines occur on RE+ dendrites in SLM, and RE- dendrites in SO. In particular, CFE results in spinogenesis of RE+/+ spines and increased median size of RE boutons, RE+/+ and RE+/- spines in SLM. Thus, while former studies linked the behavioral functions of RE with its impact on the coherence of theta oscillations between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griffin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Totty et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ito et al., 2015</xref>), we extend these findings demonstrating the impact of RE on training-induced structural and molecular plasticity of the excitatory synapses in dCA1 that participates in CFE.</p><p>Although RE+/+ dendritic spines are sparse in dCA1 (based on mCherry AAV penetrance in RE and frequency of RE+/+ dendritic spines in our study, we asses that they constitute 5–6% of all synapses), our findings show that RE has a very significant impact on dCA1 excitatory synapses. In particular, we have observed that chemogenetic inhibition of RE prevents CFE-induced expression of PSD-95 globally in SLM, suggesting the effect of RE on dCA1 synapses that spreads far beyond RE+/+ inputs. Moreover, we observed differential CFE-induced structural synaptic plasticity on RE+/- and RE-/- spines, suggesting heterosynaptic contribution of RE to plasticity of RE+/- dendritic spines. In agreement with these findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dolleman-Van der Weel et al., 1997</xref> demonstrated that RE stimulation produced large negative-going field potentials at SLM, indicative of prominent depolarizing actions on distal apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells. Hence, RE may exert a persistent influence on the state of pyramidal cell excitability, depolarizing cells to close to threshold for activation by other excitatory inputs. Consistent with this, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertram and Zhang, 1999</xref> compared the effects of stimulation of the RE with stimulation of the CA3 region of the hippocampus on population responses at CA1 and reported that RE actions on CA1 were in some cases considerably greater than those of CA3 on the CA1. Moreover, intra-RE infusions of ketamine and muscimol bidirectionally regulate neuronal firing and delta power in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang and Lisman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Roy et al., 2017</xref>). Altogether, this data indicates that RE may impact general activity of CA1 neurons. Although the mechanism is poorly understood, the regulation of synaptic protein expression, including PSD-95, beyond RE+/+ synapses is likely important. In addition, the effects of RE on synaptic levels of PSD-95 may affect the integration of information from other dCA1 inputs that regulate CFE, such as the entorhinal cortex or CA3 area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldi and Bucherelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldi and Bucherelli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bevilaqua et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ji and Maren, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The former studies demonstrated the role of the RE in fear memory encoding, retrieval, extinction, and generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramanathan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Troyner and Bertoglio, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramanathan and Maren, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vasudevan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vetere et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, recent work has shown the role of the RE→dCA1 pathway in extinction of contextual fear and recall of CFE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Totty et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratigan et al., 2023</xref>). In agreement with these findings, inhibition of the RE→dCA1 neurons and RE axons in dCA1 blocked the formation of fear extinction memory in our experiments. In addition, we observed that transient chemogenetic inhibition of RE→dCA1 during the first fear extinction session resulted in impaired extinction not only during the short- and long-term CFE memory test but also throughout the entire second extinction session. This persistent impairment of CFE alludes to long-term extinction impairment induced by PSD-95 mutation in dCA1 observed in our former study. We found that contextual fear memory cannot be updated by the animals with dCA1 phosphorylation-deficient PSD-95(S73A) mutation even if they undergo six 30 min CFE sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziółkowska et al., 2023</xref>). Hence, our data support the framework in which CFE-induced and PSD-95-dependent synaptic plasticity in dCA1 is necessary to reconsolidate and link the memories of contextual fear and CFE in order to persistently suppress contextual fear. The need for interaction between these two memory traces for fear extinction to occur, and the contribution of RE in this process, was also suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Totty et al., 2023</xref>. The RE-regulated synaptic alterations of PSD-95 levels that spread far beyond RE+/+ synapses may facilitate integration of contextual fear and CFE information that are likely generated by different dCA1 inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldi and Bucherelli, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldi and Bucherelli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bevilaqua et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ji and Maren, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we assume that the integration of all inputs to dCA1, conveying different aspects of the cognitive process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldi and Bucherelli, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bevilaqua et al., 2006</xref>), is required for optimal extinction of contextual fear.</p><p>Previous work has found that RE is necessary for proper discrimination of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>), and reductions in context discrimination might result in a relapse of fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bouton and Bolles, 1979</xref>). However, more recent studies showed that the activity of RE axons in CA1 is not contextually modulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ratigan et al., 2023</xref>) and that 8 Hz stimulation of RE does not impair context recognition, although it affects recall of CFE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Totty et al., 2023</xref>). We also see neither significant changes of RE+/+ synapses upon exposure to neutral context nor impairments of context recognition after chemogenetic inhibition of RE→CA1. Hence, our work supports the notion that impaired fear extinction upon RE inactivation is a result of deficits in memory integration, rather than impaired recognition of the extinction context.</p><p>Overall, our study illustrates a novel synaptic mechanism that participates in updating of contextual fear memories. This mechanism involves structural and molecular synaptic plasticity of the RE→dCA1 projections as well as global changes of PSD-95 levels in dCA1 area. Since memories may be repeatedly reorganized upon recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nader et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schafe et al., 2001</xref>), the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in extinction of the existing fearful, aversive, or appetitive memories provide excellent targets for memory impairment therapies. In particular, understanding the mechanisms that underlie CFE may be relevant for post-traumatic stress disorder treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The Thy1-GFP(M) (The Jackson Laboratory, JAX:007788, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:007788">IMSR_JAX:007788</ext-link>) mutant mice were bred as heterozygotes at Nencki Institute and PCR genotyped (The Jackson Laboratory protocol).

We took microphotographs (16 bit, z-stacks of 20–48 scans; 260 nm z-steps) of six secondary dendrites per region per animal from SO, SR, and SLM (in the middle of the strata) of dCA1 pyramidal neurons (AP, Bregma from –1.7 to 2.06). The images were processed and analyzed semi-automatically as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ziółkowska et al., 2023</xref>). All image Z-stacks were first processed with Huygens Professional deconvolution software to reduce background and extract all relevant information from this image series in a statistically reliable way. The RE+ and RE- dendrites were identified by visual inspection of Z-stacks of images in three channels (mCherry [axons], GFP [dendrites], and αPSD-95 [excitatory synapse scaffolding]) and Colocalization Highlighter function (ImageJ 1.52n). Colocalizations were identified on individual confocal planes. RE+ dendrites were defined as dendrites with at least one RE→CA1 synapse (physical apposition of signals in all three channels and colocalizations identified with Colocalization Highlighter function [ImageJ 1.52n] in at least one confocal plane) within the analyzed Z-stack. Next, Z-stacks were transferred into maximal projections to analyze dendritic spines (area and linear density), PSD-95+ puncta (mean gray value of PSD-95+ signal per dendritic spine) and axonal boutons (linear density and area).

In and of itself, this is not a new finding. Yet, the potential novelty and excitement comes from the authors' identification of structural alterations from RE projecting neurons to the specific stratum lacunosum moleculare subregion of CA1 after learning. The authors use a range of anatomical and functional approaches to demonstrate structural synaptic changes in dorsal CA1 that parallel the necessary role of RE inputs in modulating extinction learning. The significance of these findings was previously hampered by several technical shortcomings in the experimental design and interpretation. The authors adequately addressed some of the design concerns raised in the previous round, along with the interpretive critique that they couldn't localize the timing of effects to consolidation as originally claimed. Nevertheless, the authors provided an inadequate response to the concern regarding their misapplication of Ns and missing controls in one experiment.</p><p>In the previous review, a major methodological weakness in the experimental design involved the widespread misapplication of Ns used for the statistical analyses. Much of the anatomical analyses of structural synaptic changes in the RE-CA1 pathway used N = number of axons (Figs. 1, 2), N = number of dendrites (Figs. 3, 4), and N = number of sections (Fig. 7). In each instance it was recommended that N = animal number should be used. Reasons for this are as follows: this is standard practice in neuroanatomical research; using N = branch/ dendrite/ bouton/ spine number artificially inflates the statistical power and this incorrectly assumes independence of observations; using N = number of sections, etc., doesn't account for imbalances in the number of observations that vary from animal to animal that may skew group results.</p><p>In the authors' response, they generally concurred, but then they followed up with the defense that the number of items was too few in some cases, or absent in others, to permit using N = animal number. While they changed some of their data to N = animal numbers, other aspects of their data remained as-is. The description of the statistics in the figure legend is also dense and difficult to follow in places. Ns should be checked in the legend and figure to make sure they're correct, as at least one error was noted (e.g., see Fig. 2C). Overall, the authors' response falls short of the standard of rigor that helps to reinforce scientific findings from reliability and reproducibility concerns when generating more data to increase Ns (i.e., the number of animals) would have been the better choice.</p><p>Another persistent concern from the previous review is that, in the electron microscopic analyses of dendritic spines (Fig. 5), the authors only compared fear acquisition versus extinction training. One critique was that the lack of inclusion of a naïve control group made it difficult to understand how these structural synaptic changes are occurring relative to baseline. It was also noted that the authors appropriately included naïve controls in other experiments in the paper. In the revised submission the authors simply added in naïve control data to their previous histogram. It is not considered good practice to collect, process, or analyze data one group at a time, as this would be prone to cohort effects or experimental bias. These data should be discarded and the experiment should be run correctly with randomized cases in each group, or instead these data should be eliminated from the report since there is a key control group missing. Again, the nature of the authors' response perpetuates the aforementioned concern that data collection and analysis in this report may fall short of an acceptable standard of rigor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101736.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Ziółkowska et al. characterize the synaptic mechanisms at the basis of the RE-dCA1 contribution to the consolidation of fear memory extinction. In particular, they describe a layer specific modulation of RE-dCA1 excitatory synapses modulation associated to contextual fear extinction which is impaired by transient chemogenetic inhibition of this pathway.

In and of itself, this is not a particularly new finding, although the authors' identification of structural alterations from within dorsal CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) as a candidate mechanism for the learning-related plasticity is potentially novel and exciting. The authors use a range of anatomical and functional approaches to demonstrate structural synaptic changes in dorsal CA1 that parallel the necessary role of RE inputs in modulating extinction learning. Yet, the significance of these findings is substantially limited by several technical shortcomings in the experimental design, and the authors' central interpretation. Otherwise, there remain several strengths in the design and interpretation that offset some of these concerns.</p><p>Given that much is already known about the role of RE and hippocampus in modulating fear learning and extinction, it remains unclear whether addressing these concerns would substantially increase the impact of this study beyond the specific area of speciality. Below, several major weaknesses will be highlighted, followed by several miscellaneous comments.</p><p>Methodological:</p><p>(1) One major methodological weakness in the experimental design involves the widespread misapplication of Ns used for the statistical analyses. Much of the anatomical analyses of structural synaptic changes in the RE-CA1 pathway use N = number of axons (Figs. 1, 2), N = number of dendrites (Figs. 3, 4), and N = number of sections (Fig. 7; note that there are 7 figures in total). In every instance, N = animal number should be used. It is unclear which of these results would remain significant if N = animal number were used in each or how many more animals would be required. This is problematic since these data comprise the main evidence for the authors' central conclusion that specific structural synaptic changes are associated with fear extinction learning.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with the reviewer that N = animal number is the preferred way to present data in most of our experiments. However, in some experimental groups we observed a very low number of entries. For example, in the 5US group we found RE+/+ spines only in 3 out of 6 analyzed animals. We believe that this observation is not due to technical problems as mCherry virus transduction required to find RE+/+ spines is similar in all experimental groups and we analyzed similar volumes of tissue. While this result still allows the calculation of density of RE+/+ spines per animal it generates no entries for spine area and PSD95 mean gray value if N = animal number. Hence, we decided to use N=animals to calculate spines and boutons densities, and N=dendritic spines/boutons to calculate other spine/bouton parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There is a lack of specific information regarding what constitutes learning with respect to behavioral freezing. It is never clearly stated what specific intervals are used over which freezing is measured during acquisition, extinction, and in extinction retrieval tests. Additionally, assessment of freezing during retrieval at 5- and 30-min time points doesn't lay to rest the possibility that there were differences in the decay rate over the 30-min period (also see below).</p></disp-quote><p>We added a detailed description of how learning was assessed.</p><p>ln 125-134: “For assessment of learning we used percent of time spent by animals freezing (% freezing). Freezing behavior was defined as complete lack of movement, except respiration. To assess within-session learning (working memory) we compared pre- and post-US freezing frequency (the first 148 sec vs last 30 sec) during the CFC session (day 1). To assess formation of long-term contextual fear memory, we compared pre-US freezing (day 1) and the first 5 minutes of the Extinction session (day 2). To assess within session contextual fear extinction we ran 2-way ANOVA to assess the effect of time and manipulation on freezing frequency. Freezing data were analyzed in 5-minute bins. To assess formation of long-term contextual fear extinction memory we compared the first 5 minutes of the Extinction session (day 2) and Test session (day 3).”</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we also added data for all six 5-minut bins of Extinction sessions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) A minor-to-moderate methodological weakness concerns the authors' decision to utilize saline injected groups as controls for the chemogenetics experiments (Figs. 5, 6). The correct design is to have a CNO-only group with the same viral procedure sans hM4Di. This concern is partly mitigated by the inclusion of a CNO vs. saline injection control experiment (Fig. 6).</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5 does not describe a chemogenetic experiment.</p><p>We added new groups with control virus (CNO vs saline) to Figure 6 (now Fig. 6D and H).</p><p>The chemogenetic experiment shown on Figure 7 has all 4 experimental groups (Control vs hM4Di and saline vs CNO).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In the electron microscopic analyses of dendritic spines (Fig. 5), comparison of only the fear acquisition versus extinction training, and the lack of inclusion of a naïve control group, makes it difficult to understand how these structural synaptic changes are occurring relative to baseline. It is noteworthy that the authors utilize the tripartite design in other anatomical analyses (Fig. 2-4).</p></disp-quote><p>We added data for the Naive mice to Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Interpretation:</p><p>The main interpretive weakness in the study is the authors' claim that their data shows a role for the RE-CA1 pathway in memory consolidation (i.e., see Abstract). This claim is based on the premise that, although RE-CA1 pathway inactivation with CNO treatment 30 min prior to contextual fear extinction did not affect freezing at 5- and 30-min time points relative to saline controls, these rats showed greater freezing when tested on extinction retrieval 24 h thereafter. First, the data do not rule out possible differences in the decay rate of freezing during extinction training due to CNO administration. Next, the fact that CNO is given prior to training still leaves open the possibility that acquisition was affected, even if there were not any frank differences in freezing. Support for this latter possibility derives from the fact that mice tested for extinction retrieval as early as 5 min after extinction training (Fig. 6C) showed the same impairments as mice tested 24 h later (Figs. 6A). Further, all the structural synaptic changes argued to underlie consolidation were based on analysis at a time point immediately following extinction training, which is too early to allow for any long-term changes that would underlie memory consolidation, but instead would confer changes associated with the extinction training event.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with the reviewer that our data do not allow us to conclude whether RE-CA1 pathway is involved in acquisition or consolidation of CFE memory. Therefore, we avoid those terms in the manuscript. We just conclude that RE→CA1 participates in the CFE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Ziółkowska et al. characterize the synaptic mechanisms at the basis of the REdCA1 contribution to the consolidation of fear memory extinction.

First, they show that RE neurons send excitatory projections to the stratum oriens (SO) and the stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM), but not the stratum radiatum (SR). After context fear conditioning, the synaptic connections between RE and dCA1 neurons in the SLM (but not the SO) are weakened (reduced bouton and spine density) after mice undergo context fear conditioning. This weakening is reversed by extinction learning, which leads to enhanced synaptic connectivity between RE inputs and dendrites in the SLM. Control experiments demonstrate that the observed changes are due to extinction and not caused by simple exposure to the context. Extinction learning also induced increases in the size (volume and surface area) of the post-synaptic density (PSD) in SLM. To establish the functional role of RE inputs to dCA1, the researchers used an inhibitory DREADD to silence this pathway during extinction learning. They observe that extinction memory (measured 2-hours or 24-hours later) is impaired by this inhibition. Control experiments show that the extinction memory deficit is not simply due to increased freezing caused by inactivation of the pathway or injections of CNO. Inhibiting the RO projection during extinction learning also reduced the levels of PSD-95 protein levels in the spines of dCA1 neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Based on their results, the authors conclude that, &quot;the RE→SLM pathway participates in the updating of fearful context value by actively regulating CFE-induced molecular and structural synaptic plasticity in the SLM.&quot;. I believe the data are generally consistent with this hypothesis, although there is an important control condition missing from the behavioral experiments.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) A defining feature of extinction learning is that it is context specific (Bouton, 2004). It is expressed where it was learned, but not in other environments. Similarly, it has been shown that internal contexts (or states) also modulate the expression of extinction (Bouton, 1990). For example, if a drug is administered during extinction learning, it can induce a specific internal state. If this state is not present during subsequent testing, the expression of extinction is impaired just as it is when the physical context is altered (Bouton, 2004). It is possible that something similar is happening in Figure 6. In these experiments, CNO is administered to inactivate the RE-dCA1 projection during extinction learning. The authors observe that this manipulation impairs the expression of extinction the next day (or 2-hours later). However, the drug is not given again during the test. Therefore, it is possible that CNO (and/or inactivation of the RE-dCA1 pathway) induces a state change during extinction that is not present during subsequent testing. Based on the literature cited above, this would be expected to disrupt fear extinction as the authors observed. To determine if this alternative explanation is correct, the researchers need to add groups that receive CNO during extinction training and subsequent extinction testing. If the deficits in extinction expression reported in Figure 6 result from a state change, then these groups should not exhibit an impairment. In contrast, if the authors' account is correct, then the expression of extinction should still be disrupted in mice that receive CNO during training and testing.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with the reviewer that such an experiment would be interesting. However, it could be also confusing as we could not distinguish whether the possible behavioral effects are related to the state-dependent aspects of CFE or impaired recall of CFE. Importantly, previous studies showed that RE is crucial for extinction recall (Totty et al., 2023). We also show that CFE memory is impaired not only when the animals recall CFE without CNO (day 3) but also with CNO (day 4) (Figure 6C). Moreover, we do not see the effects of CNO on CFE in the control groups (Figure 6D and H). So we believe that it is unlikely that CNO results in state-dependent CFE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In their analysis of dCA1 synapses after contextual fear extinction (CFE) (Figure 4), the authors should have compared Ctx and Ctx-Ctx animals against naïve animals (as they did in Figure 3) when comparing 5US and Ext with naïve animals. Otherwise, the authors cannot make the following conclusion; &quot;since changes of SLM synapses were not observed in the animals exposed to the familiar context that was not associated with the USs, our data support the role of the described structural plasticity at the RE→SLM synapses in CFE, rather than in processing contextual information in general.&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the key experimental groups to conclude about synaptic plasticity related to particular behavior are the groups that differ just by one factor/experience. For CFE that would be mice sacrificed immediately before and after CFE session (Figure 2 &amp; 3); on the other hand to conclude about the effects of the re-exposure to the neutral context mice sacrificed before and after second exposure to the neutral context are needed (Figure 4). The naive group, as it differs by at least two manipulations from the Ext and Ctx-Ctx groups, is interesting but not crucial in both cases. This group would be necessary if we focused on the memories of FC or novel context. However, these topics are not the main focus of the current manuscript. Still, the naive group is shown on Figures 2 &amp; 3 to check if CFE brings spine parameters to the levels observed in mice with low freezing.</p><p>We have re-written the cited paragraph to be more precise in our conclusions.</p><p>&quot;Overall, our data demonstrate that synapses in all dCA1 strata undergo structural or molecular changes relevant to CFC and/or CFE. However, only in SLM CFE-induced synaptic changes are likely to be directly regulated by RE inputs as they appear on RE+ dendrites and spines. Since such changes of SLM synapses were not observed in the animals re-exposed to the neutral context, our data support the role of the described structural plasticity at the RE→SLM synapses in CFE, rather than in processing contextual information in general.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the materials and methods section, the description of cannula placements is confusing and needs to be rewritten.</p></disp-quote><p>This section has been rewritten.</p><p>ln 103: “Cannula placement.
