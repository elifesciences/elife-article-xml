The various mechanisms by which Cdk5 inhibits and promotes neurodegeneration are still poorly understood. Here, we show that in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Cdk5 regulates basal autophagy, a key mechanism suppressing neurodegeneration. In a targeted screen, Cdk5 genetically interacted with Acinus (Acn), a primarily nuclear protein, which promotes starvation-independent, basal autophagy. Loss of Cdk5, or its required cofactor p35, reduces S437-Acn phosphorylation, whereas Cdk5 gain-of-function increases pS437-Acn levels. The phospho-mimetic S437D mutation stabilizes Acn and promotes basal autophagy. In <italic>p35</italic> mutants, basal autophagy and lifespan are reduced, but restored to near wild-type levels in the presence of stabilized Acn<sup>S437D</sup>. Expression of aggregation-prone polyQ-containing proteins or the Amyloid-β42 peptide, but not alpha-Synuclein, enhances Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of S437-Acn. Our data indicate that Cdk5 is required to maintain the protective role of basal autophagy in the initial responses to a subset of neurodegenerative challenges.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30760.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells have a problem that we recognize from our own homes: if nobody cleans up, garbage accumulates. Unwanted material in cells can include proteins that clump together and can no longer carry out their normal tasks. If left to build up, these protein aggregates can damage the cell and even kill it. Many neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington’s disease and Alzheimer's disease, arise when such faulty proteins accumulate inside brain cells.</p><p>Autophagy is a process that can destroy protein aggregates and other defective material to keep cells healthy. Understanding how cells regulate autophagy is thus of great interest to scientists. A protein called Acinus promotes autophagy and is found in many organisms including fruit flies and humans. All Acinus proteins share a common feature; they contain a site called Serine<sup>437</sup> that can be modified by the attachment of a phosphate group, in a process known as phosphorylation. However, the significance of this modification was not clear.</p><p>Nandi et al. have now asked if this phosphorylation event is important for the role of Acinus in autophagy. The experiments were carried out in the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Flies were engineered such that the normal Acinus protein was replaced with a mutant version that mimics the phosphorylation at Serine<sup>437</sup>. These mutant flies had higher levels of Acinus, showed more autophagy, and lived longer when compared to normal flies.</p><p>Further work identified a protein called Cdk5 as being responsible for attaching phosphate to Acinus at Serine<sup>437</sup>. Making Cdk5 inactive using experimental tools led to lower levels of autophagy in brain cells and shortened the flies’ life span. Moreover, some aggregation-prone proteins linked to neurodegenerative diseases can enhance the activity of Cdk5 towards Acinus, thereby reducing their own accumulation through elevated autophagy.</p><p>Together these findings show that phosphorylation of Acinus by Cdk5 maintains healthy brain cells and improves life span by enhancing autophagy. The next step is to understand how phosphorylation at Serine<sup>437</sup> stabilizes Acinus to boost autophagy. This may lead to new ways to adjust the levels of autophagy to benefit different organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd><kwd>compound eye</kwd><kwd>fat body</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY010199</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krämer</surname><given-names>Helmut</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4900835401-36068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyra</surname><given-names>Lauren K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cdk5-mediated stabilization of Acinus in postmitotic neurons promotes autophagy and the removal of protein aggregates linked to neurodegeneration in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cdk5 shares strong homology with other members of the family of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), but it is distinct in its modes of regulation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhavan and Tsai, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pozo and Bibb, 2016</xref>). Unlike other Cdks, Cdk5 is best known for its function in post-mitotic cells rather than cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dhariwala and Rajadhyaksha, 2008</xref>). In post-mitotic cells, Cdk5 is regulated by binding to its obligatory membrane-associated p35 or p39 co-activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tsai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tang et al., 1995</xref>).

Accordingly, dysregulation of Cdk5 has been observed in numerous brain diseases, including schizophrenia and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engmann et al., 2011</xref>) and neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung and Ip, 2012</xref>). Cdk5 substrates regulating microtubule-based transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klinman and Holzbaur, 2015</xref>) and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lai and Ip, 2015</xref>), have been identified, but the long-term neuroprotective function of Cdk5 activity remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McLinden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy, here short for macroautophagy, is a key cellular process for maintaining the health of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Menzies et al., 2015</xref>). Cytoprotective functions of autophagosomes in neurons include the engulfment and lysosomal delivery of aggregates of misfolded proteins and the disposal of dysfunctional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Green and Levine, 2014</xref>). This protective role of basal autophagy was demonstrated by neuron-specific mutations in autophagy core components: neuronal loss of Atg5 or Atg7 yields rapid neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Komatsu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Juhász et al., 2007</xref>). These findings are consistent with results in mouse and Drosophila models of Huntington’s disease or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) in which elevated autophagy corresponded to reduced loads of aggregated Huntingtin (Htt) protein and ameliorated neuronal phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ravikumar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilen and Bonini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarkar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaiswal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Menzies et al., 2015</xref>). Although the rapid induction of autophagy in response to glucose or amino-acid deprivation is well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galluzzi et al., 2014</xref>), little is known about the modulation of basal levels of autophagy in response to stress caused by protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkenazi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We have previously identified Acinus (Acn) as a novel regulator of basal autophagy in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>). Mammalian Acn had originally been identified as a caspase target aiding in chromatin modifications in apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sahara et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joselin et al., 2006</xref>). In mammalian and <italic>Drosophila cells</italic>, Acn is highly enriched in the nucleus where, together with its binding partners Sap18 and RNPS1, it forms the ASAP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schwerk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murachelli et al., 2012</xref>). ASAP interacts with the exon junction complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tange et al., 2005</xref>) and participates in the regulation of alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schwerk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Malone et al., 2014</xref>). Antagonistic activities of Akt1 kinase and caspase-3 homologs regulate Acn levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2005</xref>) and genetic manipulations that prevent the caspase-mediated cleavage of endogenous Acn in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can elevate its levels in a cell type-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>An unexpected consequence of such elevated Acn was an increase in basal, starvation-independent autophagy. High-level Acn overexpression by the Gal4/UAS system triggers autophagy-dependent death in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberman et al., 2010</xref>). By contrast, Acn levels were modestly increased by the Acn<sup>D527A</sup> mutation that interferes with its Caspase-mediated cleavage or by phospho-mimetic mutations in two AKT1 target sites that reduce this cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>). Such mildly elevated Acn levels yielded elevated basal autophagy with beneficial outcomes including enhanced starvation resistance, prolonged life span and reduced loads of polyQ aggregates in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that similar benefits are gained by phosphorylation of Acn at serine 437. We identify Cdk5 as the kinase which mediates this phosphorylation and show that Cdk5 activity is enhanced in the presence of multiple aggregation-prone proteins, including Huntingtin-Q93 (Htt.Q93), SCA3.Q78, and Amyloid-beta peptide 42 (Aβ42). These findings offer new insights into the complex mechanisms balancing the effects of loss and gain-of-function of Cdk5 on neurodegenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylation of conserved serine 437 stabilizes Acn</title><p>Phosphorylation of conserved C-terminal Akt1-target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) regulates Acn levels in flies and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>).

Here, we show that reduced Cdk5 activity can also reduce neuronal fitness by compromising basal autophagy. We find that the effect of the Cdk5/p35 complex on autophagy depends on its role in phosphorylating the conserved S437 in Acn. Interfering with Acn-S437 phosphorylation, either by loss of Cdk5/p35 function, or by mutation of its target site in Acinus, reduces the level of basal, starvation-independent autophagy and shortens life span. Importantly, these phenotypes were reversed by the phospho-mimetic Acn<sup>S437D</sup> mutation. The beneficial outcomes that result from Acinus stabilization, including the extended lifespan and suppression of polyQ protein accumulation (our data and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>), argue that increases in autophagic flux and autolysosome size in stabilized phospho-mimetic Acn<sup>S437D</sup> mutants are not a response to a proteotoxic stress or reflective of a defect in lysosomal function due to Acn<sup>S437D</sup> expression, but reflect a beneficial activation of autophagy as previously observed in multiple systems (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sarkar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Simonsen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Menzies et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gelino et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, these findings indicate the importance of Cdk5-mediated Acn-S437 phosphorylation for maintaining neuronal health.</p><p>How does phosphorylation of S437 stabilize Acinus and boost its function? One possibility is a reduction in caspase-mediated cleavage of Acinus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sahara et al., 1999</xref>). Inhibition of this cleavage has previously been shown as a consequence of Akt1-mediated Acinus phosphorylation in apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2005</xref>) and also in non-apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>) and furthermore, upon binding of the anti-apoptotic protein AAC11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rigou et al., 2009</xref>). Our data, however, argue against this possibility. We have previously shown that preventing its caspase-mediated cleavage in the Acn<sup>D527A</sup> mutant stabilized Acn only in a subset of photoreceptor cells (predominantly R3 and R4, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, S437 phosphorylation elevates Acinus levels in the majority of photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We thus favor the notion of a different Acn cleavage, closer to the S437 residue. Such a cleavage has been reported for mammalian Acinus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sahara et al., 1999</xref>) at a residue corresponding to A423 in Drosophila Acn. It will be important to identify the protease responsible for this cleavage and test its impact on Acn function.</p><p>In the context of neurodegenerative diseases, much interest has been focused on the aberrant activation of Cdk5. Elevated Cdk5 activity can be induced by multiple stressors such as inflammation, ischemia, or mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Su and Tsai, 2011</xref>). These stressors can trigger pathological activation of Cdk5 by calpain-mediated cleavage of its p35 or p39 co-activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). The cleavage product p25 lacks the myristoylation-tag that anchors activated Cdk5 in complexes with p35 or p39 to membranes and escapes the inhibitory auto-phosphorylation of p35/39 that limits their life time in active complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patrick et al., 1999</xref>). The resulting unrestrained phosphorylation of proteins involved in microtubule-based axonal transport and synaptic proteins contributes to the progression of ALS, Alzheimer’s diseases and other neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McLinden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klinman and Holzbaur, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we observe Cdk5-depedent elevated Acn-S437 phosphorylation in response to the expression of polyQ proteins, but we do not know yet whether this increase reflects elevated Cdk5/p35 activity or pathological Cdk5/p25 activity following calpain-mediated cleavage of p35. Alternatively, the phosphatases that remove the phosphate group from pS437- Acn may be inhibited. Acn-S437 phosphorylation is highly dynamic in developing eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), but phosphatases acting on pS437-Acn have not yet been identified. Interestingly, in addition to multiple polyQ proteins, Aβ42 expression is another <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurodegenerative disease model that triggered elevated phosphorylation of Acn-S437. This is consistent with increased Cdk5 activity reported for multiple Alzheimer’s disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Otth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shah and Lahiri, 2017</xref>) which in turn may contribute to the Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of Tau as a possible contribution to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cruz et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Not all neurodegeneration models induced Cdk5 activity as visualized by Acn-S437 phosphorylation. Pathological Cdk5 activation is believed to contribute to Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, overexpression of alpha-Synuclein, which mimics some aspects of Parkinson’s disease in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kontopoulos et al., 2006</xref>), is not sufficient to increase pS437-Acn levels. Similarly, Acn phosphorylation was unchanged in response to hSOD1 over-expression in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Watson et al., 2008</xref>). Both of these models trigger substantial cellular stress and rapid neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaiswal et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that Acn phosphorylation is not a generic response to cellular stress, but more likely involves specific activation of Cdk5.</p><p>An example of such a specific interaction was recently elucidated in the context of polyQ proteins. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkenazi et al. (2017)</xref> showed that the levels of the autophagy regulator Beclin1 are maintained by its Ataxin3-mediated de-ubiquitination. Their interaction is mediated by the polyQ tract in wild-type Ataxin3 and inhibited by the presence of pathological polyQ tracts known to trigger Huntington’s disease or SCA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkenazi et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, an increasing number of autophagy receptors are being identified that drive selective autophagy of specific cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rogov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khaminets et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, several of these receptors are activated by modifications such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination in response to specific stressors, such as polyQ proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2017</xref>). To which extend such modifications of autophagy receptors contribute to the induction of basal autophagy by Acn remains to be tested.</p><p>Intriguingly, Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation stabilizes Huntingtin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luo et al., 2005</xref>) and thereby may promote its function as a scaffold for selective autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ochaba et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rui et al., 2015</xref>). Cdk5 may thus act through different effectors in different diseases. Endophilin B1 was identified as a Cdk5 substrate, the phosphorylation of which is required for starvation-induced autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wong et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Endophilin B1 appeared necessary for the elimination of dopaminergic neurons in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wong et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, MEKK1 is a key target for Cdk5 in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of retinitis pigmentosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang et al., 2012</xref>). Such diversity of targets may not only apply to different diseases, but also to different stages of a given disease.</p><p>Although the pathological activation of Cdk5 activity appears to be a contributing factor to the progression of some neurodegenerative diseases, we show that wild-type levels of Cdk5/p35 activity are necessary to support basal autophagy in the clearance of protein aggregates. We show that this effect, at least in part, is due to Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Acn as phospho-mimetic Acn<sup>S437D</sup> reverses the reduced basal autophagy and the shortened life span observed in <italic>p35</italic> mutants due their adult-onset, progressive neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Connell-Crowley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Trunova and Giniger, 2012</xref>).</p><p>How does the Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Acn-S437 elevate the level of basal autophagy? We previously have shown that levels of Acn are critical for regulating basal autophagy in an Atg1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>). High Acn levels can drive excessive autophagy, even in the presence of activated mTor, and cause autophagy-dependent lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberman et al., 2010</xref>). More subtle effects resulted when inhibiting caspase-mediated cleavage or phospho-mimetic mutations elevated levels of Acinus expressed from its own promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For example, the phosphorylation of two conserved Akt1-target sites has been shown to elevate Acn levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this stabilized Acn promotes starvation-independent basal autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, we find that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation stabilizes Acn protein and promotes autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), as does the phospho-mimetic Acn<sup>S437D</sup> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Nevertheless, stabilized Acinus proteins do not reach the levels necessary to cause the developmental defects that can be triggered by overexpression through the Gal4/UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear localization of Acn as a Cdk5 substrate seems to be in conflict with the localization of the activated Cdk5/p35 complex to the plasma membrane due the myristoylation of p35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patrick et al., 1999</xref>). However, non-myristoylated p35 and p39 preferentially accumulate in the nucleus and can bind and activate nuclear Cdk5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asada et al., 2008</xref>). How nuclear or possibly cytoplasmic Acn induces autophagy remains unclear. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated Acn proteins are primarily nuclear and neither phosphorylation at S437 nor the two Akt1 target sites S641 and S731 are necessary for starvation-induced autophagy, although they enhance basal autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nandi et al., 2014</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Autophagy is a critical mediator of neuronal cell health. Ongoing basal clearance of aggregated or damaged proteins is associated with protection from neurodegeneration in both flies and humans. Previous studies from the authors identified a role for the Acinus (Acn) protein in promoting basal autophagy. In this manuscript, you provide evidence that Cdk5 genetically interacts with Acn to regulate basal level of autophagy, and that Cdk5 phosphorylates Acn at S437 to modulate its stability. The phospho-mimetic Acn<sup>S437D</sup> promotes basal autophagy and rescues defects (e.g. reduced basal autophagy and shortened life span) of p35 mutants. You further demonstrate enhancement of the Cdk5/Acn-pS437 pathway in response to polyQ protein accumulation. Cdk5 was previously implicated in maintenance of neuronal health. This study identifies Acinus as a relevant target of Cdk5 activity as a compelling basis for this role. Overall, the findings are interesting and potentially important. The experiments are well executed and most conclusions are well supported by the data presented in this work. This manuscript will be suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after appropriate revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In vitro kinase assays with purified proteins to show that Cdk5 kinase can directly phosphorylate Acinus.</p><p>2) The current data does not sufficiently support the conclusion that autophagy activity is induced by S437-Acn. The authors showed that the number of Atg8a puncta and LysoTracker-positive structures is increased in Acn<sup>S437D</sup> larval fat bodies. The autolysosomes in Acn<sup>S437D</sup> larval fat bodies are much larger and more abundant compared to Acn<sup>WT</sup>. The mean diameter of lysosomal/autolysosome structures is even increased more than 8-fold! Inhibition of autophagy at the step of autophagosome maturation and/or degradation results in the same phenotype. Does starvation-induced autophagy also cause accumulation of enlarged autolysosomes in fat bodies? Additional characterization of autophagy flux would strengthen the interpretations of autophagy induction induced by Acn-pS437. This could be achieved with assays using the tandem fluorescent Atg8 reporter and/or Atg8-II levels in animals fed BafilomycinA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30760.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) in vitro kinase assays with purified proteins to show that Cdk5 kinase can directly phosphorylate Acinus.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed two sets of experiments to address this concern.</p><p>First, we prepared GST proteins fused to Acn<sup>402-527</sup> (WT or S437A) and exposed them to phosphorylation with commercially available Cdk5/p35 complexes (Σ; 14-477).

Examples include: (Scott et al., 2004) (Takats et al., 2014) (Takats et al., 2013). Neither of these papers quantified the changes in size from basal to starvations-induced autolysosomes. Importantly, however, all of these papers showed examples of electron micrographs from starved tissues containing large autolysosomes exceeding 1 µm or even 2 µm (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-D</xref> in (Scott et al., 2004); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> in (Takats et al., 2013); or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> in (Takats et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional characterization of autophagy flux would strengthen the interpretations of autophagy induction induced by Acn-pS437. This could be achieved with assays using the tandem fluorescent Atg8 reporter and/or Atg8-II levels in animals fed BafilomycinA.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we performed experiments in which we blocked lysosomal acidification and degradation in larval fat bodies by feeding chloroquine to larvae following a well-established protocol to measure autophagic flux in larval fat bodies (Low et al., 2013; Mauvezin et al., 2014; Lorincz et al., 2017). When staining these chloroquine-treated fat bodies for endogenous ATG8, we observed significant increases in ATG8a punctae and ATG8a signal intensity for wild-type starved or for fed S437D phospho-mimetic mutants consistent with increased autophagic flux (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To keep this figure manageable, we have split the previous <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and separated the analysis of the effects of S437A and S437D mutants on starvation-resistance and longevity into the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>In addition, we like to point out that the beneficial effects endowed by the S437D phospho-mimetic mutation on starvation-resistance (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), longevity (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7M</xref>), and suppression of polyQ protein accumulation (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) would be hard to explain as a consequence of defects in lysosomal degradation or reduced autophagosome maturation. By contrast, these effects are entirely consistent with beneficial effects of increased autophagy in the context of longevity and proteinopathies previously reported by several labs (some of many examples: (Sarkar et al., 2007; Simonsen et al., 2008; Nandi et al., 2014; Menzies et al., 2015; Gelino et al., 2016). We have now addressed this issue in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
