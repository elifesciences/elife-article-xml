helicase involved in the dissolution of complex DNA structures and repair intermediates. Synthetic lethality analysis implicates BLM as a promising target in a range of cancers with defects in the DNA damage response; however, selective small molecule inhibitors of defined mechanism are currently lacking. Here, we identify and characterise a specific inhibitor of BLM’s ATPase-coupled DNA helicase activity, by allosteric trapping of a DNA-bound translocation intermediate. Crystallographic structures of BLM-DNA-ADP-inhibitor complexes identify a hitherto unknown interdomain interface, whose opening and closing are integral to translocation of ssDNA, and which provides a highly selective pocket for drug discovery. Comparison with structures of other RECQ helicases provides a model for branch migration of Holliday junctions by BLM.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Bloom syndrome</kwd><kwd>RECQ</kwd><kwd>Helicase</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>allosteric</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C302/A24386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearl</surname><given-names>Laurence H</given-names></name><name><surname>Oliver</surname><given-names>Antony W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xiangrong</given-names></name><name><surname>Pearl</surname><given-names>Frances MG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105630/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pearl</surname><given-names>Laurence H</given-names></name><name><surname>Pearl</surname><given-names>Frances MG</given-names></name><name><surname>Oliver</surname><given-names>Antony W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110578/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ward</surname><given-names>Simon E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Discovery and characterisation of a novel allosteric inhibitor-binding site in human Bloom syndrome protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RECQ helicases catalyse the unwinding of duplex DNA with 3’ to 5’ directionality, driven by energy liberated by ATP-hydrolysis. As well as simple DNA duplexes, the various members of the RECQ helicase family (BLM, WRN, RECQ1, RECQ4, and RECQ5 in humans) are able to unwind DNA within a range of complex DNA structures and DNA repair intermediates, including: forks, bubbles, triple helices, displacement (D)-loops, G-quadraplexes, and three- or four-way Holliday junctions (extensively reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Croteau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu, 2012</xref>).</p><p>RECQ-helicases are strongly implicated in the maintenance of genomic integrity, principally through their participation in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway for repair of DNA double-strand breaks and restart of collapsed or blocked replication forks (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Croteau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Urban et al., 2017</xref>), but also have roles in toleration of microsatellite instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lieb et al., 2019</xref>) and sister chromatid decatenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). Defects in RECQ-family members are responsible for rare genetic diseases displaying substantial genomic instability and cancer predisposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernstein et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of function of WRN underlies the complex progeria Werner Syndrome; defects in BLM underlie Bloom Syndrome, which is characterised by growth retardation and immunodeficiency; and defects in RECQ4 are associated with Rothmund-Thompson syndrome, which displays growth retardation, skeletal abnormalities and premature ageing.</p><p>A number of experimental and computational studies have implicated RECQ helicases – primarily BLM and WRN - as potential targets for cancer therapy, due to the synthetic lethality of their silencing or downregulation with genetic defects inherent in a range of different cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lieb et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal and Brosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Datta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kategaya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pearl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the therapeutic opportunities this presents, no drugs targeting RECQ helicases have yet been licensed, although potential leads have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenthal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we determine the mode of action for two reported inhibitors of BLM – ML216 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nguyen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenthal, 2010</xref>) and a substituted benzamide (compound 2). While ML216 appears to act, at least in part, through direct DNA binding and has poor specificity, we find that 2 and derivatives thereof are highly specific binders of a defined BLM-DNA complex. Crystallographic analysis of the BLM-DNA-2 complex identifies a novel allosteric binding site and reveals a distinctive conformational step in the helicase mechanism, that can be trapped by small-molecules. These data pave the way for the development of allosteric inhibitors of BLM helicase with the potential to generate trapped and highly cytotoxic BLM-DNA complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Compound identification and screening</title><p>A series of compounds that targeted the helicase activity of human BLM were identified in a quantitative high-throughput screen (qHTS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenthal, 2010</xref>), where the results were made publicly available from the PubChem data repository [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/2528">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioassay/2528</ext-link>]. Filtering the 627 reported active compounds for preferential physicochemical properties (e.g. Lipinski’s rule of five) and excluding those with potential pan-assay interference activity (PAINS) allowed us to group the compounds into several distinct clusters according to chemical similarity. The inhibitory activity of exemplars from each cluster were tested in a fluorescence-based DNA unwinding assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rosenthal, 2010</xref>) against recombinant human BLM-HD (HD = helicase domain; amino acids 636–1298).

To test this hypothesis, we used a commercial assay that utilises recombinant Topoisomerase I (Topo I) to relax a supercoiled plasmid. Compounds that intercalate or bind to the major or minor groove of the plasmid DNA prevent relaxation. At the manufacturer’s recommended concentration of 200 µM, the positive control m-Amsacrine (mAMSA) strongly inhibited relaxation of the supercoiled plasmid. In contrast, no effect was observed with 2 at the same concentration. However, partial inhibition of relaxation could be observed for a reaction containing ML216 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). To confirm this observation, we purchased ML216 from an alternative commercial supplier (ML216-A) and also resynthesised and purified the compound in-house (ML216-B; Materials and methods, Appendix 1). In both cases, a similar level of inhibition was observed when the compounds were included in the relaxation assay, indicating that this was both a real and reproducible effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To explore further the possibility that ML216 might interact directly with DNA, we tested its ability to displace SYBR Green II (SG2) from a DNA substrate in a dye displacement assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Del Villar-Guerra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tse and Boger, 2004</xref>). When SG2 binds to DNA, a concomitant increase in its fluorescence can be measured. If an added compound can compete with the dye for binding to the DNA, a corresponding decrease in the fluorescent signal is observed. We titrated ML216 into a forked-50mer dsDNA substrate, that had been pre-incubated with SG2, observing a clear time- and dose-dependent displacement of the dye, indicating that ML216 can directly interact with a DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Compound 2 does not interfere with ATP-binding</title><p>With confidence that 2 was, in fact, a bona fide inhibitor of BLM, we repeated the unwinding assay in the presence a 10-fold higher concentration of ATP to examine if the compound was directly competitive with nucleotide binding to the active site of the enzyme. As the resulting IC<sub>50</sub> value was identical to that previously determined, it ruled out this mode of inhibition, and suggested that the compound bound elsewhere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Compound 2 is a non-competitive inhibitor</title><p>ATP-turnover experiments, under Michealis-Menten conditions, allowed us to generate a Lineweaver-Burk plot with data taken from DNA substrate titrations in the presence of 0, 5, and 10 µM of 2. The resultant plot indicated a non-competitive (allosteric) mode of inhibition for 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). With this information, we postulated that 2 might only bind to BLM-HD when it was engaged with a DNA substrate. We therefore revisited MST, first confirming the interaction of BLM-HD with the single-stranded 20mer used in our malachite green assay, plus a shorter 15mer that would be taken into crystallographic trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We next titrated 2 into the two pre-formed BLM-HD/ssDNA complexes. This time changes in fluorescent signal could be detected, confirming our hypothesis, with dissociation constants of 1.7 and 2.6 µM determined for the interaction with the 15mer and 20mer, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Enabling structural biology with the expression construct BLM-HD<sup>ΔWHD</sup></title><p>We created the expression construct BLM-HD<sup>ΔWHD</sup> to remove the conformationally flexible Winged Helix domain (WH) that requires the presence of either a stabilising nanobody, or interaction with a large DNA substrate to facilitate crystallogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Newman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Swan et al., 2014</xref>) replacing it with a short poly-(glycine/serine) linker that serves to connect the Zinc-binding domain (Zinc) directly to the Helicase and RNAse C-terminal domain (HRDC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The process of DNA-unwinding is thought to proceed via an ‘inchworm’ type of mechanism, where the D2 domain sequentially binds and releases the DNA substrate, in order to ‘feed’ it onto the D1 domain, translocating it one base at a time. The WHD and HRDC domains of the RecQ helicase-family appear to contribute to the binding, recognition and unwinding of different DNA substrates via their ability to bind to ds and ssDNA respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Inhibition via the allosteric binding site</title><p>As noted earlier, our liganded complex is structurally most similar to PDB entry 4TMU (CsRecQ)—a structure that has been previously characterised as representing a ‘pre-ATP hydrolysis’ conformation in the catalytic cycle of RecQ-family helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Newman et al., 2017</xref>). Although we have co-crystallised BLM-HD<sup>ΔWHD</sup> with ADP, we can see that the active site of the liganded complex is also compatible with ATP-binding, through comparison to the crystal structure of <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ in complex with ATP-γ-S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2003</xref>). This in turn suggests that binding of compound 2—to a small pocket hereinafter referred to as the allosteric binding site (ABS)—acts to ‘trap’ or stall BLM by blocking the set of conformational changes required for progression to the next step of the catalytic cycle.</p><p>The ARL must be in a particular conformation to permit compound binding, otherwise the side chain of Trp803 would occupy and occlude the ABS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This condition is satisfied when the D1 domain of BLM is engaged with single-stranded DNA, providing one explanation as to why we only observe compound binding in the presence of oligonucleotide. However, it is equally possible that binding of 2 serves to promote rearrangement of the ARL into the configuration that then permits the D1-ssDNA interaction.</p><p>The side chains of amino acids Gln975 and His798 contribute to the ABS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> right and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In hsRECQ5, a polar contact between the equivalent residues (Gln345 and His160) is reported to be broken as a consequence of ATP-binding, freeing the ARL to interact productively with the single-stranded 3’-overhang of a bound DNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Newman et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, mutation of the glutamine to alanine (Q345A) prevents stimulation of ATPase activity by binding to DNA, but does not perturb the basal rate of hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Newman et al., 2017</xref>). The importance of the conserved glutamine is perhaps more apparent in <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ, where mutation of the equivalent residue (Q322A) essentially ablates all ATPase capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manthei et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with the ‘pre-ATP hydrolysis’ conformation for our liganded complex, the polar contact between Gln975 and His798 is broken, being ~3.8 Å apart. We note, however, that proximity of the 2-methyl-thiazole moiety from 2, may sterically prevent reformation of this important contact.</p><p>It is clear that more detailed kinetic studies would be required to unambiguously distinguish between a ‘passive’ or ‘induced’ mode of binding for 2. However, compounds bound stably to the ABS should sterically prevent the ARL from reverting to its initial conformation/structurally disordered state found at the beginning of the catalytic cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). The observed hydrogen bond between Asp806 and His1019 may also act to stablise the ternary interaction between BLM-HD<sup>ΔWHD</sup>, 2 and ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Achieving selectivity by Helical Hairpin interactions</title><p>In addition to the ARL, several other regions of BLM interact with 2 when it is bound to the ABS, including amino acids from helicase motifs I and III, plus a short region just upstream of motif IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gorbalenya and Koonin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hall and Matson, 1999</xref>) (pre-motif IV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Unsurprisingly, the amino acid sequence identity of each region across the RecQ-family is extremely high, and do not therefore provide a facile explanation for the observed selectivity of 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In particular, two of the amino acid side chains involved in hydrogen bonds with 2 are absolutely conserved in identity (motif I, Ser801; motif III, Asp840, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). Likewise, amino acids within these motifs involved in hydrophobic contacts with 2 are also highly conserved in identity/chemical property. However, the third hydrogen bonding interaction (made by Asn1022 to 2) and its position within the ‘Helical Hairpin’ of the Zn-binding domain provides some insight, as both the length and amino acid composition of this loop is highly divergent across the RecQ-family and absent from RecQ4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). There is no obvious consensus for any of the residues, in equivalent positions to those in BLM, involved in compound interaction. This observation provides a plausible route, although the addition or alteration of chemical groups to the core scaffold of 2, for generating potent and highly selective inhibitors for the individual members of the RecQ-family of helicases.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Compound selectivity/speculative model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The observed selectivity of compound 2 appears to arise from interactions made with amino acids of the Zn-binding domain ‘Helical Hairpin’ that are poorly conserved (or absent) from the other RecQ-family helicases.

As a consequence of the extended ssDNA interface visualised in our liganded complex (also seen in PDB entry 4TMU), we can see that the size and shape of the pocket that serves to bind the HRDC is substantially altered. Interaction of the D1 domain with ssDNA alters its spatial relationship with the D2 domain, leading to a widening of the pocket and to disruption of the hydrogen bonds that have previously been described to anchor the HRDC in place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Newman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Binding and release of the HRDC has previously been linked to nucleotide-status, indicating that the domain only becomes disengaged when BLM is not bound to ADP or ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Newman et al., 2015</xref>). Our data suggest an additional nuance: if the HRDC is able to engage in an ssDNA interaction, it is prevented from re-binding to the catalytic core, thus isolating it from the catalytic cycle of the enzyme.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A speculative model for the involvement of the HRDC in unwinding DNA substrates</title><p>During model building and evaluation of our liganded structure, we found that the nucleic-acid interactions made by the different sub-domains of BLM-HD<sup>ΔWHD</sup> explain how the HRDC might contribute to the ability of BLM to unwind different types of DNA substrate—incorporating information taken from our own structure, as well as that for the interaction of the WHD with dsDNA from PDB entry 4CGZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>Simple superposition of the two structures results in a clash of the HRDC (in our structure) with the WHD; however, this is readily resolved by a small horizontal translation of the HRDC (roughly equivalent to adding an additional nucleotide to the single-stranded portion of the bound DNA substrate). We also note that, in our liganded structure, the polarity of the single-stranded DNA interacting with the HRDC is opposite to that of our model but with the understanding that is actually dictated by the packing arrangement of the molecules that serve to generate the crystal lattice; on examination, each of the observed HRDC interactions is fully compatible with binding to ssDNA in either orientation.</p><p>However, using the trajectories for each of the bound DNA substrates as positional markers allows generation of a model for unwinding of a simple DNA duplex. The double-stranded portion of the substrate is held in place through the previously described set of interactions with the WHD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Newman et al., 2015</xref>). The β-hairpin of the WH serves to separate the DNA duplex, with one strand ‘actively’ engaged with the D1/D2 domains of the helicase core and the Helical Hairpin of the Zn-binding domain. The second ‘inactive’ strand passes along the opposite face of the WH β-hairpin, to subsequently interact with the HRDC domain, potentially acting to prevent reversion and re-annealing of the DNA duplex. The relatively poor binding affinity of the HRDC for ssDNA is compatible with this model, as it would allow iterative release and recapture of the ‘inactive’ strand as the DNA substrate is unwound.</p><p>A model for how BLM might unwind a Holliday Junction has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kitano, 2014</xref>) but this treats the HRDC domain as a static object, leaving in it the ‘parked’ position and making no interactions with nucleic acid. Data published subsequent to this paper has indicated that the HRDC plays a more fundamental role, for example the charge-reversal mutation N1239D to has been shown to ablate interaction of the HRDC with both ssDNA and a Holliday junction substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim and Choi, 2010</xref>). The HRDC has also been reported to confer DNA-structure specificity to BLM, with Lys1270 playing a role in mediating interactions with DNA and for efficient dissolution of double-Holliday junction substrates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this, our structural data reveals that both Asn1239 and Lys1270 of the HRDC are poised to interact with a section of single-stranded DNA just one to two nucleotides longer than that captured in our crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, our model also suggests the existence of a transient direct interaction between the WHD and the HRDC.</p><p>Compound 2 itself, is unlikely to be suitable as a therapeutic agent, due to its poor ability to penetrate the cell membrane of mammalian cells (data not shown). Indeed, subsequent iterations of 2, or compounds that bind to the same allosteric site, may lead a tool compound that could be used to discover or confirm synthetic lethal relationships with BLM across different tumour backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Datta et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>However, as the first described <italic>bona fide</italic> selective allosteric inhibitor of

preparation of test molecules</title><p>All reactions were conducted under an atmosphere of nitrogen unless otherwise stated. Anhydrous solvents were used as purchased or were purified under nitrogen as follows using activated molecular sieves. Thin layer chromatography was performed on glass plates pre-coated with Merck silica gel 60 F254. Visualisation was achieved with U.V. fluorescence (254 nm) or by staining with a phosphomolybdic acid dip or a potassium permanganate dip. Flash column chromatography was carried out using pre-packed columns filled with Aldrich silica gel (40–63 µm) on an ISCO Combiflash Rf, or a Biotage Isolera Prime. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded at 500 MHz on a Varian 500 spectrometer (at 30°C), using residual isotopic solvent (CHCl<sub>3</sub>, δH = 7.27 ppm, DMSO δH = 2.50 ppm, 3.33 ppm (H<sub>2</sub>O)) as an internal reference. Chemical shifts are quoted in parts per million (ppm). Coupling constants (J) are recorded in Hertz (Hz). Carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were recorded at 125 MHz on a Varian 500 spectrometer and are proton decoupled, using residual isotopic solvent (CHCl<sub>3</sub>, δC = 77.00 ppm, DMSO δC = 39.52 ppm) as an internal reference. Carbon spectra assignments are supported by HSQC and DEPT editing and chemical shifts (δC) are quoted in ppm. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer FT-IR One spectrometer as either an evaporated film or liquid film on sodium chloride plates. Absorption maxima are reported in wave numbers (cm<sup>−1</sup>). Only significant absorptions are presented in the data, with key stretches identified in brackets. LCMS data was recorded on a Waters 2695 HPLC using a Waters 2487 UV detector and a Thermo LCQ ESI-MS. Samples were eluted through a Phenomenex Lunar 3µ C18 50 mm ×4.6 mm column, using acetonitrile and water acidified by 0.01% formic acid in three methods: method 1 (3:7 to 7:3 acetonitrile and water over 7 min), method 2 (3:7 to 7:3 acetonitrile and water over 4 min) and method 3 (19:1 to 1:19 acetonitrile and water over 10 min), High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) spectra were recorded on Bruker Daltonics Apex III ESI-MS, with an Apollo ESI probe using a methanol spray. Only molecular ions, fractions from molecular ions and other major peaks are reported as mass/charge (m/z) ratios.</p></sec><sec id="s9" sec-type="appendix"><title><italic>N</italic>-(2-methyl-5-sulfamoyl-phenyl)−4-(2-methylthiazol-4-yl)benzamide (1)</title><sec id="s9-1"><title>Methyl 4-(2-bromoacetyl)benzoate</title><p>A solution of methyl 4-acetylbenzoate (1.00 g, 5.61 mmol) and <italic>p</italic>-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (54 mg, 0.28 mmol) in acetonitrile (30 mL) was treated with <italic>N</italic>-bromosuccinimide (0.99 g, 5.61 mmol) and the reaction mixture heated to 80°C for 16 hr.

In this work, Chen et al., identify a new selective compound that inhibits the unwinding activity of the BLM (Bloom Syndrome) helicase. Crystallographic studies reveal that this compound locates at an unknown interdomain interface that is postulated to interfere with the conformational change of the helicase during unwinding but not DNA binding. The compound appears to be an interesting first step toward developing a cellular BLM inhibitor. It has an IC50 of 1.8uM and although is poorly cell permeable will make a good starting point for future studies.</p><p>The authors also find that the HRDC domain of the BLM helicase, in complex with the compound, interacts with the ssDNA. This provides insight into the mechanism and function of this domain in mediating helicase activity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As a general reader I found the discussion of the BLM mechanism and the role of the HRDC domain difficult to follow. Could the authors include a bit more background and outline the key questions that are unclear about the current proposed mechanism? It would also help if the authors started the relevant Discussion section with a summary of what the insights are, then follow it with the detailed explanation for how they came to the conclusion. At the moment the sections tend to dive straight into detail first.</p><p>2) The authors should be more cautious when discussing the HRDC domain. The crystal structure of BLM-DNA-ADP-inhibitor complexes was obtained by using an artificial DNA substrate with partial complementary between two ssDNA and a truncated protein. The HRDC domain is known to associate with ssDNA, albeit at low efficiency. With their DNA substrate, it is not surprising that the HRDC interacts with a nearby ssDNA. In terms of forked DNA and Holliday junction substrates, the HRDC domain may be positioned in other places or maybe very dynamic when additional dsDNA is provided.</p><p>3) The conclusion that the compound traps the BLM helicase in the &quot;closed&quot; state is too speculative. The notion of the &quot;open&quot; and &quot;closed&quot; states of BLM was derived from a kinetic study where a structural transition between two ADP-bound states was postulated. Finding that BLM complexed with the compound could not unwind DNA is not sufficient to draw the aforementioned conclusion.</p><p>4) As presented, it is unclear from the text what genetic contexts that BLM inactivation could be exploited in a synthetic lethal approach? Are there clear applications for BLM inhibitors?</p><p>5) Does compound 2 binding influence conformational changes proximal the HRDC docking site on D1 and D2, making it incompatible with HRDC domain docking? That is, could the inhibitor also be influencing conformational switching of the HRDC domain from the parked to engaged states?</p><p>Experimental suggestions – optional :</p><p>1) Does the crystallized WHD deletion construct have helicase activity or DNA-stimulated ATPase activity? The report only assesses DNA binding for the construct used for structural work. Are the helicase or ATPase activities inhibited by compound 2 for the WHD deletion construct? If so, is the inhibitor more or less potent for the WHD deletion construct. Given the WHD domain's proximity to the D2 and Zn-binding domains, its deletion may influence compound efficacy. This could be tested directly with reagents in hand, or this caveat could be raised in the Discussion as WHD deletion may very well be impacting BLM structural dynamics and/or the states observed in the inhibitor bound crystal structure of the WHD deletion protein.</p><p>2) The inhibitory effect of the compound was examined with BLM-HD only. Additional experiments with full-length BLM would make the effect more convincing. Besides, BLM is known to be able to unwind a collection of DNA substrates, such as G-quadruplex and Holliday Junction. It will further generalize the conclusion by testing if the compound also inhibits BLM-mediated unwinding of other DNA structures besides forked DNA.</p><p>3) An EMSA assay would be more direct to show that BLM can still bind to the DNA substrate in the presence of compound 2, whereas ML216 affects the DNA binding by BLM.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65339.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As a general reader I found the discussion of the BLM mechanism and the role of the HRDC domain difficult to follow.

At each step, we also have taken care to compare our proposed model back to the scientific literature and to indicate where it might help to provide a rational explanation for each of its known cellular roles.</p><p>We didn’t in fact foresee the self-interaction of the single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide, although this does become evident with hindsight. As far as we know, no other structure of a RecQ-helicase has captured the interaction of the HRDC domain with ssDNA, with all previous structures of BLM-HD in complex with ssDNA having the HRDC bound at the “parked” position.</p><p>We believe that we have able to capture this v. weak interaction, as a downstream consequence of the inhibitor stabilising the interaction between the oligonucleotide and the D1 domain. We also agree with the reviewer that the HRDC may be positioned in other places when other types of DNA structure/substrate are encountered; we chose to provide a model for what is believed to be the preferred substrate of BLM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusion that the compound traps the BLM helicase in the &quot;closed&quot; state is too speculative.

We do however provide a set of MST data that indicate that trapping does in fact occur in vitro (please see Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As presented, it is unclear from the text what genetic contexts that BLM inactivation could be exploited in a synthetic lethal approach? Are there clear applications for BLM inhibitors?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided several citations (within the Introduction) to manuscripts that explore more fully the potential of BLM (and WRN) as therapeutic targets. However, we have now added an additional short statement at the end of the manuscript to hopefully address this comment, including a timely review exploring synthetic lethal interactions of RECQ helicases, that has just become available in Trends in Cancer (Datta et al., 2020). Ultimately, generation of a cell-penetrant tool compound that selectively inhibits BLM will allow these synthetic lethal/sick relationships to be explored across a range of tumour backgrounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Does compound 2 binding influence conformational changes proximal the HRDC docking site on D1 and D2, making it incompatible with HRDC domain docking?

So, for consistency across our assay formats, we chose to use BLM-HD in preference to BLM-HD<sup>DWHD</sup>, where possible.</p><p>We would like to point the reviewer at Figure 2F, which shows binding of BLM-HD to ssDNA, and to Figure 3—figure supplement 2 which shows binding of BLM-HD<sup>DWHD</sup> to the same 15mer. Likewise, we refer the reviewer to Figure 2G which shows binding of compound 2 to BLM-HD and to Figure 3—figure supplement 2 that shows binding of 2 to BLM-HD<sup>DWHD</sup> (both in the context of a preformed complex with ssDNA). We also make the following statement in the manuscript itself, “… BLM-HD<sup>DWHD</sup> binds both ssDNA-15mer and <bold>2</bold> with a similar affinity to that of BLM-HD”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The inhibitory effect of the compound was examined with BLM-HD only.

Whilst we can detect expression of the protein in insect cells by western blot, we are as yet unable to make sufficient quantities at a purity that would be suitable for our biochemical assays. This is definitely an experiment on our “to-do” list. However, as a consequence of the current COVID-19 situation in the UK, access to the laboratory is heavily time-restricted, and so this is not something we would be able to readily able to achieve in a timely fashion.</p><p>It is worth noting that all unwinding activities of the RecQ helicase family depend on the translocation of single-stranded DNA – from making interactions with the D2 domain to those with the D1 domain in an “inchworm” type of mechanism. Therefore, if a compound prevents this from happening, then unwinding cannot occur, no matter the type of substrate used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) An EMSA assay would be more direct to show that BLM can still bind to the DNA substrate in the presence of compound 2, whereas ML216 affects the DNA binding by BLM.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this type of experiment could be of use. However, we have not optimised this particular method using BLM-HD. We believe that our MST, FP and indeed crystallographic data are sufficient to demonstrate that BLM can bind to a DNA substrate in the presence of compound <bold>2</bold>. We also refer the reviewer to Nygen et al., 2013 – where ML216 has previously been shown to disrupt the ability of BLM to bind to both ssDNA and a forked DNA duplex by EMSA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
