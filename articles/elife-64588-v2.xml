events for most living organisms. Upon nutritional stress, several signaling pathways cooperate to change the transcription program through chromatin regulation to rewire cellular metabolism. In budding yeast, histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3pT11) acts as a marker of low glucose stress and regulates the transcription of nutritional stress-responsive genes. Understanding how this histone modification ‘senses’ external glucose changes remains elusive. Here, we show that Tda1, the yeast ortholog of human Nuak1, is a direct kinase for H3pT11 upon low glucose stress. Yeast AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) directly phosphorylates Tda1 to govern Tda1 activity, while CK2 regulates Tda1 nuclear localization. Collectively, AMPK and CK2 signaling converge on histone kinase Tda1 to link external low glucose stress to chromatin regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>histone H3 T11 phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>AMPK</kwd><kwd>CK2</kwd><kwd>Nuak1</kwd><kwd>Tda1</kwd><kwd>nutrient sensing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007795</institution-id><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Workman Lab</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Workman</surname><given-names>Jerry L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118068</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Workman</surname><given-names>Jerry L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Yeast Nuak1 is an AMPK and CK2 dependent H3 T11 kinase.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To ensure survival, cells must properly adapt to changes in available nutrients by altering their metabolism. This adaptation can be achieved through the cooperation of multiple metabolic pathways. Among those pathways, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling has a central role in energy homeostasis, especially when the cellular nutrient supply is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">González et al., 2020</xref>). AMPK orthologs are very well-conserved from yeast to human and occur as heterotrimeric complex comprising catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ross et al., 2016</xref>). For its proper function, the AMPK catalytic α subunit needs to be phosphorylated at its conserved threonine residue (threonine 172 in rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hawley et al., 1996</xref>] and threonine 210 in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCartney and Schmidt, 2001</xref>]) within the activation loop of its kinase domain. In budding yeast, the catalytic α subunit is sucrose non-fermenting 1 (Snf1). This name comes from its requirement for growth by sucrose fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carlson et al., 1981</xref>). The regulatory γ subunit of budding yeast AMPK is Snf4, and its interaction with Snf1 liberates Snf1 from auto-inhibition that interferes with Snf1 threonine 210 (T210) phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Budding yeast encodes three AMPK β subunit proteins: Sip1, Sip2, and Gal83. They are partially redundant. Only when all three β subunits are deleted, cells exhibit growth defects in media containing ethanol or glycerol as a sole carbon source, as the <italic>snf1Δ</italic> mutant does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erickson and Johnston, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmidt and McCartney, 2000</xref>). The β subunits have a conserved C-terminal sequence that interacts with α and γ subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang and Carlson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 1994</xref>) and a specific N-terminal sequence for each β subunit that confers a distinctive subcellular localization of the Snf1 complex. Notably, Gal83 is required for Snf1 nuclear localization upon glucose depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vincent et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Snf1 interacts with and phosphorylates several proteins involved in nutritional stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coccetti et al., 2018</xref>). Its substrates include several transcription factors such as Cat8 and Sip4, which bind to carbon-source-responsive elements for the transcription of gluconeogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lesage et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Randez-Gil et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vincent and Carlson, 1998</xref>). Cat8 is required for proper expression of the transcription factor Adr1, which is also phosphorylated by Snf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kacherovsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Young et al., 2002</xref>). Snf1 also phosphorylates the Mig1 transcription repressor, which suppresses the transcription of glucose-repressive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nehlin and Ronne, 1990</xref>). Mig1 phosphorylation by Snf1 activates its nuclear export signal leading to expulsion of Mig1 from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DeVit and Johnston, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Papamichos-Chronakis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Treitel et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, the yeast hexokinase 2 (Hxk2) protein interacts with Mig1 in the nucleus to protect Mig1 from phosphorylation by Snf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahuatzi et al., 2007</xref>). When glucose becomes scarce, Hxk2 is phosphorylated at serine 15, which inactivates its nuclear localization signal and, in turn, facilitates its cytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fernández-García et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kriegel et al., 1994</xref>). Snf1 had been believed to be a Hxk2 serine 15 kinase; however, recent studies revealed that yeast Nuak1 homolog Tda1 is responsible for Hxk2 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaps et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kettner et al., 2012</xref>). Thus far, Hxk2 is the only known substrate of Tda1, and how Tda1 activity is regulated upon low glucose stress is unknown.</p><p>AMPK also has a central role in regulating nutritional stress-specific chromatin modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). In yeast, Snf1 is required for H3 serine 10 phosphorylation (H3pS10) at the <italic>INO1</italic> gene promoter to regulate its transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lo et al., 2001</xref>). Human AMPK phosphorylates H2B at serine 36 at the promoters of p53-responsive genes upon glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bungard et al., 2010</xref>). AMPK indirectly regulates H3 arginine 17 di-methylation by affecting histone arginine methyltransferase CARM1 protein level in the nucleus upon apoptosis-inducing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies imply that metabolic enzymes themselves also participate in chromatin regulation. Pyruvate kinase, a glycolysis enzyme, can phosphorylate H3 at threonine 11 in humans and in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Especially in yeast, pyruvate kinase forms a complex named SESAME with several metabolic enzymes involved in serine and SAM metabolism to regulate histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3pT11) in glucose-rich conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Previously, we reported a genome-wide study that H3pT11 specifically increases at the promoters of stress-responsive genes upon low glucose stress, and H3pT11 is required for proper transcription of those genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oh et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, the H3pT11 increase upon low glucose stress is a SESAME-independent process, indicating multiple different kinases are involved in H3pT11 regulation. We found that Cka1, a catalytic subunit of CK2 complex, is required for H3pT11 regulation in low glucose conditions. However, CK2 has been observed to be constitutively active and insensitive to external changes of environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pinna, 2002</xref>). It remains elusive how a constantly active CK2 can regulate H3pT11, which becomes elevated upon low glucose stress. This suggests that H3pT11 may require additional mechanisms for sensing the availability of carbon sources.</p><p>In this study, we identify an understudied kinase, Tda1, as a histone H3 T11 kinase in low glucose stress conditions. Snf1 directly phosphorylates Tda1 at its C-terminus, especially at tandem serine 483 and threonine 484 (S483/T484) residues, which is required for in vivo Tda1 activity. CK2 regulates H3pT11 by controlling Tda1 nuclear localization. Hence, Tda1 acts as a signaling platform that can combine Snf1 and CK2 signaling, thereby connecting external nutrient availability to transcription regulation in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H3pT11 upon low glucose stress is dependent on Snf1</title><p>We previously reported that H3pT11 can act as a marker of low glucose stress in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oh et al., 2018</xref>). The global H3pT11 level is inversely correlated with external glucose level and specifically increased at genes involved in metabolic changes. As AMPK signaling has major regulatory roles in nutrient starvation conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">González et al., 2020</xref>), we tested whether H3pT11 is linked with the yeast AMPK homolog, Snf1 signaling pathway. Upon the media shift from glucose-rich (2%) YPD to nutritionally unfavorable YP with 3% glycerol (YPgly), Snf1 threonine 210 phosphorylation (Snf1 pT210), the active Snf1 marker, showed a similar pattern of increase compared to that of H3pT11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, a <italic>snf1Δ</italic> mutant showed significantly reduced global H3pT11 levels in saturated cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) where media glucose is depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oh et al., 2018</xref>) and impaired H3pT11 increase upon media shift from YPD to YPgly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Rim15 is another kinase that becomes active in low glucose conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vidan and Mitchell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2008</xref>), but a <italic>rim15Δ</italic> mutant did not show the global H3pT11 defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Snf1 phosphorylates several transcription factors including Adr1, Cat8, Sip4, and Mig1 upon nutritional stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kacherovsky et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lesage et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Randez-Gil et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Treitel et al., 1998</xref>); however, deletion of these transcription factors did not affect H3pT11 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that H3pT11 is specifically regulated via the Snf1 pathway and reduction of H3pT11 in a <italic>snf1Δ</italic> mutant is not an indirect result of a transcriptional defect. Previously, we showed that Cka1, the catalytic subunit of CK2, is required for the H3pT11 increase in low glucose stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oh et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, a <italic>cka1Δsnf1Δ</italic> double deletion mutant showed a similar level of H3pT11 compared to a <italic>snf1Δ</italic> or <italic>cka1Δ</italic> single deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that CK2 and Snf1 may act in the same pathway for H3pT11 regulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>H3pT11 upon low glucose is dependent on Snf1, but not on H3pS10.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of the Snf1 threonine 210 phosphorylation (Snf1 pT210) and H3pT11 levels upon media shift from YPD (2% glucose) to YPgly (YP with 3% glycerol) measured by western blots.

In this regard, it is not clear if Tda1 itself contains non-conventional NLS, or Tda1 requires other accessory factors for its nuclear localization. Finding a Tda1 specific importin would also be an important next step.</p><p>CK2 has been known as a constitutively active kinase complex, which does not require upstream stimulation for its activity. However, many processes governed by CK2 are highly controlled processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pinna, 2002</xref>). In this study, we show an example of how a constitutively active kinase can be involved in tightly regulated processes such as H3pT11 upon low glucose stress. Although CK2 is constitutively active, H3pT11 cannot be achieved without active Snf1. Previously, we reported that Sch9 was also required for H3pT11 regulation as well as CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oh et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, Sch9 and CK2 genetically interact in H3pT11 regulation as Cka1 and Snf1 do. Our finding of H3pT11 regulation by CK2 via controlling the Tda1 nuclear localization suggests a possibility that Sch9 is also involved in the same process. This raises the possibility of Tda1 being a signaling platform that combines multiple signaling such as Snf1, CK2, and Sch9 together to finely connect external glucose levels to chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tda1 in higher eukaryotes</title><p>Structural analysis (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://yeastgenome.org">http://yeastgenome.org</ext-link>) predicts that Tda1 contains a calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase domain at its N-terminus. We found that its functional kinase domain resides between aa 1 and 380 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In yeast, there are 12 kinases that contain the domain including yeast calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (Cmk1 and Cmk2) and meiosis-specific kinase Mek1, as well as Tda1. Interestingly, Mek1 phosphorylates H3 at T11 during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kniewel et al., 2017</xref>). A large-scale screening of yeast phosphorylation site motifs revealed that the aa sequence surrounding H3T11 fits in the recognition motif of Cmk1 and Cmk2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mok et al., 2010</xref>). These results imply that calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases could be kinase candidates for H3pT11 in situations other than nutrient starvation in yeast and possibly in other species.</p><p>Based on predictions by the PPOD program (at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ppod.princeton.edu/">http://ppod.princeton.edu/</ext-link>), Nuak1 has been proposed as a human ortholog of yeast Tda1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soma et al., 2014</xref>). Nuak1 is also known as ARK5, which means AMPK-related kinase 5. As its name suggests, Nuak1 has a 47% aa sequence homology to AMPK α1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suzuki et al., 2003a</xref>). Nuak1 is involved in cell survival processes upon nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki et al., 2003b</xref>), suggesting that the Tda1 function upon nutrient stress shown in yeast is consistent in higher eukaryotes. Nuak1 predominantly localizes to the nucleus, but a recent study revealed that the cellular distribution of Nuak1 changes upon stresses in a importin β-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palma et al., 2019</xref>). Investigating whether the Nuak1 subcellular localization is regulated via a similar mechanism to that of Tda1 and phosphorylates histones under a specific stress like Tda1 would be an interesting future study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Peptide mixtures were loaded onto 100 µm fused silica microcapillary columns packed with 5 μm C<sub>18</sub> reverse phase (Aqua, Phenomenex), strong cation exchange particles (Partisphere SCX, Whatman), and reverse phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">MacCoss et al., 2002</xref>). Loaded microcapillary columns were placed in-line with a Quaternary Agilent 1260 series HPLC pump and a Velos Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-LC electrospray ionization source (ThermoFinnigan). Fully automated 10-step MudPIT runs were carried out on the electrosprayed peptides, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Florens and Washburn, 2006</xref>). Tandem mass spectra were interpreted using ProLuCID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eng et al., 1994</xref>) against a database of 8956 sequences, consisting of 4303 <italic>E. coli</italic> proteins (downloaded from NCBI on 2013-11-06), 177 usual contaminants such as human keratins, IgGs, and proteolytic enzymes, 4476 ‘shuffled’ sequences, and four yeast proteins sequences (Tda1, Snf1, Cka1, and a recombinant Tda1 C-terminal sequence from aa residues 354–586). Peptide/spectrum matches were sorted and selected using DTASelect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabb et al., 2002</xref>) with the following criteria set: spectra/peptide matches were only retained if they had a DeltCn of at least 0.08 and minimum XCorr of 1.8, 2.0, and 3.0 for singly, doubly, and triply charged spectra, respectively. In addition, peptides had to be fully tryptic and at least six amino acids long. Combining all runs, proteins had to be detected by at least two such peptides, or 1 peptide with two independent spectra. Under these criteria, the final FDRs at all levels were zero. Peptide hits from multiple runs were compared using CONTRAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tabb et al., 2002</xref>). To estimate relative protein levels, distributed normalized spectral abundance factors were calculated for each detected protein, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Florens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paoletti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zybailov et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Michael Church for scientific editing of the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Xiaobing Shi as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Brian D Strahl (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an excellent study from the Workman group that delineates the mechanism by which H3T11 becomes phosphorylated during nutrient (i.e., glucose) deprivation in yeast to regulate gene transcription. Previous studies from the Workman lab and others have revealed that H3T11 is phosphorylated from yeast to humans, and that this modification is important for transcriptional regulation. Specifically in yeast, the Workman group recently demonstrated that pyruvate kinase and CKII are required for H3T11P; however, whether additional enzymes were also involved and the interplay between kinases in mediating this mark was not well understood. As CKII was determined to not be the main kinase for H3T11P under glucose starvation, the Workman group sought to identify the relevant kinase(s). The authors found that Snf1 of the AMPK signaling pathway is required for proper H3T11P, but that not all of the regulatory subunits of AMPK (β and γ) are needed, thereby suggesting a novel connection of Snf1 with the terminal kinase. A search for this kinase found, surprisingly, that Tda1 (yeast NUAK1 homolog) is the bona fide kinase that mediates this modification. They show that Tda1 is activated by the nutrient regulated kinase Snf1, they identify the sites phosphorylated by Snf1, and they show that the nuclear translocation of Tda1 is dependent on Cka1 signaling. In all, this work describes an elegant molecular pathway wherein multiple singling pathways and kinases converge to regulate a key kinase that mediates an important chromatin modification required for glucose-deprived gene regulation.</p><p>Overall, this study is thorough, and the conclusions are strong. This paper does an excellent job demonstrating which kinases are responsible for phosphorylating which sites. The insight provided into how Tda1 is a novel mediator of H3T11P is exciting, as well as the interesting connections made to its nuclear localization. Taken together, this work would be of wide interest to the chromatin, transcription, nutrient signaling community. Therefore, I support its publication in <italic>eLife</italic> with minor modifications.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major weakness in this story is the lack of any indication that phosphorylation of histone H3T11 is biologically significant. Do cells lacking this signaling pathway or tda1 deletion have any phenotypes or defect in gene expression? Some experimental data to demonstrate that phosphorylation of H3T11 is important for some aspects of nutrient stress response would increase the significance of this paper tremendously.</p><p>2) It is interesting that Snf1-mediated phosphorylation of S483/T484 is critical for Tda1 kinase activity. However, the in vivo function of this phosphorylation event is not very clear. It will help to complete the circuit in the paper if it can be experimentally tested if mutation of S483/T484 leads to defective gene activation of glucose sensitive target genes. It would be assumed but not formally shown. Also, it would also be interesting to see if a phospho-memetic (S/T to E) mutation of Tda1 might bypass the need for Snf1/CKII, etc.</p><p>3) Similar experiments to test the role of CK2-mediated Tda1 phosphorylation would also strength the paper greatly.</p><p>4) The conclusion that Snf1 is a kinase that can phosphorylate H3S10 is arguable. The authors may want to provide more biochemical data using recombinant proteins and orthogonal approaches, or tune down their conclusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64588.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major weakness in this story is the lack of any indication that phosphorylation of histone H3T11 is biologically significant.

In our previous work, also published in e<italic>Life</italic> (PMID: 29938647), we reported genome-wide ChIP-seq results of H3pT11 in low glucose YPgly media (GSE111218). We also reported RNA-Seq results of several mutants whose H3pT11 was impaired (i.e. H3T11A mutant) in YPgly media (GSE111217). In that manuscript, we reported a solid relationship between the transcription activation of low glucose stress responsive genes and H3pT11 signal increase upon media shift from YPD to YPgly media. In addition, we found the significant transcriptional defects of several low glucose stress responsive genes in H3T11A mutant. In this regard, we believe that we successfully proved a biological significance of H3pT11 in low glucose condition in our previous work. Thanks to the reviewer’s comment we realize that we need to better review the biological significance demonstrated in our previous study in the Introduction of this manuscript. We have added a summary of the previous manuscript to the revised manuscript (Introduction).</p><p>In addition, as we already know the target genes of H3pT11, we selected several genes whose transcription are impaired in H3T11A mutant in low glucose stress. We tested their gene expression levels in tda1Δ mutants to see if tda1Δ showed a similar phenotype compared to H3T11A mutant. We added a new Figure 6—figure supplement 2, describing this result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is interesting that Snf1-mediated phosphorylation of S483/T484 is critical for Tda1 kinase activity.

The data clearly showed that AA mutant failed to restore H3pT11 target gene expression levels compared to WT. Indeed, AA mutant showed a similar level of transcription to tda1Δ mutant. The AA mutant did not show transcription defects at non-target genes (PMA1 and MET13). These results suggest the critical role of Tda1 S483/T484 phosphorylation in the regulation of Tda1 activity.</p><p>Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we made Tda1 S483D/T484E (DE) mutant and tested whether the potential phosphorylation mimic mutant could bypass the requirement of Snf1 or CK2. Interestingly, we found that DE mutant, as well as AA mutant could not restore H3pT11. The result is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>H3pT11 levels of Tda1 WT, Tda1 S483A/T484A, and Tda1 S483D/T484E mutant expressing strains analyzed by western blot.</title><p>Cells were taken from overnight saturated media.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64588-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although we showed that Tda1 phosphorylation at S483/T484 is critical for the regulation of Tda1 activity (Figure 6D), we do not know the exact mechanism how the modification controls Tda1 activity.

We showed that the Tda1 C terminal was phosphorylated by Cka1 at serine 578 (Figure 6A and Supplementary file 1) using in vitro kinase assays. We tested Tda1 S578A mutant for H3pT11 and found that the Tda1 S578A mutant did not show any defect in H3pT11 (Figure 6B), suggesting that Cka1 may not regulate Tda1 by direct phosphorylation at serine 578. Thus far, we were not able to find any evidence that Cka1 could phosphorylate Tda1 at sites other than S578, or control Tda1 nuclear localization by direct phosphorylation. The mechanism how CK2 regulates Tda1 nuclear localization needs more investigation in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusion that Snf1 is a kinase that can phosphorylate H3S10 is arguable. The authors may want to provide more biochemical data using recombinant proteins and orthogonal approaches, or tune down their conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewers comment that Snf1 as a H3S10 kinase is arguable. As H3pS10 is dispensable for H3pT11 onset upon low glucose stress (Figure 1E and F), we believe that Snf1 as a histone H3 S10 kinase is not a critical part of this study. In this regard, we revised manuscript as below.</p><p>From “Snf1 phosphorylates H3 at serine 10 at the INO1 gene promoter…”</p><p>to “Snf1 is required for H3 serine 10 phosphorylation (H3pS10) at the INO1 gene promoter…”</p><p>From “Snf1 can phosphorylate histone H3 at serine 10 in yeast.”</p><p>to “Snf1 is required for H3pS10 at the INO1 gene promoter in yeast.”</p><p>In addition, we changed Figure 4D. in the previous Figure 4D, we showed that yeast flag purified Snf1 could phosphorylate both H3S10 and H3T11 in vitro. To avoid confusion, we repeated the experiment without flag purified Snf1. Instead, we added GST-Cka1 as a new control.</p></body></sub-article></article>
