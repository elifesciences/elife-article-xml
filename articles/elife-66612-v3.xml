While presynaptic receptors – typically activated by neurotransmitters and modulated by neuromodulators – provide a powerful way of fine-tuning synaptic function, their contribution to activity-dependent changes in transmitter release remains poorly understood. Here, we report that presynaptic NMDA receptors (preNMDARs) at mossy fiber boutons in the rodent hippocampus can be activated by physiologically relevant patterns of activity and selectively enhance short-term synaptic plasticity at mossy fiber inputs onto CA3 pyramidal cells and mossy cells, but not onto inhibitory interneurons. Moreover, preNMDARs facilitate brain-derived neurotrophic factor release and contribute to presynaptic calcium rise. Taken together, our results indicate that by increasing presynaptic calcium, preNMDARs fine-tune mossy fiber neurotransmission and can control information transfer during dentate granule cell burst activity that normally occur in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CA3</kwd><kwd>ionotropic</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>presynaptic calcium</kwd><kwd>autoreceptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH116673</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castillo</surname><given-names>Pablo E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH125772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castillo</surname><given-names>Pablo E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS113600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castillo</surname><given-names>Pablo E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 MH 109267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lituma</surname><given-names>Pablo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By facilitating glutamate and BDNF release, presynaptic NMDA receptors may control information transfer from the dentate gyrus to the CA3 area of the hippocampus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurotransmission is a dynamic and highly regulated process.

Regulation of neurotransmitter release by NMDA autoreceptors in the brain was suggested three decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martin et al., 1991</xref>). Anatomical evidence for preNMDARs arose from an immunoelectron microscopy study revealing NMDARs at the mossy fiber giant bouton of the monkey hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Siegel et al., 1994</xref>), followed by functional studies in the entorhinal cortex, indicating that preNMDARs tonically increase spontaneous glutamate release and also facilitate evoked release in a frequency-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berretta and Jones, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Woodhall et al., 2001</xref>). Since these early studies, although evidence for preNMDARs has accumulated throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bouvier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Duguid and Smart, 2009</xref>), the presence and functional relevance of preNMDARs at key synapses in the brain have been called into question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carter and Jahr, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duguid, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Mossy fibers (mf) – the axons of dentate granule cells (GCs) – establish excitatory synapses onto proximal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons, thereby conveying a major excitatory input to the hippocampus proper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amaral et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Henze et al., 2000</xref>). This synapse displays uniquely robust frequency facilitation both in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Salin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vyleta et al., 2016</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hagena and Manahan-Vaughan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vandael et al., 2020</xref>). The molecular basis of this short-term plasticity is not fully understood but likely relies on diverse presynaptic mechanisms that increase glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rebola et al., 2017</xref>). Short-term, use-dependent facilitation is believed to play a critical role in information transfer, circuit dynamics, and short-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Regehr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klug et al., 2012</xref>). The mf-CA3 synapse can strongly drive the CA3 network during short bursts of presynaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chamberland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Henze et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vyleta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zucca et al., 2017</xref>), an effect that likely results from two key properties of this synapse, namely, its strong frequency facilitation and proximal dendritic localization. In addition to CA3 pyramidal neurons, mf axons establish synaptic connections with hilar mossy cells (MCs) and inhibitory interneurons (INs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amaral et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Henze et al., 2000</xref>). These connections also display robust short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lysetskiy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toth et al., 2000</xref>), which may contribute significantly to information transfer and dynamic modulation of the dentate gyrus (DG)-CA3 circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bischofberger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evstratova and Tóth, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lawrence and McBain, 2003</xref>). Despite early evidence for preNMDARs at mf boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Siegel et al., 1994</xref>), whether these receptors modulate neurotransmission at mf synapses is unknown. Intriguingly, mfs contain one of the highest expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Conner et al., 1997</xref>). While preNMDARs were implicated in BDNF release at corticostriatal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2014</xref>), whether putative preNMDARs impact BDNF release at mf synapses remains unexplored.</p><p>Here, to examine the potential presence and impact of preNMDARs at mf synapses, we utilized multiple approaches, including immunoelectron microscopy, selective pharmacology for NMDARs, a genetic knockout strategy to remove NMDARs from presynaptic GCs, two-photon imaging of BDNF release, and presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in acute rodent hippocampal slices. Our findings indicate that preNMDARs contribute to mf short-term plasticity and promote BDNF release likely by increasing presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, preNMDARs at mfs may facilitate information transfer and provide an important point of regulation in the DG-CA3 circuit by modulating both glutamate and BDNF release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Electron microscopy reveals presynaptic NMDA receptors at mossy fiber terminals</title><p>To determine the potential localization of NMDA receptors at the mf terminals of the rodent hippocampus, we performed electron microscopy and post-embedding immunogold labeling in rats using a validated antibody for the obligatory subunit GluN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Petralia et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Siegel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Takumi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Watanabe et al., 1998</xref>).

At the end of these recordings, 10 μM NBQX was applied to confirm KAR transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castillo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kwon and Castillo, 2008</xref>). It is therefore unlikely that the reduction of LFF mediated by NMDAR antagonism could be explained by recurrent network activity, suggesting a direct effect on transmitter release.</p><p>To further support a role of preNMDARs in mf LFF, we took a genetic approach by conditionally removing NMDARs from GCs in <italic>Grin1</italic> floxed mice.

To test whether preNMDARs contribute to synaptic facilitation that occurs during more physiological patterns of activity, mfs were activated with brief bursts (five stimuli, 25 Hz). We first took an optogenetic approach and used a Cre-dependent ChIEF virus to selectively light-activate mf-CA3 synapses in <italic>Grin1</italic>-cKO and control mice. Thus, animals were injected with a mix of AAV5-CaMKII-CreGFP+AAV DJ-FLEX-ChIEF-tdTomato viruses in the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). At least 4 weeks after surgery, acute slices were prepared and burst-induced facilitation of AMPAR-mediated transmission in CA3 was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). Burst-induced facilitation, triggered by light stimulation and measured as the ratio of EPSCs elicited by the fifth and first pulse (P5/P1 ratio), was significantly reduced in <italic>Grin1</italic>-cKO animals as compared to controls. Because these bursts of activity can activate the CA3 network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Henze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kwon and Castillo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005</xref>), we next monitored KAR-EPSCs under conditions of low excitability (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). MK-801 bath application also reduced burst-induced facilitation, whereas facilitation remained unchanged in naïve slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). In a separate set of experiments, we confirmed the reduction of MK-801 on burst-induced facilitation under more physiological recording conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Lastly, we tested whether preNMDARs, by facilitating glutamate release during bursting activity, could bring CA3 pyramidal neurons to threshold and trigger postsynaptic action potentials. To test this possibility, we monitored action potentials elicited by KAR-EPSPs (resting membrane potential −70 ± 2 mV) from CA3 pyramidal neurons intracellularly loaded with 2 mM MK-801. Under these recording conditions, MK-801 bath application significantly reduced the mean number of spikes per burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). No changes in mean spikes per burst were observed in naïve slices over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Application of 10 μM NBQX at the end of these experiments confirmed that action potentials were induced by KAR-mediated synaptic responses. Consistent with these observations, MK-801 also reduced the mean number of spikes per burst when AMPAR-mediated action potentials were recorded from CA3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Moreover, using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we demonstrate that preNMDARs contribute to presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in mf boutons. Lastly, upon repetitive activity, preNMDARs promote BDNF release from mf boutons. Taken together, our findings indicate that preNMDARs act as autoreceptors to boost both glutamate and BDNF release at mf synapses. By regulating information flow in the DG-CA3 circuit, preNMDARs may play a significant role in learning and memory.</p><p>Early studies using immunoperoxidase electron microscopy revealed NMDARs in presynaptic compartments in multiple brain areas (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Corlew et al., 2008</xref>). Subsequent studies that used immunogold electron microscopy, a more precise localization method, identified NMDARs on the presynaptic membrane in a number of brain structures, including neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fujisawa and Aoki, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larsen et al., 2011</xref>), hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGuinness et al., 2010</xref>), and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pickel et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement with these studies, and using a previously validated antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Siegel et al., 1994</xref>), we identified prominent presynaptic labeling of the obligatory subunit GluN1 in mf boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). Moreover, we found that these receptors are close to the active zone and therefore well positioned to modulate neurotransmitter release.</p><p>Previous work in the cerebellum and neocortex suggested that somatodendritic potentials generated by NMDARs could signal to nerve terminals and lead to presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Christie and Jahr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Christie and Jahr, 2009</xref>). Thus, changes in neurotransmitter release resulting from NMDAR antagonism could be due to somatodendritic NMDARs but not necessarily preNMDARs residing on nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duguid, 2013</xref>). However, we showed that focal NMDAR antagonism far from the somatodendritic compartment and in transected axons still reduced short-term plasticity at mf synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), making it extremely unlikely that somatodendritic NMDARs could explain our results. In further support of functional preNMDARs at mf boutons, we found that 2PU of glutamate induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise in control, but not in GluN1-deficient boutons. Together, our findings strongly support the presence of functional preNMDARs facilitating neurotransmission at mf-CA3 synapses.</p><p>There is evidence that preNMDARs can operate as coincidence detectors at some synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duguid, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). At the mf-CA3 synapse, we found that preNMDARs contribute to LFF (i.e. 1 s inter-stimulus interval). This observation is intriguing given that the presynaptic AP-mediated depolarization is likely absent by the time glutamate binds to preNMDARs. However, coincidence detection may not be an essential requirement for mf preNMDARs to modulate glutamate release. Of note, at resting membrane potential, the NMDAR conductance is not zero and the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Traynelis et al., 2010</xref>). It is also conceivable that mf preNMDARs exhibit low-voltage dependence, as it has been reported at other synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). Remarkably, the somatodendritic compartment of GCs can generate sub-threshold depolarizations at mf terminals (a.k.a. excitatory presynaptic potentials) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alle and Geiger, 2006</xref>). By alleviating the magnesium blockade, these potentials might reduce the need for coincidence detection and transiently boost the functional impact of mf preNMDARs.</p><p>While the presence of preNMDARs is downregulated during development both in neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Corlew et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Larsen et al., 2011</xref>) and in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mameli et al., 2005</xref>), we were able to detect functional preNMDARs in young adult rats (P17–P28) and mice (P30–P44), once mf connections are fully developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amaral and Dent, 1981</xref>). Functional preNMDARs have been identified in axonal growth cones of hippocampal and neocortical neurons, suggesting that these receptors are important for regulating early synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Because GCs undergo adult neurogenesis, and adult-born GCs establish new connections in the mature brain, preNMDARs could also play an important role at immature mf synapses and functional integration of new born GCs into the mature hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Toni and Schinder, 2015</xref>). Moreover, experience can modulate the expression and composition of preNMDARs in neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>), a possibility not investigated in our study.</p><p>The glutamate that activates preNMDARs may originate from the presynaptic terminal, the postsynaptic cell, nearby synapses or neighboring glial cells. Our results indicate that activation of preNMDARs at mf synapses requires activity-dependent release of glutamate that likely arises from mf boutons, although other sources cannot be discarded, including astrocytes. For instance, at medial entorhinal inputs to GCs, preNMDARs appear to be localized away from the presynaptic release sites and facing astrocytes, consistent with preNMDAR activation by gliotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jourdain et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Savtchouk et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, at mf-CA3 synapses, we found that preNMDARs are adjacent to the release sites, suggesting a direct control on glutamate release from mf boutons.</p><p>The precise mechanism by which preNMDARs facilitate neurotransmitter release is poorly understood, but it may include Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the receptor and depolarization of the presynaptic terminal with subsequent activation of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Corlew et al., 2008</xref>). In support of this mechanism is the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability of NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rogers and Dani, 1995</xref>). Besides, presynaptic sub-threshold depolarization and subsequent activation of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels is a common mechanism by which presynaptic ionotropic receptors facilitate neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Engelman and MacDermott, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pinheiro and Mulle, 2008</xref>). PreNMDARs may also act in a metabotropic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dore et al., 2016</xref>) and facilitate spontaneous transmitter release independent of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrahamsson et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings demonstrating that the open channel blocker MK-801 robustly reduced short-term plasticity at mf synapses support an ionotropic mechanism that involves Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through preNMDARs. A previous study failed to observe Ca<sup>2+</sup> reductions in mf boutons by DL-APV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liang et al., 2002</xref>). A combination of factors could account for this discrepancy with our study, including a stronger mf repetitive stimulation (20 pulses, 100 Hz), which may overcome a less potent NMDAR antagonism and/or the need for preNMDAR activity, as well as the use of a higher affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (Fura-2 AM) and a lower spatiotemporal resolution imaging approach. Nevertheless, in line with previous studies that detected presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises following local activation of NMDARs (e.g. NMDA or glutamate uncaging) in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchanan et al., 2012</xref>) and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rossi et al., 2012</xref>), we provide direct evidence that preNMDAR activation by either repetitive activation of mfs or 2PU of glutamate increases presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Although the Ca<sup>2+</sup> targets remain unidentified, these may include proteins of the release machinery, calcium-dependent protein kinases and phosphatases, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to facilitating evoked neurotransmitter release, preNMDARs can promote spontaneous neurotransmitter release as indicated by changes in miniature, action potential-independent activity (e.g. mEPSCs) (for recent reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kunz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). A potential role for preNMDARs in spontaneous, action potential-independent release at mf synapses cannot be discarded.</p><p>Our results show that activation of preNMDARs by physiologically relevant patterns of presynaptic activity enhanced mf transmission and DG-CA3 information transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A previous study reported that NMDAR genetic deletion in GCs resulted in memory deficits (e.g. pattern separation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McHugh et al., 2007</xref>). Although the mechanism is unclear, it could involve activity-dependent preNMDAR regulation of mf excitatory connections. We also found that preNMDARs facilitate neurotransmitter release in a target cell-specific manner. Like in neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Larsen and Sjöström, 2015</xref>), such specificity strongly suggests that preNMDARs have distinct roles in controlling information flow in cortical microcircuits. Thus, preNMDAR facilitation of mf synapses onto glutamatergic neurons but not GABAergic INs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) may fine-tune the CA3 circuit by increasing the excitatory/inhibitory balance.</p><p>Given the multiple signaling cascades known to regulate NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lau and Zukin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sanz-Clemente et al., 2013</xref>), preNMDARs at mf synapses may provide an important site of neuromodulatory control. PreNMDARs have been implicated in the induction of LTP and LTD at excitatory or inhibitory synapses in several brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). While most evidence, at least using robust induction protocols in vitro, indicates that long-term forms of presynaptic plasticity at mf synapses can occur in the absence of NMDAR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castillo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005</xref>), our findings do not discard the possibility that preNMDARs could play a role in vivo during subtle presynaptic activities. As previously reported for corticostriatal LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2014</xref>), preNMDARs could regulate long-term synaptic plasticity by controlling BDNF release, which is consistent with BDNF-TrkB signaling being implicated in mf-CA3 LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schildt et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, BDNF could facilitate glutamate release by enhancing NMDAR function at the presynapse, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Madara and Levine, 2008</xref>), although the precise mechanism(s) remain unclear. By potentiating mf-CA3 transmission, BDNF could also promote epileptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McNamara and Scharfman, 2012</xref>). Lastly, dysregulation of NMDARs is commonly implicated in the pathophysiology of brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lau and Zukin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paoletti et al., 2013</xref>). PreNMDAR expression and function have been suggested to be altered in experimental models of disease, including neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zeng et al., 2006</xref>) and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). At present, however, in vivo evidence for the involvement of preNMDARs in brain function and disease is rather indirect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bouvier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). The development of specific preNMDAR tools is required to determine the functional impact of these receptors in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Briefly, animals (n = 3 rats) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine 1: 1 (0.1 mL/kg b.w.) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, and 15% saturated picric acid solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for 15 min. Vibratome sections 500 μm thick were placed into 1 M sucrose solution in 0.1 M PB for 2 hr before they were slammed on a Leica EM CPC apparatus. Samples were dehydrated in methanol at −80°C and embedded by freeze-substitution (Leica EM AFS2) in Lowicryl HM 20 (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA), followed by polymerization with UV light. Then, ultrathin 80-nm-thick sections from Lowicryl-embedded blocks of the hippocampus were picked up on coated nickel grids and incubated on drops of a blocking solution consisting of 2% human serum albumin in 0.05 M TBS and 0.03% Triton X-100.

Acute rat hippocampal slices (400 µm thick) were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats, from postnatal day 17 (P17) to P28 of either sex. For procedures regarding transgenic mouse slice preparation, see below. The hippocampi were isolated and cut using a VT1200s microslicer (Leica Microsystems Co.) in a solution containing (in mM): 215 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.6 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 20 glucose.

All solutions were equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.4). Slices were allowed to recover for at least 45 min in the ACSF solution before recording. For physiological Mg<sup>+2</sup> and Ca<sup>+2</sup> experiments, ACSF solutions were adjusted to (in mM): 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub> and 1.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and temperature was maintained at 35 ± 0.1°C in the submersion-type recording chamber heated by a temperature controller (TC-344B Dual Automatic Temperature Controller, Warner Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Electrophysiological recordings were performed at 26.0 ± 0.1°C (unless otherwise stated) in a submersion-type recording chamber perfused at 2 mL/min with normal ACSF supplemented with the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist picrotoxin (100 µM) and the selective AMPA receptor (AMPAR) antagonist LY303070 at a low concentration (0.5 µM) to minimize CA3-CA3 recurrent activity, or at a high concentration (15 µM) to isolate KAR-EPSCs and KAR-EPSPs to assess monosynaptic mf transmission. Whole-cell recordings were made from CA3 pyramidal cells voltage-clamped at −70 mV using patch-type pipette electrodes (3–4 mΩ) containing (in mM): 131 cesium gluconate, 8 NaCl, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, and 2 MK-801 pH 7.25 (280–285 mOsm) unless specified otherwise. KOH was used to adjust pH. Series resistance (8–15 MΩ) was monitored throughout all experiments with a −5 mV, 80 ms voltage step, and cells that exhibited a series resistance change (&gt;20%) were excluded from analysis. A stimulating bipolar electrode (theta glass, Warner Instruments) was filled with ACSF and placed in <italic>stratum lucidum</italic> to selectively activate mfs using a DS2A Isolated Voltage Stimulator (Digitimer Ltd.) with a 100 µs pulse width duration. AMPAR-EPSCs were recorded for a baseline period of 2 min, and LFF was induced by stepping the stimulation frequency from 0.1 to 1 Hz for 2 min. Facilitation was measured by taking a ratio of the mean EPSC during the steady-state, LFF period of activity and the 2-min baseline (EPSC<sub>1Hz</sub>/EPSC<sub>0.1Hz</sub>) before and after bath application of NMDAR antagonists.</p><p>To qualify for analysis, mf responses met three criteria: (1) The 20–80% rise time of the AMPAR-EPSC was less than 1 ms, (2) LFF was greater than 150%, (3) the AMPAR-EPSC displayed at least 70% sensitivity to the group 2/3 mGluR agonist, DCG-IV (1 µM). Isolated KAR-EPSCs were elicited by 2 pulses with a 5 ms inter-stimulus interval for LFF experiments. Baseline measurements were acquired at least 10 min after ‘break-in’ to achieve optimal intracellular blockade of postsynaptic NMDARs by MK-801 (2 mM) in the patch-pipette. To transect mf axons in acute slices, a 45° ophthalmic knife (Alcon Surgical) was used to make a diagonal cut across the hilus from the dorsal to ventral blades of the DG, and the subregion CA3b was targeted for patch-clamp recordings. For D-APV (2 mM) puff experiments, a puffer device (Toohey Company) was set to deliver two to three puffs of 100 ms duration at 3–4 psi during the 2 min of LFF activity. The puffer pipette was placed at least 200 µm away from the recording site, and both the puff pipette and hippocampal slice were positioned to follow the direction of the laminar perfusion flow in a low profile, submersion-type chamber (RC-26GLP, Warner Instruments). Burst-induced facilitation was elicited by 5 pulses at 25 Hz with a 0.03 Hz inter-trial interval for a baseline period of 10 min. Facilitation was measured by calculating the ratio of the mean KAR-EPSC peak of the fifth pulse to the first pulse (P5/P1) before and after bath application of MK-801 (50 µM). To study KAR induced action potentials, CA3 pyramidal cells were whole-cell patch-clamped with internal solution containing (in mM): 112 potassium gluconate, 17 KCl, 0.04 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 10 NaCl, 2 MgATP, 0.2 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, and 2 MK-801, pH 7.2 (280–285 mOsm). Current-clamped CA3 cells were held at −70 mV during burst stimulation of mfs (5 pulses at 25 Hz) to monitor evoked action potentials. Spike transfer was measured by quantifying mean number of spikes/burst for a 10 min period before and after bath application of MK-801 (50 µM). Robust sensitivity to the AMPAR/KAR selective antagonist NBQX (10 µM) confirmed KAR-EPSC responses. Similarly, CA3 pyramidal cells were kept in current-clamp mode for AMPAR-mediated action potential monitoring in the presence of LY303070 (0.5 µM) and picrotoxin (100 µM). AMPAR-mediated mf action potentials were confirmed by blockade of responses following application of DCG-IV (1 µM). Both hilar MCs and CA3 INs were visually patched-loaded with Alexa 594 (35 µM), and morphological identity was confirmed by two-photon laser microscopy at the end of experiments. MCs were voltage-clamped at −70 mV, and a bipolar electrode was placed in the DG to activate mf inputs. The data analysis and inclusion criteria used for mf experiments (described above) was also implemented for MC recordings. CA3 INs were voltage-clamped at −70 mV and burst stimulated, facilitation was assessed as previously mentioned. Both facilitating and depressing mf responses were included for analysis given the diversity of mf to CA3 IN transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toth et al., 2000</xref>). Whole-cell voltage and current-clamp recordings were performed using an Axon MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Signals were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz.

Two weeks post-surgery, mice were sacrificed for electrophysiology or Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments.

For NMDAR/AMPAR ratios, GCs were patch-clamped with the cesium internal solution previously mentioned containing either Alexa 594 (35 µM) for GFP<sup>+</sup> cells (laser tuned to 830 nm/910 nm, respectively) or Alexa 488 (35 µM) for mCherry<sup>+</sup> cells (laser tuned to 910 nm/780 nm, respectively). AMPAR-EPSCs were recorded at −65 mV in the presence of picrotoxin (100 µM) by placing a bipolar electrode near the medial perforant path and delivering a 100 μs pulse width duration using an Isoflex stimulating unit. AMPAR-EPSCs were acquired for at least 5 min followed by bath application of NBQX (10 µM) to isolate NMDAR-EPSCs. GCs were brought to +40 mV to alleviate magnesium block and record optimal NMDAR-EPSCs. NMDAR/AMPAR ratios were measured by taking the mean NMDAR-EPSC/AMPAR-EPSC for a 5 min period of each component. Only acute mouse slices with optimal GFP and mCherry reporter fluorescence (i.e. robust expression, ≥75% of DG fluorescence) were used for electrophysiology, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and BDNF imaging experiments. <italic>Grin1</italic>-floxed animals (The Jackson Laboratory) were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Higley (Yale University).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetics</title><p><italic>Grin1</italic> floxed and control mice of either sexes (P17–P20) were injected with a 1:2 mix of AAV5-CaMKII-CreGFP/AAV-DJ-FLEX-ChIEF-tdTomato viruses targeting the DG, using the same coordinates described above. At least 4 weeks post-surgery, acute hippocampal slices were prepared as previously described, and slices showing optimal GFP and tdTomato expression were used for electrophysiology experiments. Mf optical burst stimulation was elicited by using a Coherent 473 nm laser (4–8 mW) delivering 5 pulses at 25 Hz with a 1–2 ms pulse width duration. Facilitation was measured by taking a ratio of the mean AMPAR-EPSC peak of the fifth pulse to the first pulse (P5/P1) in control and <italic>Grin1</italic>-cKO animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Two-photon calcium imaging and MNI-glutamate uncaging</title><p>mCherry<sup>+</sup> GCs were patch-loaded with an internal solution containing in (mM): 130 KMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 HEPES, 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.4 NaGTP, 10 sodium phosphocreatine, 0.035 Alexa 594 (red morphological dye), and 0.2 Fluo-5F (green calcium indicator), 280–285 mOsm. KOH was used to adjust pH. GCs near the hilar border were avoided and GCs that exhibited adult-born GC electrophysiological properties were excluded from analysis. GCs were kept in voltage clamp configuration at −50 mV for at least 1 hr to allow the diffusion of dyes to mf boutons. Recordings were obtained in ACSF solution containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 glucose, 0.01 NBQX, 0.1 picrotoxin, and 0.01 D-serine. Using an Ultima 2P laser scanning microscope (Bruker Corp) equipped with an Insight Deep See laser (Spectra Physics) tuned to 830 nm, the ‘red’ photomultiplier tube (PMT) was turned on and with minimal pockel power the red signal was used to identify the mf axon. With 512 × 512 pixel resolution, mf axons were followed for at least 200 µm from the DG toward CA3, until bouton structures were morphologically identified and measured (&gt;3 μm in diameter). GCs were switched to current-clamp mode held at −70 mV and 1 ms current injections were used to elicit a burst of 5 action potentials at 25 Hz. Using line scan analysis software (PrairieView 5.4, Bruker Corp.), a line was drawn across the diameter of the bouton at a magnification of at least 16×. The ‘green’ PMT channel was turned on, and 1000 line scans were acquired in a 2 s period. Action potential induction was delayed for 400 ms to collect a baseline fluorescence time period. Calcium transients (CaTs) were acquired with a 1 min inter-trial-interval and analyzed using the ΔG/R calculation: (G − G<sub>0</sub>)/R. CaTs from control animals were compared to <italic>Grin1-</italic>cKO by taking the mean peak ΔG/R value for a 30 ms period of the fifth action potential. In similar fashion, CaT signals in acute rat hippocampal slices were acquired and tested for sensitivity to D-APV (100 µM) while adjusting ACSF MgS0<sub>4</sub> concentration to 1.3 mM and CaCl<sub>2</sub> to 2.5 mM in the absence of NBQX.</p><p>For glutamate uncaging experiments, GCs that were mCherry<sup>+</sup> were patch-loaded using the internal solution previously described, and a small volume (12 mL) of recirculated ACSF solution containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 glucose, 2.5 MNI-glutamate, 0.01 NBQX, 0.1 picrotoxin, and 0.01 D-serine. A MaiTai HP laser (Spectra Physics) was tuned to 720 nm to optimally uncage glutamate and elicit CaTs in GC dendritic spines. Following the measurement of CaTs in GC spines, mf boutons were identified and to mimic bursting activity, five uncaging pulses (1 ms duration) were delivered at 25 Hz. The acquired CaTs in spines and boutons were analyzed using the ΔG/R calculation in control and <italic>Grin1</italic>-cKO animals. In a subset of control boutons, D-APV (100 µM) was applied to detect CaT sensitivity to NMDAR antagonism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Two-photon BDNF-phluorin imaging</title><p><italic>Grin1</italic> floxed and control mice of both sexes (P16-20) were injected with a 1:2 mix of AAV5-CaMKII-mCherryCre/AAV-DJ-DIO-BDNF-phluorin viruses targeting the DG using the same coordinates as above. At least 4 weeks post-surgery, acute hippocampal slices were prepared as previously described, and slices showing optimal GFP and mCherry expression were taken for imaging sessions. For stimulation, a monopolar micropipette electrode was placed in the <italic>stratum lucidum</italic> at least 250 µm away from the imaging site. The Insight Deep See laser (Spectra Physics) was tuned to 880 nm, and the imaging site was selected by the appearance of fibers and bouton structures in the <italic>stratum lucidum</italic>. Using 512 × 512 pixel resolution identified boutons measuring at least 3 μm in diameter were selected as a region of interest (ROI) magnified to 4–6×, and a baseline acquisition of 100 consecutive images at 1 Hz using T-series software (PrairieView 5.4, Bruker Corp.) was acquired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2014</xref>). Following the baseline acquisition, a repetitive stimulation consisting of 125 pulses at 25 Hz was delivered 2×, triggering an acquisition of 200 consecutive images at 1 Hz. The fluorescence intensity of the bouton ROI was measured using ImageJ software to calculate ΔF/F of the BDNF-pHluorin signal. To verify reactivity of the ROI, an isosmotic solution of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (50 mM) was added at the end of the imaging session as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Park et al., 2014</xref>). The same experimental and analysis procedure was implemented to measure BDNF release triggered by mf burst stimulation consisting of 5 pulses at 100 Hz, 50×, every 0.5 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Viruses</title><p>AAV5-CaMKII-eGFP and AAV5-CaMKII-CreGFP viruses were acquired from UPenn Vector Core.

Postsynaptic NMDA receptors are critically involved in learning and memory as coincidence detectors in Hebbian plasticity. Some studies, however, have reported that NMDA receptors may function in more unconventional manners. This paper provides strong evidence for presynaptic NMDA receptors at a specific subset of hippocampal mossy-fibre boutons. Electron microscopy, electrophysiology, optogenetics, calcium imaging, and genetic manipulation yield compelling evidence that supports the main conclusions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Presynaptic NMDA receptors facilitate short-term plasticity and BDNF release at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Per Jesper Sjöström (Reviewer #2); Kenneth A Pelkey (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Experimental:</p><p>Re-evaluation of the preNMDAR blockade effect on frequency facilitation under more physiological [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o (1.2 mM) and temperature is essential given the precedents for unique modes of mossy fiber release with unique Ca<sup>2+</sup> source dependencies at variable [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o levels and temperatures. Since change in cleft glutamate concentration could impact how and when presynaptic receptors are activated, this new data would be important to establish the physiological relevance of the authors' findings.</p><p>While re-evaluation of the calcium imaging experiments in physiological temperature and divalent concentration is not required. Please, provide a thorough and careful discussion on the limitation of the experimental conditions used in this study.</p><p>2) Explanation:</p><p>The authors convincingly demonstrate the involvement of preNMDARs in both LFF and burst facilitation at mossy fiber synapses. While the proposed mechanism for preNMDAR activation during burst facilitation is fairly straightforward, it is less clear how the requirements for ionotropic NMDAR activation are met during low-frequency 1 Hz stimulation. Please, comment on how the glutamate from a presynaptic spike can activate preNMDARs at 1 Hz when the depolarization from that spike is gone. Although this could work at some higher frequency, when the subsequent spikes in a burst provide the necessary depolarization, it is not clear how this would work at 1 Hz.</p><p>The mechanism of relief for preNMDAR voltage dependent block needs to be thoroughly discussed (but not necessarily experimentally solved). MFB recordings reveal APs with sub ms half durations even following use dependent spike broadening, this duration makes it difficult to expect that the presynaptic spikes themselves can support depolarization of sufficient duration to relieve the block. These MFB spikes do exhibit ADPs that could sum but published traces (at 5Hz MFB APs) do not support significant summated depolarization of the ADPs within the terminal (Geiger and Jonas, Neuron 2000).</p><p>3) Clarification:</p><p>In the calcium imaging experiments signal-to-noise ratio appears to be poor on Figure 5, 6, S5 and S6, where responses are typically well below 5%. This is echoed by the fuzzy Fluo5-F example images, making conclusions drawn from the data not particularly strong. In some cases, perhaps the wrong images were shown? Maybe images did not render correctly in the PDF I look at? Please clarify.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The immunocytochemistry images are blurry; the synaptic vesicles are not clearly visible in the presynaptic terminal. It would be great to provide better quality illustrations for these experiments.</p><p>2. Optogenetic experiments shown in Figure 4A-C demonstrating a role for preNMDAR in short-term facilitation: The authors demonstrate that Grin1-cKO decreases P5/P1. The narrative suggests that this change should be attributed to a decrease in P5. However, in the example shown, P5 appears similar in control and in Grin1-cKO, while P1 appears to be increased in Grin1-cKO. Are there changes in basal release in Grin1-cKO animals?</p><p>3. From the images presented in Figure 5B, it is hard to evaluate where the boutons are recorded from.</p><p>4. For both uncaging and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments, data recorded in control mice is compared to data recorded in Grin1-cKO animals. Pharmacological blockade of NMDARs in the same boutons would provide more insight on the relative contribution of preNMDAR to presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients evoked by somatic APs or glutamate uncaging pulses.</p><p>5. Is there a special relationship between NMDAR and BDNF release? Or is it just that Grin1-cKO boutons experience a lower total Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during the MF stimulation paradigm?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is succinct and well-written, making it a pleasure to read. A caveat of the study is that the imaging experiments presented appear to have very low signal:noise, preventing convincing conclusions to be drawn. In addition, while the BDNF finding is potentially important and supports the presence of preNMDARs, it seems to be largely disconnected from the rest of the story. Finally, it is not clear how preNMDAR autoreceptors can signal ionotropically at 1 Hz. These issues are elaborated in the points below. Nonetheless, these issues do not affect the overall conclusions of the paper, which is well-grounded with good experimental design and execution. We believe this paper should be highly suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after these points have been addressed.</p><p>1. BDNF: The finding that preNMDARs contribute to BDNF release is very intriguing. However, it seems to be just loosely linked to the rest of the story. Could this be tied in better somehow? In Figure 7, the authors elicit BDNF release through a repeated &quot;burst&quot; stimulation of 125 pulses at 25 Hz. I think the use of the word &quot;burst&quot; for this kind of sustained stimulation is misleading, especially in comparison with previous figures where burst stimulation consisted of 5 pulses. I also wonder why the authors used this form of stimulation, as opposed other stimulation protocols like TBS, which is both effective at eliciting BDNF release (Balkowiec and Katz, 2002) and more closely mimics GCs' sparse, bursting activity in vivo (Pernia-Andrade and Jonas, 2014). In Figure 7, if Grin1-cKO reduces BDNF release physiologically, one would expect the baseline BDNF-pHluorin signal to be significantly higher in the cKO compared to the control. Has this been compared?</p><p>2. Statistics and Controls: In Figure 8, unlike in previous figures, it is not shown whether controls were done to check for stability of responses over time, either in interneurons or hilar mossy cells. This is particularly missed in 8B, as s. lucidum interneurons can show synapse-type specific long-term plasticity that affects burst facilitation (Toth et al., 2000). The mixed responses shown in 8C may reflect the synaspe dichotomy shown by Toth et al., and it could be difficult to conclude about the role of preNMDARs at interneuron synapses without further exploration of these differences. The paired t-tests used throughout the paper provide a powerful internal comparison (Figure 1, S2, 3, 4, 8). However, as these experiments involves two rounds of LFF induction over time, drug treatment is not the only variable. Dialysis of cells after gaining whole-cell access, potential changes in efficacy of consecutive LFF induction and cell death after axotomy (Figure 3, S4), for example, can also have large influences on the results. Therefore, naive/solvent controls (like Figure S2, 3B, 3D, 4E, 4G) should have been done for each set of experiments and compared statistically with the drug treatment groups (i.e. After/before of control vs. after/before of drug treatment groups with one-way ANOVA or equivalent tests). N numbers were given in boutons/spines. It was unclear how many cells/slices/biological repeats were performed. The n=6-10 spines/boutons seem rather small. Please clarify.</p><p>3.

We have performed new experiments at 35ºC and 1.2 mM Ca<sup>+2</sup> and 1.2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> extracellular concentration and present our findings in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Under these more physiological experimental conditions, we show that preNMDARs contribute to burst-induced facilitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Explanation:</p><p>The authors convincingly demonstrate the involvement of preNMDARs in both LFF and burst facilitation at mossy fiber synapses. While the proposed mechanism for preNMDAR activation during burst facilitation is fairly straightforward, it is less clear how the requirements for ionotropic NMDAR activation are met during low-frequency 1 Hz stimulation. Please, comment on how the glutamate from a presynaptic spike can activate preNMDARs at 1 Hz when the depolarization from that spike is gone. Although this could work at some higher frequency, when the subsequent spikes in a burst provide the necessary depolarization, it is not clear how this would work at 1 Hz.</p><p>The mechanism of relief for preNMDAR voltage dependent block needs to be thoroughly discussed (but not necessarily experimentally solved). MFB recordings reveal APs with sub ms half durations even following use dependent spike broadening, this duration makes it difficult to expect that the presynaptic spikes themselves can support depolarization of sufficient duration to relieve the block. These MFB spikes do exhibit ADPs that could sum but published traces (at 5Hz MFB APs) do not support significant summated depolarization of the ADPs within the terminal (Geiger and Jonas, Neuron 2000).</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased the reviewers note we convincingly demonstrate the involvement of preNMDARs in both LFF and burst facilitation in mossy fiber synapses. We also wondered about the mechanism underlying preNMDAR activation at 1 Hz. In our revised manuscript (Lines 367-378), we attempted an explanation as follows: “There is evidence that preNMDARs can operate as coincidence detectors at some synapses (Duguid, 2013; Wong et al., 2020). […] By alleviating the magnesium blockade, these potentials might reduce the need for coincidence detection and transiently boost the functional impact of mf preNMDARs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Clarification:</p><p>In the calcium imaging experiments signal-to-noise ratio appears to be poor on Figure 5, 6, S5 and S6, where responses are typically well below 5%.

Optogenetic experiments shown in Figure 4A-C demonstrating a role for preNMDAR in short-term facilitation: The authors demonstrate that Grin1-cKO decreases P5/P1.

Is there a special relationship between NMDAR and BDNF release?

A previous study suggested presynaptic Ca<sup>+2</sup> influx via preNMDARs during repetitive stimulation, together with calcium released from internal stores, contributes to BDNF release at corticostriatal synapses (Park et al., Neuron 2014). While we have not measured Ca<sup>+2</sup> influx during our MF stimulation paradigm, our observations are consistent with reductions in presynaptic Ca<sup>+2</sup> influx underlying diminished BDNF release in <italic>Grin1</italic>-cKO boutons, and we do not discard the potential contribution of internal calcium stores.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript is succinct and well-written, making it a pleasure to read. A caveat of the study is that the imaging experiments presented appear to have very low signal:noise, preventing convincing conclusions to be drawn. In addition, while the BDNF finding is potentially important and supports the presence of preNMDARs, it seems to be largely disconnected from the rest of the story. Finally, it is not clear how preNMDAR autoreceptors can signal ionotropically at 1 Hz. These issues are elaborated in the points below. Nonetheless, these issues do not affect the overall conclusions of the paper, which is well-grounded with good experimental design and execution. We believe this paper should be highly suitable for publication in eLife after these points have been addressed.</p><p>1. BDNF: The finding that preNMDARs contribute to BDNF release is very intriguing. However, it seems to be just loosely linked to the rest of the story. Could this be tied in better somehow? In Figure 7, the authors elicit BDNF release through a repeated &quot;burst&quot; stimulation of 125 pulses at 25 Hz. I think the use of the word &quot;burst&quot; for this kind of sustained stimulation is misleading, especially in comparison with previous figures where burst stimulation consisted of 5 pulses. I also wonder why the authors used this form of stimulation, as opposed other stimulation protocols like TBS, which is both effective at eliciting BDNF release (Balkowiec and Katz, 2002) and more closely mimics GCs' sparse, bursting activity in vivo (Pernia-Andrade and Jonas, 2014).</p></disp-quote><p>The 125-pulse, 25 Hz stimulation protocol is commonly used to induce LTP at the mossy fiber to CA3 pyramidal cell synapse. Given that LTP at this synapse requires BDNF release, we decided to use this protocol first. We agree with the reviewer that TBS patterns of activity more closely mimic GC bursting activity in vivo. New experiments, now included in Figure 7—figure supplement 1, showed that BDNF release by more physiological burst stimulation is also reduced in the absence of preNMDARs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7, if Grin1-cKO reduces BDNF release physiologically, one would expect the baseline BDNF-pHluorin signal to be significantly higher in the cKO compared to the control. Has this been compared?</p></disp-quote><p>We have compared the baseline BDNF-pHluorin raw signals in Control and <italic>Grin1</italic>-cKO and found no significant difference (Control: 353.6 ± 72, n = 12 slices; <italic>Grin1</italic>-cKO: 286.6 ± 29, n = 10 slices; p = 0.435, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test). Our findings suggest that preNMDARs facilitate BDNF release in an activity-dependent manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Statistics and Controls: In Figure 8, unlike in previous figures, it is not shown whether controls were done to check for stability of responses over time, either in interneurons or hilar mossy cells. This is particularly missed in 8B, as s. lucidum interneurons can show synapse-type specific long-term plasticity that affects burst facilitation (Toth et al., 2000). The mixed responses shown in 8C may reflect the synaspe dichotomy shown by Toth et al., and it could be difficult to conclude about the role of preNMDARs at interneuron synapses without further exploration of these differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the stability experiments for CA3 interneurons and hilar mossy cells that we did not include in the original submission (see Figure 8—figure supplement 1). In response to the reviewer’s comment regarding facilitating and depressing CA3 inhibitory neurons, our data is now split into two groups i.e. facilitating and depressing synaptic inputs. NMDAR antagonism still had no effect on either population (Figure 8B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paired t-tests used throughout the paper provide a powerful internal comparison (Figure 1, S2, 3, 4, 8). However, as these experiments involves two rounds of LFF induction over time, drug treatment is not the only variable. Dialysis of cells after gaining whole-cell access, potential changes in efficacy of consecutive LFF induction and cell death after axotomy (Figure 3, S4), for example, can also have large influences on the results. Therefore, naive/solvent controls (like Figure S2, 3B, 3D, 4E, 4G) should have been done for each set of experiments and compared statistically with the drug treatment groups (i.e. After/before of control vs. after/before of drug treatment groups with one-way ANOVA or equivalent tests). N numbers were given in boutons/spines. It was unclear how many cells/slices/biological repeats were performed. The n=6-10 spines/boutons seem rather small. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The design of most of our experiments included internal controls. We understand this approach is one of the best ways to deal with variability across experiments.

While we have no evidence for or against this possibility, direct demonstration likely requires uncaging NMDA onto identified presynaptic boutons in the presence of a cocktail of VGCC blockers. We did not pursue this avenue given the high cost and low benefit ratio of these experiments. As denoted by the reviewer, Chamberland et al., 2020 demonstrated P/Q and N-type VGCC blockade entirely eliminates MF-CA3 transmission –also reported in the Castillo et al., 1994 study. These studies strongly suggest that the bulk of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise that triggers neurotransmitter release is mediated by VGCCs, suggesting that preNMDARs mainly play a regulatory role by boosting release.</p><p>As for a potential role of preNMDARs in facilitating spontaneous AP-independent release, elucidating such role is not straightforward given that mossy fiber inputs comprise a small fraction of the excitatory synapses impinging on a CA3 pyramidal neuron. As a result, a potential reduction in mEPSC activity by NMDAR antagonism (or genetic <italic>Grin1</italic> removal from GCs) is likely to be lost in the background activity. In this context, it is worth noting that consistent with previous reports (Kamiya and Ozawa, J Physiol 1999; Kamiya et al., J Physiol 1996), we have evidence that the mGluR2/3 agonist DCG-IV (1-2 µM), which virtually abolishes evoked mossy fiber transmission, has a minimal effect on mEPSC activity in CA3 pyramidal cells. Thus, there are little reasons to believe that a significant reduction in mEPSC activity could be detected in CA3 pyramidal neurons following NMDAR antagonism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The presynaptic calcium imaging experiments provide convincing evidence for CaTs mediated by presynaptic NMDARs.
