Although Myo10-driven filopodial dynamics have been characterized, there is no information about the absolute number of Myo10 molecules during the filopodial lifecycle. To better understand molecular stoichiometries and packing restraints in filopodia, we measured Myo10 abundance in these structures. We combined SDS-PAGE densitometry with epifluorescence microscopy to quantitate HaloTag-labeled Myo10 in U2OS cells. About 6% of total intracellular Myo10 localizes to filopodia, where it enriches at opposite cellular ends. Hundreds of Myo10s are in a typical filopodium, and their distribution across filopodia is log-normal. Some filopodial tips even contain more Myo10 than accessible binding sites on the actin filament bundle. Live-cell movies reveal a dense cluster of over a hundred Myo10 molecules that initiates filopodial elongation. Hundreds of Myo10 molecules continue to accumulate during filopodial growth, but accumulation ceases when retraction begins. Rates of filopodial elongation, second-phase elongation, and retraction are inversely related to Myo10 quantities. Our estimates of Myo10 molecules in filopodia provide insight into the physics of packing Myo10, its cargo, and other filopodia-associated proteins in narrow membrane compartments. Our protocol provides a framework for future work analyzing Myo10 abundance and distribution upon perturbation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>filopodia</kwd><kwd>myosin 10</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>protein quantitation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM144292</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shangguan</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2140001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shangguan</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM124272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rock</surname><given-names>Ronald S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM149073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rock</surname><given-names>Ronald S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Improved technology for counting proteins captures myosin 10 dynamics throughout the filopodial lifecycle, defines requirements for initiating filopodia, and reveals a crowded filopodial tip where motors frequently exceed available actin.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myosins are a group of motor proteins that travel along the cell’s dynamic cytoskeletal highways, binding actin and using ATP as fuel. Apart from myosin 2, the other &gt;40 classes are considered ‘unconventional’ and often include membrane and cargo-binding tail domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Odronitz and Kollmar, 2007</xref>). A myosin of particular interest is myosin 10 (Myo10), a motor protein well known for its role in cellular protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerber and Cheney, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008</xref>). These protrusions, termed filopodia, comprise tightly packed, parallel actin filaments and participate in a multitude of processes such as phagocytosis, directed cell migration, growth-cone guidance, and cell-cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008</xref>). Myo10 has key implications in health dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courson and Cheney, 2015</xref>). For example, upregulated Myo10 is tied to increased genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayca Pozo et al., 2021</xref>) and breast cancer aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Myo10’s role in filopodia has been widely investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerber and Cheney, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Courson and Cheney, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tokuo and Ikebe, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tokuo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raines et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arjonen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heimsath et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Summerbell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miihkinen et al., 2021</xref>). Myo10 expression increases dorsal filopodia, and the cargo-binding tail domains, MyTH4 and FERM, are crucial for filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohil et al., 2006</xref>). When Myo10 is overexpressed, it produces many Myo10 tip-localized filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg and Cheney, 2002</xref>). Estimations on Myo10-positive filopodia length, average number of filopodia per area, and the velocities of extension and retraction have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerber and Cheney, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cirilo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petersen et al., 2016</xref>). However, questions regarding the quantity and distribution of Myo10 molecules within the cell still linger. Published images of Myo10 show its prominent localization in the filopodial tip, but a pool of Myo10 in the cell body remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kenchappa et al., 2020</xref>). A quantitative understanding of Myo10 localization could provide further insight into filopodial dynamics, how the crowded environment inside a thin filopodium affects the composition of the filopodial tip complex, and ultimately how Myo10 dysregulation connects to pathology.</p><p>Studies estimating protein numbers in subcellular compartments have been conducted before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu and Pollard, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malla et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loiodice et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sayyad and Pollard, 2022</xref>). Methods include super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sayyad and Pollard, 2022</xref>), mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin et al., 2013</xref>), quantitative western blots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu and Pollard, 2005</xref>), and photobleaching experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hummert et al., 2021</xref>). We describe here a simple imaging and analysis method exploiting HaloTag labeling technology applied to Myo10 and filopodia. Similar to quantitative western blotting of GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu and Pollard, 2005</xref>), our strategy relies on SDS-PAGE densitometry using a fluorescent protein standard to estimate the mean number of Myo10 molecules per cell. In parallel fluorescence microscopy work, we record the fluorescent intensity per cell and convert the per-pixel fluorescent signal to the local number of molecules.</p><p>We find that the bulk of Myo10 remains in the cell body, with hundreds of Myo10s in each filopodium. Myo10 is unevenly distributed across a cell’s filopodia, and some filopodial tips have an excess of Myo10 over accessible actin filament-binding sites. Filopodial initiation from the membrane occurs from a median-sized cluster of 160 Myo10 molecules. Hundreds of Myo10 molecules continue to accumulate in filopodial puncta during filopodial extension phases, but accumulation ceases during filopodial retraction. Nascent filopodial extension, second-phase extension, and retraction rates all diminish with increasing Myo10 amounts, suggesting that a large number of motors suppress filopodial dynamics. Having the number of Myo10 molecules contextualizes interactions of Myo10 with its cargo, the plasma membrane and actin, building a picture of a densely packed filopodial tip compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HaloTag-based cellular protein quantitation for microscopy</title><p>We expressed human HaloTag-Myo10 in U2OS cells to visualize its behavior in filopodia. Wildtype U2OS cells produce few filopodia, but exogenous expression of Myo10 induces abundant surface-attached filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This induction suggests that Myo10 is a limiting reagent for filopodia in U2OS cells and allows us to assess the impact of variable Myo10 expression levels. HaloTag labeling was selected due to its high-efficiency binding and the commercial availability of a HaloTag standard protein with a known concentration. Our human, full-length Myo10 construct has an N-terminal HaloTag and C-terminal Flag-tag.

First, we loaded lysate from a known number of Myo10-transfected U2OS cells on an SDS-PAGE gel along with known amounts of HaloTag standard protein, a 61 kDa HaloTag-GST fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Because all samples were incubated with TMR-HaloTag ligand, we use the standard protein’s fluorescence emission in the gel to generate a standard curve and estimate the mean number of Myo10 molecules per cell by densitometry. We propagate the 95% CI from the gel standard curve for our subsequent error estimates. In parallel, we measured TMR-HaloTag Myo10 molecules for the same set of transfected U2OS cells using epifluorescence microscopy. From these measurements, we obtain the total background-subtracted fluorescence intensity for each of the ~50-cell biological replicates (independent transfections on different days) per fixed- and live-cell experiments. We used these totals to determine the fluorescence signal per molecule by microscopy. Both microscopy and gel samples were labeled with excess HaloTag ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, D and E</xref>) to ensure maximal labeling of Myo10 molecules with no detectable nonspecific labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). All Myo10 molecule measurements accounted for our measured 90% TMR-HaloLigand labeling efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Importantly, wildtype U2OS cells do not express detectable levels of Myo10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and generate few filopodia. Therefore, essentially all Myo10 molecules carry the HaloTag label, and these molecules are responsible for inducing the filopodia that we observe. We pooled measurements from the three bioreplicates, resulting in the analysis of 150 cells of varying Myo10 expression levels in fixed-cell experiments, and 168 cells in live-cell experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Limited quantities of Myo10 in filopodia</title><p>We start with observations in fixed cells that report the distribution of Myo10 throughout U2OS cells.

If these influences operate beyond the average separation between filopodia, we might see correlated spatial patterns of higher and lower Myo10 density along the edge of the cell. Indeed, Myo10 is not uniformly distributed, instead concentrating in cellular zones at opposing sides of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Sectors of the cell with the highest quantity of Myo10 have neighboring sectors that are also high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, left). Moreover, these high-signal sectors have more Myo10 puncta, as does the opposite side of the cell. Thus, there is a periodic high-low-high-low pattern of punctum density on the cell’s perimeter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, center; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for an example cell). We define puncta as any cluster/spot of Myo10 detected by segmentation (see Methods for details on image segmentation analysis). However, the number of Myo10 per filopodium is relatively constant on average around the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, right). Potentially a local activation signal initiates filopodia at a particular site, and then the signal spreads from the high Myo10 zone to generate more puncta in the immediate vicinity. Likewise, sectors of the cell with low Myo10 levels tend to be surrounded by fewer Myo10 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, center).

Because log-normal distributions have long tails, we wondered how filopodia can support the movement of extreme Myo10 levels at filopodial tips. To address this question, we compared Myo10 concentrations to the amount of available actin sites in filopodia. We randomly selected a set of 90 filopodial tip-localized Myo10 puncta and measured the apparent length of the punctum. These lengths vary from ~250 nm (diffraction limited) to just over 1.5 µm in the case of the most elongated punctum.

Adequate temperature control of the sample was also crucial, as the U2OS cells would rapidly contract their filopodia in response to cold. We identified and focused on three events in the filopodial lifecycle: filopodial initiation from a Myo10 punctum that appears at the plasma membrane, second-phase elongation from a Myo10 tip punctum in an established filopodium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>), and filopodial retraction.</p><p>Because Myo10 seems to be limiting filopodial production in U2OS cells, we wondered how many Myo10 molecules are needed for filopodial initiation.

Such a Myo10-induced multi-cycle filopodial elongation mechanism has been previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2017</xref>). We find a median of 290 Myo10 molecules organize and form the separate punctum at the start of second-phase elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This number represents about double the number of Myo10 involved in nascent elongation (median: 160). Retracting Myo10 puncta initially contain a median of 240 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Both the initial punctum and the second-phase punctum accumulate additional Myo10 molecules over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). To estimate the accumulated amount, we took the last point of each trajectory and performed a t-test against the null hypothesis of a zero mean. Initial puncta accumulate a mean of 95 molecules (95% CI: 74, 120; t=8.8; df = 236; p-value = 2.7*10<sup>–16</sup>), while second-phase puncta accumulate 307 molecules (95% CI: 130, 480; t=3.5; df = 50; p-value = 0.001). However, unlike these two filopodial growth processes, retracting Myo10 puncta remain relatively constant as they return to the cell body (mean: –73 molecules; 95% CI: −140,–10; t=–2.3; df = 57; p-value = 0.025; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). When retracting filopodia reach the cell body, the punctum often dissipates. However in a few cases, a new Myo10 punctum will coalesce and emerge from the location of a previous one (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Increasing quantities of Myo10 slow the punctum movements in all phases of the filopodial lifecycle</title><p>Finally, we wondered how the speeds of filopodial elongation and retraction are related to the number of Myo10 molecules in a tip punctum. Such values would help to constrain models that depend on Myo10 flux to deliver components to the filopodial tip or to generate force at the tip to assist actin polymerization. Interestingly, speeds of tip puncta during filopodial initiation, second-phase elongation, and retraction are all inversely related to the amount of Myo10 in the punctum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>). In each case, fewer molecules are associated with a higher variance in speed. The median speed of elongating Myo10 puncta is 160 nm/s, which is similar to previously published values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kerber et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerber and Cheney, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with the trend of more molecules resulting in slower puncta velocities, the larger puncta involved in second-phase elongation display a slower median speed of 110 nm/s. The median speed of retracting Myo10 puncta is 110 nm/s, similar to previously reported values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref>). For retracting puncta moving faster than actin retrograde flow, the velocity of Myo10 likely reflects a collapse of the whole filopodium or other complex filopodial dynamics. Our live movies capture some of these non-constant Myo10 retrograde events. <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video4">Figure 4—video 4</xref> exemplifies a decreasing intensity trajectory, wherein a Myo10 punctum rapidly ‘snaps’ closer to the cell body before diffusing into the cytoplasm. The ‘snap’ could be explained by the filopodium undergoing coiling or buckling, possibly induced in part by Myo10-generated force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leijnse et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leijnse et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limited activation of Myo10</title><p>Myo10 is the limiting reagent for constructing filopodia in U2OS cells, but less than 20% arrives in filopodia when exogenously expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). There is ample time for Myo10 to diffuse from the cytosolic pool to the numerous filopodial sites present in these cells, where it would then be captured. Thus, we expect that most of the cytosolic pool of Myo10 is in an inactive, autoinhibited state. Available PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> (PIP<sub>3</sub>) in the cell could be limiting the portion of free intracellular Myo10 that is activated and entering filopodia. Umeki et al. proposed that Myo10 binds PIP<sub>3</sub> at cell peripheries and dimerizes, becomes activated, and converges local actin filaments to form the filopodial base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Umeki et al., 2011</xref>). Although Myo10 can participate in filopodia formation independently of VASP proteins and substrate attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohil et al., 2006</xref>), other proteins have been found to be conserved in mechanisms of filopodia initiation. Components such as Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krugmann et al., 2001</xref>), formin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alieva et al., 2019</xref>), Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Korobova and Svitkina, 2008</xref>), neurofascin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peuhu et al., 2022</xref>), or VASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lebrand et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthur et al., 2021</xref>) could also be prospective limiting partners of Myo10 entry into filopodia.</p><p>Prior information on the absolute number of Myo10 molecules in filopodia is sparse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kerber et al., 2009</xref> transfected HeLa cells with low levels of GFP-Myo10 (6–12 hr post-transfection) and found 20–200 molecules at the filopodial tip (). These levels are consistent with the range that we measure here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The shorter time post-transfection clearly affects Myo10 expression levels, which is evident in our data. Fixed-cell experiments had higher Myo10 expression overall (48 hr post-transfection) compared to live-cell experiments (24 hr post-transfection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Myo10 accretion into filopodial puncta</title><p>The distribution of Myo10 among filopodial puncta is log-normal rather than normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This stands in contrast to more consistent, normally distributed quantities of other actin-binding proteins. In fission yeast, proteins in the spindle pole body (e.g. Sad1p), at the cytokinetic contractile ring (e.g. Myo2p, Rho GEF Rgf1p), and within actin patches (e.g. ARPC1, capping protein Acp2p) did not display the wide concentration ranges that we saw for Myo10 in filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu and Pollard, 2005</xref>). We propose several reasons for the non-Gaussian distribution of Myo10 molecules. Log-normal distributions are commonly associated with growth processes, and the accumulation of Myo10 at filopodial tips fits this description. Filopodia have a large capacity for additional Myo10, and an ample reserve of unactivated Myo10 remains in the cytosol. Slow activation of Myo10 would then allow its travel down filopodia and accretion into puncta. Filopodia operate far from saturation, enabling relatively unrestricted Myo10 accumulation. In contrast, we suspect that the spindle pole body, cytokinetic ring, and actin patches represent cytoskeletal systems constructed from one or more limiting reagents. Limiting reagents put an upper bound on the growth of the system and lead to normal distributions at saturation.</p><p>Furthermore, the end requirements of cytokinesis and filopodial formation differ. Cytokinesis is a tightly regulated process involving a balance of forces, and the precise timing of each stage has been described in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). Disruptions to components of the contractile ring, such as myosin inhibition, affect rates of actin filament disassembly and ring constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malla et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, there is no specific number of filopodia that cells aim to create nor is there an optimal number of Myo10 per filopodium. Therefore, filopodia formation is a much more permissive process than cytokinesis, which could also explain the variation in values we observe of Myo10 compared to contractile ring-associated proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Non-uniform Myo10 filopodial distribution</title><p>Myo10 tends to accumulate in filopodia that are at opposite sides of the cell. These high Myo10 sectors have a higher density of filopodia but a similar quantity of Myo10 per filopodium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). We hypothesize a few different explanations for why Myo10 and filopodia not equally distributed around the cell. Potentially, Myo10 is funneled into filopodia that are moving toward specific environmental stimuli that simultaneously affect Myo10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meyen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Efremov et al., 2022</xref>). For example, local generation of PIP<sub>3</sub> might serve to dock and activate Myo10 in focused regions of the plasma membrane, such as the basolateral surfaces of polarized MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). The docked but diffusing Myo10 is then more likely to initiate and elongate new filopodium. This overall diffusion and capture process for Myo10 has been observed at the single-molecule level in cells, where it has been described as a 3D to 2D to 1D reduction in dimensionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baboolal et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, Myo10 could be responding to information encoded in the actin network itself (e.g. nearby stress fibers) or other local signaling molecules. Myosins can differentiate the structural and chemical properties of actin filaments, including age, tension, curvature, post-translational modifications, and multifilament architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santos et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, actin filament networks could be partly responsible for choreographing Myo10 trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santos et al., 2020</xref>). Future studies could identify potential guidance cues that trigger the initiation of Myo10-positive filopodia.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>An excess of Myo10 at the filopodial tip</title><p>A major finding of this work is that there is often an excess of Myo10 at filopodial tips over the available actin-binding sites for myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>). Interestingly, there is a mechanism that continues to push Myo10 into the filopodia, even when there may not be available actin to bind. This observation points to two notable features of motility in filopodial systems. The first is that there is no mechanism for a filopodium to shut off entry at the base when the tip is already overfilled with Myo10. The two sites are functionally independent of each other, although retracting filopodia differ in this regard (see below). The second is that Myo10 does not pack in an orderly fashion at the filopodial tip. Although our observations are in the context of an overexpression system, we note that immunofluorescence staining of endogenous Myo10 also shows occasional high-intensity, bulbous filopodial tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg and Cheney, 2002</xref>). Our concentration estimates at the filopodial tip suggest that there is sufficient plasma membrane area for the Myo10. Therefore, even though Myo10 disengages from actin, it may remain engaged to the plasma membrane through its PH domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). As Myo10 molecules diffuse out of the concentrated region at the tip, they can encounter open sites on the actin filament bundle and reengage, walking back to the tip.</p><p>The structural model of the filopodium discussed above assumes an orderly, hexagonally closely packed bundle structure all the way to the filopodial tip. Consistent with this picture, EM images of mouse melanoma B16F1 cells indicate bundled parallel actin filaments at the filopodial tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Svitkina et al., 2003</xref>). However, this is not always the case. In <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> cells, actin filaments in the filopodia tip can terminate in free ends and/or appear fragmented, by which short actin filaments are arranged into a non-parallel array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Medalia et al., 2007</xref>). Bent filopodial tips in mammalian cells overexpressing GFP-Myo10 can display bulbous membrane extensions containing splayed actin filaments or actin filaments arranged in loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2023</xref>). These fragmented, frayed, or otherwise disorganized ends of the filopodial actin bundle might support more actin-bound Myo10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Indeed, an excess of Myo10 at the tip would compete with actin crosslinkers and help to support fraying. Further investigation is required to understand how Myo10 traffic jams and actin fraying affect the dynamics of actin itself and the activity of its associated proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Number of Myo10 molecules needed for filopodial initiation and second-phase elongation</title><p>We observe a median of 160 Myo10 molecules and a minimum of 52 molecules at filopodial initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These quantities correspond to approximately 5 and 2 molecules per actin filament at a nascent filopodium, respectively. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe et al., 2010</xref> also saw a rapid (2–20 s) accumulation of Myo10 recruitment at filopodial initiation. Myo10 participates in bridging actin filaments in emergent fascin-actin bundles, the actin structures that it prefers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ropars et al., 2016</xref>). Such bridging could help to organize or orient the bundles to allow protrusion, much like the development of the lambda-precursors observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Svitkina et al., 2003</xref>.</p><p>Second-phase filopodial elongation involves more molecules of Myo10, a median of 290 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This increase in number likely reflects the larger available pool of active Myo10 present at an established filopodial tip. Because only 160 molecules are needed for filopodial initiation, we believe that Myo10 quantities do not limit second-phase extension if initiation and second-phase elongation have similar mechanical requirements. Focal adhesion proteins, such as vinculin and integrin-β1, have been previously identified as essential components during the second-phase of filopodia extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2017</xref>). Other actin-associated proteins (e.g. Arp2/3 and vinculin) are also present at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2017</xref>). The duration required for focal adhesion proteins to translocate into a filopodium, coupled with actin crosslinking and bundling in the new filopodium, results in an increased accumulation of Myo10 at the local level. This accumulation is a consequence of Myo10 awaiting interaction with other protein partners at the filopodium tip. We speculate that the entire process takes longer than at the cell body plasma membrane, where the concentration of available focal adhesion proteins is higher.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Myo10 entry into filopodia switches off upon retraction</title><p>Myo10 accumulates within puncta after filopodial initiation and second-phase elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), adding several hundred molecules on the minutes timescale. However, in retracting filopodia, accretion of additional Myo10 ceases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These retracting filopodia frequently have immediate neighbors that are not retracting. Therefore, the mechanism that switches off Myo10 traffic must be highly focused to single filopodia. Moreover, this switching mechanism must operate at the base of the filopodium where the Myo10 traffic would otherwise enter. Two mechanisms seem plausible given these considerations. Either the retracting filopodium generates a Myo10-inhibitory signal that diffuses out and rapidly dissipates, or the actin architecture of the filopodium is altered and blocks Myo10 motility. These findings offer a quantitation of the dynamic behavior of Myo10 during retrograde flow, but further research is necessary to uncover the mechanisms governing switching of filopodial movement.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Multiple motors interfere to slow dynamic movements at the filopodial tip</title><p>The presence of increasing quantities of Myo10 slow filopodial movements in all three phases of the filopodial lifecycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>).

In work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cirilo et al., 2024</xref>, wildtype and fast-mutant Myo3 motors also localize to filopodial tips, and the filopodial elongation rate correlates with the Myo3 speed. Myo3 is a slower motor than Myo10 (70 nm/s vs. 300–600 nm/s), and the Myo3-decorated filopodia move more slowly than we typically observe here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cirilo et al., 2024</xref>).

Our results are within the context of an overexpression system, and other systems expressing endogenous Myo10 may express at a lower overall level than here. However, cells expressing endogenous Myo10 also show prominent dense tip localization by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg and Cheney, 2002</xref>), so the Myo10 organization we see here does exist physiologically. Our goal in this study was to understand Myo10’s role in filopodial initiation and dynamics in a defined system where Myo10 is the limiting factor. U2OS cells express undetectable levels of endogenous Myo10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), so we are indeed observing the influence of Myo10 in a situation where Myo10 is the limiting factor for filopodia formation.</p><p>Regarding aspects of microscopy and automated image processing, very dim Myo10 spots could have escaped detection.

Furthermore, our estimates of molecules are predicated on the calibration curve of the HaloTag standard protein on the SDS-PAGE gels, which is likely the highest source of error on our molecule counts. Despite these concerns, our values still provide a sense of the magnitude of Myo10 molecules within cellular structures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>One of our key findings is the excess of Myo10 compared to available actin at filopodial tips. We propose that there is a sizable population of Myo10 docked on the plasma membrane but not to actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Alternatively, actin filaments that fray from the fascin-actin bundle yield more binding sites for Myo10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Myo10 moves processively along actin bundles, even disorganized ones formed by crowding reagents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nagy et al., 2008</xref>). Any single overloaded filopodium may use either or both mechanisms.</p><p>We argue that there is an interplay between incoming Myo10 that release upon encountering a traffic jam of other Myo10 molecules, and Myo10 molecules that are part of the traffic jam that are ‘pushed off’ (i.e. naturally dissociate and are replaced) by new arrivals. Myo10 cargoes may need to handle either the actin-attached or actin-detached situation, which has implications for force-sensing cargoes such as integrins.</p><p>At the filopodial tip, we expect that newly formed actin will be rapidly occupied by Myo10 due to the high quantity on standby. However, fascin must eventually bind to facilitate the bundling of new actin polymerized at the filopodial tip. While Myo10 cannot bind to the interior of a fascin-actin bundle due to insufficient space, the converse is also true: fascin cannot crosslink at a Myo10-bound actin filament site until the Myo10 dissociates. However, this Myo10 dissociation occurs frequently as part of the stepping process. Once there is an opening, fascin can outcompete Myo10 due to the high avidity interaction between fascin and actin. Fascin binding is essentially irreversible, as we saw no disassembly of a suspended fascin-actin bundle even after 1 hr of continuous buffer wash (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Courson and Rock, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the dynamic association and dissociation of Myo10 at the filopodial tip with subsequent, irreversible fascin binding may be essential for the continued elongation of the filopodium.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Knowing the number of Myo10 molecules in a filopodium provides insight into molecular packing geometries in confined intracellular spaces. This study showcases the high density of molecules that can be packed into tight cellular compartments, captures the number of Myo10 molecules needed for filopodial initiation, and finds that Myo10 entry into filopodia switches off upon filopodial retraction. Our results contribute to understandings of molecular stoichiometries in filopodia and Myo10 abundance in these structures. Our protocol also provides a framework for future studies examining the factors that tune Myo10 density and distribution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Accutase was neutralized with DMEM+10% FBS and the cells were collected with a 3:30 min spin at 400 rcf at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended in 100 µl cell media, and 10 µl of the cells were removed and mixed with 1x Trypan blue for cell counting. The remaining cells were combined with 400 µl cell media and subjected to a 5 min, 400 rcf spin at room temperature. Cells were moved to ice post-spin and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 1 mM PMSF.

Excess TMR-HaloLigand was incubated for 10 min on ice with only lysates from the fixed-cell experiments. All samples were supplemented with an SDS loading buffer (0.1 M DTT, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) and heated at 70°C for 10 min before loading onto a 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free protein gel (Bio-Rad 4568095). The gel was run at 180 V for 45 min and imaged on a ChemiDoc. Images of the stain-free, AF647, and rhodamine channels were taken. We used the Gel Analysis plug-in in ImageJ to compare signal intensity of the gel bands. A standard curve was generated from the HaloTag standard protein TMR signal to estimate the number of Myo10 molecules per total transfected cells loaded (total cells loaded times the fraction transfected).

The gel was transferred to PVDF membrane using a Pierce Power Blotter semi-dry electrophoretic transfer cell (1.3 A constant for 12 min). The blot was blocked with 5% milk in 1x TBST, 1 hr shaking at room temperature. For 1 hr at room temperature, the blot was incubated with anti-Myosin10 (Novus NBP1-87748) and anti-β-tubulin (Invitrogen 22833) antibodies in 5% milk in 1x TBST. The blot was rinsed with 5% milk in 1x TBST for 10 min, three total washes. Then, the blot was incubated with anti-Rabbit-HRP (Cell Signaling 7074) and anti-Mouse-HRP (Cell Signaling 7076) antibodies in 1x TBST, 1 hr shaking at room temperature. After three 10 min washes with 1x TBST, chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific, SuperSignal West Femto, 34094) was applied to the blot for 2 min and subsequently imaged on a Chemidoc.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>TMR-HaloLigand labeling efficiency</title><p>To test TMR-HaloLigand labeling efficiency, 6.8 µM of HaloTag standard protein was labeled with TMR-HaloLigand in 5.8× molar excess in a 20 µl reaction volume, on ice for 10 min. Bio-Beads SM-2 (Bio-Rad 152-8920) were washed with methanol 3×, distilled water 3×, and PBS 3× before they were added to ¼ volume of the reaction. After 1 hr and 40 min at room temperature in the dark, the reaction tube was spun for 3 min, 600 rcf spin. The supernatant was recovered and the absorbance spectrum was measured on Nanodrop. Absorbances at 280 nm and 553 nm were used for protein and dye concentrations, respectively. To account for protein that may have nonspecifically bound to the beads, pre-bead TMR-HaloLigand-labeled HaloTag standard protein was loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel alongside the post-bead supernatant. Comparing the signal intensities of pre- and post-bead gel bands allowed for a corrected post-beads protein concentration value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Ligand labeling saturation for microscopy</title><p>To test ligand labeling saturation for microscopy, cells were fixed for 20 min in a solution comprising: 4% PFA, 0.08% Triton, 1:1000 DAPI in PEM buffer, and a series of TMR-HaloLigand concentrations (in µM: 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5).

Signal inside the convex hull mask was summed. Because there was higher, uneven background that persisted after the rolling ball subtraction in higher TMR-HaloLigand live samples, segmented Myo10 puncta were summed and plotted as well. Plotting only segmented puncta appeared to reduce the contribution of background pixels inside the convex hull mask that could falsely inflate final Myo10 intracellular signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fixed-cell fluorescence microscopy</title><p>For Myo10 fixed-cell imaging, cells were fixed for 20 min in a solution comprising: 4% PFA, 0.08% Triton, 2.5 µM TMR-HaloLigand, and 1:1000 DAPI in PEM buffer. After three PBS washes (4 min each), cells were stained with 1 mM Phalloidin-AF647 (Invitrogen A22287) in 1% BSA for 20 min. Cells were washed 3× with PBS (4 min each) before immediate imaging. Fluorescence images were taken on an Axiovert using a 60× water objective and a gain of 125 ms and 175 ms exposure (below detector saturation). To prevent photobleaching, cells were kept in the dark and imaged immediately upon illumination of the selected field of view. Samples were imaged within a day of preparation. TMR was visualized using green light and AF633 was visualized with red light.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analyzing fixed-cell images</title><p>Image analysis was done using in-house Python scripts. To calculate the number of Myo10 molecules in the fluorescence images, the Myo10-stained images were first background-subtracted: the average signal of a 56×56 pixel square near the cell body was calculated and subtracted from each pixel of the TIFF image. Next, the phalloidin-stained cell image and Myo10-stained image were filtered to remove non-cell objects and subjected to watershed segmentation. To generate a ‘cell body mask’, an erosion function followed by an opening function were applied to the phalloidin-stained cell image. The Myo10 image mask was defined as the ‘total cell mask.’ The ‘cell body mask’ was subtracted from the ‘total cell mask’ for a ‘filopodia mask.’ Connected component analysis (CCA) was performed on the ‘filopodia mask’ to obtain masks for all filopodia-localized Myo10 puncta. For the CCA, pixels were considered neighbors if they were connected through a maximum of two orthogonal hops. Segmented puncta (i.e. the connected regions) were then inspected in Napari (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sofroniew et al., 2022</xref>). Puncta belonging to the same filopodium were manually combined into the same filopodium mask.</p><p>To convert fluorescence intensities by microscopy into the number of Myo10 molecules, let I<sub>n</sub> represent the sum of the fluorescence signal for n =~50 cell images in a bioreplicate (each background-corrected, and each integrated over their ‘total cell masks’). This fluorescence signal arises from n⟨m⟩ molecules, where ⟨m⟩ denotes the expected number of Myo10 molecules per transfected cell as determined by the SDS-PAGE analysis. Let I<sub>ROI</sub> represent the background-corrected and summed intensity of a single region-of-interest (e.g. a filopodial punctum, or one cell).

The Myo10 filopodial molecules were averaged within each section. The section with the highest molecules was aligned to degree 0 for each cell’s rose plot. Total count of Myo10 puncta analyzed per section was also calculated. Puncta were not manually combined if belonging to the same filopodium. Therefore, puncta that were at the border of two radial sections were counted once for each section. For the rose plots in panel 2D, a randomly selected empty Myo10 section was aligned to degree 0 if more than one section contained no Myo10. The standard error bars represent the standard error of the mean molecules per section after 500 iterations of bootstrapping. In each iteration, 150 cells were randomly selected with replacement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Measuring local Myo10 concentrations at the tips of fixed-cell filopodia</title><p>To obtain estimates of local Myo10 concentrations in filopodia tips, 10 Myo10 tip-localized puncta were randomly chosen from three different cell images of each bioreplicate set.

After 10 min, cells were quickly washed 2× with DMEM+10% FBS washes, and one 5 min wash. Immediately before imaging, cells were replaced with DMEM+10% FBS containing 1× GOC. Live cells were imaged on a 37°C heated objective using a gain of 100 ms and 300 ms exposure (below detector saturation). Ten random cells per bioreplicate were recorded for &lt;6 min (three bioreplicates in total). For each bioreplicate, additional snapshots of ~50 living cells were taken to sample the intensity distribution for the fluorescence intensity-to-molecule conversions. Fixed-cell samples were prepared in parallel to obtain transfection efficiencies of the bioreplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Analyzing live-cell movies</title><p>Image analysis was partially done using in-house Python scripts. To get an intensity distribution for the fluorescence intensity-to-molecule conversions, the Myo10-stained snapshots were first background-subtracted using a rolling ball radius of 50 pixels in ImageJ. To obtain total intracellular Myo10 signal, filopodial puncta were used as bounding edges for a manually drawn mask. Signal inside the drawn mask was summed. Conversion of fluorescence signal intensity to number of molecules was performed as described above for fixed cells. Myo10 puncta in the live cell movies were segmented and tracked using the Fiji plug-in TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). Trackmate parameters used: LoG detector with estimated blob diameter = 1 µm, median filter, sub-pixel localization; LAP tracker with frame to frame linking = 0.5 µm, track segment gap closing = 1 µm (max frame gap = 2), track segment splitting = 0.5 µm, track segment merging = 1 µm.</p><p>After completing TrackMate analysis, all trajectories in the cell movies were manually inspected for occurrence of three types of filopodial events. The start of the three events are defined by when TrackMate first segments the punctum. ‘Initiation’ is when a Myo10 punctum gathers at the plasma membrane and then shoots into a filopodium. ‘Second-phase elongation’ is a new Myo10 punctum that emerges from an existing one. ‘Retraction’ is when a Myo10 punctum, observed in frame 1 of the movie, begins moving back toward the cell body. The track IDs were recorded for each trajectory type and further inspected. A few puncta that TrackMate segmented were manually removed because they were clearly background noise or incorrectly tracked puncta (e.g. a punctum from another filopodium that briefly crosses paths, or filopodial puncta that were detected by TrackMate only well after initiation). Any selected trajectories containing Myo10 puncta merging or splitting events were excluded from velocity analysis.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> parts A–C, Myo10 puncta molecules in the first two frames of each trajectory were averaged. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> parts D–F, the starting punctum molecules are subtracted from subsequent frames of each trajectory. Parts D–E follow the trajectory of each punctum that is initially identified for a certain filopodial event, but then those puncta could have engaged in other activities during their lifetime (e.g. retract). GAM fitting was only applied to a subset of the total data to prevent a few long trajectories from dominating the trend. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> parts G–H, note that velocity analysis includes a few Myo10 puncta that switch direction within a single trajectory (e.g. a retracting punctum that then elongates).

Based on these preliminary estimates, the authors developed further their analysis and discussed different scenarios regarding myosin 10 working models to explain intracellular diffusion and targeting to filopodia.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>I confirm my previous assessment. Overall, the paper is elegantly written and the data analysis is appropriately presented. Moreover, the novel experimental approach offers advantages to labs with limited access to high-end microscopy setups (super-resolution and/or EM in particular), and the authors proved its applicability to both fixed and live samples.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Myself and the other two reviewers pointed to the same weakness, the use of protein overexpression in U2OS. The authors claim that Myosin10 is not expressed by U2OS, based on Western blot analysis. Does this completely rule out the possibility that what they observed (the polarity of filopodia and the bulge accumulation of Myo10) could be an artefact of overexpression? I am afraid this still remains the main weakness of the paper, despite being properly acknowledged in the Limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>Respectfully, our observations do not capture an “artefact” of overexpression but rather the “response” to overexpression. Our goal in this project was to overexpress Myo10 in a situation where it is the limiting reagent for generating filopodia. As Reviewer 3 notes below, overexpression shows that filopodial tips “can accommodate a surprisingly (shockingly) large number of motors.” This is exactly the point. Reviewer 2 considered our handling of this issue to be a strength of the paper. As far as whether bulges occur in endogenous Myo10 systems, please see our comments to Reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I consider all the remaining issues I expressed during the first revision solved.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper sought to determine the number of myosin 10 molecules per cell and localized to filopodia, where they are known to be involved in formation, transport within, and dynamics of these important actin-based protrusions.

Overall, the study forms the basis for a novel technique to estimate the number of molecules per cell and their localization to actin-based structures. The implications are broad also for being able to understand the role of myosins in actin protrusions, which is important for cancer metastasis and wound healing.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper addresses an important fundamental biological question about how many molecular motors are localized to a specific cellular compartment and how that may relate to other aspects of the compartment such as the actin cytoskeleton and the membrane. The paper demonstrates a method of estimating the number of myosin molecules per cell using the fluorescently labeled HALO tag and SDS-PAGE analysis. There are several important conclusions from this work in that it estimates the number of Myo10 molecules localized to different regions of the filopodia and the minimum number required for filopodia formation. The authors also establish a correlation between number of Myo10 molecules filopodia localized and the number of filopodia in the cell. There is only a small % of Myo10 that tip localized relative to the total amount in the cell, suggesting Myo10 have to be activated to enter the filopodia compartment. The localization of Myo10 is log-normal, which suggests a clustering of Myo10 is a feature of this motor.</p><p>One of the main critiques of the manuscript was that the results were derived from experiments with overexpressed Myo10 and therefore are hard to extrapolate to physiological conditions. The authors counter this critique with the argument that their results provide insight into a system in which Myo10 is a limiting factor for controlling filopodia formation. They demonstrate that U20S cells do not express detectable levels of Myo10 (supplementary Figure 1E) and thus introducing Myo10 expression demonstrates how triggering Myo10 expression impacts filopodia. An example is given how melanoma cells often heavily upregulate Myo10.</p><p>In addition, the revised manuscript addresses the concerns about the method to quantitate the number of Myo10 molecules per cell and therefore puncta in the cell. The authors have now made a good faith effort to correct for incomplete labeling of the HALO tag (Figure 2A-C, supplementary Figure 2D-E). The authors also address the concerns about variability in transfection efficiency (Figure 1D-E).</p><p>A very interesting addition to the revised manuscript was the quantitation of the number of Myo10 molecules present during an initiation event when a newly formed filopodia just starts to elongate from the plasma membrane. They conclude that 100s of Myo10 molecules are present during an initiation event. They also examined other live cell imaging events in which growth occurs from a stable filopodia tip and correlated with elongation rates.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors acknowledge that a limitation of the study is that all of the experiments were performed with overexpressed Myo10. They address this limitation in the discussion but also provide important comparisons for how their work relates to physiological conditions, such as melanoma cells that only express large amounts of Myo10 when they are metastatic. Also, the speculation about how fascin can outcompete Myo10 should include a mechanism for how the physiological levels of fascin can complete with the overabundance of Myo10 (page 10, lines 401-408).</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the discussion about fascin competing with high concentrations of Myo10 in filopodial tips on pg. 15. The key feature is that fascin binding in a bundle is essentially irreversible, so it wins if any space opens up and it manages to bind before the next Myo10 arrives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary</p><p>The work represents progress in quantifying the number of Myo10 molecules present in the filopodia tip. It reveals that cells overexpressing fluorescently labeled Myo10 that the tip can accommodate a wide range of Myo10 motors, up to hundreds of molecules per tip.</p><p>The revised, expanded manuscript addresses all of this reviewer's original comments. The new data, analysis and writing strengthen the paper. Given the importance of filopodia in many cellular/developmental processes and the pivotal, as yet not fully understood role of Myo10 in their formation and extension, this work provides a new look at the nature of the filopodial tip and its ability to accommodate a large number of Myo10 motor proteins through interactions with the actin core and surrounding membrane.</p><p>Specific comments -</p><p>(1) One of the comments on the original work was that the analysis here is done using cells ectopically expressing HaloTag-Myo10. The author's response is that cells express a range of Myo10 levels and some metastatic cancer cells, such as breast cancer, have significantly increased levels of Myo10 compared to non-transformed cell lines. It is not really clear how much excess Myo10 is present in those cells compared to what is seen here for ectopic expression in U2OS cells, making a direct correspondence difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, a direct correspondence is difficult, and is further complicated by other variables (e.g., expression levels of Myo10 activators, cargoes, fascin, or other filopodial components) that may differ among cell lines. Properly sorting this out will require additional work in a few key cellular systems.</p><p>However, there are two points to keep in mind that somewhat mitigate this concern. First, because ectopic expression of Myo10 causes an ~30x increase in the number of filopodia, the activated Myo10 population is divided over that larger filopodial population. Second, the log-normal distribution of Myo10 across filopodia has a long tail, which means that some cells with low levels of Myo10 will concentrate that Myo10 in a few filopodia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In response to comments about the bulbous nature of many filopodia tips the authors point out that similar-looking tips are seen when cells are immunostained for Myo10, citing Berg &amp; Cheney (2002). In looking at those images as well as images from papers examining Myo10 immunostaining in metastatic cancer cells (Arjonen et al, 2014, JCI; Summerbell et al, 2020, Sci Adv) the majority of the filopodia tips appear almost uniformly dot-like or circular. There is not too much evidence of the elongated, bulbous filopodial tips seen here.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the tips in Berg and Cheney are circular, but their size varies considerably (just as a balloon is roughly circular, its size varies with the amount of air it contains). Non-bulbous filopodial tips have a theoretical radius of ~100 nm, which is below the diffraction limit. However, many of the filopodial tips are larger than the diffraction limit in Berg and Cheney, Fig. 1a. We cropped and zoomed in the images to show each fully visible filopodial tip</p><p>We attempted to perform a similar analysis of the images in Arjonen and Summerbell. Unfortunately, their images are too small to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, in reconsidering the approach and results, it is the case that the finding here do establish the plasticity of filopodia tips that can accommodate a surprisingly (shockingly) large number of motors. The authors discuss that their results show that targeting molecules to the filopodia tip is a relatively permissive process (lines 262 - 274). That could be an important property that cells might be able to use to their advantage in certain contexts.</p><p>(2) The method for arriving at the intensity of an individual filopodium puncta (starting on line 532 and provided in the Response), and how this is corrected for transfection efficiency and the cell-to-cell variation in expression level is still not clear to this reviewer. The first part of the description makes sense - the authors obtain total molecules/cell based on the estimation on SDS-PAGE using the signal from bound Halo ligand. It then seems that the total fluorescence intensity of each expressing cell analyzed is measured, then summed to get the average intensity/cell. The 'total pool' is then arrived at by multiplying the number of molecules/cell (from SDS-PAGE) by the total number of cells analyzed. After that, then: 'to get the number of molecules within a Myo10 filopodium, the filopodium intensity was divided by the bioreplicate signal intensity and multiplied by 'total pool.' ' The meaning of this may seem simple or straightforward to the authors, but it's a bit confusing to understand what the 'bioreplicate signal intensity' is and then why it would be multiplied by the 'total pool'. This part is rather puzzling at first read.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, such information is critical. We have now revised this description with more precise terms and have included a formula on pg. 20.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the approach described here leads the authors to their numerical estimates every effort should be made to have it be readily understood by all readers. A flow chart or diagram might be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a diagram of the calculations to the supplemental material (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). We hope that both changes will make it easier for others to follow our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The distribution of Myo10 punctae around the cell are analyzed (Fig 2E, F) and the authors state that they detect 'periodic stretches of higher Myo10 density along the plasma membrane' (line 123) and also that there is correlation and anti-correlation of molecules and punctae at opposite ends of the cells.</p><p>In the first case, it is hard to know what the authors really mean by the phrase 'periodic stretches'. It's not easy to see a periodicity in the distribution of the punctae in the many cells shown in Supp Fig 3. Also, the correlation/anti-correlation is not so easily seen in the quantification shown in Fig 2F. Can the authors provide some support or clarification for what they are stating?</p></disp-quote><p>The periodic pattern that we refer to is most apparent in the middle panels of Fig. 2E, F. These panels show the density of Myo10 puncta. These puncta numbers closely correspond to filopodia counts, with the caveat that some filopodia might have multiple puncta. This periodic density might not be as apparent in the raw data shown in Supp. Fig. 3. We have therefore rewritten this paragraph to clarify our observations (pg. 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors are no doubt aware that a paper from the Tyska lab that employs a completely different method of counting molecules arrives at a much lower number of Myo10 molecules at the filopodial tip than is reported here was just posted (Fitz &amp; Tyska, 2024, bioRxiv, DOI: 10.1101/2024.05.14.593924).</p><p>While it is not absolutely necessary for the authors to provide a detailed discussion of this new work given the timing, they may wish to consider adding a note briefly addressing it.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of this manuscript and that it uses a different approach for calibrating the fluorescence signal in microscopy. However, we are not comfortable commenting on that manuscript at this time, given that it has not yet been peer reviewed with the chance for author revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The manuscript the authors are now presenting does not comply with the formatting limits of a Short report, but it is instead presented as a full article type.

I understand the authors want to address these mechanisms in a follow-up story, for this reason, I encourage them to shorten the discussion, which seems unnecessarily long for a technique-based manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In the first round of review, Reviewer 3 asked us to expand the discussion.

While the R2 value is quite good, it seems a bit odd that the three (?) data points for live cells are all quite small relative to the fixed cells and all bunched together at the left side of the plot.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the main text, the time post-transfection has a noticeable effect on the level of Myo10 expression. The three fixed-cell bioreplicates had higher Myo10 expression because they were analyzed 48 hours post-transfection compared to the three live-cell bioreplicates (24 hours). Therefore, the fixed cell data points are larger in value because they represent more molecules, and the live cell data points are on the left side of the plot because they represent fewer molecules.</p></body></sub-article></article>
