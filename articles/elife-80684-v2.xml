NOR-associated sequences and epigenetic modifications contribute to the differential expression of rRNAs. However, the mechanism(s) controlling the dosage of active versus inactive <italic>rRNA</italic> genes within each NOR in mammals is yet to be determined. We have discovered a family of ncRNAs, SNULs (<italic>S</italic>ingle <italic>NU</italic>cleolus <italic>L</italic>ocalized RNA), which form constrained sub-nucleolar territories on individual NORs and influence rRNA expression. Individual members of the SNULs monoallelically associate with specific NOR-containing chromosomes. SNULs share sequence similarity to pre-rRNA and localize in the sub-nucleolar compartment with pre-rRNA. Finally, SNULs control rRNA expression by influencing pre-rRNA sorting to the DFC compartment and pre-rRNA processing. Our study discovered a novel class of ncRNAs influencing rRNA expression by forming constrained nucleolar territories on individual NORs.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nucleolus is the most well-characterized non-membranous nuclear domain, where ribosome biogenesis and maturation occur and is formed around the nucleolus organizer regions (NORs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Németh and Grummt, 2018</xref>). NORs are comprised of rRNA gene tandem arrays, and in human cells, they are located on the short arms (p-arm) of the five acrocentric chromosomes (Chrs. 13,14,15, 21, and 22) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McStay, 2016</xref>). Human cells contain &gt;400 copies of rRNA (18 S/28 S/5.8 S) genes, yet only ~50% of the copies are transcriptionally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grummt, 2007</xref>). The expression of rRNA genes is tightly controlled during physiological processes, such as cellular development, by epigenetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McStay, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guetg and Santoro, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McStay and Grummt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haaf et al., 1991</xref>). However, the mechanism that precisely maintains the dosage of active versus inactive rRNA genes within a cell is yet to be determined. Two potential scenarios could explain the expression of ~50% rRNA genes at any given time. In the first scenario, rDNA repeats in half of the 10 NORs remain transcriptionally active, whereas the rRNA genes in the rest of the five NORs remain inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McStay, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlesinger et al., 2009</xref>). Supporting this model, a study from Cedar laboratory reported that rRNA repeats present in the NORs of the individual alleles of Chr. 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 replicated late during the cell cycle, and had chromatin marks consistent with transcriptionally being transcriptionally inactive. In the second scenario, each NOR contains both active and inactive rRNA clusters. In support of this claim, immune-FISH performed in several non-transformed human cell lines revealed that all the NORs with detectable rDNA repeats are active, as defined by UBF loading and their ability to form functional nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McStay, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Sluis et al., 2020</xref>). Also, recent long-read sequencing data support the hypothesis that each NOR is a mosaic of active rDNA repeat and silent rDNA repeat clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Sluis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hori et al., 2021</xref>). This study demonstrated that all the NORs contain methylated and unmethylated 47 S rDNA clusters, and the methylated rDNA repeats within each NOR tend to cluster together to form heterochromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Sluis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hori et al., 2021</xref>). Cis-regulatory elements and factors, including ncRNAs are suggested to maintain active versus inactive rDNA repeats within each NOR.</p><p>The nucleolus harbors a diverse set of small and long noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), which play crucial roles in organizing the nucleolar genome as well as regulating rRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mamontova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hao and Prasanth, 2022</xref>). For example, the intergenic spacer (IGS) between rRNA genes encodes several ncRNAs, such as pRNA, PAPAS, and PNCTR, which modulate rRNA expression and nucleolus organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mamontova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hao and Prasanth, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bierhoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yap et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have reported that ncRNAs, including SLERT, LoNa, AluRNAs, and the LETN lncRNAs, modulate nucleolus structure and rRNA expression via independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caudron-Herger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Collectively, these studies underscore the importance of ncRNAs in controlling key nucleolus functions, thus contributing to cellular homeostasis.</p><p>Besides the rDNA array, the remaining DNA sequences within the short arms of all five NOR-containing acrocentric chromosomes are highly repetitive and share high levels of sequence similarities across different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McStay, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guetg and Santoro, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McStay and Grummt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Floutsakou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Németh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Németh and Längst, 2011</xref>). As a result, insights into novel genes and/or regulatory elements within the p-arms are limited. Careful analyses of small regions located adjacent to NORs revealed that they code for lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Floutsakou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Sluis et al., 2019</xref>), indicating that the p-arms of the NOR-containing chromosomes harbor ncRNA genes, which could modulate key nucleolar functions.</p><p>In the present study, we have identified a novel family of ncRNAs: SNULs, which likely originate from the p-arms of acrocentric chromosomes and form allele-specific constrained sub-nucleolar territories on the NOR-containing chromosomes. SNUL-1 RNA displays high sequence similarity to pre-rRNA. Further studies revealed that the SNUL family of ncRNAs contributes to rRNA expression. Thus, our study unraveled the existence of a novel family of ncRNAs that display monoallelic coating/association on the autosomal segments of NOR-containing p-arms for modulating rRNA expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SNUL-1 RNA forms a distinct territory within the nucleolus</title><p>In a screen to identify cell-cycle-regulated RNAs with distinct cellular distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hao et al., 2020</xref>), we identified a unique probe with ~600 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which hybridized to an RNA species that preferentially formed a cloud/territory within the nucleolus in a broad spectrum of human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

However, unique probes (non-overlapping with the probe-1 region) generated from the Chr17-encoded lncRNA failed to detect SNUL-1 RNA cloud (data not shown). Furthermore, BLAST-based analyses failed to align the Probe 1 sequence to any other genomic loci. Since a large proportion of the p-arms of nucleolus-associated NOR-containing acrocentric chromosomes is not yet annotated, we speculated that SNUL-1 could be transcribed from an unannotated genomic region from the acrocentric p-arms. RNA-FISH-based analyses revealed that a [CT]<sub>20</sub> repeat and a 60-nucleotide overhang sequence within the original probe-1 were crucial for detecting the SNUL-1 cloud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>; probe 4), implying that the [AG] repeats along with unique sequence beyond the repeat contributes to the hybridization specificity and localization of SNUL-1.</p><p>During the screen, we identified another single-stranded oligonucleotide probe that shared ~73% sequence similarity to the SNUL-1 probe 4 that detected an additional RNA cloud in the nucleolus but was distinct from the SNUL-1 cloud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We named this RNA SNUL-2. The probe that hybridized to SNUL-2 also contained an imperfect [CT]-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that both SNUL-1 and SNUL-2 RNAs contain [AG] repeats. Based on this, we propose that SNUL-1 and SNUL-2 are members of a novel RNA family and form non-overlapping constrained territories within the nucleolus.</p><p>To identify the full-length SNUL-1 sequence, we isolated total RNA from biochemically purified nucleoli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and enriched the RNA population by performing RNA-pull down using SNUL-1 probe 4 as a bait. We then performed targeted long-read Iso-Sequencing (Iso-Seq; Single Molecule Real-Time Sequencing by PACBIO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>; please see methods for details). The binding affinities between individual high-quality full-length isoforms generated by circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads, and SNUL-1 Probe 4 were calculated using RIBlast (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukunaga et al., 2017</xref>). Top-ranked isoforms with high binding affinity with SNUL-1 Probe 4 were picked as candidate sequences (CSs). The full-length SNUL-1 candidates identified by iso-sequencing ranged in length from 1.9 kb-3.1 kb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In parallel, rRNA-depleted nucleolar RNA was also sequenced by Oxford Nanopore without SNUL-1 enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We reasoned that candidate transcripts supported by targeted PacBio sequencing and independent Nanopore long-read sequencing represent real SNUL-1 RNA candidates. Indeed, all the iso-seq SNUL-1 CSs were able to be aligned by Nanopore reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Aligned Nanopore reads were extracted and subjected to de novo construction of new consensus sequences (please see Materials and methods for details). Comparison between the CSs identified by iso-seq analyses and the newly built consensus sequences by Nanopore reads revealed a ~100% identity, thus confirming these CSs in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). RNA-FISH was then performed using probes designed from each of the CSs. Probes designed from distinct CSs all detected RNA clouds within the same area, which were also positively detected by the original SNUL-1 cloud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Members of the SNUL-1 CS RNAs, though enriched with the same SNUL-1 cloud, did not display complete co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>), indicating that they might hybridize to different RNA species organized within the same territory. The full-length SNUL-1 CS RNAs identified by both iso-seq and nanopore seq. analyses contained defined 5’ and 3’ ends, and displayed high levels of sequence similarity between each other (&gt;90%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Comprehensive statistical analyses (considering the variation among the CSs and the error rate of PacBio Isoseq) rejected the hypothesis that the SNUL-1 CSs represent the same transcript with different levels of sequencing errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp4">Supplementary files 3 and 4</xref>, see Materials and methods for the detailed analyses). Thus, it is plausible that rather than a single type of transcript, SNUL-1 represents a group of RNA species that share similar sequence features and are clustered together as an RNA cloud within the nucleolus. Pair-wise alignment of the individual members of the SNUL-1 CSs with the transcribed region of rDNA revealed ~84–91% sequence similarity between the CSs and one of the pre-rRNA species, 21 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>). 21 S is one of the intermediates produced during rRNA processing, consisting of 18 S and partial ITS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In general, the individual SNUL-1 CSs showed 84–86% alignment to the 5’ end of 21 S and 81–82% alignment to the 3’ end of 21 S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). For example, SNUL-1 CS2305 showed 86% identity to the first 1.3 kb of 21 S pre-rRNA, which corresponds to a significant portion of 18 S rRNA, followed by a large gap and segments of 86–91% identity corresponding to the 3’ end of 18 S and the 3’ end of ITS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). On the other hand, CS1269 had 91% identity to the 18 S rRNA region but had a large gap in alignment in the first 1 kb, as well as segments of 84–90% identity corresponding to the 5’ and 3’ ends of ITS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>In the nucleolus, both SNUL-1 and pre-rRNA (detected by the probe hybridizing to the internal transcribed region [ITS1] of pre-rRNA) distributed mostly non-overlapping regions, as observed by super resolution-structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In addition, modified DNA antisense oligonucleotides against SNUL (ASO-SNUL) specifically reduced only SNUL-1 levels. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>).

The association rate between the SNUL-1 cloud and other NOR-containing chromosomes, such as Chr. 13 and Chr. 22 was 30–40%, which could be because these chromosomes are localized in the same nucleolus, along with the SNUL-1-associated Chr. 15 allele.

Results revealed loss of SNUL-1 signal in the cells treated with SNUL-1 ASO even post-denaturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>). If the lack of SNUL-1 signals in SNUL ASO-treated cells is because the SNUL ASO compete with the probe for SNUL-1 RNA is true, then upon denaturation, the target SNUL-1 RNA, disassociated from the SNUL ASO would have shown positive RNA signal with SNUL-1 probe. Based on this observation, we infer that even though the competition could still be possible, it cannot explain the complete loss of SNUL-1 RNA signal in the ASO-treated samples. Our results imply that SNUL depletion either enhanced the expression of nucleolus-enriched <italic>rRNA</italic> genes and/or altered the co-transcriptional pre-rRNA processing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SNUL-1 influences rRNA biogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNA-FISH of SNUL-1 (green) and SNUL-2 (red) in WI-38 cells transfected with ctr-ASO or ASO-SNUL oligonucleotides.

The DFC-localized FBL binds to the 5’ end upstream of the first cleavage site (01 site; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) of the 47 S pre-rRNA co-transcriptionally and facilitates pre-rRNA sorting for efficient RNA processing and DFC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). Due to this, the 5’ end of 47 S pre-rRNA is localized in the DFC region, as shown by SR-SIM of smRNA-FISH using the 5’ external transcribed spacer (5’ETS)–1 probe set targeting the first 414 nts of 47 S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, the region within the 47 S pre-rRNA 5’ETS located downstream of the 01 cleavage site (detected using 5’ETS-2 &amp; 3 probes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>; probes: 5’ETS-2 and 3]) associated with the rRNA transcription sites (FC or FC/DFC junction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, in the SNUL-depleted cells, the FBL-interacting 5’ETS-1 region within the 47 S pre-rRNA failed to sort to DFC and instead preferentially accumulated in the FC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>). An earlier study demonstrated that depletion of pre-rRNA processing factors, such as FBL, compromised 47 S pre-rRNA sorting at DFC, resulting in the accumulation of pre-rRNA in the FC region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). Our results suggest the possibility that SNULs could influence pre-rRNA biogenesis by modulating FBL-mediated pre-rRNA sorting/processing. In support of this, we observed an enriched association of SNUL-1 in the FBL-localized DFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). We, therefore, determined whether SNULs influence the interaction between FBL and pre-rRNA in DFC. Toward this, we performed FBL RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative RT-PCR to quantify the interaction between FBL and nascent pre-rRNA in control and SNUL-depleted cells. Strikingly, SNUL-depleted cells showed reduced interaction between FBL and pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), indicating that DFC-enriched SNULs could influence the FBL interaction with pre-rRNA.</p><p>The sequence upstream of the 01-cleavage site within the 47 S pre-rRNA (detected by 5’ETS-1 probe), is co-transcriptionally cleaved after it is sorted to DFC by FBL. Defects in the pre-rRNA sorting to DFC were shown to affect pre-rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). SNUL-1-depleted cells showed defects in the initial cleavage at the 5’end of the 47 S pre-rRNA, as observed by the reduced levels of 30S+1 intermediate and +1–01 cleaved product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>) by Northern blot analyses. The +1–01 is the unstable product processed from the 5’end of 47 S pre-rRNA due to the cleavage at the 01 site. These results indicate the potential involvement of SNULs in pre-rRNA, sorting and/or co-transcriptional processing.</p><p>NcRNAs influence asynchronous DNA replication in a monoallelic fashion. For example, Thayer laboratory has identified a group of lncRNAs, ASARs (Asynchronous replication and Autosomal RNAs), which are monoallelically transcribed and associated on various chromosomes and control asynchronous replication timing between chromosome alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heskett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heskett et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donley et al., 2015</xref>). An earlier study from Cedar laboratory reported allelic-specific replication and transcription of rDNA loci in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlesinger et al., 2009</xref>). We, therefore, tested whether SNULs contribute to asynchronous replication and monoallelic expression of rDNA loci in human cells. We performed the ReTiSH (Replication timing-specific hybridization), an assay previously developed by Cedar laboratory, to determine the replication timing of both the alleles of Chr. 15 in control and SNUL-depleted HTD114 and WI-38 cells (please see Materials and methods for details about ReTisH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlesinger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donley et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, control and SNUL-depleted cells were incubated with BrdU for specified time points (6 or 14 hr) and then synchronized in metaphase by treating the cells with colcemid for 1 hr. In these cells, 6 hr BrdU incubation, cells present in late S-phase preferentially incorporates BrdU, whereas 14 hr, labels cells in any stage of S phase. The replication status of rDNA loci was determined by a modified version of co-FISH, an assay in which the BrdU +ve replicated regions are specifically converted to ssDNA and then hybridized with rDNA probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cornforth and Eberle, 2001</xref>). In addition to rDNA, we also labeled the mitotic chromosomes with a CEN15 probe to mark the Chr.15 rDNA clusters. In contrary to what had been reported by the Cedar group, we did not observe allele-specific differential replication of rDNA clusters on the Chr.15 p-arm. Both the alleles of Chr.15 p-arms replicate during the late S phase in both the cell lines (please see Ctrl in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). Surprisingly, upon SNUL-depletion, the Chr. 15 alleles showed differential replication timing. In SNUL-depleted HTD114 cells, the maternal allele of Chr.15 p-arm (allele with larger CEN15 signal) replicated earlier (no rDNA signal in 6 hr) compared to the paternal allele, which continued to replicate during late S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,C</xref>; compare 6 hr Ctrl versus 6 hr ASO-SNUL).</p><p>To independently test the ReTiSH results, we performed EdU-incorporation assays in control and SNUL-depleted interphase HTD114 cells. Cells were pulse-labelled with EdU to mark replication sites (green), co-stained with rDNA (Cyan) and Chr.15-specific centromeres (yellow) to determine the replication timing of the Chr.15 p-arm containing rDNA cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>). In control cells, rDNA cluster from both the chr-15 p-arms co-localized with EdU +ve foci predominantly in mid and late S-phase cells. Upon SNUL depletion, Chr. 15 rDNA cluster from the maternal allele showed enhanced association with EdU foci in the middle S-phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>). These results implicate that the replication timing of maternal allele shifts from late S-phase to middle S-phase upon SNUL depletion, confirming the ReTiSH results. However, the significance of this observation remains to be elucidated.</p><p>To test whether SNULs influence monoallelic transcription of rDNA clusters, we evaluated the status of monoallelic association of three of the active histone marks (H3Ac, H4Ac, H3K4me3) on the Chr.15 p-arms in the mitotic chromosome spreads of control and SNUL-depleted HTD114 and RPE1 cells, based on the assay previously described in the Cedar study. We observed active histone mark signals in all the chromosome arms, including the q-arms of chr. 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schlesinger et al., 2009</xref>). However, unlike what had been reported earlier by the Cedar lab in their earlier study, we could not find any active histone marks in both the alleles of rDNA bearing p-arms of Chr. 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>) in control as well as SNUL-depleted cells. We measured the histone mark signal intensities between two chr. 15 p-arm alleles and did not find any significant difference between the two alleles in control and SNUL-depleted cells. In conclusion, we did not find monoallelic replication and transcription of chr. 15 rDNA cluster containing NORs in human cell lines (hTERT-RPE1, HTD114, and WI-38) those display monoallelic association of SNULs, supporting the notion that every NORs contain both active and inactive rDNA clusters. Based on these results, we argue that SNUL RNAs constitute the first family of ncRNAs in the nucleolus, which displays monollelic association to specific NOR-containing chromosomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have discovered SNULs, a novel family of ncRNAs, which display non-random association to specific NOR-containing chromosomes within the nucleolus. Our data suggest that SNUL-1 is a member of a family of RNAs sharing similar sequence features. The most striking feature of the SNUL-1 sequence is its resemblance to the 21 S pre-rRNA intermediate. Recent genomic mapping of acrocentric chromosome arms revealed that most of the sequences in the NOR-containing p-arms are shared among all 5 chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Floutsakou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Sluis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nurk et al., 2022</xref>).

NuD is reported in certain nonhybrid or ‘pure species’ of plants and fruit flies but has not yet been observed in mammals, primarily due to a lack of information about the allele-specific rRNA sequence variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greil and Ahmad, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xie et al., 2012</xref>). During NuD, chromosome allele-specific rRNA expression is observed, in which the rRNA gene array within the NOR that is inherited from one parent (dominant) is maintained in a transcriptionally active status, while the rRNA loci from the other parent (under dominant) are preferentially silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McStay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pontes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Earley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 1998</xref>). Several features associated with the monoallelic regulation of SNULs share similarities with NuD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tucker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McStay, 2006</xref>). SNUL-1 and rRNA expression in NuD is dictated by non-imprinted random monoallelic expression. Repressive epigenetic modifiers play vital roles in the allele-specific expression of SNULs, and rRNAs during NuD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Earley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Pikaard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Neves et al., 1995</xref>). Interestingly, specific sequence elements located near the NORs are implicated in controlling NuD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Labhart and Reeder, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rabanal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Warsinger-Pepe et al., 2020</xref>). For example, in the germ cells of male <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Y chromosome sequence elements promote developmentally regulated NuD of the Y chromosome-encoded rRNA over the X-chromosome rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Warsinger-Pepe et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We observe that SNUL-1 forms a spatially constrained RNA territory that associates next to the NOR of Chr. 15 but is devoid of pre-rRNA. Furthermore, SNUL-depleted cells show elevated levels of pre-rRNA, along with defects in pre-rRNA sorting and processing. One-way SNUL-1 could modulate rRNA expression is via modulating the levels of bioprocessing machinery that control rRNA biogenesis and processing. For example, high sequence similarity between SNUL-1 and pre-rRNAs helps SNUL-1 to compete for and/or recruit factors that regulate rRNA biogenesis in a spatially constrained area within the nucleolus. A recent study, by visualizing the distribution of tagged pre-rRNAs from an NOR-containing chromosome, reported that similar to SNULs, pre-rRNAs transcribed from individual NORs form constrained territories that are tethered to the NOR-containing chromosomal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mangan and McStay, 2021</xref>). It is possible that SNUL-1, by forming a distinct RNA territory on the NOR of the Chr. 15 allele, influences the expression of rRNA genes in cis. Such organization of SNULs and rRNA territories in a constrained area within the nucleolus would help to control the expression of a subset of rRNA genes without affecting the rRNA territories on other acrocentric chromosomes.</p><p>Our observation of the compartmentalized distribution of individual members of SNUL RNA within specific sub-nucleolar regions challenges the current view that all the nucleoli within a single nucleus are composed of identical domains. Future work will entail determining the mechanism(s) underlying the constrained formation of SNUL territories and allele-specific spreading and regulation on autosomal regions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of the present study</title><p>Presently, very little is known about the sequences in the short arms of NOR-containing chromosomes. A recent study utilizing long-read sequencing in a haploid cell line revealed that p-arms of NOR-containing chromosomes are enriched with repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nurk et al., 2022</xref>). Higher levels of sequence similarity observed between <italic>SNUL-1</italic> candidates, and pre-rRNA made it impossible for us to precisely map the genomic coordinates of <italic>SNUL-1</italic> genes from the available long-read sequencing data set. It is intriguing to note that the SNUL-1 candidates showed the highest levels of sequence similarity with 21 S pre-rRNAs. Interestingly, many ‘adenosine and Guanosine’ sequence mismatches were observed between SNUL-1 candidates and 21 S pre-rRNA. We cannot rule out the possibility that SNUL-1 RNAs represent pre-rRNA variants that are extensively modified via post-transcriptional processes such as adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I-editing). Earlier studies have reported the enrichment of A-to-I editing enzymes such as ADARs (Adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA) in the nucleolus and RNA hyper-editing is utilized as a mechanism of RNA nuclear-retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sansam et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prasanth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang and Carmichael, 2001</xref>). SNUL clouds are formed due to the hyper-editing of pre-rRNA variants to perform regulatory functions in the nucleolus. Future studies will test this model. Complete genome assembly of p-arms from SNUL-1-expressing diploid cells would be essential to map <italic>SNUL-1</italic> genes in the genome and to identify the regulatory elements controlling the monoallelic expression of <italic>SNULs</italic>. Genomic annotation of the full-length <italic>SNUL-1</italic> genes are also crucial for designing strategies to specifically alter the expression of individual <italic>SNUL</italic> genes without targeting other SNUL-like genes, furthering mechanistic understanding of SNUL functions. Even with these technical limitations, the current study is highly impactful because our observations of the association of autosome arms by SNULs support a paradigm-shifting model that ncRNA-coating of chromosomes and their roles in gene repression is not restricted only to sex chromosomes. In addition, our study will serve as a starting point towards understanding how differential rDNA expression is achieved during physiological processes. Altogether, this study will form the basis for an entirely new avenue of investigation, which would help to understand the role of ncRNAs on monoallelic changes in autosomal chromatin structure and gene expression in the nucleolus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>WI-38 and IMR-90 cells were grown in MEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), non-essential amino acid, sodium-pyruvate.

For rDNA contents on the two Chr. 15 alleles in hTERT-RPE1 cells, relative integrated density was calculated by dividing the measurement of the larger rDNA signal by the measurement of the smaller rDNA signal. For 15Sat III and 15CEN, relative integrated density was calculated by dividing the measurement of the larger signal spot by that of the other spot signal within the same cell. For ReTiSH in HTD114 and WI38 control and SNUL-depleted cells, relative integrated density between two alleles was calculated by dividing the measurement of the rDNA signal on the Chr. 15 with the larger CEN15 by the measurement on the other Chr. 15, and by dividing the measurement of the rDNA signal on the Chr. 15 with the larger 15Sat III by the measurement on the other Chr. 15, respectively.</p><p>For the measurement of 5-FU incorporation and 5’ETS signal in control and SNUL-depleted cells, z-stacks were imported into Fiji/ImageJ and maximum intensity projection was performed. Nuclei were segmented by optimized threshold and inverted into binary mask. The integrated density of 5-FU signal or 5’ETSsignal in each of the nuclei was measured.</p><p>For the measurement of 5’ETS-1 signal intensity in FC of nucleolus in control and SNUL-depleted cells, the middle z session was selected for each image and imported into Fiji/ImageJ then split into single channels. FCs were segmented by auto threshold of RPA194 channel and inverted into binary mask. The binary masks were applied to the 5’ETS-1 channel and the integrated intensity of 5’ETS-1 signals within FCs were counted for each nucleolus. The relative 5’ETS-1 signal intensity in FCs was calculated by dividing the integrated intensity of 5’ETS-1 signals within FCs by the integrated intensity of the entire image.</p><p>For the measurement of FBL and RPA194 signal distribution, 20 of DFC and FC units were selected and the middle z session for each unit was chosen. Averaged images were generated by applying Average Intensity Projection in Fiji/ImageJ. FBL or RPA194 signal was segmented by optimized threshold and inverted into binary mask. The binary masks were applied to FBL or RPA194 channel and the area was counted for each FC/DFC unit.</p><p>For the measurement of histone mark intensities in HTD114 and RPE1 control and SNUL-depleted cells, z-stacks were imported into Fiji/ImageJ and maximum intensity projection was performed. rDNA signal on Chr.15 alleles was segmented by optimized threshold and inverted into binary mask. The binary masks were applied to the histone mark channel and the integrated intensity of histone mark signals was counted for each metaphase spread. The relative integrated density between two alleles was calculated by dividing the measurement of the rDNA signal on the Chr. 15 with the larger CEN15 by the measurement on the other Chr. 15, and by dividing the measurement of the rDNA signal on the Chr. 15 with the larger 15Sat III by the measurement on the other Chr. 15, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>PacBio iso-seq</title><p>Total RNA from isolated HeLa nucleoli was poly-adenylated by Poly(A) Polymerase Tailing Kit (Epicentre) and depleted of rRNA by the RiboMinus Human/Mouse Transcriptome Isolation Kit (Invitrogen).

The top 2000 candidates with the lowest interaction energy were intersected to generate the final set of 507 transcripts like SNUL-1. Pairwise BLASTs of each of the top ranked PacBio Iso-Seq clones and genome assembly hg38 were performed to pick the candidates showing the least similarity with any of the annotated genes. A reference fasta file was generated with the top 5 picked candidates with least similarity (BLAST) to the annotated genes from PacBio sequencing dataset. The fast5 file from nanopore long read sequencing was basecalled using Guppy V4.2.2.A reference fasta file was generated from the top 5 sequences identified previously from BLAST-based least similarity to annotated genes. The fastq file from Nanopore sequencing containing 1,267,135 reads (across two runs) was aligned to the reference fasta file, generated from top 5 candidates from PacBio sequencing data, using minimap2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Birol, 2018</xref>). Alignment statistics were computed using samtools – flagstat option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2009</xref>), a total of 123,582 (9.7%) were mapped to the reference fasta file. Mapped reads were extracted into a sam file and indexed using samtools, for visualizing the alignments through IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zentner et al., 2011</xref>). To generate an accurate version of SNUL-1 transcripts, we generated a consensus sequence from the above Nanopore based long-read alignments to the PacBio based candidate sequences, using samtools and bcftools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Danecek and McCarthy, 2017</xref>). All the reads aligning to the SNUL-1 transcripts were extracted and a consensus sequence from these reads was assembled using the combination of modules mpileup, call, and vcfutils from samtools and bcftools as depicted in Figure S1g. To evaluate the specificity of the assembled transcripts, we performed a similarity comparison between the generated consensus sequence against rRNA and PacBio Iso-Seq CS clones. We observed that the sequences identified/generated from our analysis were more analogous to the Iso-Seq clones over rRNA.</p><p>To verify the error rate of PacBio sequencing technology, for each isoform in the high-quality PacBio database, we ran BLAST against the human transcript database (GRCh38.p13 assembly). The maximum number of target sequences and the maximum number of high-scoring segment pairs were set to 20 and 1 respectively, and the rest of the arguments were set to default in the BLAST runs. LAGAN-v2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brudno et al., 2003</xref>) was then used to perform pairwise global alignment between each isoform and its corresponding top 20 best matches, found by BLAST. A dissimilarity score was assigned to each matched candidate by taking the ratio of mismatching sites to all the sites where both isoform and the matched candidate did not contain gaps. The matched candidate with the least dissimilarity score was taken as the best match to the isoform. The mean of the dissimilarity scores, associated with isoforms having GC content greater than 60% (matching the GC content of ITS1), being ~0.5% verifies the PacBio error rate (&lt;1%).</p><p>To determine whether the five isoforms capable of detecting SNUL-1 are different transcripts, and their difference is not due to sequencing error, we propose the following three hypotheses to be tested:</p><p><italic>H<sub>0</sub></italic>: There is one known gene whose transcripts are <italic>I<sub>1</sub>,…,I<sub>5</sub></italic>.</p><p><italic>H<sub>1</sub></italic>: There is one unannotated gene, that is with no transcripts present in human transcript database, whose transcripts are <italic>I<sub>1</sub>,…,I<sub>5</sub></italic>.</p><p><italic>H<sub>2</sub></italic>: There are multiple unannotated/annotated genes whose transcripts are <italic>I<sub>1</sub>,…,I<sub>5</sub></italic>.</p><p>If <italic>H<sub>0</sub></italic> is true, then there exists a known transcript such that the dissimilarity score (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) between isoform <italic>i</italic> (<italic>I<sub>i</sub></italic>) and that transcript follows the empirical distribution of the dissimilarity scores in Figure S1l.

We apologize for the terrible delay in providing this decision letter. We had much difficulty securing reviews. In the end your article could only be reviewed by 1 peer reviewer, but the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. Another reviewer did not respond despite being chased for several weeks, and a second reviewer could not review in the end but provided informal remarks that we are passing onto you in case they would be helpful. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work cannot be published in <italic>eLife</italic> as it is.</p><p>The reviewer(s) found the paper interesting, but the main concerns are that the study does not provide enough information about the RNA and equally important, the manuscript did not discuss preceding work that impacts the interpretation and novelty of the findings. The observation of monoallelic expression from rRNA encoding loci is interesting, but it has been established in 2009 by the work, Allelic inactivation of rDNA loci. Genes Dev. 2009 Oct 15;23(20):2437-47. doi: 10.1101/gad.544509. You and your coauthors may not be aware of the paper, but there may be relevant data from this paper to help understand the NOR phenomenon better. We do acknowledge that you have succeeded in identifying and characterizing a new family of ncRNAs which seem to play a role in the mono-allelic expression of r-RNA. These ncRNAs are expressed in a mono-allelic manner. This remains interesting but we feel that the study would have to go further since monoallelic expression was established more than 10 years ago. Reviewer 1 also mentioned that the experiments would have to be better described for them to evaluate the findings.</p><p>We hope these comments will be helpful to you as you move forward. We hope that you will conduct further experiments that would address the above concerns.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Monoallelically-expressed Noncoding RNAs form nucleolar territories on NOR-containing chromosomes and regulate rRNA expression&quot; reports the discovery of a family of ncRNAs they call SNULs for Single NUcleolus Localized RNA and examine their localization with respect to nucleoli and reports that the RNAs they are examining are monoallelically expressed in a mitotically stable manner similar to what happens in X inactivation.</p><p>These RNAs come from a screen which is not well described and the descriptions of the sequence analyses are unclear, so it is difficult to know exactly what they are analyzing in the manuscript. If these are RNAs with reasonable abundance, then they should be findable without the extensive PCR amplification they appear to have done for the PacBio sequencing (the methods section is not clear on exactly how many rounds of PCR were performed). Moreover, given the acknowledged sequence similarities of the SNULs with other RNAs, the possibility of chimaera formation during PCR amplification is high. They are clearly detecting RNAs associated with nucleoli but exactly what they are examining is unclear. It is possible that a clear determination of the genomic origin of these RNAs will be complicated by the repetitive sequences in the regions of the genome where they reside.</p><p>Note also that the idea of monoallelic expression from rRNA encoding loci is interesting, but has been established in 2009. Title: Allelic inactivation of rDNA loci. Genes Dev. 2009 Oct 15;23(20):2437-47. doi: 10.1101/gad.544509.</p><p>If there are analyses which could be added to further clarify how the different types of sequencing complemented and/or reinforced one another, that might make the characterization of the RNAs being studied here more convincing.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Monoallelically-expressed Noncoding RNAs form nucleolar territories on NOR-containing chromosomes and regulate rRNA expression&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor, and we apologize for the long delay in the review process. As you know, we had difficulty obtaining reviewers in the first round and in the end, only had one reviewer who was able to turn in comments. Fortunately, we secured two additional reviewers in this round, although there was a delay in obtaining the last review. As you will see, all three reviewers view your paper positively and we would like to invite you to submit a revised manuscript based on their recommendations.</p><p>Specifically, we hope you can address these comments in a revised paper.</p><p>1. Reviewer 2 suggested visualizing the SNUL transcripts using a northern blot to give readers a sense of the length and abundance of the various isoforms. If you can provide this information from the Nanopore or PacBio data, please do so in lieu of the northern. (also see note from Reviewer 1 about presentation of the Nanopore sequencing data)</p><p>2.

Please also address the more specific and minor comments of the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Hao et al., &quot;Monoallelically-expressed Noncoding RNAs form nucleolar territories on NOR-containing chromosomes and regulate rRNA expression&quot; characterizes novel non-coding RNA emanating from the rDNA regions of the human genome. The revised manuscript has thoughtfully considered the concerns raised in the initial review.</p><p>Comments / points to be addressed:</p><p>1. line 66/67, instead of &quot;and were transcriptionally inactive&quot; perhaps say something along the lines of &quot;and had chromatin marks consistent with being transcriptionally inactive&quot;.</p><p>2. line 178/179. Please give a little more detail as to what you mean by &quot;partially align to 18S&quot; and &quot;align to ITS1&quot;. What % alignment over what distance, or whatever makes sense given the nature of the alignments being mentioned?</p><p>3. line 242. Use of the word &quot;biallelically&quot; is confusing in this context because it seems that the text is referring to a second location which could be one of the two alleles of several rDNA loci.</p><p>4. lines 251 -258. The text is talking about the SNUL-1 cloud association with one allele of Chr. 15 NOR and then mentions the association rate with Chr. 13 and 22, but not the other allele of Chr. 15.</p><p>5. lines 285 – 287. What about mentioning if it could be observed whether the other Chr. 15 had transcriptionally active rDNA clusters?</p><p>6. lines 300 – 303. I suggest not using &quot;non-randomly associates&quot; as this is vague, and instead use terminology similar to what is used in the next paragraph where the ideas of imprinting and &quot;mitotically inherited random monoallelic association&quot; are explored experimentally.</p><p>7. lines 876 – 901. The addition of the Nanopore sequencing to corroborate data from Pac-Bio sequencing in the original submission. That said, the description of the statistical analyses in lines 876 – 901 is unclear and I would advise the authors to either change their statistical analysis or at least explain some of the things they are doing in a more convincing manner. It is not clear why multiplying the empirical p values is a good idea; such multiplying makes the ultimate p value be dependent on the number of things being multiplied. Using an Erlang distribution with the parameters they chose is not justified and is not a common way of analyzing sequencing data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript presented by Hao, Liu, et al. details important findings surrounding a new type of noncoding RNA that regulated the expression of rRNA. The characterization of SNLU-1 through a variety of imaging and sequencing based approaches is compelling and provides a new example of noncoding RNAs that can control a major biological process in an allele-specific manner.</p><p>Summary of the work:</p><p>Ribosomal RNA regulation is of critical importance and therefore so too is defining the molecular mechanisms that control its expression. A long-standing question has been to understand which of the many nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) are active by what means the cell establishes this. Here the authors characterize a new, noncoding RNA based mechanism for regulation of rRNA expression. Leveraging confocal imaging and super resolution reconstructions, the authors characterize a new type of noncoding RNA called SNUL (focusing mostly on SNUL-1, but also presenting data on SNUL-2). These noncoding RNAs associate with and generate 'clouds' around chromosomes in an allele specific manner. Examining this across a number of cell lines at various cell cycle stages, the authors discovered that SNUL-1 is mitotically inherited in a random monoallelic association with chromosome 15. The SNUL RNAs are Pol I expressed and using long read sequencing on two different technology platforms provided some sequence context for the RNAs, with the caveat that they are difficult to map fully due to their repetitive nature. Finally, knockdown studies revealed an impact on rRNA processing through imaging and northern blotting assays, highlighting a functional consequence of SNUL transcripts.</p><p>Overall, the claims in the paper are well supported by the data presented. The revised manuscript also extensively investigates a previously reported observation of reported allelic-specific replication and transcription of rDNA loci in human cells. The new data generated here, with newer techniques appears to be internally consistent, while contradictory to the previous report. Beyond rRNA biology, the phenological observation of the cloud-like association of the SNUL's with various chromosomes is an exciting new example of a noncoding RNA establishing a physical territory around a specific chromosome to control the expression in situ.</p><p>There are some additional data presentation aspects and experiments that could add to the depth of understanding. Some of these would likely be the focus of future studies.</p><p>1. Visualizing the SNUL transcripts. A northern blot could have been performed to give readers a sense of the length and abundance of the various isoforms. If this information was also obtained from the Nanopore or PacBio data, the authors could have compiled it into a figure / plot to again provide this information to the readers.</p><p>2. There are some places where the authors note &quot;data not shown&quot;. Generally, I would avoid this, if it is important enough to mention in the text, the data should be shown. If not, there is no need to note the data in the text.</p><p>3. It was not obvious how long the authors waited after KD in Figure 1-S2J. The figure shows loss of SNUL-1, but no data is shown about the effect of this KD on the pre-rRNA, even though the text says there was no effect on the pre-rRNA. Additional information here or data on the pre-rRNA would be helpful.s</p><p>Future experiments:</p><p>• In the future, an RNA-capture assay should be performed. Assaying both the associated RNA, DNA, and proteins using ChART, ChIRP, RAP, or OMAP technologies would likely provide mechanistic insight into how and importantly where, at a molecular level, the SNULs operate.</p><p>Other comments on the text and figures:</p><p>• Figure 1B; why do U2OS have such a speckly pattern of SNUL-1?</p><p>• Figure 1C; the labels / legends have squares overlapping the text.</p><p>• Figure 2I and related; the Pol1 data is convincing, but I am not sure that I see an obvious shift to the periphery of the nucleoli. Maybe illustrate where the nucleoli are in some of these images?</p><p>• Figure 5G; is there a way to quantify the difference here and apply a statistical test to demonstrate significance?</p><p>• All of the Red/Green combos are not ideal for data presentation in the case of color-blind readers. There are also higher contrast 2 and 3 color sets that can make the data easier to read for everyone.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This revision by Hao and Liu et al., adds an extensive confirmation study of Schlesinger et al. 2009 Genes and Dev., which reported asynchronous replication timing and mono-allelic expression of human nucleoli-organizing regions (NORs). However, neither observation is reproduced here, which is noteworthy given the original study has been extensively cited but to my knowledge not been reproduced. These contradictory results probably warrant publication on their own.</p><p>Overall, this revision is highly responsive to prior reviewers comments, and technically rigorous. Unfortunately, a single critical point remains unresolved: the location(s) of SNUL-1 and to which extent its effect on pre-rRNA processing can be distinguished from targeting the pre-rRNA itself:</p><p>The SNUL1 probe does not map to any NOR-carrying chr by blat. Because the SNUL candidate sequences (CS) or multiple-sequence alignment were not included in this revision, their alignment to the T2T genome (Nurk, et al. 2022) could not be assessed. At a minimum, the authors should include this information in a revision.</p><p>The SNUL2 probe does map to all NOR-chromosomes however, with multiple blat hits in the rDNA and one additional partial hit outside each rDNA cluster. On chr13 it is immediately adjacent to the core rDNA cluster (see blat to T2T genome on UCSC browser). Given the overlapping CT-dinucleotide repeat region common to SNUL-1/2, it is noteworthy that the only ASO capable of reducing SNUL-1 also reduced SNUL-2 by targeting the shared CT-dinucleotide repeat region (ASO sequence was not provided). In addition to the SNUL1-CS sequence alignments mentioned above, the authors should also provide FISH data from ASO experiments against the SNUL-1 CS sites (currently listed as &quot;data not shown&quot;).</p><p>Without this and the ASO information, it remains unclear to me whether the observed pre-rRNA processing defect in ASO-targeted cells isn't a result of targeting the pre-rRNA itself, given its extensive sequence homology with SNUL-1 CSs (Figure 1). Of course, the pre-rRNA signal increases in these cells, while the SNUL-1/2 signal disappears, but the ASO may interfere with SNUL-1/2 probe hybridization, which relies on the CT-dinucleotide sequence as well (Figure 1-suppl2). In contrast, the pre-rRNA is detected with a different probe. At minimum, the authors would need to demonstrate SNUL-1 depletion with a probe that does not overlap the ASO-targeted sequence, to demonstrate that the effect of the ASO on SNUL-1 is depletion, while the pre-rRNA signal increases.</p><p>In summary, this study identifies a novel class of nucleoli-associated non-coding RNAs associating in cis with a specific NOR (SNUL-1 on chr15 and SNUL-2 on chr13). In addition, this study makes a strong case against monoallelic rRNA expression reported previously.</p><p>The technical challenge of pinpointing the origin of these SNULs even with the recently T2T-assembled human rDNA repeats is well appreciated, but the authors need to provide additional information to clarify the identity of SNUL-1 CSs. To link SNUL-1 function to rRNA synthesis, the authors would have to disambiguate the SNUL-1 target from co-targeting the pre-rRNA itself – for example by combining multiple SNUL-1 CS ASOs without sequence homology to the pre-rRNA, or at minimum, using SNUL-1 CS FISH probes that do not overlap with the ASO to confirm SNUL-1 depletion. If the only ASO effective at &quot;depleting&quot; SNUL-1 also matches the pre-rRNA itself, the authors should test ASOs that target only the pre-rRNA – if a processing defect is reproduced here, it is unlikely a result of targeting SNUL-1 or other SNULs.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Monoallelically-expressed Noncoding RNAs form nucleolar territories on NOR-containing chromosomes and regulate rRNA expression&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I have better confidence in the conclusions made by the authors now. I would like to request one last item before publication. When re-reading the manuscript, I am still left with confusion about where the SNULs are coming from. I understand they have imperfect homology with specific parts of the pre-rRNA, and thus perfect alignment is not possible.</p><p>However, as a reader, I feel somewhat confused about where these RNAs are being transcribed from.</p><p>I think a model of the rRNA, annotated with the expected regions or regions of homology, in the context of the other known domains of the rDNA would be extremely helpful. For example, there is an opportunity to provide a singular resource and reference for readers with the cartoon illustrated in &quot;Figure 1—figure supplement 3A&quot; (Schematic showing the positions of the rRNA and ITS1 probes.) Is it possible to layer onto this all of the probes, ASOs, etc used across this work as well as the expected region of SNUL transcription – with the fair caveat that the precise region of transcription is not yet defined?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I want to commend the authors on thoroughly addressing the reviewers concerns..</p><p>I just don't understand how the SNUL sequences don't map to even the T2T genome. I've blat-ed several of the candidate sequences and the 86% identity matches often hit a particular rDNA model (e.g. supplementary file 2, candidate 1 aligns to &quot;rdna-model15a&quot;, which would be congruent with the SNUL1 cloud lighting up a rRNA-adjacent area). Yet, looking at the mismatches in the blat, they are primarily guanosines and adenosines. Aside from a more in-depth statistical analysis of the underlying sequence content of the 21S rRNA transcript, have the authors considered the possibility that all SNUL-1 clouds originate from heavily A-I or other RNA-edited 18S/21S rRNAs?</p><p>RNA-editing of 18S/21S rRNA could account for the significant dissimilarity to 21S while 21S is still the best genomic match for these Iso-Seq and Nanopore sequences. This interpretation would suggest that the SNULs are retained in the nucleus rather than exported, to perform regulatory functions or because editing impaired export. If the authors cannot rule out RNA-editing (e.g. would ADAR knockdown impair SNUL1 clouds?), could they discuss this possibility in the manuscript?</p><p>A cursory literature search revealed there's precedence for ADARs associating with nucleoli (Sansam, et al. 2003, PNAS – 223 citations).</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC283538/</p><p>To be clear, I don't think additional experiments are necessary, but the possibility that SNUL clouds result from nucleolar retention of RNA-edited rRNA transcripts should be discussed. Lastly, I recommend checking the manuscript once more for typos (e.g. &quot;Is-Seq&quot;) and sentence structure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80684.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

You and your coauthors may not be aware of the paper, but there may be relevant data from this paper to help understand the NOR phenomenon better.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewing editor and the reviewer for pointing out the paper from the Cedar lab (Genes Dev. 2009 Oct 15;23(20):2437-47 <sup>1</sup>). In this paper, the authors claimed allele-specific asynchronous replication of rDNA loci. The authors observed that half of the 10 rDNA loci in human cells replicated late during the S-phase, and the other half replicated early in an allelic-specific manner. It is generally presumed that late replicated DNA loci tend to be transcriptionally inactive. Due to the high sequence similarity between rRNAs transcribed from the rDNA repeats in all 10 NORs, the authors did not concisely demonstrate allele-specific transcription inactivation of rRNA genes. However, in support of their claim, they demonstrated that 5 of the 10 NOR containing acrocentric arms in the mitotic chromosomes stained weakly for active chromatin histone marks such as H3Ac, H4Ac, and H3K4me, implying that these chromosomes contain inactive rRNA repeats. Based on these results, the authors argued that rDNA foci display mono-allelic expression.</p><p>As per the editorial suggestion, we performed exactly the same experiments conducted by the Cedar lab in their 2009 Genes and Development paper<sup>1</sup> to test the status of rDNA allele-specific replication and association of active histone marks on the mitotic rDNA cluster-containing p-arm of Chr-15 in three different cell lines (WI-38, HTD114 and RPE1) those show a mono-allelic association of SNUL1. Furthermore, we performed the following experiments to determine whether SNULs play any role in the allele-specific asynchronous replication and transcription repression of rRNA loci.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>We performed the ReTiSH (Replication timing-specific hybridization) in control and SNUL-depleted cells (HTD114 and WI-38). Unlike what Cedar group reported earlier, we DID NOT observe allele-specific differential replication of rDNA clusters from chr.15 p-arm. Rather, we observed that both the alleles of Chr.15 p-arms replicate during the late S phase in both the cell lines (Figure 5 – Supplement3; Figure 5 – Supplement 4). Interestingly, upon SNUL depletion, the rDNA clusters from two Chr.15 alleles showed differential replication timing in HTD114 cells. The Maternal allele of Chr.15 p-arm replicates earlier (during mid S-phase) than the paternal allele (late S-phase) in SNUL-depleted cells (Figure 5 – Supplement3).</p></list-item><list-item><p>To confirm the ReTiSH results, we performed EdU pulse-chase experiments in control and SNUL-depleted interphase cells. In these experiments, cells were pulse-labeled with EdU to mark replication sites, then co-stained with rDNA and Chr.15-specific centromeres to determine the replication timing of the Chr.15 p-arm containing rDNA cluster (Figure 5 – Supplement 5). Similar to our ReTiSH data, in control cells, rDNA cluster from both the chr-15 p-arms preferentially associated with EdU +ve foci in cells showing mid and late S-phase patterns. Upon SNUL depletion, one of the rDNA clusters from Chr. 15 showed enhanced association with EdU foci in middle S-phase cells (Figure 5 – Supplement 5). These results implicate that the replication timing of maternal allele shifts from late S-phase to middle S-phase upon SNUL depletion, confirming the ReTiSH results. The above results indicate that SNULs influence the replication timing of rDNA regions.</p></list-item></list><p>However, we could not reproduce the Cedar lab’s results showing allele-specific differential replication of rDNA loci in control cells.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Next, we tested the mono-allelic association of three of the active histone marks (H3Ac, H4Ac, H3K4me3) on the rDNA cluster-containing p-arms of Chr.15. We performed these experiments in control and SNUL-depleted HTD114 and RPE1 cells (Figure 5 – Supplement 6; Figure 5 – Supplement 7), again both these cells showed allele-specific expression of SNUL-1. In addition, SNULs influence the expression of rRNA genes in these cells. We observed active histone mark signals in all the chromosome arms, including the q-arms of chr.15. However, unlike what had been reported earlier by the Cedar lab in their Genes and Dev. paper, we could NOT find any active histone marks in both the alleles of rDNA bearing p-arms of chr.15. We measured the histone mark signal intensities between two chr15 p-arm alleles, and we could not find any significant difference between two alleles in control and SNUL-depleted cells (Figure 5 – Supplement 6; Figure 5 – Supplement 7).</p></list-item></list><p>These results further argue against the model proposed by Cedar lab supporting mono-allelic transcription of rDNA genes.</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>In support of their claim, Cedar lab study also showed allele-specific DNA CpG methylation (a mark associated with inactive transcription) on rDNA clusters. However, recent DNA methylation data derived from long-read sequencing data support the hypothesis that each rDNA array is a mosaic of active rDNA repeat and silent rDNA repeat clusters. These studies clearly demonstrated that all the NORs contain both methylated and unmethylated 47S rDNA clusters, and the methylated rDNA repeats within each NOR tend to cluster together to form heterochromatic regions <sup>2, 3</sup>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Further, the UBF, an RNA polymerase I transcription factor, is associated with the transcriptionally active rDNA repeats <sup>2-4</sup>. It is now established that in diploid human cells, all of the rDNA repeat containing NORs associate with UBF, indicating that all the 10 NOR alleles contain active rDNA clusters <sup>2-5</sup>. These observations further contradict the Cedar lab study.</p></list-item></list><p>Based on our experiments performed in three different diploid or pseudo-diploid cell lines (WI-38, RPE1, and HTD114), we could not reproduce the data published by the Cedar lab. We did not see allele-specific differential replication of rDNA cluster located in Chr.15 p-arm. We also did not see any active histone marks on both the alleles of rDNA-cluster from the Chr.15 p-arm, implying the absence of allele-specific transcription of rDNA clusters. We also would like to point out that we have not seen any other study (including from Cedar lab) that followed (or reproduced) the original study from Cedar lab, demonstrating allele-specific transcription of rDNA genes. The consensus in the field is that all rDNA-positive NORs are a mosaic of both transcriptionally active (hypomethylated, UBF-associated) and inactive (hypermethylated, UBF-negative) rDNA repeats <sup>5</sup>. The important question that remains to be addressed is how differential expression of rDNA repeats within each NOR cluster is achieved. SNULs could be one of those ncRNAs, regulating differential rDNA expression within each allele.</p><p>Based on all these observations, we therefore argue that our study, showing the mono-allelic association of SNUL-1 and -2 transcripts to Chr.15 and.13 respectively constitute the first study demonstrating the allele-specific association of ncRNAs on the rDNA-cluster containing NORs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. We do acknowledge that you have succeeded in identifying and characterizing a new family of ncRNAs which seem to play a role in the mono-allelic expression of r-RNA. These ncRNAs are expressed in a mono-allelic manner. This remains interesting but we feel that the study would have to go further since monoallelic expression was established more than 10 years ago.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the encouragement. As indicated above (Comment 2), the Cedar lab paper did not demonstrate allele-specific transcription of rRNA transcripts due to technical limitations. They argued the mono-allelic inactivation of rDNA genes based on their asynchronous replication status and the low active chromatin marks on half of the rDNA loci in mitotic chromosomes. However, we could not reproduce their data in three different human cell lines. Also, recent studies have demonstrated data indicating that every rDNA repeat-containing NOR constitutes both active and inactive rDNA repeats. Such data contradicts the Cedar lab model, claiming that only half of the NOR-positive acrocentric p-arms contain active rDNA clusters.</p><p>Based on this, we argue that our observations, showing mono-allelic association of SNUL-1 and -2 ncRNAs to NOR-containing chromosomes is a novel finding. We also demonstrated that SNULs represent a novel class of ncRNAs, forming distinct nucleolar territories on NOR-containing chromosomes. Though SNUL-1 ncRNA displayed sequence similarity to 21S pre-rRNAs, it does not represent 21S pre-rRNA variants. Our recent unpublished data demonstrates that SNUL-1 ncRNAs are NOT processed into distinct 18S rRNA variants and do not associate with 40S ribosomes (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

By performing RNA-seq in cell cycle synchronized samples, we identified several hundreds of lncRNAs that differentially expressed in a particular stage of the cell cycle. We performed a large-scale RNA-FISH-based screen to characterize the localization of these cell cycle-regulated lncRNAs. One of the probes in this screen hybridized to SNUL-1 RNA in the nucleolus. The original double-stranded DNA probe that detected the SNUL-1 RNA cloud(s) was mapped to hg38-Chr17: 39549507-39550130 genomic region, encoding a lncRNA. However, other unique non-overlapping probes generated from the Chr17-encoded lncRNA failed to detect the SNUL-1 RNA cloud. Furthermore, BLAST-based analyses failed to align the SNUL-1 hybridized sequence to any other genomic loci. Since a large proportion of the p-arms of nucleolus-associated NOR-containing acrocentric chromosomes is not yet annotated, we speculated that SNUL-1 could be transcribed from an unannotated genomic region from the acrocentric p-arms.</p><p>We have now provided the information in the revised manuscript.

In the PacBio-iso-seq analyses, we utilized the standard protocol (recommended by the scientists from PacBio, who are authors in the manuscript), which included 13 PCR cycles. However, as described in the manuscript, in parallel to PacBio-seq, we also performed nano-pore sequencing of the nucleolus-enriched RNA without any amplification. The SNUL-1 full-length candidate sequence (CS) that we described in the manuscript is the ncRNA that showed 100% sequence similarity in both independent PacBio Iso-seq as well as nanopore seq analyses. We argue that if the SNUL-1 candidate transcripts would have been an artifact of PCR amplification in PacBio-seq, then we would not have obtained the full-length sequence with 100% match in the nanopore-seq reads.

As suggested by this reviewer, we have now performed Northern blots to detect the changes in pre-rRNA processing after SNUL or pre-rRNA depletion. To deplete pre-rRNA, we used Antisense oligonucleotides targeting 18S rRNA as well as the ITS1 within the 21S pre-rRNA. Our results clearly demonstrate that only SNUL, and not pre-rRNA depletion affected the levels of 30S pre-rRNA (Figure 5-Supplement 2C). These results imply that changes in 30S pre-rRNA levels observed in SNUL-ASO treated cells is specifically due to SNUL depletion.</p><p>To test the reviewer’s concern that absence of SNUL-1 signal in the SNUL-ASO-treated cells because of potential competition between SNUL-ASO and the probe, (both ASO and SNUL-1 probe competing for the SNUL-1 RNA), we performed the following experiment. We incubated cells with con (scr) and SNUL-1 ASO for 72 hrs. After that, we fixed cells, denatured the cells and performed high stringent washes (similar to striping the probes in MER-FISH protocol) for striping the ASOs from the target RNA. After that, we performed RNA-FISH to detect SNUL-1. Results revealed loss of SNUL-1 signal in the cells treated with SNUL-1 ASO (Figure 5-figure supplement 2I). If the idea that the lack of SNUL-1 signals in SNUL ASO treated cells is because SNUL ASO competes with the probe for SNUL-1 RNA is true, then upon denaturation of cells treated with SNUL ASOs, would have shown positive SNUL-1 RNA signal.

This is also evident from the data presented in Figures 4A and C, where in all the cells, SNUL-1 cloud only associated with one of the two chr 15 alleles, marked by chr. 15 specific centromeres or peri-centromeres. These experiments were done in diploid cells, which normally contain 1-2 nucleoli. The association of SNUL-1 to a small percentage of other acrocentric chromosomes (besides Chr. 15) could be because these chromosomes are localized next to the SNUL-1-associated Chr. 15 allele in the same nucleolus, and not because SNUL-1 cloud is coating these chromosomes.

Both these data support the models that SNUL-1-associated Chr. 15 allele contains active rDNA clusters. At present, we do not have any direct evidence to show whether the rDNA clusters within the SNUL-1 -ve Chr-15 allele remain active or inactive. This is a technical problem. We were not successful in performing super-resolution imaging of RNA-FISH (to detect pre-rRNA) and DNA paint (to detect chr. 15 alleles). However, indirect evidence supports the model that both alleles of Chr. 15 contain active rDNA genes.

The characterization of SNLU-1 through a variety of imaging and sequencing based approaches is compelling and provides a new example of noncoding RNAs that can control a major biological process in an allele-specific manner.</p><p>Summary of the work:</p><p>Ribosomal RNA regulation is of critical importance and therefore so too is defining the molecular mechanisms that control its expression. A long-standing question has been to understand which of the many nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) are active by what means the cell establishes this. Here the authors characterize a new, noncoding RNA based mechanism for regulation of rRNA expression. Leveraging confocal imaging and super resolution reconstructions, the authors characterize a new type of noncoding RNA called SNUL (focusing mostly on SNUL-1, but also presenting data on SNUL-2). These noncoding RNAs associate with and generate 'clouds' around chromosomes in an allele specific manner. Examining this across a number of cell lines at various cell cycle stages, the authors discovered that SNUL-1 is mitotically inherited in a random monoallelic association with chromosome 15. The SNUL RNAs are Pol I expressed and using long read sequencing on two different technology platforms provided some sequence context for the RNAs, with the caveat that they are difficult to map fully due to their repetitive nature. Finally, knockdown studies revealed an impact on rRNA processing through imaging and northern blotting assays, highlighting a functional consequence of SNUL transcripts.</p><p>Overall, the claims in the paper are well supported by the data presented. The revised manuscript also extensively investigates a previously reported observation of reported allelic-specific replication and transcription of rDNA loci in human cells. The new data generated here, with newer techniques appears to be internally consistent, while contradictory to the previous report. Beyond rRNA biology, the phenological observation of the cloud-like association of the SNUL's with various chromosomes is an exciting new example of a noncoding RNA establishing a physical territory around a specific chromosome to control the expression in situ.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her/their positive remarks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some additional data presentation aspects and experiments that could add to the depth of understanding.

As discussed in the methods, in the pac-bio seq, we enriched the transcripts complementary to the SNUL-1 probe by RNA pull down and long-read sequencing.

On chr13 it is immediately adjacent to the core rDNA cluster (see blat to T2T genome on UCSC browser). Given the overlapping CT-dinucleotide repeat region common to SNUL-1/2, it is noteworthy that the only ASO capable of reducing SNUL-1 also reduced SNUL-2 by targeting the shared CT-dinucleotide repeat region (ASO sequence was not provided). In addition to the SNUL1-CS sequence alignments mentioned above, the authors should also provide FISH data from ASO experiments against the SNUL-1 CS sites (currently listed as &quot;data not shown&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We developed several ASOs targeting individual SNUL-1 candidates. Unfortunately, none of the ASOs gave significant knock down. (Please see Figure 5-figure supplement 2A). We believe that SNUL-1 consists of a group of very similar, but not identical transcripts, originating from a Chr. 15 p-arm cluster. Iso-seq and Nanopore seq. data supported this claim. Knocking down one or few of the candidates may not make a significant impact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Without this and the ASO information, it remains unclear to me whether the observed pre-rRNA processing defect in ASO-targeted cells isn't a result of targeting the pre-rRNA itself, given its extensive sequence homology with SNUL-1 CSs (Figure 1). Of course, the pre-rRNA signal increases in these cells, while the SNUL-1/2 signal disappears, but the ASO may interfere with SNUL-1/2 probe hybridization, which relies on the CT-dinucleotide sequence as well (Figure 1-suppl2). In contrast, the pre-rRNA is detected with a different probe. At minimum, the authors would need to demonstrate SNUL-1 depletion with a probe that does not overlap the ASO-targeted sequence, to demonstrate that the effect of the ASO on SNUL-1 is depletion, while the pre-rRNA signal increases.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer’s interpretation. Unfortunately, we do not have any probe that successfully hybridizes to SNUL-1 without the repeats. Even the probes that hybridizes to SNUL-1 CS shown in Figure 1-Figure supp. 2C-D also contain CT repeats.</p><p>To test the competition model (both ASO and SNUL-1 probe competing for the SNUL-1 RNA), we performed the following experiment. We incubated cells with con (scr) and SNUL-1 ASO for 72 hrs. After that, we fixed cells, denatured the cells and performed high stringent washes (similar to striping the probes in MER-FISH protocol) for striping the ASOs from the target RNA. After that we performed RNA-FISH to detect SNUL-1. Results revealed loss of SNUL-1 signal in the cells treated with SNUL-1 ASO (Figure 5—figure supplement 2I). If the idea that the lack of SNUL-1 signals in SNUL ASO treated cells is because SNUL ASO competes with the probe for SNUL-1 RNA is true, then upon denaturation SNUL ASO from the target RNA would have shown positive SNUL-1 RNA signal. Based on that, we suggest that even though the competition could still be a possibility, it cannot explain the complete loss of SNUL-1 RNA signal in the ASO-treated samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, this study identifies a novel class of nucleoli-associated non-coding RNAs associating in cis with a specific NOR (SNUL-1 on chr15 and SNUL-2 on chr13). In addition, this study makes a strong case against monoallelic rRNA expression reported previously.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank for this reviewer for recognizing the strength and the novelty of the study</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The technical challenge of pinpointing the origin of these SNULs even with the recently T2T-assembled human rDNA repeats is well appreciated, but the authors need to provide additional information to clarify the identity of SNUL-1 CSs. To link SNUL-1 function to rRNA synthesis, the authors would have to disambiguate the SNUL-1 target from co-targeting the pre-rRNA itself – for example by combining multiple SNUL-1 CS ASOs without sequence homology to the pre-rRNA, or at minimum, using SNUL-1 CS FISH probes that do not overlap with the ASO to confirm SNUL-1 depletion. If the only ASO effective at &quot;depleting&quot; SNUL-1 also matches the pre-rRNA itself, the authors should test ASOs that target only the pre-rRNA – if a processing defect is reproduced here, it is unlikely a result of targeting SNUL-1 or other SNULs.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the suggestion, in order to test whether the changes in RNA processing observed in SNUL ASO-treated cells is not due to the fact that this ASO is also targeting pre-rRNA, we treated cells with specific ASOs targeting the pre-rRNAs (ASOs targeting 18S rRNA and the ITS1 of pre-rRNA). Northern blot using the 5’ETS probe revealed that only SNUL, and not pre-rRNA depletion resulted in significant alteration in the 30S pre-rRNA (Figure 5-supplement 2C). These results imply that the changes in pre-rRNA processing observed in SNUL ASO-treated cells is not due to the reason that ASO is also co-targeting pre-rRNA.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the third round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers are now very positive about your paper and we are ready to move forward.

I've blat-ed several of the candidate sequences and the 86% identity matches often hit a particular rDNA model (e.g. supplementary file 2, candidate 1 aligns to &quot;rdna-model15a&quot;, which would be congruent with the SNUL1 cloud lighting up a rRNA-adjacent area). Yet, looking at the mismatches in the blat, they are primarily guanosines and adenosines.

This interpretation would suggest that the SNULs are retained in the nucleus rather than exported, to perform regulatory functions or because editing impaired export. If the authors cannot rule out RNA-editing (e.g. would ADAR knockdown impair SNUL1 clouds?), could they discuss this possibility in the manuscript?</p><p>A cursory literature search revealed there's precedence for ADARs associating with nucleoli (Sansam, et al. 2003, PNAS – 223 citations).</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC283538/</p><p>To be clear, I don't think additional experiments are necessary, but the possibility that SNUL clouds result from nucleolar retention of RNA-edited rRNA transcripts should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for this outstanding comment.
