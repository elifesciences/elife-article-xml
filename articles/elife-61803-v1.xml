such that within one host different viral variants can emerge. Evidence suggests that influenza virus variants are more prevalent in pregnant and/or obese individuals due to their impaired interferon response. We have recently shown that the non-allergic, paucigranulocytic subtype of asthma is associated with impaired type I interferon production. Here, we seek to address if this is associated with an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Compared to controls, mice with paucigranulocytic asthma had increased disease severity and an increased emergence of influenza virus variants. Specifically, PB1 mutations exclusively detected in asthmatic mice were associated with increased polymerase activity. Furthermore, asthmatic host-derived virus led to increased disease severity in wild-type mice. Taken together, these data suggest that at least a subset of patients with asthma may be more susceptible to severe influenza and may be a possible source of new influenza virus variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza virus</kwd><kwd>asthma</kwd><kwd>interferons</kwd><kwd>mutation</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE180100512</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Short</surname><given-names>Kirsty Renfree</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12U7118N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vrancken</surname><given-names>Bram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van den Hoecke</surname><given-names>Silvie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1130815</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Upton</surname><given-names>Kyle R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Patients with paucigranulocytic asthma may be more susceptible to severe influenza and could potentially be source of new, more virulent, influenza virus variants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Similar to many other RNA viruses, the influenza virus RNA polymerase has poor proofreading activity, resulting in a high rate of viral mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van den Hoecke et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, even if an influenza virus infection occurs with a defined molecular clone, there will be rapid generation of viral variants that possess one or more mutations relative to the original virus strain. Many viral mutants are of reduced or unaltered virulence compared to the wild-type (WT) parental viral strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van den Hoecke et al., 2015</xref>). However, viral variants that display increased virulence can also emerge. Modelling studies suggest that there are a higher number of influenza virus variants in individuals that suffer from severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reperant et al., 2014</xref>). This may reflect the fact that mutations that are of increased virulence but of reduced fitness are able to replicate in immunocompromised individuals and not in individuals that have a fully competent immune response. Alternatively, in individuals with severe disease there may be additional rounds of virus replication, which represent additional opportunities for viral mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reperant et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with these observations, pregnant mice infected with influenza virus have an increased rate of viral mutations compared to their non-pregnant counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engels et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, the impaired interferon response of obese mice is thought to drive the emergence of virulent influenza virus variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honce et al., 2020</xref>). These data raise the question whether asthma, a host co-morbidity frequently associated with an impaired interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wark et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Contoli et al., 2006</xref>), also facilitates the emergence of influenza virus variants.</p><p>The impact of pre-existing asthma on the severity of influenza virus infection is controversial. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic asthma was identified as the single most common underlying medical condition in individuals hospitalised with influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nguyen-Van-Tam et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morris et al., 2012</xref>). Individuals with asthma are known to have a greater risk of (i) admission to the hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neuzil et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Riordan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Kerkhove et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller et al., 2008</xref>), (ii) being treated in the intensive care unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bueving et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Libster et al., 2010</xref>), (iii) requiring a greater number of outpatient visits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neuzil et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miller et al., 2008</xref>), and (iv) developing pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Riordan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dawood et al., 2011</xref>) upon influenza virus infection. Whilst some of these observations may be attributable to the fact that influenza virus can exacerbate the symptoms of asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Obuchi et al., 2013</xref>), Dawood and colleagues demonstrated that the majority of patients with asthma were hospitalised for influenza in the absence of an acute asthma attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dawood et al., 2011</xref>). However, a global analysis of pH1N1 cases suggests that once hospitalised, influenza patients with asthma have a greater survival rate than patients with other conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Van Kerkhove et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with these findings, studies using a mouse model of disease actually suggest that mice with the cardinal features of asthma display <italic>reduced</italic> disease severity following infection with influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furuya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samarasinghe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The controversies in the literature regarding the interactions between asthma and influenza appear hard to reconcile. However, it is important to recognise that asthma is a heterogenous disease, consisting of many different phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Svenningsen and Nair, 2017</xref>). It is possible that different subtypes of asthma display differing degrees of synergism with influenza virus. For example, the aforementioned mouse studies used either ovalbumin (OVA), fungal allergens, or house dust mite for sensitisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furuya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samarasinghe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>), all of which induce an eosinophilic asthma which was characterised by high levels of IgE and eosinophilia. Whilst approximately 40% of adults suffer from this allergic ‘eosinophilic asthma’, a large percentage of asthma patients suffer from non-allergic asthma (i.e. where asthma is observed in the absence of eosinophilic asthma). One such subtype is paucigranulocytic asthma in which airway remodelling occurs in the absence of eosinophilia or neutrophilia.</p><p>Here, we sought to determine the role of paucigranulocytic asthma, using an established experimental mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikkatt et al., 2017</xref>), in the generation of influenza virus variants. We chose to focus on paucigranulocytic asthma for this study as (i) the relationship between this specific phenotype of non-allergic asthma and severe influenza has yet to be studied, (ii) in some populations paucigranulocytic asthma can affect up to 40% of asthmatic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schleich et al., 2013</xref>), and (iii) paucigranulocytic asthma is associated with an impaired interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikkatt et al., 2017</xref>). We show that mice with a paucigranulocytic asthma phenotype (henceforth referred to as ‘asthmatic mice’) have increased intra-host influenza viral diversity compared to control mice. Importantly, two of the viral mutations that emerged in asthmatic mice were associated with increased viral replication and polymerase activity. Together, these data provide strong evidence that host–viral interactions are bidirectional and that host co-morbidities can influence the evolution of influenza virus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM)-infection of RAGE-deficient mice induces the cardinal features of paucigranulocytic asthma</title><p>To investigate the effect of asthma on the severity of influenza we employed a previously established model of paucigranulocytic asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikkatt et al., 2017</xref>). In this model, an early-life PVM infection followed by reinfection with PVM later in life in mice deficient in the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), encoded by the <italic>Ager</italic> gene, promotes airway remodelling characteristic of asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikkatt et al., 2017</xref>). To confirm this phenotype, the number of mucus-secreting cells and airway smooth muscle mass (ASM) was assessed in PVM-infected RAGE-deficient mice and mock-infected RAGE-deficient mice. Importantly, RAGE-deficient mice that received only an early life PVM infection were not included in these experiments as we have previously shown that an early life PVM infection, followed by a later life infection with influenza A virus (IAV), also results in an asthma-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikkatt et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikkatt et al., 2017</xref>), an early and later life PVM infection in RAGE-deficient mice resulted in a significant increase in the number of mucus secreting cells and ASM mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To confirm that the observed structural changes were not associated with a marked pro-inflammatory phenotype or strong interferon response, various cytokines were assessed in the lungs of asthmatic and non-asthmatic mice. Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikkatt et al., 2017</xref>) asthmatic mice had significantly lower pulmonary levels of IFN-γ, CXCL1, TNF-α, CCL2, IL12, IL1b, IL10, and IFN-α compared to non-asthmatic control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These data indicate that this is an appropriate mouse model to study the effects of asthma, and an impaired interferon response, on the emergence of influenza virus variants.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM)-infection (at 7 days of age and reinfection at 35 days of age) of RAGE-deficient mice induces the cardinal features of asthma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left) Percentage of airway epithelial cells (AECs) producing mucus was quantified by immunohistochemistry at 7 days post-reinfection (i.e. 42 days of age) from uninfected RAGE-deficient mice (non-asthmatic) and infected RAGE-deficient mice (asthmatic).

However, the impact of pre-existing asthma on the severity of influenza remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Riordan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dawood et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furuya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samarasinghe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>). Mouse studies modelling allergic asthma have suggested that asthma may mediate partial protection from severe influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Furuya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Samarasinghe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doorley et al., 2017</xref>). Here, using our previously established mouse model of non-allergic paucigranulocytic asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arikkatt et al., 2017</xref>), we show that the impaired interferon response (characteristic of this subtype) is associated with increased influenza severity. These data suggest that further research, both clinical and pre-clinical, into the relationship between non-allergic asthma and influenza virus severity is warranted.</p><p>Recent data suggest that an impaired interferon response correlates with an increase in the emergence of influenza viral variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engels et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honce et al., 2020</xref>). Engels and colleagues demonstrated that an allogenic pregnant host environment fails to activate the innate immune response, including that of type I interferons during IAV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engels et al., 2017</xref>). The failure to mount a robust immune response was associated with an increased viral load and a higher emergence of viral variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engels et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, Honce and colleagues demonstrated that the decreased type I interferon response within an obese micro-environment corresponded to increased viral replication and enhanced virulence compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honce et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with these findings, we observed increased viral variants in mice with the cardinal features of paucigranulocytic asthma, particularly within PB1. The absence of an early immune response in the asthmatic mice, that is, lack of type I interferon expression, may allow for the emergence of viral variants that would otherwise be suppressed in a healthy host. Further to this, non-asthmatic host-derived viruses showed host adaption and little sign of morbidity in WT mice, while asthmatic host-derived virus resulted in increased morbidity. This suggests that viral variants born from an asthmatic host could (transmission permitting) lead to the emergence of more pathogenic viral strains.</p><p>The influenza A viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) forms dimers of heterotrimers consisting of PA, PB1, and PB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2019</xref>), with areas of inter-subunit contact stabilising the trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pflug et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugiyama et al., 2009</xref>). Intra-host viral mutations in this complex may be deleterious, neutral, or advantageous in terms of viral pathogenesis. The β-hairpin within the PB1 thumb domain is responsible for viral replication initiation, and deletions in this region impair viral replication and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oymans and te Velthuis, 2018</xref>).</p><p>PB1 S654N (a mutation identified in asthmatic clinical samples and those from asthmatic mice) and PB1 P651Q (a mutation identified in asthmatic mice) reside within this priming loop. Interestingly, the P651 residue has previously been shown to be the primary amino acid involved in coordinating terminal initiation during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Te Velthuis et al., 2016</xref>). Glutamine residues have been documented to interact with nucleotide bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luscombe et al., 2001</xref>), and given the position of PB1 P651Q, it is possible that it alters the interaction with the 3ʹ sugar-base of the vRNA or is beneficial to structural conformation during the initiation process. Our structural analysis of PB1 P651Q predicted a stabilising effect, which was consistent with an increase in polymerase activity relative to the WT. C693Y and K691R (both of which were identified in asthmatic mice) reside in the first α-helix of the C-terminus, which constitutes the major binding region with the N-terminus of PB2 and has an overall major stabilising effect on the heterotrimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pflug et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugiyama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugiyama et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poole et al., 2007</xref>). Deletion of any of the three α-helices within the C-terminus abolishes viral gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poole et al., 2007</xref>). Double and single mutations in the C-terminus of PB1 alter viral RNA yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugiyama et al., 2009</xref>). Our structural analysis of PB1 C693Y predicted side chain interactions between the mutated residue and PB2 K32 which may increase the stability of the inter-subunits and, in turn, affect polymerase activity. Thus cumulatively, the data presented here suggest that the PB1 C693Y and P651Q mutations detected in asthmatic mice resulted in increased viral replication in various epithelial cell lines, and increased polymerase activity. It is well established that single nucleotide variants (SNVs) can drastically change the replication fidelity and pathogenicity of a virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pauly et al., 2017</xref>). As such, future research would benefit from more in-depth analysis of the effect of C693Y or P651Q within PB1 on the fidelity of the RdRp. Nevertheless, our results should be taken as proof of principal that an asthmatic host may be more likely to produce more virulent viral variants – a finding that holds wide consequences for the emergence of new viral strains.</p><p>It is important to recognise that there are several limitations associated with this study. Firstly, paucigranulocytic asthma remains a poorly understood and poorly characterised phenotype of asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tliba and Panettieri, 2019</xref>). Accordingly, we are not aware of any other mouse model of paucigranulocytic asthma that could be used to validate these results. Similarly, there was insufficient information associated with the clinical sequences used herein to determine which asthma phenotypes each patient had. Indeed, we cannot eliminate the possibility that all patients suffered from allergic, rather than non-allergic, asthma. The clinical sequences analysed in the present study were also obtained as consensus sequences, and do not account for minority viral variant populations present in any individual. Additionally, only a single measure of genetic diversity was used (Shannon entropy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abd Raman et al., 2020</xref>) although the possibility of read depth bias was considered. Finally, it must be emphasised that these data cannot be extrapolated to other subtypes of asthma where the relationship with influenza virus, and intra-host viral variation, may be markedly different.</p><p>Nevertheless, despite these limitations these data suggest that in a mouse model of paucigranulocytic asthma there is an increased diversity of influenza viral variants some of which are associated with increased polymerase activity. Additionally, we have demonstrated that virus derived from an asthmatic host can cause more severe disease when introduced to a non-asthmatic host. Given these findings, additional studies monitoring individuals with asthma (and in particular those with non-allergic asthma) for increased influenza severity and the emergence of influenza virus variants may be of value.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Viral strains and titrations</title><p>PVM strain J3666 stocks were prepared from mouse lung homogenate as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garvey et al., 2005</xref>).

Using a mouse model of asthma, the authors show that asthmatic animals suffer from more severe infection, but also that the virus appears to show greater evidence of evolution in asthmatic animals (based on variation in the viral sequence). These changes in the virus support more vigorous viral replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting an increased virulence. Crucially, infection of healthy control mice with virus derived from the asthma-prone animals also demonstrated that viral strains emerging from asthmatic animals showed increased virulence when passed back to healthy animals.</p><p>This study shows that viral evolution in compromised hosts can lead to an increase in virulence that persists when transmitted back to healthy animals. The implications of this for viral spread and evolution at a population level are important, although clearly further work is required to extend this beyond the current animal model.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A paucigranulocytic asthma host environment promotes the emergence of virulent influenza viral variants&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miles Davenport as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Cody Allison (Reviewer #1); Vijaykrishna Dhanasekaran (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses an interesting angle of the concept that varying conditions of immunosuppression can facilitate the emergence of virulent mutant strains of Influenza. Data presented partially support this hypothesis, however there are concerns regarding the virulence of strains, deep sequence analysis, the downstream analysis of mutations, and the interpretation on influenza evolution. Therefore additional experiments are necessary to substantiate the statements in the title, Abstract and Discussion.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authors state that more virulent strains emerge. While it is clear that mutational penetrance is higher in asthmatic mice, more evidence is required to establish it is more virulent.</p><p>a) weight loss and viral load are not enough to indicate virulence. This could simply be a result of the asthmatic phenotype, being unable to control virus. The increased replication <italic>in vitro</italic> is insufficient to ascribe to a mutant with higher replicative capacity.</p><p>b) what are the predominant mutations growing out of the cell lines following incubation with lung homogenates? Does it vary between the mice? If they're replicating faster they should be the predominant clones. Were the 3 asthmatic mice used for this experiment selected based upon the frequency of mutations identified in them?</p><p>c) should have histology and lung cytokines from asthmatic and non-asthmatic mice following challenge to corroborate increased virulence.</p><p>d) what happens to non-asthmatic mice when you challenge them with virus isolated from homogenised lung from the asthmatic group? Non-asthmatic animals should develop symptoms (weight loss, cytokines, oedema, infiltrates) if indeed you are generating strains of greater virulence.</p><p>2) Shannon's entropy scores in Figure 3 are non-parametric, with many asthmatic animals giving a score of zero. For PB1 (or any of the segments), can entropy scores be correlated with individual mice across the ~2-log spread of viraemia in this group (in Figure 2B) (i.e. does increased viral diversity correlate with high or low viraemia in those animals)?</p><p>3) There is concern with the use of a single measure of genetic diversity (Shannon entropy), which has been shown repeatedly to produce biased estimates (Please see. Zhao and Illingworth, Virus Evolution 5:vey041 https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vey041 ). It is also not clear what the effect of the initial template load on measures of genetic diversity at each site/gene. Did the authors check if there was sufficient template diversity as a low diversity can bias all estimates? Additionally, it would be important to show any variation between samples / days as supporting information.</p><p>4) As before, since the rest of the paper relies heavily on single mutations (e.g. PB1 693), it would be important to use robust methods, or multiple methods to check whether they are consistent.</p><p>5) A major goal of this study was to address the importance of co-morbidities is on influenza evolution, but this hypothesis is not directly tested in this paper. Using C693Y as example, it is not clear what their prevalence is among naturally circulation H1N1pdm09 viruses. By filtering publicly available sequences, the authors have identified sequences from 51 asthma cases and compared these to 51 cases matching age and sex with no co-morbities (randomly I assume), but I feel these number are quite low to derive meaningful comparisons. To make inferences about the effect on influenza evolution, I suggest to map important mutations onto gene phylogenies to identify the dominance of mutations in naturally circulating populations. e.g. has Y693 or other PB1 mutations fixed in any of the circulation sub-lineages of H1N1.</p><p>It is also interesting this mutation is predicted to increase stability, and that they potentially show increased polymerase activity. If correct, shouldn't this mutation be dominant among naturally circulating strains?</p><p>6) As a part of the RdRp, mutations within PB1 gene by itself can increase mutational frequency, but this is not explored/discussed in light of results presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61803.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authors state that more virulent strains emerge.

We have now updated the figure legend of Figure 2 to reflect a move away from virulence and instead focus on disease severity “RAGE-deficient asthmatic mice experience more severe influenza than non-asthmatic mice”. Furthermore, we have included day 4 viral titre data, histology scores of all time points, and cytokine and inflammatory marker data in the updated Figure 2.

Non-asthmatic animals should develop symptoms (weight loss, cytokines, oedema, infiltrates) if indeed you are generating strains of greater virulence.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s query, we have now performed experiments whereby we inoculated non-asthmatic C57BL/6 mice with lung homogenate from either asthmatic or non-asthmatic mice at a PFU of 2000 PFU per mouse (<bold>Figure 8</bold>). Interestingly but unsurprisingly, we saw that asthmatic host-derived IAV was associated with significantly more weight loss (Figure 8A), lower blood oxygen saturation (Figure 8B), and higher viral load (Figure 8C) than non-asthmatic host-derived IAV. Furthermore, mice infected with asthmatic host derived IAV had a significant upregulation in various anti-viral and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 8E). Furthermore, upon infection of a non-asthmatic host with non-asthmatic derived IAV, there is an observable divergence in the PB1 haplotype differences as the virus continues to adapt to its host (Figure 9A). By contrast, upon infection of a non-asthmatic host with asthmatic derived IAV, there is a consolidation of the PB1 mutations that arose during the initial infection (Figure 9B). Together this data suggests that asthmatic hosts could facilitate the emergence of new strains that have increased pathogenicity.</p><p>We have subsequently updated the Materials and methods, Results and Discussion:</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“Mouse strains</p><p>RAGE-deficient mice (<italic>Ager</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) were kindly provided by Prof. Ann-Marie Schmidt, (New York University Langone Medical Centre, USA).

For PB1 (or any of the segments), can entropy scores be correlated with individual mice across the ~2-log spread of viraemia in this group (in Figure 2B) (i.e. does increased viral diversity correlate with high or low viraemia in those animals)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting query and we thank the reviewer for suggesting it. To answer this, we assume the reviewer is referring to the viral load in the lung (PFU) when they are speaking of “viraemia” and we will answer accordingly. For the correlation analysis, we focused on the PB1 genome segment as this is the only gene that showed a difference between asthmatic and non-asthmatic in our results (Figure 3). On an individual animal level, we can see a positive relationship within the D6 asthmatic group, between the weight-loss (as a measure of disease severity) and both the Shannon Entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), and the total number of mutations in the PB1 genome segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). However, no correlation between the viral load and Shannon Entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C</xref>), or the total number of mutations in the PB1 genome segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1D</xref>) was detected. Together this suggests that at day 6, asthmatic mice that experienced more severe influenza (as determined by weight-loss) produced more viral variants, but that this did not correlate with an increased viral load.</p><p>We are happy to include this data as supplementary material if the reviewers believe it adds value to the paper.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Asthmatic day 6 samples show a positive relationship between weight loss and measures of viral diversity in the PB1.</title><p>Influenza viral RNA isolated from the lung tissue of asthmatic (n=27) and non-asthmatic (n=25) mice was analysed for viral variants.

Zhao and Illingworth, Virus Evolution 5:vey041 https://doi.org/10.1093/ve/vey041 ). It is also not clear what the effect of the initial template load on measures of genetic diversity at each site/gene. Did the authors check if there was sufficient template diversity as a low diversity can bias all estimates? Additional it would be important to show any variation between samples / days as supporting information.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that one measure of genetic diversity is limiting. However, we selected this approach to be consistent with recently published works in this field, which have relied heavily on Shannon entropy without any other measures of diversity (please see Honce et al., 2020). In light of the reviewer’s concerns, we have now compared the read depth between samples and can conclude that no bias based on difference in read depth are present. We have now included the read depth results as Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and have included the use of a single measure of genetic diversity as a limitations of the study. These additions correspond to changes in the following sections:</p><p>Results: “To account for any bias from difference in sequencing coverage, the read count for each segment was analysed and there were no significant differences between groups (Figure 3—figure supplement 1)”.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Additionally, only a single measure of genetic diversity was used (Shannon entropy), however we took into account any read depth bias, and within the field of influenza diversity this method alone has been routinely used [Honce et al., 2020; Abd Raman et al., 2020].”</p><p>We would also like to remind the reviewers that all the viral sequencing data generated in this study is available on the European Nucleotide Archive with accession number PRJEB40027 for anyone who wishes to look at our data further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As before, since the rest of the paper relies heavily on single mutations (e.g. PB1 693), it would be important to use robust methods, or multiple methods to check whether they are consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to stress to the reviewers that our paper does not rely on any one mutation for our conclusion. Rather, we are suggesting that there is an observable increase in diversity of virus isolated from an asthmatic host, compared to a non-asthmatic host. Additionally, we have now demonstrated that virus derived from an asthmatic host can cause more severe disease when introduced to a non-asthmatic host (see response to reviewer query 1d above). Given these findings, additional studies monitoring individuals with asthma (and in particular those with non-allergic asthma) for increased influenza severity and the emergence of influenza virus variants may be of value.</p><p>The purpose of creating the C693Y mutation was to demonstrate that mutations found in key areas of the PB1 protein structure, exclusive to the asthmatic group, could affect (specifically, increase) the replication capability of the virus. However, to alleviate concerns that the paper relies heavily on a single mutation (C693Y), we have now performed mutagenesis and introduced the P651Q mutation into the PB1 plasmid and observed polymerase activity. These results confirm the crystal structure findings and indicate that the P651Q mutation increases polymerase activity compared to the wild type.</p><p>We have included the data in Figure 7 and a discussion of these points in the following sections:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>“Specifically, C693Y and P651Q mutations in the PB1 of influenza virus was exclusively detected in mice with the cardinal features of paucigranulocytic asthma and these were associated with increased viral replication and polymerase activity”.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“PB1 C693Y and P651Q increases viral polymerase activity</p><p>We next sought to investigate the individual effect of the PB1 C693Y and P651Q mutations on viral polymerase activity using a minigenome assay, given its their predicted increase in stability. […] Together these data suggest that the C693Y and P651Q mutations identified exclusively in asthmatic hosts, is altering the interaction between PB1 and PB2 in a stabilising manner, resulting in increased polymerase activity”.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Our structural analysis of PB1 P651Q predicted a stabilising effect, which was consistent with an increase in polymerase activity relative to the wild type”.</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“The PB1-C693Y and PB1-P651Q mutations were independently as introduced into the PB1 gene segments of influenza A/Auckland/2009 (H1N1) using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from New England BioLabs as per the manufacturer’s instructions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A major goal of this study was to address the importance of co-morbidities is on influenza evolution, but this hypothesis is not directly tested in this paper. Using C693Y as example, it is not clear what their prevalence is among naturally circulation H1N1pdm09 viruses. By filtering publicly available sequences, the authors have identified sequences from 51 asthma cases and compared these to 51 cases matching age and sex with no co-morbities (randomly I assume), but I feel these number are quite low to derive meaningful comparisons. To make inferences about the effect on influenza evolution, I suggest to map important mutations onto gene phylogenies to identify the dominance of mutations in naturally circulating populations. e.g. has Y693 or other PB1 mutations fixed in any of the circulation sub-lineages of H1N1.</p><p>It is also interesting this mutation is predicted to increase stability, and that they potentially show increased polymerase activity. If correct, shouldn't this mutation be dominant among naturally circulating strains?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct in the assumption that the 51 cases were randomly selected. We also agree with the reviewers that the sample size of 51 clinical cases is quite small. Unfortunately, at the time of manuscript preparation, there were only 51 clinical samples that listed asthma as a co-morbidity, thus limiting our analysis.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that in order to make inferences about the effect on influenza evolution we would need to map the mutations onto phylogenies. However, as we used a mouse model, we do not expect to see these exact asthmatic mouse-specific mutations in the human population. Rather than suggesting that the mutations found within this study could arise in naturally circulating population, we are suggesting that asthmatic hosts give rise to more pathogenic mutations and using the clinical samples to highlight a similar trend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) As a part of the RdRp, mutations within PB1 gene by itself can increase mutational frequency, but this is not explored/discussed in light of results presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Due to biosafety limitations, we cannot introduce the mutations that were identified into an infectious virus as this would be classified by our institution as gain-of-function work. As a result, we cannot experimentally investigate if the C693Y or P651Q mutations lead to increased mutation rates. However, previous studies have indeed shown that specific mutations in the PB1 gene segment can contribute to altering the fidelity of the RdRp (Lin, et al., 2019) and as such the emergence of mutations.</p><p>We have now included a discussion of this possibility in the Discussion:</p><p>“It is well established that SNVs can drastically change the replication fidelity and pathogenicity of a virus [Lin et al., 2019; Pauly et al., 2017]. […] Nevertheless, our results should be taken as proof of principal that an asthmatic host is more likely to produce more virulent viral variants – a finding that holds wide consequences for the emergence of new viral strains”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
