This study aims to evaluate possible functional interplay of endogenous µ- and δ-opioid receptors (MORs and DORs) in mouse neurons. Detecting GPCR dimers in native tissues, however, has been challenging. Previously, MORs and DORs co-expressed in transfected cells have been reported to form heterodimers, and their possible co-localization in neurons has been studied in knock-in mice expressing genetically engineered receptors fused to fluorescent proteins. Here, we find that single cholinergic neurons in the mouse striatum endogenously express both MORs and DORs. The receptors on neurons from live brain slices were fluorescently labeled with a ligand-directed labeling reagent, NAI-A594. The selective activation of MORs and DORs, with DAMGO (µ-agonist) and deltorphin (δ-agonist) inhibited spontaneous firing in all cells examined. In the continued presence of agonist, the firing rate returned to baseline as the result of receptor desensitization with the application of deltorphin but was less observed with the application of DAMGO. In addition, agonist-induced internalization of DORs but not MORs was detected. When MORs and DORs were activated simultaneously with [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin, desensitization of MORs was facilitated but internalization was not increased. Together, these results indicate that while MORs and DORs are expressed in single striatal cholinergic interneurons, the two receptors function independently.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cholinergic interneurons</kwd><kwd>opioid receptors</kwd><kwd>co-localization</kwd><kwd>desensitization</kwd><kwd>internalization</kwd><kwd>dimerization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA048136</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arttamangkul</surname><given-names>Seksiri</given-names></name><name><surname>Farrens</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endogenous µ- and δ-opioid receptors do not form stable heterodimers in cholinergic interneurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Opioid receptors are a family of GPCRs targeted by endogenous peptides and exogenous opiate drugs. Three opioid receptor-subtypes, µ (MOR), δ (DOR), and κ (KOR) are known to be distributed in many brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Merrer et al., 2009</xref>). The co-expression of opioid receptor-subtypes in individual neurons has steadily gained attention because possible cross-interactions between the receptors could provide new pharmacological targets for analgesia while avoiding the side effects associated with the activation of a single opioid receptor subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujita et al., 2015</xref>). Although there is evidence from biochemical and fluorescent imaging studies to support the existence of MOR-DOR heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cahill and Ong, 2018</xref>), those studies required the use of heterologous expression and genetically modified receptors to enable experimental detection. In addition, an increasing number of studies suggest that only a small population of dimers exist and interact in a time scale of milliseconds, resulting in a proposed ‘kiss-and-run’ model of receptor dimer interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasai and Kusumi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calebiro and Sungaworn, 2018</xref>). Thus, there is still no clear evidence that endogenously expressed MORs and DORs form stable heterodimers. The major challenge for testing these possible interactions in native tissue is the fact that opioid receptors are generally expressed in low densities in neuronal tissues, thus detection of subcellular co-localization is often ambiguous. Functional readout using electrophysiological measurement is a powerful tool to detect MOR-DOR co-expression in single neurons but there are few such studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Egan and North, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chieng et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The striatum is a subcortical structure in the forebrain that plays an important role in motivation, sensorimotor function, goal-directed learning, and drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kreitzer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castro and Bruchas, 2019</xref>). The largest portion of neurons are medium spiny GABAergic projecting neurons that are also known to produce opioid peptides including enkephalin (µ-and δ-agonists) and dynorphin (κ-agonists). The striatum consists of a heterogeneous structure where all opioid receptor-subtypes have been located by various techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Le Merrer et al., 2009</xref>). MOR-binding sites are primarily detected in the striosomal patches, whereas DOR and KOR binding sites are found in both matrix and patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herkenham and Pert, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tempel and Zukin, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kitchen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banghart et al., 2015</xref>). Cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) comprise only a small population (1–2% of all neurons) and are scattered throughout the striatum. These neurons function as an important regulator of the synaptic activity within the striatum including the local release of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yorgason et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cachope et al., 2012</xref>). ChIs are spontaneously active neurons that release acetylcholine in brain slices and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilson et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Wilson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhou et al., 2002</xref>). The firing rate of these neurons is inhibited, and the membrane potential is hyperpolarized following the application of δ- but not µ-agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang and North, 1992</xref>). Other studies, however, report the presence of functional MORs in these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jabourian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Britt and McGehee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ponterio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mamaligas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muñoz et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that various ChI subpopulations contain segregated MORs and DORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jabourian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Britt and McGehee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laurent et al., 2012</xref>). To date, there is no evidence demonstrating that MORs and DORs are co-localized on ChIs.</p><p>Thus, in the present study, we used a novel labeling approach combined with image analysis and electrophysiological techniques to investigate the distribution of MORs and DORs on ChI neurons in the striatum. To enable live-cell imaging, we used a ligand-directed labeling agent, NAI-A594, to specifically attach a fluorophore to both MORs and DORs on the plasma membrane of single ChIs in brain slice preparations. The selective antagonists at DOR (SDM25N) or MOR (CTAP) were used to differentiate the two receptors and assess the degree of MOR and DOR expression. The inhibition of spontaneous firing using the selective µ-agonist (DAMGO) and δ-agonist (deltorphin II) confirmed that both MORs and DORs were present and functional on single neurons. [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin (ME) and morphine also inhibited the firing activity of ChIs. As expected, ME interacted with both receptors while morphine selectively activated MORs. Interestingly, while the extracellular recordings showed activation at each receptor fully inhibited firing activity of the neuron, in the continued presence of agonists substantial desensitization of DORs, but not MORs was observed. Similarly, only the DORs showed agonist-induced receptor internalization. Co-activation of the receptors by exogenous application of ME increased MOR desensitization. Collectively, the results in this study indicate that co-localized MOR-DOR function autonomously and there is little evidence for stable heterodimer formation, at least at functional level. Nonetheless, our data do not rule out possible downstream functional interactions that may occur when both receptors are simultaneously activated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ligand-directed labeling of opioid receptors</title><p>Naltrexamine-acylimidazole-alexa594 (NAI-A594; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–a</xref>) is a labeling reagent that has been shown to specifically bind opioid receptors and then covalently tag them with the fluorophore Alexa-594 to MORs in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arttamangkul et al., 2019</xref>).

The MOR-binding sites in the patches persisted when DORs were blocked with a selective antagonist ICI-174,864 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-b</xref>). In contrast, fluorescent labeling of the whole striatum was greatly diminished when the MOR selective antagonist, CTAP, was included in NAI-A594 solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–c</xref>). These results suggest that most of the labeling in the striatum were at MORs. Large neurons with a few dendrites near the boundary of the striosomal patches were also fluorescently tagged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–d</xref>). The cell morphology and location of these neurons suggested that they were most likely ChI neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brimblecombe and Cragg, 2016</xref>). The labeled receptors on these large neurons, however, could be either MORs or DORs, due to the ability of NAI-A594 to label both receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arttamangkul et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To verify the comparable labeling of MORs and DORs with NAI-A594, a series of biochemical experiments were done using Flag-tagged MOR (FMOR) and Flag-tagged DOR (FDOR) cells. Naltrexamine-acylimidazole-alexa488 (NAI-A488), was used to detect the labeled receptors with an anti-Alexa488 antibody, and an anti-Flag antibody was used as a control for comparison in a western blot analysis. The results showed that NAI-A488 at 30 and 100 nM reacted similarly with both receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata2">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>, for red and green bands, respectively). The labeling of FDOR and FMOR by NAI-A488 was specific, as it could be completely blocked by addition of the opioid antagonist naloxone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The fact that Alexa488-labeled receptors are detected even after denaturing gel electrophoresis confirms that the fluorophore is covalently bound to the receptors. The ability of NAI-A488 to label FDOR and FMOR was further analyzed by comparing concentration labeling curves of each receptor using an on-cell western assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata3">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata4">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1s1sdata5">Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 5</xref>). The labeling curves for NAI-A488 reacted FDORs and FMORs were similar and saturated at about 100 nM. The labeling coefficients were also comparable, with apparent Kd values of 7.1 ± 2.8 nM for FDOR and 3.3 ± 0.7 nM for FMOR (two-tailed, unpaired t-test, p = 0.2543, n = 3 experiments performed in triplicate).

In the presence of SDM25N, the fluorescence staining was further reduced as compared to CTAP-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-b</xref>).

Average mean fluorescence intensity of NAI-A594-labeled cells in the dorsal striatum was ~20 % higher than in ventral striatum (mean fluorescence± SD = 170.7 ± 57.6 for dorsal, n = 52 and 140.9 ± 47.6 for ventral n = 47; ordinary one-way ANOVA, Sidak’s test, p = 0.0100 and n = numbers of GFP-positive neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

Interestingly, when the detection of MOR was determined by NAI-A594 in the presence of SDM25N, the fluorescent intensity of labeled cells was only ~37% and ~ 47% of that observed with NAI-A594 alone in the dorsal and ventral striatum, respectively (mean fluorescence± SD = 63.9 ± 19.5, n = 48 as compared to the mean fluorescence of NAI-A594 = 170.7 ± 57.6, n = 52 for dorsal, and 65.7 ± 25.5, n = 22 as compared to the mean fluorescence of NAI-A594 = 140.9 ± 47.6, n = 47 for ventral; p &lt; 0.0001 for both, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

In experiments where no antagonists were used, ME (1 µM) caused 79.9% ± 9.9% desensitization (n = 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> bottom trace and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) that was similar to ME (10 µM, 83.0% ± 6.0%, n = 8, p = 0.9999). The degree of desensitization caused by ME (1 µM) was not different from that caused by ME plus CTAP or deltorphin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, one-way ANOVA, Sidak’s multiple comparisons, p = 0.9999 for ME (1 µM) <italic>vs</italic>. ME plus CTAP, or p = 0.9913 for ME (1 µM) <italic>vs</italic>. deltorphin).</p><p>These results were surprising because the above findings predict that activation of MORs by ME should sustain inhibition of firing activity longer, since MOR only weakly desensitizes when selectively activated. The time-course analysis of desensitization during 5-min application of ME in different conditions reveals that desensitization caused by ME activation at both receptors started slower than the desensitization of DOR caused by ME plus CTAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, two-way ANOVA, p = 0.0109 for different treatment and p = 0.0001 for time of agonist application, as compared to ME 1 µM). Conversely, the desensitization by ME alone was faster and more complete than desensitization of MOR caused by ME plus SDM25N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, two-way ANOVA, p = 0.0001 for different treatment and p = 0.0040 for time of agonist application, as compared to ME 1 µM).</p><p>These results suggest that when ME interacts with both MORs and DORs at the same time, MOR desensitization is augmented. To test this assumption, we measured the ability of DAMGO (1 µM) to inhibit the firing rate after ME-induced desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> bottom trace). The results show a substantial reduction in the inhibition as compared to the control result of DAMGO alone (36.4% ± 6.0% inhibition after ME, n = 7 <italic>vs</italic>. 98.0% ± 1.2% of DAMGO alone, n = 7, one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the ability of deltorphin (1 µM) to inhibit the firing rate after ME desensitization was also reduced (18.3% ± 3.4%, n = 5 inhibition after ME <italic>vs</italic>. 96.6 ± 2.7, n = 10 of deltorphin alone, one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, ME caused desensitization at both MORs and DORs, and desensitization of MORs could be accelerated by DOR desensitization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Receptor internalization</title><p>One possible explanation for the increase of MOR desensitization when MOR and DOR are simultaneously activated could be co-internalization of both induced by ME. To test for this, we used live cell imaging to examine agonist-induced internalization of endogenous MORs and DORs labeled with NAI-A594 in ChAT-GFP mice. Labeled ChI neurons were first imaged once before agonist application (time = 0 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> - top panel). A saturating concentration of each agonist was applied for 20 min followed by a 10-minute washout before a second image was taken.

Fluorescent puncta were found throughout the cell body of the neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–a</xref>). The F/F0 in the cytoplasm from the ME-treated neurons was significantly higher than F/F0 of cells perfused with buffer alone (1.49 ± 0.05 for ME, n = 9 and 1.13 ± 0.03 for control, n = 8, one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s test, p &lt; 0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top). Deltorphin (1 µM) was used to induce endocytosis of DORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–b</xref>). The change of fluorescence in the cytoplasm from deltorphin-treated cells was also greater than in the buffer control group (F/F0 = 1.38 ± 0.04 for deltorphin, n = 7 <italic>vs</italic> 1.13 ± 0.03 for control, n = 8, one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s test, p = 0.0002, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the MOR selective agonist DAMGO (10 μM) caused little or no redistribution of receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-c</xref> ), and the F/F0 of the cytoplasm was the same as that of the buffer control group (1.13 ± 0.03, n = 7 DAMGO <italic>vs</italic>. 1.13 ± 0.03 control, n = 8, one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s test, p &gt; 0.9999, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top).</p><p>Next, the fluorescence at the plasma membrane was determined after each treatment. The fluorescence at the plasma membrane is expected to decrease if labeled receptors are internalized. In control experiments the F/F0 on the plasma membrane was 0.96 ± 0.01 after 30 min (n = 8). A value below one suggests that a small portion of NAI-A594 may bind reversibly and be removed during washing or some small agonist-independent internalization may occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>). Following the application of ME or deltorphin, the fluorescence at the plasma membrane significantly decreased (F/F0 = 0.85 ± 0.01 for ME, n = 9 and 0.88 ± 0.01 for deltorphin, n = 7; both with p &lt; 0.0001 as compared to control buffer of 0.96 ± 0.01, n = 8, one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom). In contrast, DAMGO caused only a slight decrease of the fluorescence ratio at the plasma membrane that was the same as that of the control group (F/F0 = 0.96 ± 0.01, n = 7, one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s test, p = 0.9962, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom). The results indicate that endogenous DORs are readily internalized whereas MORs remain mostly on the plasma membrane under these experimental conditions. Importantly, ME-induced receptor internalization was comparable to DOR internalization caused by deltorphin suggesting that ME did not increase MOR endocytosis or cause co-internalization of MOR-DOR.</p><p>One caveat for this interpretation is the different time of agonist application between receptor internalization and desensitization. During this period, receptors could undergo endocytosis and recycling that differed from what was happening during the desensitization. Thus, receptor internalization caused by DAMGO (10 µM), deltorphin (1 µM) or ME (10 µM) was measured immediately after 5-min application of the agonists. The values of F/F0 in the cytoplasm from DAMGO, deltorphin and ME were not different from that of control treated with buffer (1.13 ± 0.03, n = 8 for control; 1.12 ± 0.06, n = 5 for DAMGO, p = 0.9996; 1.13 ± 0.06, n = 6 for deltorphin, p &gt; 0.9999; 1.12 ± 0.05, n = 7 for ME, p = 0.9995, one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test as compared to control, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top). Similarly, there was no decrease of F/F0 values on the plasma membrane that was different from the buffer control (0.96 ± 0.01, n = 8 for control; 0.96 ± 0.02, n = 5 for DAMGO, p &gt; 0.9999; 0.95 ± 0.01, n = 6 for deltorphin, p = 0.9819; 0.96 ± 0.01, n = 7 for ME, p &gt; 0.9999, one-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom). The results demonstrate time-dependent processes for deltorphin- and ME-induced receptor internalization and suggest that desensitization occurs before receptor internalization could be detected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Co-localization of MORs and DORs has been postulated to exist in vivo based on genetically modified receptors in knock-in mice and the use of antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gendron et al., 2015</xref>). In the present work, we used receptor imaging and electrophysiological recordings to examine MOR/DOR action and interactions in brain slices from ChAT-GFP and wild-type mice. The results demonstrate that while endogenous MORs and DORs are co-expressed on cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), they function independently and do not appear to require stable dimer formation for their activity.</p><p>Interactions between two GPCRs in vivo could result from physical association of the receptors (aka dimerization) or functional consequence of many possible down-stream events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lambert and Javitch, 2014</xref>). The discovery that MORs and DORs are present and functional in a single ChI neuron in brain slices offers a relevant model system to study these important issues. The results from this study indicate no major population of stable MOR-DOR heterodimers forms, or if physical association between the receptors does occur, it does not affect the ability of individual receptors to inhibit spontaneous activity of ChIs. In addition, each receptor undergoes distinct regulation processes. DORs desensitize more completely at a faster rate than MORs. Similar results have been reported in studies using cultured neurons from mice with genetic deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walwyn et al., 2009</xref>), neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells expressing endogenous human MORs and DORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prather et al., 1994</xref>) and <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes exogenously expressing equal amounts of MOR and DOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lowe et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>When both receptors are concurrently activated with [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin (ME), MOR exhibits an increase in desensitization, which differs from the slow induction of desensitization at only MORs. The actions of ME on co-expressed MOR-DOR are crucial in understanding functional interactions between these receptors and resultant effects on ChI activity in vivo. In conditions where ME independently interacts with each receptor (i.e., in the presence of selective antagonists for MOR and DOR), ME produces similar results to the selective agonists thus underscoring the ability of MORs and DORs to act independently in native environment. The increase in MOR desensitization induced by ME alone where MORs and DORs are simultaneously activated is most likely a heterologous action dependent on downstream processes. It is well known that G protein receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylation and arrestin-binding are common mechanisms for homologous desensitization of MORs and DORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Williams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gendron et al., 2016</xref>). Given that ME recruits arrestin to DORs more efficiently than MORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomes et al., 2020</xref>), simultaneous co-activation at MOR and DOR by ME may facilitate the interaction between arrestin and MOR. Supporting this possibility, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lowe et al., 2002</xref> found that in oocyte model, arrestin was the limiting factor for MOR desensitization and increased arrestin expression enhanced the desensitization rate.</p><p>One potential issue is that there could be an agonist bias between ME and DAMGO at inducing MOR desensitization. At MOR, ME does not exhibit biased signaling toward G protein or β-arrestin as compared to DAMGO; however, ME does have a biased activity toward β-arrestin at DOR compared to deltorphin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gomes et al., 2020</xref>). In the situation when both MORs and DORs were co-activated by ME, recruitment of GRKs/arrestins to the plasma membrane could facilitate MOR desensitization but only when MORs are simultaneously present with DORs. This hypothesis could be tested through the inhibition of GRK2/3 activity and/or genetic deletion of β-arrestin.</p><p>Co-internalization of MORs and DORs would provide supporting evidence for physical association of heterodimers. Studies in cultured neurons from mouse dorsal root ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walwyn et al., 2009</xref>) and neurons in the tissue of myenteric plexus from DOR-GFP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DiCello et al., 2020</xref>) found no co-internalization induced by a selective agonist of MORs or DORs. Similarly, here we found that internalization of MOR and DOR are very different from each other in ChIs. Our data show deltorphin evoked significant DOR redistribution from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm, but there was no receptor internalization induced by the MOR selective agonist DAMGO. Because receptor internalization by ME was not greater than that induced by deltorphin, the results suggest that the receptors do not traffic together, even with simultaneous activation. This finding does not eliminate the possibility of transient formation of dimers on the plasma membrane, for example through a so-called ‘kiss-and-run’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurevich and Gurevich, 2008</xref>). In such a scenario, the change in downstream signaling including GRK/arrestin could still modify desensitization that occurs prior to receptor internalization whether the receptors will form dimers or not. It is also not known if the lifetime of a heterodimer will be long enough to have an action on the activation process. Thus far, only MOR-MOR homodimers have been studied by single molecule analyses, and these studies found no evidence of MOR-MOR homodimers at a basal condition, even at high receptor densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Möller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asher et al., 2021</xref>). MOR-MOR-homodimers however could be induced by DAMGO with a lifetime of ~460 milliseconds indicating the rapid decay of dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Möller et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>One possible criticism of the above analysis would be to propose that NAI-A594-labeled receptors are less likely to be internalized. We do not think this is likely to be the case for the following reasons. (1) ME induced the same increase in potassium conductance in A594-labeled and unlabeled locus coeruleus neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arttamangkul et al., 2019</xref>). (2) Agonist-induced endocytosis of NAI-A594 labeled MORs occurs in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arttamangkul et al., 2019</xref>) and in cultured habenular neurons (personal communication with Dr. Damien Jullié, UCSF). (3) The attached fluorophore is of much smaller molecular size compared to reporter proteins or antibodies used in the study of subcellular localization of receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choquet et al., 2021</xref>), thus it is less likely that A594-tagged receptors would exhibit defective receptor activation. The low signal-to-noise with the use of live brain slices could also limit the detection of low numbers of events and thus accumulation of the fluorescent signal in the cytoplasm. The trafficking of DORs is mainly targeted to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsao and von Zastrow, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scherrer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pradhan et al., 2009</xref>), therefore the fluorescent signal in the cytoplasm would increase with time. It should be noted that although the receptors may be degraded in the lysosomes, the Alexa594 dye will remain fluorescent because of its stability in acidic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">King et al., 2020</xref>). MORs are known to recycle to the plasma membrane, especially when the agonist remains bound to the receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jullié et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kunselman et al., 2019</xref>). Because slow wash-out of agonist is common in brain slice preparations, it is possible that recycling process of MORs in cultured cells is detected more easily than in brain slices.</p><p>Finally, we note our discovery that striatal cholinergic interneurons co-express MORs and DORs, presenting a new perspective on the role of ChIs in regulating synaptic circuitry in the striatum, particularly after opioid treatment. The present study uncovers distribution of MORs and DORs in ChIs throughout the striatum (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and the co-localization of MORs and DORs have been functionally studied in the area of ventral striatum. It is not known if MORs and DORs on ChIs in the dorsal striatum may act like those in the ventral part. The labeling results suggest that MORs and DORs could also co-express on ChIs in the dorsal striatum. Because DORs are more abundant than MORs in the dorsal ChIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), one would predict that MOR desensitization could be accelerated by co-activation of DORs relative to the observations in the ventral striatum. More importantly, the relative function of MOR and DOR when found on the same cells may be altered after animals are chronically treated with morphine. A number of studies have reported functional up-regulation of DOR in several brain areas, possibly resulting from an increased receptor expression on the surface membrane (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gendron et al., 2015</xref>). In DOR-GFP mice, chronic morphine, however, does not change surface expression of the GFP-tagged DORs on ChIs in the dorsal striatum, and the expression even decreases in the ventral ChIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leah et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the results in this study illustrate co-existence of endogenous MOR and DOR on the surface membrane of ChIs in the striatum. We find that both receptors function independently and are differently regulated when activated by selective agonists. In spite of their autonomous signaling, the interactions induced by downstream processes such as phosphorylation and/or arrestin binding suggest important functional interactions apart from direct receptor association.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R.norvegicus, Sprague Dawley, male and female</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock# 001RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:RGD_734476">RGD_734476</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>M. musculus</italic>, C57BL/6 J, male and female</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock# 000664RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>M. musculus</italic>C57BL/6 J (ChAT-BAC-eGFP)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stock # 007902RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:007902">IMSR_JAX:007902</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>M. musculus</italic> C57BL/6 J MOR-KO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schuller et al., 1999</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Oprm1</italic>-exon-1 knockout mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. John E.

A stock solution of 100 µM in 2% DMSO-water was made and used within one week. The following reagents were purchased from companies as indicated in parentheses: DAMGO, naloxone and (+)MK-801 (Hello Bio, Princeton, NJ), [DAla<sup>2</sup>]-Deltorphin II and SDM25H HCl (Tocris, Minneapolis, MN), [Met<sup>5</sup>]enkephalin (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ), CTAP (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Morphine alkaloid was obtained from National Institute on Drug Abuse, Neuroscience Center (Bethesda, MD) and was dissolved in a few drops of 0.1 M HCl and an adjusted volume of water to make a stock solution of 10 mM. All salts to make artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) used in electrophysiological experiments were purchased from Sigma.

Mice (21–28 days), both male and female, on a C57BL/6 J background were used for all genotypes. ChAT(BAC)-eGFP transgenic mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and the homozygous pairs were bred. Wild-type mice were raised from breeders obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. MOR-KO (<italic>Oprm1 gene</italic>) mice were gifted from Dr. John Pintar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schuller et al., 1999</xref>). Juvenile Sprague-Dawley rats (21–28 days), both male and female, were raised from two breeding pairs that were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Chemical labeling of endogenous MOR and DOR in brain slices</title><p>Rats and mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and brains were removed and placed in warm (30 °C) oxygenated ACSF plus MK-801 (0.03 mM). Brain slices were prepared (280 µm thickness) using a vibratome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany). The slices containing striatum between bregma 0.38–1.4 mm of mouse brain and 0.6–2 mm of rat brain were collected and allowed to recover in oxygenated warm ACSF (34 °C) containing 10 µM MK-801 for 30 min. Slices were then hemisected. One half was incubated in oxygenated ACSF containing 100 nM NAI-A594 for 1 hr at room temperature. In a separate vial, the other half of brain slice was also incubated for 1 hr at room temperature in the solution of 100 nM NAI-A594 plus CTAP (1 µM) or NAI-A594 plus SDM25N (0.5 µM) to selectively block the labeling of MOR or DOR, respectively. The labeled slice was then transferred to an upright microscope (Olympus BX51W1, Center Valley, PA) equipped with a custom-built two-photon apparatus and a 60 x water immersion lens (Olympus LUMFI, NA 1.1). Both Alexa594 dye and GFP were excited simultaneously with a high-frequency laser beam at 810 nm (Chameleon, Coherent, Inc, Santa Clara, CA). Fluorescence of GFP and Alexa594 were acquired and collected in two separate channels using ScanImage software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pologruto et al., 2003</xref>). Each image acquisition contained 10 optical slices at 0.5 µm thickness. Each optical slice was averaged from five consecutive scans of 512 × 512 pixels. Brain slices were submerged in continuous flow of ACSF at a rate of 1.5–2 ml/min and drugs were applied via superfusion. All experiments were done at 34°C. Macroscopic images of labeled slices were captured with a Macro Zoom Olympus MVX10 microscope and a MV PLAPO2xC, NA 0.5 lens (Olympus). Alexa594 dye was excited with yellow LED (567 nm). The slices were kept under ACSF in a petri dish during data acquisitions. Data were acquired using Q Capture Pro software (Q Imaging, British Columbia, Canada).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Brain slices were prepared as described for the labeling study. A loose cell-attached extracellular recording was done with an Axopatch-1C amplifier in current mode. Recording pipettes (1.7–2.1 MΩ, TW150F-3, World Precision Instruments, Saratosa, FL) were filled with 175 mM NaCl buffered to pH7.4 with 5 mM HEPES. The on-cell pipet resistance varied in the range of 5–15 MΩ. Immediately the cell attaching was formed, spontaneous activity of the neuron was monitored. Only cells that showed steady regular firing at baseline for 3–5 min were used in the experiments. Data were collected at sampling rate of 10 KHz, and episode width of 50 s with Axograph X (1.5.4). Drugs were applied by bath perfusion. Bestatin (10 μM, Sigma) and thiorphan (1 μM, Sigma) were included in all peptide solutions to prevent enzymatic degradation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Chemical labeling of FDOR and FMOR in HEK293 cells</title><p>Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were originally obtained from ATCC (Cat. No. CRL_1573) and maintained in house. Its identity has been authenticated and there is no mycoplasma contamination. HEK293 cells expressing FlagDOR and FlagMOR were generated by transfection with FlagMOR and FlagDOR plasmids obtained from Dr. Mark von Zastrow (UCSF). Stable expressing cells were selected, grown and maintained in Dulbecco’s minimal essential media (DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), Geneticin sulfate (0.5 mg/ml, ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) and antibiotic-antimycotic (1 x, ThermoFisher). Twenty-four hr before labeling, cells were seeded at 3.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in a 12-well plate. The next day, cells were labeled with 30 or 100 nM NAI-A488 for 30 min at 37°C. Control cells were labeled in the presence of excess 10 μM naloxone to confirm the specificity of labeling. After the labeling period, cells were washed two times in PBS + 1 µM naloxone, followed by incubation with 10 µM naloxone in PBS containing calcium and magnesium at 37°C for another 10 min. Cells were then placed on ice and washed two times in ice-cold PBS plus 1 μM naloxone. The wells were scraped, and cell pellets collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. Whole cell extracts were produced by resuspending cell pellets in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0 % nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5 mM PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 X Halt protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific Cat. No. 78437)) and nutating for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected for further analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit II (cat. no. 5000112) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The NAI-A488-labeled cell extracts were then subjected to western blotting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Cell extracts prepared from NAI-A488-labeled cells were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by western immunoblotting. Ten μg total protein of each sample was denatured in SDS containing sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 62.5 mM Tris pH 6.8, 0.001% bromophenol blue) in the presence of 0.1 M DTT, at 37°C for 10 min. The samples were then loaded onto 8% SDS-polyacrylamide denaturing gels and run until the dye front just ran off the bottom. The proteins were then electro-transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-FL, cat. no. IPFL00010), blocked in Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR, cat. no. 927–40000) and probed with two primary antibodies, M1 anti-FLAG MAb (Sigma, cat. no. F3040, used at a 1:600 dilution) and rabbit anti Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, cat. no. A11094, 1:500), followed by washing and incubation with two secondary antibodies, goat-anti mouse IgG Alexa-680 (Thermo Fisher, A28183, 1:5,000 dilution) and goat-anti rabbit IgG IRDye CW 800 (LI-COR cat no. P/N 926–32211, 1:10,000 dilution). Antibodies were diluted in a buffer consisting of 1/10 diluted Odyssey Blocking Buffer, TBS (20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl)/1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.2% Tween-20. Blots were washed in TBS/1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>/0.3% Tween-20, and final washes were in TBS/1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The western blot membranes were scanned using a Sapphire Biomolecular Imager (Azure Biosystems) at 784 nm and 658 nm excitation and images were acquired using Sapphire Capture software (2017).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>On-cell western analysis</title><p>96-well, black walled, optical bottom plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 165305) were coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-D-lysine followed by seeding, in triplicate for each condition, 3.0 × 10<sup>4</sup> DOR or MOR cells per well. 24 hr later, using the same method as above, the cells were labeled with varying concentrations of NAI-A488 (0, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 nM) and duplicate wells were labeled with each NAI-A488 concentration in the presence of 10 μM naloxone, in order to determine non-specific binding. After the final PBS wash, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, 20 min, at room temperature, washed in PBS three times and then blocked for 1.5 hr, at room temperature, with rocking, in Odyssey Blocking Buffer. The fixed and blocked cells were then incubated overnight at 4°C, on an orbital shaker with primary antibodies (M1, 1:600 and rabbit anti-Alexa Fluor 488, 1:500) diluted in 1:10 Odyssey Blocking Buffer in TBS/1 mM CaCl2. The next morning, the wells were washed five times, 5 min each in TBS containing 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.05% Tween-20 (OCW wash buffer), followed by incubation in secondary antibodies (Goat-anti mouse IgG-Alexa-680, 1:2500; goat anti-rabbit-IRDye CW 800, 1:5000 diluted in OCW wash buffer) for 1 h, at room temperature while rocking. The wells were then washed five times for 5 min in wash buffer, followed by three washes for 5 min each in TBS plus 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The wells were air-dried before imaging on a Sapphire Biomolecular Imager using 784 nm and 658 nm excitation. In this experiment, the signal from 784 nm excitation represents opioid receptors modified by NAI-A488, while the 658 nm signal indicates opioid receptor present in each condition. Background values were obtained from cells that were labeled with 100 nM NAI-A488, but that did not receive any primary antibody. Fluorescence intensities were quantitated using AzureSpot Analysis Software (version 2.0.062). All values were background subtracted and the 784 nm signal for each condition was normalized to the 658 nm signal in the same condition. The ratios (784/658) were also calculated for cells labeled with NAI-A488 in the presence of 10 μM naloxone. Prism 6 (GraphPad software, SanDiego, CA) was used to construct concentration dependent curves of non-specific and total labeling and calculate Kd’s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantitative image analysis of membrane fluorescent intensity</title><p>We wrote an ImageJ macro to automate the fluorescent intensity analysis of two-photon microscopy data using Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rueden et al., 2017</xref>). The data were collected from two fluorescence emission channels, GFP and Alexa 594. The macro inputs a data stack, first deinterleaving the channels and Gaussian blurring (sigma = 1) to smooth the GFP channel’s pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moments-preserving thresholding is then applied to generate a mask on each slice of the GFP signal. We assigned this GFP mask’s edge corresponding to the shape of the neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The assignment was verified qualitatively, and the result was well-matched with the signals of NAI-A594 staining on the membrane. Some errors however may occur particularly along dendritic branching planes resulting in truncated masking (down skewing the membrane mean intensity measurement), and the data in this area would be avoided (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The mask from each GFP optical slice was then overlaid onto the same optical slice of corresponding Alexa594 channel. The procedure was scanned through every optical section to ensure that the largest area corresponding to the shape of the neuron was included in the analysis. The membrane fluorescent intensity was measured by converting the GFP mask area to a line with a random break introduced along its length. The line traced along the membrane-mask edge and thereby the neuron’s membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The mean pixel intensity was collected along the line’s length. Each data stack is analyzed over ten consecutive slices. The mean fluorescence of each optical slice was pooled and computed for the mean membrane fluorescence intensity of a neuron (F-memb). The macro was run without intervention by a researcher who was blinded to the data collection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantitative image analysis of receptor endocytosis</title><p>With the same masking procedure, the analysis comprised two separate operations on the selected mask. The first operation was to determine the mean membrane fluorescent intensity (F-memb) as described earlier. The second operation used an 8-pixel dilation (corresponding to ~0.6 µm) along every point in the membrane mask’s definition to define an area of the neuron’s cytoplasmic portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The mean cytoplasmic fluorescent intensity of each optical slice was measured from this area, and all slices’ means were pooled and averaged for the final output of mean cytoplasmic fluorescence (F-cyt) of a neuron.</p><p>Receptor endocytosis was determined by two methods. One method calculated the change of cytoplasmic fluorescent intensity from the ratio of F/F0, where F = F-cyt/(F-cyt+ F memb) after drug treatment and F0 = F-cyt/(F-cyt+ F memb) before drug treatment. The other method used F/F0 calculated from membrane fluorescent intensity and F = F-memb/(F-cyt+ F memb) after drug and F0 = F-memb/(F-cyt+ F memb) before drug.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) except the data of fluorescent membrane surface intensity, which is shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The number of sample size is indicated in the figure legends. Statistical analysis and graphs were made with Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, SanDiego, CA). One-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test was used to compare treatment groups and p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. A non-linear saturation of one-site binding curve was constructed from total and non-specific labeling curve and Kd was calculated from curve fitting values using Prism 6.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Software, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal uses were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and with approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol #IP00000160 of the Oregon Health &amp; Science University.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This manuscript addresses an important question in the opioid field – whether the mu opioid receptor and the δ opioid receptor are likely to function independently, or whether their signaling is coupled, e.g. if they form heterodimers. Using live imaging with a tag that labels both receptors and electrophysiological recordings in cholinergic striatal interneurons in brain slices, the authors conclude that the receptors most likely act independently. The work is carefully done, and while the possibility remains that there may be interactions between the two receptors, either by rapid on/off dimerization or downstream signaling, this work adds to our understanding of the system and provides important evidence in favor of independent receptor activation.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Functional independence of endogenous μ- and δ-opioid receptors co-expressed in cholinergic interneurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Lu Chen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Brady K Atwood (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The manuscript lacks detailed statistical analyses, mostly relying on descriptions of the data as interpreted by the authors. In most places there are no indications of which statistical analyses were utilized and what the outcomes of those analyses were. In the few places where analyses were indicated, it is not clear that the appropriate tests were used (e.g. using an unpaired t-test when an ANOVA, and possibly a repeated measures ANOVA should have been used).</p><p>2. The Met-enkephalin data are puzzling and raise several concerns.</p><p>a) 5D middle trace looks like ME-induced desensitization could just be slower for MOR, please show a longer time course than 5 min in 5E.</p><p>b) 5C: the order of treatments is highly inconsistent (agonist-agonist, agonist-antagonist-agonist, etc). Order seems to be important as DAMGO immediately after Delt doesn't desensitize (top panel in 5C), but does when applied first (middle panel of 5C), but is less efficacious following a washout of MetEnk (lower panel of 5C). In order to make this interpretable, please use a consistent approach to treatments: how long they are on, what treatments are used between DAMGO/Met-Enk and Delt/Met-Enk, etc.</p><p>c) It remains unclear why Met-enk pretreatment results in MOR desensitization. The authors hypothesize that the desensitization that occurs in MORs after Met-enk administration could be due to the coincidental recruitment of GRK/arrestin by DORs.

The authors need to consider the term more deeply (think pentameric ion channels as the bar for direct protein-protein dimers), and revise the language, intro and discussion throughout to better clarify what they mean by GPCR dimers? Do they mean like GABA-B, or do they mean like ion channels…or do they mean like many people think Class A receptors that kiss one another quickly, and then move on. And/or that the receptors are packaged together for anterograde transport or retrograde trafficking and that's really all they come close to one another for.

The manuscript lacks detailed statistical analyses, mostly relying on descriptions of the data as interpreted by the authors. In most places there are no indications of which statistical analyses were utilized and what the outcomes of those analyses were. In the few places where analyses were indicated, it is not clear that the appropriate tests were used (e.g. using an unpaired t-test when an ANOVA, and possibly a repeated measures ANOVA should have been used).</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical analyses are now included in all the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The Met-enkephalin data are puzzling and raise several concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>The results with Met-enkephalin (ME) are very interesting. All the concerns are addressed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) 5D middle trace looks like ME-induced desensitization could just be slower for MOR, please show a longer time course than 5 min in 5E.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point. Our data show that MOR desensitization caused by ME + SDM25N was slower than desensitization of both receptors induced by ME alone or DOR desensitization induced by ME + CTAP during 5-minute desensitization (two-way ANOVA for time treatment, p = 0.0040 or p&lt;0.000, respectively). The analysis results have been included in the result section.</p><p>Although in principle we agree that a time course longer than 5 minutes could show values of MOR desensitization closer to that of DOR desensitization, we have not carried out the suggested experiment for two reasons. First, we do not think that the results would change the conclusion of our study, as it would not change the fact that we observe different regulation processes of MORs and DORs co-expressed in a single neuron. Second, measuring spontaneous firing in real-time is technically challenging experiment to carry out, especially when we do not know how long we would have to measure (since we do not know when MOR desensitization will reach the same extent as DOR). Hence, we do not include these experiments but instead included the results of MOR and DOR desensitization selectively induced by ME that were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (see above and line 275-277 in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) 5C: the order of treatments is highly inconsistent (agonist-agonist, agonist-antagonist-agonist, etc). Order seems to be important as DAMGO immediately after Delt doesn't desensitize (top panel in 5C), but does when applied first (middle panel of 5C), but is less efficacious following a washout of MetEnk (lower panel of 5C). In order to make this interpretable, please use a consistent approach to treatments: how long they are on, what treatments are used between DAMGO/Met-Enk and Delt/Met-Enk, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this, we did experiments where there was no antagonist between the application of DAMGO (10 µM, 5 minutes) and deltorphin (1 µM, 2 minutes). The results were not different from those that used CTAP. This new experiment and results are now presented in Figure 5C and 5 F.</p><p>In the top trace, there was no DAMGO (1 µM)-induced desensitization because of a short application time (2 min). This application is very different from the middle trace where application of a higher concentration of DAMGO, 10 µM was applied for 5 minutes.</p><p>The results on the top and middle trace in Figure 5C and the summary (Figure 5F) indicated that pre-desensitization of MOR by DAMGO or DOR by deltorphin did not reduce the subsequent inhibition of firing caused by activation of -DOR or MOR, respectively.</p><p>The bottom trace shows that the ME caused desensitization of the combination of MOR and DOR. The inhibition induced by DAMGO or deltorphin was reduced following washout of ME (summary is included in Figure 5F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) It remains unclear why Met-enk pretreatment results in MOR desensitization. The authors hypothesize that the desensitization that occurs in MORs after Met-enk administration could be due to the coincidental recruitment of GRK/arrestin by DORs. However, the data in Figure 6 suggests that Met-enk does not result in greater internalization, which would argue against this hypothesis. Please provide more data that establish this interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we did experiments where internalization was examined after 5-minute treatment with ME, deltorphin or DAMGO to compare with the desensitization time course. There was negligible internalization by any agonist. The data is included in Figure 6C. These results suggest that receptor desensitization occurred prior to internalization and that GRK/arrestin recruitment results in desensitization without internalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Address why Met-Enk is different than DAMGO. Is it biased signaling? (try a highly arrestin-biased agonist or in an arrestin KO tissue)?</p></disp-quote><p>DAMGO is a selective MOR agonist. ME is a full agonist at MOR and DOR. DAMGO and ME are non-biased agonists at MOR while ME shows small biased activity toward b-arrestin at DOR (Gomes et al., 2020). We reason that the GRK/arrestin pathway may play important roles for this difference between MOR and DOR and that we have planned to address this question in the future work using GRK inhibitors as well as arrestin KO tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Met-Enk was used to co-activate the two receptors, why not try a co-activation with DAMGO and Delt as a parallel to the Met-Enk. Same results or different?</p></disp-quote><p>This study focused on ME because it is an endogenous peptide that activates both receptors. Using the same ligand will provide better understanding of biased signaling by different receptors in the same environment. It is also more physiological relevant because the D2-MSNs in striatum produce enkephalin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript by Arttamangkul et al., tests how the responses to a selective agonist to one receptor affects subsequent responses to an agonist of the other, using receptor internalization and electrophysiological responses to gauge the likelihood that MOR and DOR receptors act independently vs. as a unit.

The transient heterodimer formation is possible but experiments to determine the dynamic interaction between the two receptors at molecular levels such as FRET-FLIM will be necessary. This will require a selective labeling at MOR and DOR with a donor-acceptor pair of fluorophores by NAI reagents, which is beyond the scope of this current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

If both of the MOR and DOR binding sites were available in this distinct conformation, DAMGO or deltorphin would desensitize the receptor at the same rate since a dimer would act as a single unit. If one of the binding sites is not accessible to the agonist, ME + CTAP or ME + SDM25 would show the same desensitization rate because ME would be able to bind either MOR or DOR.

This study focused on the functions of MOR and DOR in the ventral striatum since the expression of MORs and DORs as determined by NAI labeling in this area was not different. The data from NAI-A594 labeling showed that there were more DORs than MORs in the dorsal than ventral striatum, thus it is possible that action of MOR and DOR in the in the dorsal striatum could be different from the ventral striatum.
