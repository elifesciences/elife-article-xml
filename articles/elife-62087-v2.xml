Proteins of the PAR and Crumbs complexes are pivotal to epithelial polarization, but the mechanistic understanding of polarization is challenging to reach, largely because numerous potential interactions between these proteins and others have been found, without a clear hierarchy in importance. We identify the regionalized and segregated organization of members of the PAR and Crumbs complexes at epithelial apical junctions by imaging endogenous proteins using stimulated‐emission‐depletion microscopy on Caco-2 cells, and human and murine intestinal samples. Proteins organize in submicrometric clusters, with PAR3 overlapping with the tight junction (TJ) while PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6β form segregated clusters that are apical of the TJ and present in an alternated pattern related to actin organization. CRB3A is also apical of the TJ and partially overlaps with other polarity proteins. Of the numerous potential interactions identified between polarity proteins, only PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6β are spatially relevant in the junctional area of mature epithelial cells, simplifying our view of how polarity proteins could cooperate to drive and maintain cell polarity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many of our organs, including the lungs and the intestine, are lined with a single layer of cells that separate the inside of the organ from the surrounding environment inside the body. These so-called epithelial cells form a tightly packed barrier and have a very characteristic organization.</p><p>The apical surface faces the outside world, while the basal surface faces the inner tissues. These different interfaces are reflected in the organization of the cells themselves. The shape, composition, and role of the apical cell surface are distinct from those of the basal surface, and they also contain different proteins. In some epithelial cells, the apical surface specializes and forms protruding structures called microvilli. Thus, epithelial cells are said to be polarized along this apical–basal axis. Over the last 30 years, many labs have identified and studied which proteins help epithelial cells become and stay polarized.</p><p>Previous biochemical experiments showed that these so-called polarity proteins interact with each other in many different ways. But it remains unclear whether some of these interactions are more important than others, and where exactly in the apical or basal membranes these interactions take place.</p><p>Mangeol et al. used super-resolution microscopy to observe the polarity of proteins at the apical membranes of both human and mouse cells from the small intestine to answer these questions. They focused on areas called tight junctions, where the intestinal cells connect with each other to form the barrier between the outside and the inside. First, all the polarity proteins clustered together in various formations, they were not distributed uniformly. For example, one protein called PAR3 was at the level of the tight junctions, whereas other proteins were closer to the apical surface and the outside world. Only two pairs of proteins – PAR6 and aPKC, and PALS1 and PATJ – formed stable clusters with each other. This finding was unexpected because previous biochemical experiments had predicted multiple interactions. Third, the PALS1/PATJ complexes stayed at the bottom of the microvilli protrusions, whereas PAR6/aPKC were inside the protrusions.</p><p>Taken together, these experiments reveal a detailed snapshot of how the polarity proteins themselves are organized at the apical surface of epithelial cells. Future work will be able to address how these protein complexes behave over time.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>Caco-2 cells</kwd><kwd>polarity proteins</kwd><kwd>STED</kwd><kwd>human intestine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-INBS-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangeol</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE14-0032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangeol</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Instituts thematiques multi-organismes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Plan Cancer</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangeol</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-LABX-0054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangeol</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangeol</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post doctoral grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangeol</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteins pivotal to epithelial polarization organize in separated clusters, simplifying the current view by showing that a small fraction of the many protein–protein interactions proposed are prominent in mature epithelia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In epithelial tissues, cells coordinate their organization into a polarized sheet of cells. Each cell acquires an apico-basal organization and specialized lateral junctions, namely, tight junctions (TJs, also known as zonula occludens), adherens junctions, and desmosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farquhar and Palade, 1963</xref>). This organization is key to the development, maintenance, and function of epithelial tissues.</p><p>Over the past two decades, several proteins have been discovered to be pivotal to epithelial polarization, such as PAR3, PAR6, aPKC (PAR complex), Crumbs, PATJ, PALS1 (Crumbs complex), Scribble, LGL, and DLG (Scribble complex) in mammals (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assémat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pickett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rodriguez-Boulan and Macara, 2014</xref>). These proteins are remarkably well conserved over the animal kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belahbib et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Le Bivic, 2013</xref>). Deletion or depletion of one of these proteins usually results in dramatic developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alarcon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charrier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hakanen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lalli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sabherwal and Papalopulu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tait et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whiteman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the quest to understand the role of polarity proteins, numerous genetic and biochemical studies have been carried out. We and others have found that these proteins interact to form multiprotein complexes. Pioneering studies defined three core complexes based on the discovery of protein interactions or localization: the PAR complex consisting of PAR3, PAR6, and aPKC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joberty et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 2000</xref>), the Crumbs complex consisting of CRUMBS, PALS1, and PATJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhat et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makarova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roh et al., 2002b</xref>), and the Scribble complex consisting of Scribble, LGL, and DLG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bilder et al., 2000</xref>). However, this view became more complex over the years as many interactions between proteins of different complexes can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assémat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hurd et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemmers et al., 2004</xref>), and interactions of polarity proteins with cytoskeleton regulators and lateral junction proteins are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assémat et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Macara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itoh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Médina et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roh et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takekuni et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). A current limitation in the understanding of polarization is that there is no clear hierarchy of the importance of these numerous interactions. Potential interactions revealed through biochemical assays do not necessarily reflect relevant interactions in cells and do not specify when nor where in the cell these interactions could be relevant.</p><p>Polarity proteins have been localized with classical light microscopy, and remarkably, they are often found concentrated at the apical junction, a key organizational landmark of epithelial cells. To understand how polarity proteins cooperate to orchestrate cell polarization, one needs to understand how precisely polarity proteins organize with respect to apical junctions or the cytoskeleton. However, except for a few limited cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hirose et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izumi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2020</xref>), the precise localization of polarity proteins at these organizational landmarks is missing. Moreover, knowing how polarity proteins organize in relation to each other in the cell should enable us to decipher from their plentiful known potential interactions, which ones are more relevant in specific subregions of the cell.</p><p>To tackle these challenges, we decided to systematically localize with stimulated‐emission‐depletion (STED) microscopy the polarity proteins that are key to the establishment of the apical pole of epithelia: PAR3, aPKC, PAR6β, PATJ, PALS1, and CRB3A. These proteins localize at the apical junction region of epithelial cells. Because how proteins interact and localize is likely to depend on cell differentiation, we decided to focus here on mature epithelia, a state where we hypothesize that protein interactions and localization are stationary. Using human and murine intestine and Caco-2 cells, we first imaged endogenous polarity proteins with respect to the TJ to appreciate their overall organization in the region. Second, we localized these proteins two-by-two to uncover relevant apical polarity protein subcellular associations. Finally, we focused on the organization of polarity proteins with respect to the actin cytoskeleton. We find that polarity proteins localize in distinct subregions that do not reflect the canonical definition of polarity protein complexes. In addition, their localization with respect to the cytoskeleton emphasizes some emerging roles of polarity proteins as regulators of actin organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Polarity proteins are localized in separate subdomains in the apical junction region</title><p>To obtain a first estimate of polarity protein localization in the TJ region, we systematically imaged each polarity protein with respect to a marker of the TJ. To this end, each apical polarity protein and a TJ marker (ZO-1 or Occludin) were immunostained and imaged together using STED microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hell and Wichmann, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To optimize the sample orientation, samples were cryo-sectioned when needed, in particular to obtain apico-basal orientation. Since we focused on mature epithelia, intestinal cells were observed exclusively in villi and Caco-2 cells were seeded on filters and grown over 14 days to allow sufficient differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pinto et al., 1983</xref>). Because the resolution of STED microscopy followed by deconvolution was, in our hands, about 80 nm in each color channel, the gain of resolution compared to classical confocal microscopy approaches was threefold in the planar orientation and sevenfold along the apico‐basal axis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Polarity proteins localize in separate subdomains in the tight junction (TJ) region in human (<bold>A–C</bold>) and murine (<bold>D–F</bold>) small intestine biopsies.</title><p>(<bold>A, D</bold>) STED images of protein localization in the TJ area.

While we mostly found PAR3 at the TJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A, C, D, and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A and C</xref>), PAR6β and aPKC were at the TJ level and apical of the TJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A and C</xref>).

These differences may originate from sample preparation or differences in cell organization due to tissue maturation.

Surprisingly, we found PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6β well segregated from each other when we observed them in the planar orientation. They sometimes appeared as alternating bands along the junction with a spatial repeat in the range of 200–300 nm (zooms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In some cases, these bands seemed formed by clusters facing each other in neighboring cells, indicating potential coordination of polarity protein organization between adjacent cells. Second, we found that only a minority of CRB3A colocalized with any of the other polarity proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These observations are also surprising because CRB3A has been reported to strongly interact both with PALS1 and PAR6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayase et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemmers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makarova et al., 2003</xref>). This could mean that these interactions are mostly transient or that they are not prominent in the TJ area. This result questions the stability and functional cellular meaning of the canonical CRB3-PALS1-PATJ complex and the CRB3-PAR6 interaction. Finally, when localizing PAR3 along with PALS1 or aPKC, we found that PAR3 is hardly found with either of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These data show that PAR3, aPKC, and PAR6β do not associate in a static complex as has been suggested in several non-mammalian models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso and Henrique, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris and Peifer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morais-de-Sá et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>). It appears, in our conditions, that aPKC and PAR6β are likely linked in the apical TJ region, whereas PAR3 is poorly associated with them. Again, it is possible that the interaction between PAR3 and PAR6β-aPKC is mostly transient or that it is not relevant in the TJ area. We conclude that PAR3 is largely excluded from other polarity proteins at the TJ and that PALS1-PATJ, PAR6β-aPKC, and CRB3 form three spatially separated entities in the apical region of the TJ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>PATJ localization in the TJ region with electron tomography</title><p>In the generally accepted description of the canonical Crumbs complex, PALS1 binds to the transmembrane protein CRB3A and PATJ binds to PALS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roh et al., 2002b</xref>). Therefore, PALS1 and PATJ are thought to be in close vicinity of the membrane since CRB3A is a short transmembrane protein. Moreover, it was proposed that PATJ links CRB3A-PALS1 to the TJ area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michel et al., 2005</xref>) because of the direct interaction of PATJ with the TJ protein ZO-3 and Claudin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roh et al., 2002a</xref>). Our protein-proximity analyses, however, raise the question of whether PALS1/PATJ interact with CRB3A in the TJ region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and our localization of PATJ with STED suggests that most PATJ proteins are often too far from the TJ to interact with this structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).

We started by quantifying PATJ position with respect to the TJ, using as a reference the most apical part of the TJ (defined morphologically as the most apical position of contact between neighboring cells’ plasma membranes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We found that most PATJ proteins were about 80 nm away from the TJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Although PATJ molecular structure is not known, given its sequence including multiple potent unstructured domains between PDZ domains, it is likely that as a folded protein its size cannot fill the 80 nm gap we find. Therefore, our data suggest that most PATJ molecules do not interact directly with TJ proteins. We found instead most PATJ proteins were close to the apical membrane and that only a small fraction was present in microvilli or the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Previous observations that PATJ associates with ZO-3 or Claudin1 might depend on the cellular state, or these interactions could be transient.</p><p>CRB3A is thought to anchor PALS1 and PATJ to the plasma membrane. However, given our results showing a minor colocalization of PATJ and PALS1 with CRB3A, it is unlikely to be the case for most PALS1 and PATJ molecules. Therefore, the localization of PATJ close to the apical membrane led us to wonder whether PATJ together with PALS1 could be associated with the apical plasma membrane via interactors that remain to be discovered. Thus, we measured the distance of the immunogold label of PATJ to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and found that the distance of the gold label is in most cases compatible with the association of PATJ and PALS1 with the apical plasma membrane (123/169 ≈ 73% of gold particles were less than 38 nm away from the plasma membrane, corresponding to the size of the primary and gold-labeled secondary antibody combination added with the size of PALS1). We conclude that PATJ and PALS1 are likely to be anchored to the apical membrane not by CRB3A but by yet unknown apical membrane proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Organization of PATJ-PALS1, PAR6β-aPKC, and the actin cytoskeleton</title><p>Because polarity proteins play a key role in the epithelial organization, we wondered how these proteins were organized with respect to the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is very densely packed in the TJ region, which makes challenging the identification of where polarity proteins are localized with respect to the actin structure, if not impossible, with 2D STED. Indeed, the method leads to overlaps between actin structures that are then very difficult to extricate. Therefore, we chose to use 3D STED, which has a planar resolution lower than 2D STED (about 120 nm) but a much higher axial one (about 140 nm), making it a tool of choice to decipher how polarity proteins organize together with actin in three dimensions.</p><p>We find that in the region where PATJ, PALS1, PAR6β, and aPKC are located, the actin cytoskeleton identified with 3D STED consists mostly of microvilli structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Our results show that of these eight potential interactions, only two, namely, PAR6β-aPKC and PALS1-PATJ, are likely to be stable or spatially restricted, clarifying the current view on how polarity proteins interact in the apical junction area of the cell. We question the existence of the canonical Crumbs and PAR complexes as previously described and propose that only PAR6β-aPKC and PALS1-PATJ can be defined as major structural complexes.

In mammalian epithelial cells, PAR3, PAR6, and aPKC have been thought to interact at apical junctions as these proteins concentrate there, but only PAR6 and aPKC are found at the apical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Satohisa et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, in a few non-mammalian systems, PAR3 was observed as segregated from PAR6 and aPKC at epithelial apical junctions: when observed with confocal microscopy, PAR3 is basal of PAR6 and aPKC in the apical junctions of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> embryos during cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris and Peifer, 2005</xref>), as well as in chick neuroepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso and Henrique, 2006</xref>). Our data suggest that the segregation of PAR3 from PAR6-aPKC is likely to be a conserved principle of organization in polarized epithelia. Even if the interaction of PAR3 with PAR6-aPKC is central to polarization, it is likely to be transient. The mechanistic basis for the transient character of the interaction between PAR3 and PAR6-aPKC in mammalian epithelia may be similar to the Cdc-42-dependent mechanisms found in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morais-de-Sá et al., 2010</xref>) or <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodriguez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> also found that polarity proteins can organize in clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dickinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Although this was observed in very different conditions, this points to a potentially conserved mechanism on how polarity proteins organize.</p><p>Our finding that PAR3 localizes at the TJ confirms previous observations using electron microscopy in rat small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Izumi et al., 1998</xref>) and MDCK cells. One recent study found a small fraction of PAR3 at the level of the adherens junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). Even though STED allows for a much larger volume to be probed compared to electron microscopy, we did not observe PAR3 basal of the TJ. The localization of PAR3 may depend on the cell type as well as its maturation state, but interestingly PAR3 is never found in the region apical of the TJ, where we find the other polarity proteins.</p><p>Because CRB3 is a transmembrane protein and several studies reported its interaction with PALS1, it was thought to anchor PALS1 and PATJ to the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makarova et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roh et al., 2002b</xref>). Similarly, it is suggested in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> that Crb recruits Par-6 and aPKC to the apical membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morais-de-Sá et al., 2010</xref>). Our study suggests that the recruitment of PALS1, PATJ, PAR6β, and aPKC to the plasma membrane is unlikely to be due to CRB3A because CRB3A poorly colocalizes with these proteins. Nevertheless, our data suggest that PALS1-PATJ are localized at the plasma membrane, perhaps confined in this area by another set of interactors to be uncovered. This last observation is likely to be similar for PAR6-aPKC. We cannot rule out both for PALS1-PATJ and PAR6β-aPKC that the interaction with CRB3A could be transient, and that this transient interaction would be sufficient to localize these protein complexes in the apical surface area.</p><p>The importance of polarity proteins for the epithelial organization points to the fact that these proteins are likely to play a key role in the organization of the cytoskeleton. Several proteins having a role in actin regulation have been shown to interact with polarity proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazellières et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Médina et al., 2002</xref>), but how polarity proteins could influence actin organization is largely unknown. The correlation of organization between the actin cytoskeleton and PAR6-aPKC and PALS1-PATJ clusters points to a potential structural or instructional role of these proteins in the cytoskeleton organization. These findings call for further investigations, including functional and structural approaches.</p><p>We have shown that our observations were not the consequence of methodological artifacts, as live imaging on PAR6β-Citrine CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in and immunolabelling gave very similar results on the same cells, and permeabilization with or without detergent allowed us to observe the same organization of PATJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Nevertheless, because of the size of antibodies, the combination of primary and secondary antibodies displaces the fluorescent signal from the epitope it targets by about 25 nm. Can this displacement alter our conclusions regarding protein organization? The fluorescent densities observed with STED are very likely to be the result of the clustering of tens of fluorophores, therefore tens of antibodies recognizing tens of polarity proteins. Because these densities are created by tens of antibodies, we speculate that these antibodies are oriented isotropically in space. As a result, the use of antibodies might slightly increase the size of polarity protein clusters, but the fluorescence created by antibodies in images is well centered on polarity protein clusters, making antibodies a tool of choice for this study.</p><p>Are clusters of polarity proteins smaller than the diffraction limit? It is often not the case, as many fluorescent densities can be as large as twice the diffraction limit and often display complex shapes, indicating clusters of polarity proteins larger than 80 nm. It would be very valuable to understand how these clusters are organized at a smaller scale, and how other proteins are implicated, including cytoskeletal proteins. Moreover, single-molecule approaches used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dickinson et al., 2017</xref> could help to further identify the nature of polarity protein clusters and their stoichiometry.</p><p>In this study, we define endogenous polarity protein organization and how polarity proteins are likely to interact. The early concept of polarity protein complexes introduced by biochemical studies is impractical today because of the very large number of potential interactions between proteins discovered. Additionally, it omits important features, such as the dynamics of interaction and their reality in relation to cell subregions. Our study proposes a snapshot of the polarity organization in mature intestinal epithelial cells that calls for a novel, more dynamic definition of interactions between polarity proteins and associated proteins that will be needed to uncover the mechanistic basis of cell apico-basal polarization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>A clone of Caco-2 cells, TC7, was used in this study because differentiated TC7 cells form a regular epithelial monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chantret et al., 1994</xref>).

In each case, the reference protein was a TJ protein (ZO-1 or Occludin) that was localized precisely, defining a reference position along the junction from which intensity measurement was done. For planar orientations, the reference was the maximum intensity of the TJ marker along the junction; intensity measurements consisted in getting the intensity profiles of proteins perpendicular to the junction, all along the junction. For apico-basal orientations, we measured intensity profiles on the apico-basal axis, all along the junction. On a given profile, the reference was taken at the most apical point where the TJ marker intensity was a third of its maximum intensity; the reason for this choice is that TJs spread along the apico-basal axis tended to vary up to threefold from one cell to another and this definition of the reference allowed us to define a reproducible apical edge of the TJ. In the process, we used bilinear interpolation to obtain subpixel quantification. The results of analyses were then normalized for intensity for each junction to avoid junction-to-junction intensity variation. Because we used a reference protein for each junction, we could then align all results based on the reference position of the reference protein and pool all results into a single protein density plot. Since we used either ZO-1 or Occludin as references, we controlled that these proteins are localized similarly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Protein–protein proximity analysis</title><p>The principle of quantification of protein–protein proximity was introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2010</xref>. The authors of this method observed that the autocorrelation of a given image or the cross-correlation between two images coming from two different channels showed a peak at its center. The ratio of amplitude between the peaks of the cross-correlated and autocorrelated images gave a good estimate of protein proximity, which they coined the protein–protein proximity index. This index is similar to more classical colocalization coefficients, but we found that the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2010</xref> was well suited for proteins distributed along a junction.</p><p>In practice, we extracted junctions from two-color images, restricting the analysis to a band of 400 nm centered on the reference given by the TJ (as defined earlier). As we found the analysis to be dependent on orientation, when planar orientation was used, we excluded junctions that were not straight. All extracted junctions of a given protein pair to be examined were then concatenated into one large two-channel image on which we achieved autocorrelation and cross-correlation analysis (autocorrelation is achieved on each channel, and cross-correlation is achieved with both channels). We extracted the amplitude of peaks obtained in each of the autocorrelated and cross-correlated images as proposed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wu et al., 2010</xref>. Therefore, when analyzing protein 1 and protein 2 proximity, we obtain the amplitude A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> from the autocorrelation of images of protein 1 and protein 2, respectively, and the amplitude C<sub>12</sub> from the cross-correlation analysis. One evaluates the fraction of protein 1 colocalizing with protein 2 with the protein–protein proximity index P<sub>1</sub> = C<sub>12</sub>/A<sub>2</sub>, and the fraction of protein 2 colocalizing with protein 1 with the protein–protein proximity index P<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>12</sub>/A<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we color-coded the values of these indices.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Danelle Devenport as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript addresses a fundamental problem: the organisation of epithelial polarity determinants at the apical domain of human epithelial cells. Mangeol et al. investigate this question using super-resolution microscopy approaches (STED) in polarised intestinal epithelial cells. Using immunofluorescence labeling of endogenous proteins, they provide a careful characterization of Par3-Par6-aPKC and Patj-Pals1-Crb3a localization relative to tight junctions. They find that each protein localizes in the near vicinity of the tight junction, in a clustered organization. Through pairwise colocalization analyses, they observe significant separation of polarity proteins that are generally considered to be part of the same molecular complex based on biochemical assays. Specifically, PAR3 is not associated with aPKC or PAR6, and CRB3a colocalizes poorly with all other polarity proteins, raising interesting questions for future analyses.</p><p>The imaging performed in this study is skillful and beautifully presented and, achieving an isotropic resolution of about 80nm, is impressive. However, because of this great gain in resolution compared to other studies of similar components, the major concern of all three reviewers is that the process of fixation and immunostaining may introduce artefacts that are causing the segregated dots to appear. Variable antibody quality and insufficient validation of antibody specificity raise additional concerns about the observed patterns of localization.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The issues with fixation and antibodies would be best addressed by generating endogenously tagged, CRISPR-knockin GFP versions of some of the proteins studied, which is technically straightforward to perform these days, and would allow the conclusions to be drawn with full confidence. As such experiments would constitute major experimental revisions and will take some time to complete, we recommend confirming the most novel and possibly contentious protein pairs: for example PALS1 versus aPKC, and perhaps CRB3a compared to others.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>Related to fixation and immunofluorescence:</p><p>1. All of the results depend on antibody quality, specificity and antigenicity, but no antibody validation provided (with the exception of PATJ). If one primary antibody is less specific than the others, the colocalisation data will be heavily skewed, appearing not to be colocalised. Perhaps this can explain why Crb3a fails to colocalise with the other proteins? Validating the results with a second primary antibody or an endogenously tagged GFP-fusion protein would alleviate this concern.</p><p>2. Antibodies are in the range of 10-15nm in length, so with an isotropic resolution of 80 nm, this might have to be taken into account when using primary and secondary antibodies to reveal proteins. In particular, monoclonal versus polyclonal antibodies might have differing effects on localisation precision. I would very much appreciate some comments or thoughts on the fact that polarity proteins were revealed using antibodies.</p><p>3. The authors use rather high concentrations of detergent (1% SDS or 1% Triton X-100) for permeabilisation according to their protocols. Are they not worried that this might affect tissue integrity and protein distribution? Couldn't these conditions cause segregated clusters to appear?</p><p>Other major points:</p><p>1. Figure 1. It would be good to show and demonstrate that Occludin and ZO-1 labeling are completely interchangeable in terms of localisation precision.</p><p>2. Figure 3. I do understand the authors' rational for analysing the localisation in the orientation (planar versus apical-basal) that reveals the largest distance, but it would be good to nonetheless show the other orientation for completeness (maybe as supplementary).</p><p>3. Figure 5. The final figure shows overlapping PATJ and aPKC at TJs, with the aPKC lost from TJs upon knockdown of PATJ. This result seems to suggest that the CRB-PALS-PATJ complex must directly bind/recruit aPKC to TJs, which seems to conflict with their earlier conclusions that these complexes are completely separated in punctae and do not truly overlap at the nanoscale.</p><p>4. Figure 5. The super-resolution characterization of actin organization is not as extensive or convincing as the description of polarity protein localization. A closer examination of actin organization relative to PATJ and aPKC at junctional, apical, and villi positions would strengthen the findings in Figure 5.</p><p>5. I am also a bit confused by the analysis presented in Figure 5 with regards to colocalisation of components with apical F-actin structures and the deduction from these and the EM data that some components, aPKC/Par6, localise to 'the first row of' microvilli near junctions whilst PALS1-PATJ localise near the base of said microvilli. How would localisation to the apical plasma membrane outside of or within microvilli be restricted to only the ones near junctions? There is not only F-actin in microvilli but also all over and near the apical cortex, so what distinguished the ability of aPKC/PAR6 to bind to actin in microvilli? The PATJ knock-down results are interesting, and I agree suggestive of some interaction between the complexes and actin organisation. But without further analyses as to what other components might be affected in their localisation in this situation, it is hard to judge whether the effect on actin is a direct or rather indirect one, so I am unsure as to what these images add without more in depth follow-up.</p><p>6. In some cases the number of biological replicates is small. Only one mouse sample was used, and the quantifications of junctions are performed across just 1 or 2 cell culture replicates (although more replicates were performed, just not used for quantification). Therefore, the data reflect the variability across junctions (violin plots in Figures1-2) but they don't reflect the variability across biological replicates. This also means the p-value in Figure 5 was calculated using n=number of junctions rather than n=experimental replicates, which would be a more appropriate comparison of means. Quantifying the data across 3 biological replicates to show the variability across experiments would greatly strengthen the results and conclusions.</p><p>7. The authors rightly point out where their study fits within what has been attempted by other labs previously in order to understand and dissect apical polarity complex function. They clearly define interesting aspects, such as PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6 forming independent clusters, and the lack of colocalisation and thus maybe association with Crumbs3. In contrast to the last sentence statement of their abstract 'This organization at the nanoscale level significantly simplifies our view on how polarity proteins could cooperate to drive and maintain cell polarity.' I cannot yet see what these results simplify about our understanding of apical polarity complexes and even more so what the authors' new model is of how the complexes work. This needs to be spelt out more clearly, please.</p><p>8. I would also point out that, in part, other studies have pointed in the same direction. The recent paper by the Ludwig lab (Tan et al. 2020 Current Biology 30, 2791-2804) points in part in a similar direction, identifying a vertebrate 'marginal zone' similar to the one already known from invertebrate epithelia, as well as identifying basal to this an apical and basal tight junction area. Furthermore, as the authors themselves discuss in the discussion, the 'splitting away' of Par3 has been observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia (embryonic, follicle cells and eye disc), and should maybe be introduced already at an earlier point of the paper. Furthermore, papers by Wang et al. and Dickinson et al., that also analyse PAR complex clustering should be cited and mentioned in the introduction/discussion (Wang, S.-C., Low, T. Y.

As this was reported many times, such artifacts can be due to a lack of specificity of antibodies, or because of fixation or permeabilization. The use of CRISPR knock-in fluorescent versions of the proteins studied can alleviate these artifacts.</p><p>We tried to prepare PAR6β, PATJ, and CRB3A with fluorescent tags; PALS1 and aPKC could not be used because they come in several isoforms (Kamberov et al., JBC, 2000; Shaha et al., Placenta, 2022). The CRISPR knock-in of the fluorescent protein Citrine in PAR6β in Caco-2 cells was successful. The GFPtagged version of PATJ we tried resulted in the diffused localization of the protein in the cytoplasm in Caco-2 cells, suggesting artifacts of tagging. Our lab has tried to obtain CRISPR knock-ins of CRB3A in Caco-2 cells without, so far, any success. CRISPR knock-ins are powerful tools, but we can witness as many other labs working on human cell lines that successful knock-ins are strongly protein-dependent and lead to many failures.</p><p>To best address the reviewers’ concerns, we designed the following experiment using the CRISPR knock-in PAR6β-Citrine in Caco-2 cells. Since we observed the organization of polarity proteins in fixed samples thanks to superresolution microscopy, the imaging of the fluorescent tag had to be achieved on a live sample with superresolution microscopy to allow for comparison. Moreover, to ensure that we observe the same organization in fixed and live samples, we first imaged with STED the fluorescent protein Citrine in live Caco-2 cells, then fixed, permeabilized, and labeled the cells with antibodies and finally came back to the exact same cells observed in live and imaged them with STED, this time thanks to an AlexaFluor-568 labeled antibody. We find the same clusters of PAR6β when observed live with Citrine or fixed with AlexaFluor-568. This comparison rules out the possibility that the observed clusters are artifactual and confirms our results using superresolution.</p><p>How we modified our manuscript:</p><p>Examples of these experiments are reported in Figure 3A and we described these results in the main text (lines 131-146, page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major points:</p><p>Related to fixation and immunofluorescence:</p><p>1.

Nevertheless, because of the size of antibodies, the combination of primary and secondary antibodies displaces the fluorescent signal from the epitope it targets by about 25nm. Can this displacement alter our conclusions regarding protein organization? The fluorescent densities observed with STED are very likely to be the result of the clustering of tens of fluorophores, therefore tens of antibodies recognizing tens of polarity proteins. Because these densities are created by tens of antibodies, we speculate that these antibodies are oriented isotropically in space. As a result, the use of antibodies might slightly increase the size of polarity protein clusters, but the fluorescence created by antibodies in images is well centered on polarity protein clusters, making antibodies a tool of choice for this study.”</p><p>To keep the discussion on monoclonal <italic>versus</italic> polyclonal antibodies here, the epitopes used to obtain polyclonal antibodies are very small in fully folded proteins, domains encompassing epitopes being in the order of a few nanometers. Therefore, while monoclonal antibodies will always reach the same location in a protein, polyclonal will reach positions that will differ by a few nanometers at most. We believe this effect is negligible in comparison to the use of primary and secondary antibodies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

To the best of our knowledge, the concentrations used in our manuscript are commonly reported in the field, and we adjusted the concentration to their minimum to obtain reproducible results. To verify that the detergents we use are not responsible for the clustered organization of proteins, we created a protocol where permeabilization with detergents is replaced by freezing and thawing cells once in liquid nitrogen, which partially cracks cell membranes. We already used this protocol in the initial version of the manuscript Figure 4 when deciphering the location of PATJ with electron microscopy. The morphology of cells was preserved in these conditions.</p><p>Using this protocol for STED microscopy on PATJ, we could not witness any significant difference with the images obtained with detergent. It is to be noted that only labeling with PATJ worked in these conditions. Freezing and thawing cells was not sufficient to detect any antibody of the other polarity proteins.</p><p>The results come in addition to what we observed with the CRISPR knock-in (See our response above 2.) and confirm that our observations are not due to artifacts.</p><p>How we modified our manuscript:</p><p>Examples of these experiments are reported in Figure 3B and we described these results in the main text (lines 154-159, page 11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other major points:</p><p>1.

The proximity analysis presented in Figure supplement 1 of Figure 4 is obtained from single cell culture as these are very difficult experiments that are confirmations of results obtained in Figures 1 and 2. The results obtained with electron tomography are also obtained with one cell culture replicates, although on several cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors rightly point out where their study fits within what has been attempted by other labs previously in order to understand and dissect apical polarity complex function. They clearly define interesting aspects, such as PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6 forming independent clusters, and the lack of colocalisation and thus maybe association with Crumbs3. In contrast to the last sentence statement of their abstract 'This organization at the nanoscale level significantly simplifies our view on how polarity proteins could cooperate to drive and maintain cell polarity.' I cannot yet see what these results simplify about our understanding of apical polarity complexes and even more so what the authors' new model is of how the complexes work. This needs to be spelt out more clearly, please.</p></disp-quote><p>The main question many previous studies focused on was “what interactions between polarity proteins and other proteins exist”. If we focus only on proteins observed in this manuscript, these studies concluded that PAR6β can interact with PAR3, aPKC, and CRB3A, aPKC can interact with PAR3 and PAR6, PALS1 can interact with CRB3A, PATJ, and PAR6. This has led to multiple reviews and articles, including ours, presenting polarity proteins as a block of many interacting proteins, without any hierarchy in what could be the most relevant interactions.</p><p>We show in our manuscript that of these 8 potential interactions between key proteins, only two, namely the pairs PAR6β/aPKC and PATJ/PALS1, are likely to be described as prominent or stable, discarding the other 6 as stable in this area of the cell.</p><p>How we modified our manuscript in an attempt to better explain these facts:</p><p>– We rephrase the last sentence of the abstract: “Of the numerous potential interactions identified between polarity proteins, only PALS1-PATJ and aPKC-PAR6β are spatially relevant in the junctional area of mature epithelial cells, simplifying our view of how polarity proteins could cooperate to drive and maintain cell polarity.”</p><p>– We revised the paragraph addressing this point in the previous version of the manuscript (discussion, pages 20-21, lines 304-323).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. I would also point out that, in part, other studies have pointed in the same direction. The recent paper by the Ludwig lab (Tan et al. 2020 Current Biology 30, 2791-2804) points in part in a similar direction, identifying a vertebrate 'marginal zone' similar to the one already known from invertebrate epithelia, as well as identifying basal to this an apical and basal tight junction area. Furthermore, as the authors themselves discuss in the discussion, the 'splitting away' of Par3 has been observed in Drosophila epithelia (embryonic, follicle cells and eye disc), and should maybe be introduced already at an earlier point of the paper. Furthermore, papers by Wang et al. and Dickinson et al., that also analyse PAR complex clustering should be cited and mentioned in the introduction/discussion (Wang, S.-C., Low, T. Y. F., Nishimura, Y., Gole, L., Yu, W., and Motegi, F. (2017). Cortical forces and CDC-42 control clustering of PAR proteins for <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryonic polarization.
