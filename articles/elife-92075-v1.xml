has been linked to selected microRNAs in individual studies; however, an unbiased genome-wide approach to map T2D induced changes in the miRNAs landscape in human liver samples, and a subsequent robust identification and validation of target genes are still missing.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Liver biopsies from age- and gender-matched obese individuals with (n=20) or without (n=20) T2D were used for microRNA microarray analysis. The candidate microRNA and target genes were validated in 85 human liver samples, and subsequently mechanistically characterized in hepatic cells as well as by dietary interventions and hepatic overexpression in mice.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Here, we present the human hepatic microRNA transcriptome of type 2 diabetes in liver biopsies and use a novel seed prediction tool to robustly identify microRNA target genes, which were then validated in a unique cohort of 85 human livers. Subsequent mouse studies identified a distinct signature of T2D-associated miRNAs, partly conserved in both species. Of those, human-murine miR-182–5 p was the most associated with whole-body glucose homeostasis and hepatic lipid metabolism. Its target gene <italic>LRP6</italic> was consistently lower expressed in livers of obese T2D humans and mice as well as under conditions of miR-182–5 p overexpression. Weight loss in obese mice decreased hepatic miR-182–5 p and restored <italic>Lrp6</italic> expression and other miR-182–5 p target genes. Hepatic overexpression of miR-182–5 p in mice rapidly decreased LRP6 protein levels and increased liver triglycerides and fasting insulin under obesogenic conditions after only seven days.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>By mapping the hepatic miRNA-transcriptome of type 2 diabetic obese subjects, validating conserved miRNAs in diet-induced mice, and establishing a novel miRNA prediction tool, we provide a robust and unique resource that will pave the way for future studies in the field. As proof of concept, we revealed that the repression of <italic>LRP6</italic> by miR-182–5 p, which promotes lipogenesis and impairs glucose homeostasis, provides a novel mechanistic link between T2D and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and demonstrate in vivo that miR-182–5 p can serve as a future drug target for the treatment of obesity-driven hepatic steatosis.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported by research funding from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (KI 1887/2-1, KI 1887/2-2, KI 1887/3-1 and CRC-TR296), the European Research Council (ERC, CoG Yoyo LepReSens no. 101002247;

Accordingly, obesity is the leading risk factor for T2D and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Yet, while almost 90% of individuals with T2D are overweight or obese, not all obese individuals develop T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narayan et al., 2007</xref>). Multiple factors play a role in the development of T2D, including genetics, lifestyle, and the gut microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chobot et al., 2018</xref>). Non-genetic risk factors such as epigenetic changes induced by aging, weight gain, and intrauterine programming were shown to contribute to the increasing prevalence of T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ling and Groop, 2009</xref>). microRNAs (miRNAs), as one epigenetic mechanism, have the potential to simultaneously regulate the expression of multiple genes and entire pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, miRNAs can mediate organ cross-talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gurwitz, 2015</xref>), and the dysregulation of a few miRNAs can have deleterious effects on a systemic level (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambros, 2001</xref>). Aberrant expression of miRNAs in T2-diabetic subjects was already shown in human adipose tissue, pancreatic beta cells, skeletal muscle, and blood (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agbu and Carthew, 2021</xref>). However, although the liver is the central organ to maintain whole-body glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rines et al., 2016</xref>) little is known about alterations of hepatic miRNA expression in T2-diabetic subjects.</p><p>miR-103 and miR-107 directly regulate insulin sensitivity in liver and adipose tissue of obese mice by repressing caveolin-1 and insulin receptor signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trajkovski et al., 2011</xref>). Likewise, miR-802 impairs hepatic insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kornfeld et al., 2013</xref>) and the highly expressed miRNAs miR-34a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2015</xref>) and miR-122 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2012</xref>) perturb hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in mice. Nevertheless, most studies on hepatic miRNAs in T2D pathogenesis were performed in laboratory rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trajkovski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2016</xref>) or liver cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerin et al., 2010</xref>), and human data is largely elusive. We have shown that miR-let-7e is increased in livers of T2-diabetic subjects and associated with down-regulation of the insulin receptor substrate 2 gene (<italic>IRS2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krause et al., 2020</xref>). A comprehensive evaluation of all hepatic miRNAs transcribed and dysregulated in T2-diabetic subjects is nonetheless missing. Importantly, miRNAs are already used as drug-targets for cancer treatments and provide an excellent basis to develop novel therapies for metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krützfeldt et al., 2005</xref>). Accordingly, here we aimed to conduct a thorough profiling of hepatic miRNA signatures that are associated with T2D in obese human subjects with or without type 2 diabetes, to identify miRNAs that control key genes involved in metabolic pathways as well as NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance etiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design human cohort</title><p>All participants of the human cohort signed informed consent.

All clinical parameters were measured at the Institut für Klinische Chemie und Laboratoriumsmedizin, Zentrum für Diagnostik, Universitätsklinikum Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, according to the DIN EN ISO 15189:2014 certification. Serum glucose, cholesterol, HDL, and triacylglycerols were determined using photometric assays (kinetic bichromatic analysis; in-house assay). HbA1c was quantified by capillary electrophoresis or by turbidimetric inhibition assays (in-house assay). Insulin levels were quantified from frozen serum samples using the Human/Canine/Porcine Insulin Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&amp;D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, US). Subjects were categorized by (1) the use of anti-diabetic medication and (2) by definition of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) into subjects with T2D (receiving anti-diabetes medication or HbA1c≥6.5%, n=41) and non-diabetic controls (not receiving anti-diabetes medication and HbA1c&lt;5.7%; n=44, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>).

Mice were maintained on a 12 hr light-dark cycle with free access to water and a standard chow diet (Altromin, #1314) or 58% high-fat diet (HFD) (Research Diets, D12331). For the weight cycling study, mice were subjected to HFD for 24 weeks before intervention: The group termed HFD remained on HFD during the study. The remaining two groups of DIO mice were divided as follows: Diet switch (HC) animals continued to receive ad libitum access to HFD for 12 weeks before they were switched to a chow diet for the remaining 12 weeks of the study. In contrast, weight cycling (YoYo) mice were switched to a chow diet on day 0 of the study for 12 weeks and then fed again ad libitum with HFD for another 12 weeks. Age-matched mice fed chow were used as a control group. At the end of the diet-intervention study, all mice were fasted for 4 hr at the start of the light phase before being sacrificed by cervical dislocation for organ withdrawal. To obtain plasma blood was collected in EDTA-containing tubes and centrifuged at 4°C and 2000 × g for 10 min. Mice used for the DIO miRNA microarray analysis were fed HFD for 28 weeks.

This is reasoned by the minimal group mean log2 value which was declared as ‘is expressed’ by the TAC software and which could be quantified by qPCR. Moreover, multiple associations to the incidence of type 2 diabetes or other metabolic traits and missing associations to BMI and age were mandatory to be declared as candidate genes for qPCR validation.

In a medium-sized but well characterized human cohort, we were able to assess for the first time the hepatic miRNA transcriptome of obese individuals with T2D compared to obese control subjects. We identified a distinct signature of 28 hepatic miRNAs that were associated with T2D of which 19 miRNAs were associated with further metabolic traits. Of those, the human/murine conserved miRNA miR-182–5 p showed the strongest upregulation in T2D subjects and moreover correlated to multiple metabolic traits and pathways of glucose and lipid metabolism including fasting glucose, HbA1c, and liver fat content. The newly validated miR-182–5 p target gene <italic>LRP6</italic> was consistently downregulated in livers of obese T2-diabetics and in obese insulin-resistant mice as well as by in vivo and in vitro miR-182–5 p overexpression. While hepatic miR-182–5 p overexpression increased liver fat content and fasting insulin levels in mice, weight loss in DIO mice reversed miR-182–5 p induction and partially restored its target genes in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) indicating a therapeutic potential for future miR-182–5 p-based drugs.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Dynamic regulation of insulin resistance and hepatic lipogenesis by miR-182–5 p.</title><p>Expression of 28 microRNAs was significantly altered in the liver of humans with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) versus humans with obesity but no diabetes (ND). These regulated microRNAs were compared to the hepatic microRNA transcriptome of obese mice and associated with metabolic traits. From those miR-182–5 p was selected as overlapping candidate. LRP6 is the main target gene and consistently altered in humans, cell culture, and obese mice. miR-182–5 p is induced by long-term feeding of high-fat diet in mice and reversed by weight loss. Liver-specific upregulation of miR-182–5 p in metabolically challenged mice induced hepatic fat accumulation and increased fasting insulin levels.

Only five miRNAs that were dysregulated in livers of obese T2D humans were conserved in obese insulin-resistant mice. Of note, the discrepancy between the here identified miRNAs and known miRNAs regulating glucose metabolism in murine studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trajkovski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kornfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dávalos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanin et al., 2018</xref>) may be based on the design of our human study. Both groups of our human study cohort were severely obese, and our analysis did not compare the obese miRNA transcriptome to a lean control group. Consequently, obesity-induced miRNAs likely escaped our analysis. Furthermore, in our logistic regression analysis, we used the NAFLD activity score (NAS) as cofactor to exclude hepatic lipid content and fibrosis as driving factor for altered miRNA expression. Accordingly, our previously identified T2D-induced hsa-let-7e-5p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krause et al., 2020</xref>) shows under this stratification only a strong trend (p=0.0518) to be elevated in T2D. If we exclude NAS as cofactor, we can reproduce the significant association (p=0.0265, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) which is accompanied by an aging effect (p=0.0286, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). Nevertheless, we here comprehensively evaluated all hepatic miRNAs transcribed in humans and identified miRNAs specifically dysregulated in obese T2-diabetic, compared to obese non-diabetic subjects.</p><p>hsa-miR-182–5 p is transcribed as part of a highly conserved cluster including miR-183/96/182 whose expression is upregulated in a variety of non-sensory diseases, including cancer, neurological, and auto-immune disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dambal et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, in our cohort, only the expression of miR-182–5 p was increased and associated to T2D and other metabolic traits whereas the other cluster members were not detected in the here investigated biopsies. Our findings are in agreement with a previous study where increased hepatic miR-182–5 p expression was associated with the severity of NAFLD-related fibrosis in a smaller cohort of 30 subjects matched for age, sex, BMI and T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leti et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, increased hepatic miR-182–5 p expression levels were also reported in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolganiuc et al., 2009</xref>) and rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nie et al., 2018</xref>) models of NAFLD. Here, we reproduced and mechanistically extended these findings in liver biopsies of 85 obese subjects and in DIO mice undergoing weight-cycling. In addition to the known associations of miR-182–5 p with hepatic lipid metabolism, we revealed strong correlations to genes and clinical parameters associated with glucose tolerance. This new link of miR-182–5 p to glucose homeostasis is further support by our in vitro findings of reduced glucose uptake and impaired insulin signaling after miR-182–5 p overexpression. Additionally, in vivo miR-182–5 p overexpression not only increased hepatic fat content but also increased fasting insulin levels which itself is a predictor of T2D in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weyer et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Since miRNAs can be released into circulation from various tissues, serum miRNAs are potential, minimally invasive biomarkers for tissue health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hayes and Chayama, 2016</xref>). However, since most of the previously reported circulating miRNAs which are associated with T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiménez-Lucena et al., 2018</xref>) are not among the 28 hepatic miRNAs discovered in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), our human hepatic miRNA transcriptome now reveals that serum miRNAs might not be suitable to assess dysregulations of hepatic liver glucose and lipid metabolism. We could also not reproduce the previously described association between T2D and serum miR-182–5 p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref> and B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weale et al., 2020</xref>). The validity of serum miR-182–5 p as biomarker for T2D manifestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weale et al., 2020</xref>) in a disease-duration and treatment-specific manner in T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weale et al., 2021</xref>) could not be tested in our cohort as disease duration and precise duration and dosages of the diabetes treatment was not available for all study participants. Furthermore, serum miR-182–5 p concentrations might be biased by miR-182–5 p released from dead cells of other tissues than liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Szilágyi et al., 2020</xref>) and our analysis did not distinguish between cell-free miRNA and extracellular vesicular miRNAs, potentially impacting the diagnostic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Endzeliņš et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, recent motif analyses identified that miRNAs might contain liver-specific cell-retention signals, such as ‘AGAAC’ that prevent their release into circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Martin et al., 2022</xref>). This retention signal is present in hsa-miR-182–5 p (UUUGGCAAUGGU<bold><underline>AGAAC</underline></bold>UCACACU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Martin et al., 2022</xref>) and could explain why we did not find differences in serum miR-182–5 p between our study groups. Furthermore, it strengthens our assumption that miR-182–5 p is particularly relevant for regulating liver metabolism in an autocrine/paracrine manner. Lastly, our results highlight the risk to miss important disease mechanisms when solely focusing on blood-based epigenetic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krause et al., 2019</xref>) and the urgent need for tissue-specific resource databases as presented in this study.</p><p>According to the miRNA-gene interaction database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karagkouni et al., 2018</xref>), the lipogenic target genes of miR-182–5 p <italic>SCD</italic> and <italic>FASN</italic> should be downregulated upon miR-182–5 p induction. However, we hypothesize that the increased expression of key genes of cellular de novo lipogenesis is rather an effect of the miR-182–5 p mediated repression of <italic>LRP6</italic> than a direct miRNA-mRNA interaction. <italic>LRP6</italic> is a Wnt co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thompson and Monga, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamai et al., 2000</xref>) and is linked to metabolic diseases in humans since several loss-of-function mutations within <italic>LRP6</italic> were shown to cause hypertriglyceridemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Go, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mani et al., 2007</xref>), hypercholesterinemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ye et al., 2012</xref>), NAFLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Go et al., 2014</xref>) and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Keramati et al., 2011</xref>). Loss of <italic>LRP6-</italic>mediated activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) enhances hepatic lipid accumulation by increasing de novo lipogenesis and triglyceride synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Thompson and Monga, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) which is in line with the observed increased expression of <italic>SCD</italic> in T2D obese humans and <italic>SCD</italic> and <italic>FASN</italic> in HepG2 cells after miR-182–5 p mimic transfection. Additionally, mice carrying the loss-of-function mutation LRP6 p.R611C develop fatty liver disease including insulin resistance, liver inflammation, and steatosis due to increased hepatic de novo lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Besides its crucial role as regulator of de novo lipogenesis <italic>LRP6</italic> regulates glucose metabolism by promoting TCF7L2-dependent insulin receptor expression in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Singh et al., 2013</xref>) and by regulating <italic>IRS1</italic> expression in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bommer et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings of reduced <italic>IRS1</italic> expression in diabetic obese humans and reduced <italic>INSR</italic> and <italic>IRS1</italic> expression in DIO mice as well as downregulated glucose uptake and insulin signaling in miR-182–5 p overexpressing cells are consistent with this glucoregulatory role of <italic>LRP6</italic>, acting under tight control by miR-182–5 p. Our acute hepatic miR-182–5 p overexpression study in mice strongly corroborates this miR-182–5 p-Lrp6 link, and warrants additional, long-term studies on whole body glucose tolerance and hepatic metabolism in miR-182–5 p overexpressing mice.</p><p>In naïve mice, hepatic miR-182–5 p expression was only upregulated after 20 weeks of HFD feeding, i.e., long after the mice developed obesity compared to standard diet-fed mice. Accordingly, obesity per se does not seem to be the sole driver of hepatic miR-182–5 p. This is consistent with the human situation, were only diabetic obese but not ‘healthy’ obese humans show the increase of hepatic miR-182–5 p expression. Whether miR-182–5 p dictates if an obese individual becomes type 2 diabetic or remains glucose tolerant, and whether miR-182–5 p mechanistically drives hepatic dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, are thus intriguing questions for future studies. Such follow-up studies should be conducted in humans, given that mice are rarely developing diabetic pathologies surpassing glucose intolerance, and should compare lean with overweight or obese non-diabetic and T2D subjects to specifically address whether exacerbated hepatic insulin resistance and lipid deposition affect miR-182–5 p expression levels. In our cohort, T2D subjects received anti-diabetic treatment, which is a limitation of our study. HbA1c levels in the T2-diabetic subjects were nonetheless still significantly higher compared to the ND obese individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). To ultimately dissect if hepatic miR-182–5 p upregulation is causally involved in the development of insulin resistance or if it is a marker of manifested T2D would mandate longitudinal studies. First mechanistic evidence is revealed by our in vitro and in vivo studies, which show that miR-182–5 p overexpression acutely decreases glucose uptake and insulin signal transduction in hepatic cells and increases fasting insulin levels and hepatic fat content in mice. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms inducing miR-182–5 p expression in the liver of T2-diabetic subjects, and whether miR-182–5 p antagonism can rescue the metabolic phenotype in mice.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We provide a network of novel microRNAs that are dysregulated in livers of T2-diabetic subjects and identify miR-182–5 p and its target genes as potential drivers of dysregulated glucose tolerance and fatty acid metabolism in obese T2-diabetics. Mechanistic studies with miRNA mimics in cells and mice revealed that hepatic miR-182 expression elicits repressive effects on its target gene <italic>LRP6</italic> and subsequently on glucose and lipid metabolism. The discoveries that miR-182–5 p is associated with T2D and NAFLD via <italic>LRP6</italic> downregulation in liver of obese subjects and the reversibility by weight loss in DIO mice offer unique mechanistic insight into diabetes pathology and point towards promising future anti-diabetic strategies, built either on antagonizing miR-182–5 p activity or reducing hepatic miR-182–5 p expression by pharmacological or dietary means.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All participants of the human cohort signed informed consent.

Figure 3A only showed that miR-182-5p expression was highly correlated to body weight, but the cohort can not explain why the human cohort has different miR-182-5p expression. GTT and ITT data are lacking for this cohort and thus cannot demonstrate a causal link between insulin sensitivity and miR-182-5p. The lack of histological evidence cannot show the relationship between NAFLD and miR-182-5p.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of the weight cycling cohort was to demonstrate that miR-182-5p is dynamically altered and that it can be reversed to almost control levels by weight loss. Thereby we validate in mice that obesity is associated with miR-182-5p upregulation (HFD group without intervention) and we propose that the adverse effects of increased miR-182-5p in obesity might be reversible by weight loss. We did not perform ITTs and GTTs in this weigh cycling cohort because the HFD-model in C57BL/6 mice is well established and it can be assumed that glucose- and insulin-tolerance deteriorated during HFD feeding (doi.org/10.1038/oby.2007.608; doi:10.1007/978-1-61779-430-8_27) and improved after weight loss (doi:10.1038/s41598-023-40514-w). To corroborate this assumption, we provide plasma insulin along with as other important metabolic marker of the weight cycling model in supplemental figure 5A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Loss-of-function of miR-182-5p and/or gain-of-function of Lrp6 in vivo or in vitro would clarify the importance of the miR-182-5p-Lrp6 axis and provide more direct evidence for its potential as a therapeutic target.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree with the reviewer that loss of miR-182 and gain of LRP6 function experiments are missing. However, we provide miR-182 gain of function experiments that impressively show increased liver triglycerides after only seven days of miR-182 overexpression. Because these in vivo data are only short-term, we stated our conclusions carefully and point out that we do not have evidence for a direct involvement of miR-182-5p in insulin signaling. We are now planning follow-up studies in which miR-182-5p will be overexpressed and also antagonized for a longer time. However, for the timeframe of this revision process these extensive studies are not feasible and we ask the reviewer for his/her understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The schematic summary is too complex and includes too many assumptions to faithfully represent the data shown in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, the schematic summary is very complex. Therefore we simplified the upper part (new figure 5) and only focused on the clearly regulated genes and main pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Although lots of microarray analyses were performed in this study, the authors didn't systemically investigate the function of miR-182 in T2DM or NAFLD. The current data provided in this manuscript may only support that miR-182 is involved in the homeostasis of glucose or insulin.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that the nature of or data is mostly correlative. We tried to overcome this by performing mechanistic in vitro data. Because overexpression of miR-182-5p decreases inulin signaling in vitro and induces hyperinsulinemia in vivo we still strongly believe that miR-182-5p is highly relevant for the homeostasis of glucose and insulin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors used miRNA mimics to overexpress miR-182 in mice. How to emphasize the target specificity in the liver? Normally, adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) is used to specifically target the liver.</p></disp-quote><p>Tail vein injections as used in our experimental set-up are known to deliver compounds directly to the liver via the portal vein. For modulation of microRNAs in the liver it is an established technique to deliver mimics (or inhibitors) via the tail vein (doi:10.1007/978-1-62703-435-7_18; doi: 10.1089/10430349950017734). To account for off-target effects we quantified miR-182-5p and target gene expression in spleen and heart. Although miR-182-5p concentrations in mimic treated mice were strongly increased in these tissues, expression in the liver was still highest (new supplementary figure 6A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The HE and Oil red staining of the mouse liver should be shown in miR-182-5p overexpressing mice compared with the control mice, which could provide a more intuitive view of the fat content in the mouse liver.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately the livers were flash frozen and not optimally prepared for later histological analyses. Nevertheless, we performed H&amp;E stainings in all livers and provide representative HE stainings of two control and two miR-182-mimic treated mice (new supplementary figure 5D). The increase hepatic lipid content is clearly visible in the H&amp;E staining of miR-182-mimic treated mice and supports our previous findings of increased hepatic triglycerides (Figure 4H). Due to the freezing process, livers were damaged and Oil red staining was impossible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) After overexpression of miR-182-5p in mice, the serum insulin levels were increased. Does miR-182-5p affect insulin resistance in mice? The insulin tolerance test (ITT) experiment needs to be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, the performance of an ITT would have clarified the effects of miR-182 on insulin tolerance best. Because we did not see differences in the GTT after treating mice acutely with the miR-182 mimic we decided to not perform the ITT in this short-term. The increased fasting serum levels after miR-182-5p mimic treatment (Fig. 4G) suggest that rather insulin sensitivity than insulin secretion is disturbed by miR-182-5p. We are aware, that in future experiments mice should be treated for a longer period with miR-182-5p mimics and that an ITT should be performed in these more chronic studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Figure 2H, the author measured the level of p-Akt/Akt to indicate the effect of miR-182-5p on insulin resistance in HepG2 cells. It is best to provide the western blotting results of p-AKT and t-AKT after HepG2 cells are treated with or without insulin.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide the full blots for all western blotting experiments as new supplemental figure 3B. The HepG2 cells were stimulated with 20 nM insulin 10 min before harvest as described in 2.11 and consequently Akt and p-Akt were quantified. We did not analyze Akt and p-Akt without stimulation because Akt is rarely phosphorylated in the basal non-insulin stimulated state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) This study suggests that miR-182-5p may promote insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia by downregulating LRP6. Nevertheless, to confirm this conclusion, we suggest you transfect miR-182-5p after downregulating the level of LRP6 with its siRNA for further validation.</p></disp-quote><p>Because miR-182-5p targets LRP6 as we have validated by luciferase-assays, LRP6 levels are already low after miR-182-5p overexpression. Thus, the additional downregulation of LRP6 by other means (such as siRNAs) does not make sense in our opinion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The author described that serum miR-182-5p was neither altered in T2D nor correlated with hepatic miR-182-5p expression, so is it suitable as the biomarker of T2D?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, as the reviewer stated correctly, serum concentrations of miR-182-5p were not related to its liver concentrations or the type 2 diabetic state. We therefore suggest that circulating miR-182-5p levels are not a suitable biomarker for T2D. We clarified this in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) What are the changes in fasting blood glucose levels in HFD, HC, and YoYo mouse models? Is there a correlation between miR-182-5p level and fasting blood glucose level in T2D patients and mouse models?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we did not measure the fasting blood glucose levels in this mouse model and therefore cannot answer this question. However, we provide the fasting insulin levels of our mouse models and their positive correlations with miR-182-5p (Fig. 3D and Suppl.Fig. 5D). In T2D humans, hepatic miR-182-5p correlates positively with fasting glucose (Fig. 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The capitalization of the letters in &quot;STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology&quot; should be checked. What does the &quot;Among these is miRNAs miR-182-5p&quot; mean? Please clarify it.</p></disp-quote><p>The “STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology “ report form is abbreviated as “STROBE” list. We this capitalized the letters that are used to build the abbreviation.</p><p>“Among these is miRNAs miR-182-5p” is a typo for which we apologize. It should mean “Among these conserved miRNAs is miR-182-5p.” We corrected this error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The functional importance of miR-182 on gene expression is not rigorously tested.</p><p>(A) Many of the target genes in Fig. 1C and Fig. 3 are controlled by multiple factors that are known to be increased with obesity (e.g., lipogenic genes are increased by hyperinsulinemia), making it likely that their association with miR-182 is correlative rather than a consequence of miR-182 increases.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that miR-182 is not the only factor regulating the here investigated genes. We rather propose, that miR-182 could be an additional upstream regulator that holds the potential to modify entire pathways of insulin signaling and lipogenesis. However, miR-182 should be not viewed as an on/off-switch as it likely plays a modulating role. Although, our in vivo data stemming from humans and mice are correlative we believe that the in vitro data derived in HepG2 cells clearly show a causal role for miR-182-5ß in decreasing LRP6 and insulin signaling, indicated by lower AKT phosphorylation after miR-182-5p overexpression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(B) 500-fold overexpression of miR-182 does not significantly change gene expression. The authors need to knockdown miR-182 in mice and then feed them a chow versus high-fat diet. If miR-182 is a significant regulator of these genes, the effects of the diet will be blunted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive criticism and agree that an optimal experiment would be to antagonize miR-182-5p in mice to rescue glucose and lipid metabolism. There here presented in vivo upregulation of miR-182-5p was a proof-of-concept study to confirm our hypothesis in a reasonable timeframe. We are aware, that follow-up studies are needed, and we are now planning studies in which miR-182-5p will be overexpressed and also antagonized for a longer time. However, for the timeframe of this revision process these extensive studies are not feasible and we ask the reviewer for his/her understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It has previously been shown that miR-182 is in a polycistrionic microRNA locus that is activated directly by SREBP-2. Is this also true in humans? If so, this would indicate that miR-182 is a marker of SREBP activity. How does the nuclear active form of SREBP1 and SREBP2 change in the human livers and HFD-fed mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very interesting question. Suitable experiments to investigate if miR-182-5p is activated by SREBF would be EMSAs or ChIPs. Unfortunately we have only frozen protein lysate of the human livers left in which such experiments cannot be performed. We agree that this should be prioritizes in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Similarly, to test the role of LRP6 in mediating the effects of miR-182, the authors should compare the effects of miR-182 overexpression in the presence and absence of LRP6.</p></disp-quote><p>Because miR-182-5p targets LRP6 as we have validated by luciferase-assays, LRP6 levels are already low after miR-182-5p overexpression. Thus, the additional downregulation of LRP6 by other means (such as siRNAs) does not make sense in our opinion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The methods are a bit confusing. The authors state that &quot;we applied a logistic regression analysis for the 594 mature miRNAs using the NAFLD activity score (NAS) as a cofactor to exclude any bias by hepatic fat content, lobular inflammation, and fibrosis.&quot; However, they later showed that miR-182 levels are correlated with NAS. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We excluded NAFLD explicitly as driving factor for the association to T2D by including a surrogate (the NAFLD activity score) as cofactor. It is well known that NAFLD and T2D are indeed likely associated to each other. Since not all our included individuals with T2D have NAFLD and vice versa, a second correlation with NAS revealed also that a high NAS is associated with higher expression of miR-182.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Does two-fold overexpression of miR-182 (which mimics the effects of HFD) have any effect on chow-fed mice?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question that we unfortunately cannot answer right now. We are planning further mouse studies in which we will include a chow-fed mice as controls.</p></body></sub-article></article>
