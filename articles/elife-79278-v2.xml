mammalian cells. Its production in the <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi traps cholesterol synthesized in the ER to promote formation of a sphingomyelin/sterol gradient along the secretory pathway. This gradient marks a fundamental transition in physical membrane properties that help specify organelle identify and function. We previously identified mutations in sphingomyelin synthase SMS2 that cause osteoporosis and skeletal dysplasia. Here, we show that SMS2 variants linked to the most severe bone phenotypes retain full enzymatic activity but fail to leave the ER owing to a defective autonomous ER export signal. Cells harboring pathogenic SMS2 variants accumulate sphingomyelin in the ER and display a disrupted transbilayer sphingomyelin asymmetry. These aberrant sphingomyelin distributions also occur in patient-derived fibroblasts and are accompanied by imbalances in cholesterol organization, glycerophospholipid profiles, and lipid order in the secretory pathway. We postulate that pathogenic SMS2 variants undermine the capacity of osteogenic cells to uphold nonrandom lipid distributions that are critical for their bone forming activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organellar lipidomics</kwd><kwd>osteoporosis</kwd><kwd>sphingomyelin biosensor</kwd><kwd>transbilayer lipid asymmetry</kwd><kwd>lipid order probes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB944-P14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holthuis</surname><given-names>Joost CM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HO3539/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holthuis</surname><given-names>Joost CM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB944-P8</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piehler</surname><given-names>Jacob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM144096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Burd</surname><given-names>Christopher G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF17OC0029432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maeda</surname><given-names>Kenji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004836</institution-id><institution>Independent Research Fund Denmark</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>6108–00542B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maeda</surname><given-names>Kenji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Organellar lipidomics and lipid reporter studies in intact cells reveal how disease-relevant mutations in a sphingolipid biosynthetic enzyme cause a wide-ranging perturbation of lipid distributions and membrane properties along the secretory pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic membranes consist of complex lipid mixtures, with amounts and ratios of the individual lipids showing marked variations between organelles and membrane leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harayama and Riezman, 2018</xref>). Although some rare lipids contribute to organelle function through stereospecific recognition by lipid binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Paolo and De Camilli, 2006</xref>), numerous recognition processes on or within organellar bilayers are determined by biophysical membrane properties that result from the collective behavior of the bulk lipids. Particularly striking are the lipid-induced changes in bilayer-thickness, lipid packing density and surface charge that accompany the transition from early to late organelles in the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holthuis and Menon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharpe et al., 2010</xref>). These changes are highly conserved across species and provide specific cues for membrane proteins that govern vital processes such as protein secretion and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Magdeleine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhou and Hancock, 2018</xref>). To defend the unique lipid mixtures of secretory organelles against erosion by vesicular transport, cells exploit cytosolic transfer proteins that enable specific lipids to bypass vesicular connections by mediating their monomeric exchange at contact sites between distinct organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, organelles like the ER harbor membrane property sensors that provide feedback to the lipid metabolic network to preserve their characteristic lipid composition when exposed to stress or metabolic insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levental et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Radanović et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Sterols and sphingomyelin (SM) are prime examples of bulk membrane lipids that are unevenly distributed between secretory organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). Sterols are rare in the ER but abundant in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi and plasma membrane (PM). The bulk of SM is synthesized in the lumen of the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi from ceramides supplied by the ER and delivered by vesicular transport to the PM, where it accumulates in the exoplasmic leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanada et al., 2003</xref>). SM is the preferred binding partner of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slotte, 2013</xref>). About one-third of the total cholesterol pool in the PM is sequestered by SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endapally et al., 2019</xref>). Besides influencing cellular cholesterol homeostasis, SM contributes to an enhanced packing density and thickening of <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi and PM bilayers. This, in turn, may modulate protein sorting by hydrophobic mismatching of membrane spans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Munro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quiroga et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, an asymmetric distribution of SM across late secretory and endolysosomal bilayers is relevant for an optimal repair of damaged organelles. Lysosome wounding by chemicals or bacterial toxins triggers a rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated scrambling and cytosolic exposure of SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellison et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niekamp et al., 2022</xref>). Subsequent conversion of SM to ceramides by neutral SMases on the cytosolic surface of injured lysosomes promotes their repair, presumably by driving an inverse budding of the damaged membrane area in a process akin to ESCRT-mediated formation of intraluminal vesicles. This SM-based membrane restoration pathway functions independently of ESCRT and may also operate at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niekamp et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>SM biosynthesis in mammals is mediated by SM synthase 1 (SMS1) and SMS2. Both enzymes act as phosphatidylcholine (PC):ceramide phosphocholine transferases, which catalyze the transfer of the phosphorylcholine head group from PC onto ceramide to generate SM and diacylglycerol (DAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huitema et al., 2004</xref>). SMS1 resides in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi, and its deficiency in mice causes mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupts insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yano et al., 2011</xref>). SMS2 resides both in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi and at the PM. Its deficiency ameliorates diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mitsutake et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sugimoto et al., 2016</xref>). Removal of SMS1 or SMS2 has only a minor impact on ceramide, DAG and SM pools in tissues or cells, and the mechanisms underlying the phenotypes observed in SMS1 and SMS2 knockout mice are not well understood. Besides SMS1 and SMS2, mammalian cells contain an ER-resident and SMS-related protein (SMSr), which displays phospholipase C activity and synthesizes trace amounts of the SM analog ceramide phosphoethanolamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murakami and Sakane, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vacaru et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported that SMS2 is highly expressed in bone and identified heterozygous mutations in the SMS2-encoding gene (<italic>SGMS2</italic>) as the underlying cause of a clinically described autosomal dominant genetic disorder – osteoporosis with calvarial doughnut lesions (OP-CDL: OMIM #126550) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pekkinen et al., 2019</xref>). The clinical presentations of OP-CDL range from childhood-onset osteoporosis with low bone mineral density, skeletal fragility and sclerotic doughnut-shaped lesions in the skull to a severe spondylometaphyseal dysplasia with neonatal fractures, long-bone deformities, and short stature. The milder phenotype is associated with the nonsense variant p.Arg50*, which gives rise to a truncated but catalytically active enzyme that mislocalizes to the <italic>cis/medial-</italic>Golgi (T. Sokoya and J. Holthuis, unpublished data). However, the most severe phenotypes are associated with two closely localized missense variants, p.Ile62Ser and p.Met64Arg. Interestingly, these missense variants enhance de novo SM biosynthesis by blocking ER export of enzymatically active SMS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pekkinen et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that OP-CDL in patients with pathogenic SMS2 variants is not due to a reduced capacity to synthesize SM but rather a consequence of mistargeting bulk SM production to an early secretory organelle. How this affects the contrasting lipid landscapes and membrane properties in the secretory pathway remains to be established.</p><p>In this work, we used genetically engineered cell lines and OP-CDL patient-derived fibroblasts to address the impact of pathogenic SMS2 variants p.Ile62Ser and p.Met64Arg on the lipid composition, transbilayer arrangement, and packing density of early and late secretory organelles. Toward this end, we combined shotgun lipidomics on purified organelles with the application of lipid biosensors and targeted solvatochromic fluorescent probes in live cells. We show that cells harbouring pathogenic SMS2 variants accumulate PM-like amounts of SM in the ER and display a disrupted transbilayer SM asymmetry. This is accompanied by significant imbalances in cholesterol organization and membrane lipid order. We also find that pathogenic SMS2 variants cause marked changes in the ER glycerophospholipid profile, including an enhanced phospholipid desaturation and rise in cone-shaped ethanolamine-containing phospholipids, potentially reflecting an adaptive cellular response to counteract SM-mediated rigidification of the ER bilayer. Our data indicate that pathogenic SMS2 variants profoundly undermine the cellular capacity to uphold nonrandom lipid distributions in the secretory pathway that may be critical for the bone forming activity of osteogenic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The IXMP motif in SMS2 is part of an autonomous ER export signal</title><p>The most severe clinical presentations of OP-CDL are associated with the SMS2 missense variants p.I62S and p.M64R, which cause retention of a functional enzyme in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pekkinen et al., 2019</xref>). Ile62 and Met64 are part of a conserved sequence motif, IXMP, which is located 13–14 residues upstream of the first membrane span in both SMS1 and SMS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). We reasoned that this motif may be part of an ER export signal, which could explain its absence in the ER-resident SMS family member SMSr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vacaru et al., 2009</xref>). To test this idea, we generated FLAG-tagged SMS2 constructs in which Ile62 or Met64 was replaced with Ser or Arg, respectively. Upon their transfection in HeLa cells, the subcellular distribution of the SMS2 variants was determined by fluorescence microscopy using antibodies against the FLAG tag and ER-resident protein calnexin. In agreement with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pekkinen et al., 2019</xref>), SMS2<sup>I62S</sup> and SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> were each retained in the ER, in contrast to wildtype SMS2, which localized to the Golgi and PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). We then asked whether the IXMP motif in SMS2 can mediate ER export independently of other sorting information. To address this, we created a FLAG-tagged chimera protein, SMSr-SMS2<sub>11-77</sub>, in which the region linking the <italic>N</italic>-terminal SAM domain and first membrane span of SMSr was replaced with the IXMP-containing cytosolic tail of SMS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In contrast, no traces of SMS2 were found in ER eluates from cells expressing the wildtype protein. As there is no specific lipid marker for the ER, using a lipidomics approach to confirm that pull-down with anti-calnexin antibody indeed isolates the ER is not trivial. However, the ER is known to synthesize ceramides whereas SM is primarily produced in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi and accumulates in the PM.

The ER from ΔSMS1/2 cells expressing SMS2 had a lipid composition similar to that of the ER from wildtype cells. In contrast, the ER from SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>-expressing cells contained sevenfold higher SM levels, that is ~10 mol% SM instead of ~1.5 mol% of all identified lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). This increase in ER-bound SM was accompanied by a twofold rise in DAG levels and a significant drop in the amount of PC and ceramide, consistent with the presence of a catalytically active SM synthase in the ER. Interestingly, expression of SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> also led to a marked (1.8-fold) increase in ER-associated PE levels. In contrast, ER levels of cholesterol and other bulk lipids were largely unaffected. However, we noticed that expression of SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> enhanced unsaturation of bulk phospholipid in the ER, as indicated by a significant rise in di-unsaturated PC at the expense of saturated and mono-unsaturated PC species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). PC chain length, on the other hand, was largely unaffected. Strikingly, SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> expression also caused a sharp increase in ER-bound ceramide-1-phosphate (Cer1P; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Moreover, cellular Cer1P levels were essentially abolished in SM synthase-deficient cells, indicating that production of Cer1P is tightly coupled to SM biosynthesis.</p><p>The PM from ΔSMS1/2 cells expressing SMS2 had a SM content similar to the PM from wildtype cells (~10 mol%). In comparison, the PM from ΔSMS1/2 cells expressing SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> had a slightly reduced SM content (~8 mol%) even though the total SM content of these cells was considerably higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). PM-associated levels of cholesterol and other bulk lipids did not show any major differences among the various cell lines, except for a lack of SM and elevated PC and GSL content in SMS-deficient cells. The PM from all four cell lines contained significantly elevated levels of saturated PC species in comparison to the ER. In addition, the PM from ΔSMS1/2 cells expressing SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> contained fourfold higher levels of dihydroSM (represented by SM species with 0 double bonds; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>), consistent with the ER residency of this enzyme. Collectively, these data indicate that pathogenic SMS2 variants disrupt the SM gradient along the secretory pathway and cause substantial changes in the lipid profile of the ER.</p><p>To confirm that cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants accumulate SM in the ER, we next used an engineered GFP-tagged version of equinatoxin II (Eqt) as non-toxic SM reporter in live cells. To enable detection of SM inside the secretory pathway, the reporter was equipped with the <italic>N</italic>-terminal signal sequence of human growth hormone and tagged at its <italic>C</italic>-terminus with oxGFP, yielding EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). A luminal Eqt mutant defective in SM binding, EqtSol<sub>SS</sub>, served as control. When expressed in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, both EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> and EqtSol<sub>SS</sub> showed a reticular distribution that overlapped extensively with the ER marker protein VAPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, upon co-expression with SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>, EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> but not EqtSol<sub>SS</sub> displayed a distinct punctate distribution that coincided with the ER network. EqtSM<sub>SS</sub>-containing puncta were not observed in cells expressing the enzyme-dead variant SMS2<sup>M64R/D276A</sup>, indicating that their formation strictly relies on SM production in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To verify that the EqtSM<sub>SS</sub>-positive puncta mark ER-resident pools of SM, U2OS cells co-expressing EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> and SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> were subjected to hypotonic swelling as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">King et al., 2020</xref>). After incubation for 5 min in hypotonic medium, the ER’s fine tubular network transformed into numerous micrometer-sized vesicles. In SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>-expressing cells, the membranes of these ER-derived vesicles were extensively labelled with EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, in hypotonic cells co-expressing EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> with SMS2<sup>M64R/D276A</sup> or EqtSol<sub>SS</sub> with SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>, the reporter was found exclusively in the lumen of ER-derived vesicles, indicating that Eqt staining of the ER membrane critically relies on catalytically active SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> and a SM-binding competent reporter. In agreement with the ER lipidome analyses, these results demonstrate that cells expressing SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> accumulate bulk amounts of SM in the ER. Moreover, our finding that hypotonic swelling of SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>-expressing cells transforms the ER-associated punctate distribution of EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> to a more uniform labeling of the ER bilayer suggests that alterations in membrane curvature and/or lipid packing may affect the lateral organization of Eqt-SM assemblies.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Luminal SM reporter EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> enables visualization of an ER-resident SM pool in SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>-expressing cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells co-transfected with mCherry-tagged VAPA (ER, <italic>magenta</italic>) and empty vector (control), SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> or SMS2<sup>M64R/D276A</sup> and luminal GFP-tagged SM reporter EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> or its SM binding-defective derivative, EqtSol<sub>SS</sub> (Eqt, <italic>green</italic>), were incubated in isotonic medium (100% Optimem) for 5 min and imaged by spinning disc confocal microscopy.

We therefore asked whether SM produced by pathogenic SMS2 variants in the ER lumen has access to the cytosolic leaflet. As expected, EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub> in wildtype or ΔSMS1/2 cells expressing SMS2 displayed a cytosolic distribution. In contrast, expression of pathogenic variant SMS2<sup>I62S</sup> or SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> in each case caused EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub> to accumulate in numerous puncta that were dispersed throughout the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4A</xref>).

Under these conditions, EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub>-positive puncta gave rise to small vesicular structures, implying the presence of a membranous core. Based on these results, we envision that SM synthesized by pathogenic SMS2 variants readily equilibrates across the ER bilayer, triggering mobilization of both luminal and cytosolic EqtSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Whether condensation of EqtSM into puncta reflects binding of the reporter to pre-existing SM microdomains or involves a clustering of SM-bound reporters driven by a residual pore-forming activity remains to be established. Conceivably, binding of EqtSM to the membrane may alter its curvature and even pinch off SM-enriched membrane regions, analogous to the shedding of extracellular vesicles observed when cells are exposed to the cholesterol/SM binding protein ostreolysin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skočaj et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, such shedding may explain why EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub>-positive puncta do not co-localize with a wide range of organellar markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). While our findings underline the value of EqtSM and LysSM as tools for probing SM topology in organellar bilayers, further studies are warranted to address their potential impact on the structural organization of SM-rich membranes.</p><p>Based on the foregoing, we reasoned that cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants may have a diminished capacity to concentrate SM on their surface. To challenge this idea, we stained the surface of intact wildtype or ΔSMS1/2 cells expressing SMS2 or SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> with recombinant EqtSM. Cell surface labeling was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively assessed by flow cytometry. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, wildtype cells could be readily stained with the SM reporter whereas ΔSMS1/2 cells were devoid of EqtSM staining. Expression of SMS2, but not enzyme-dead SMS2<sup>D276A</sup>, restored EqtSM staining of ΔSMS1/2 cells to a level approaching that of wildtype cells. In contrast, expression of SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> restored cell surface staining to only a minor degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>) even though the PM-associated SM pool of these cells was close to that of wildtype or SMS2-expressing ΔSMS1/2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>).

The emission spectra of these probes are blue-shifted in tightly packed lipid bilayers, which is due to a reduced polarity in the nano-environment of the NR fluorophore. The relative extent of these spectral shifts can be quantified in cellular membranes using ratiometric imaging. In NR12A, the presence of a charged membrane anchor group that blocks passive flip-flop across membrane bilayers makes this probe ideally suited to selectively quantify lipid order in the outer PM leaflet of live cells when added to the extracellular medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danylchuk et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, a propyl chloride group in NRER<sub>Cl</sub> targets this probe to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Danylchuk et al., 2021</xref>) even though some residual staining of other organelles cannot be excluded.

Therefore, it was surprising that the marked accumulation of SM in the ER of SMS<sup>M64R</sup>-expressing cells had no obvious impact on ER-bound cholesterol levels or the cellular pool of cholesteryl esters (CE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). To examine whether pathogenic SMS2 variants influence cholesterol organization in cells, we used a mCherry-tagged D4H sterol reporter derived from the perfringolysin O <italic>θ</italic>-toxin of <italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic>. This reporter recognizes cholesterol when present at &gt;20 mol% in membranes and mainly decorates the inner leaflet of the PM at steady state when expressed as cytosolic protein. Part of the reason for the high detection threshold is that the reporter detects free cholesterol in the membrane but not cholesterol in complex with SM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Das et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, a previous study showed that plasmalemmal PS is essential for retaining D4H-accessible cholesterol in the inner PM leaflet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maekawa and Fairn, 2015</xref>). Accordingly, we found that cytosolic D4H-mCherry primarily stained the inner PM leaflet in wildtype HeLa cells. In contrast, the probe displayed a more diffuse cytosolic distribution in ΔSMS1/2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6A</xref>). Expression of SMS2 inΔSMS1/2 cells restored PM staining, indicating that PM-associated SM is critical for controlling the reporter-accessible cholesterol pool in the inner PM leaflet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6B</xref>). Strikingly, in ΔSMS1/2 cells expressing pathogenic variant SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> or SMS2<sup>I62S</sup>, cytosolic D4H-mCherry did not label the inner PM leaflet but primarily accumulated on intracellular vesicles that were largely segregated from EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub>-positive puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6B</xref>). These vesicles co-localized extensively with dextran-positive endolysosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Whether redistribution of cytosolic D4H-mCherry from the PM to endolysosomes induced by pathogenic SMS2 variants is due to an enhanced Golgi-to-endosome trafficking of cholesterol or an impaired cholesterol export from lysosomes remains to be established. As PM cholesterol levels are largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>), it is conceivable that the presence of SM in the inner PM leaflet of cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants may render a coexisting cholesterol pool inaccessible to the reporter.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Pathogenic SMS2 variants perturb subcellular cholesterol pools.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HeLa ΔSMS1/2 cells transduced with doxycycline-inducible SMS2, SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> or SMS2<sup>I62S</sup> were co-transfected with GFP-tagged EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub> (<italic>green</italic>) and mCherry-tagged cytosolic sterol reporter D4H (<italic>red</italic>).

To address this, skin fibroblasts derived from patients with the missense variant p.I62S or p.M64R and healthy controls were co-transfected with the luminal SM reporter EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> and mCherry-tagged VAPA as ER marker. Next, the fibroblasts were subjected to hypotonic swelling and live cell imaging. Strikingly, in patient fibroblasts the membranes of ER-derived vesicles were extensively labelled with EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). In contrast, in fibroblasts of healthy controls, EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> was found exclusively in the lumen of ER-derived vesicles. This indicates that the ER in patient fibroblasts contains substantially elevated SM levels. In addition, we found that the cytosolic SM reporter EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub> accumulated in numerous puncta when expressed in patient fibroblasts while its expression in fibroblasts of healthy controls resulted in a diffuse cytosolic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Formation of Eqt-positive puncta in patient fibroblasts did not occur when using the SM binding-defective reporter, EqtSol<sub>cyto</sub>. Thus, besides accumulating SM in the ER, patient fibroblasts display a breakdown of transbilayer SM asymmetry. Interestingly, these aberrant SM distributions were accompanied by significant alterations in lipid order on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>).

While maintenance of its nonrandom subcellular distribution is thought to be relevant for a variety of physiological processes, experimental proof for this concept is scarce. Here, we show that inborn pathogenic SMS2 variants p.M64R and p.I62S identified in patients with a severe form of OP-CDL cause profound perturbations in subcellular SM organization. Both variants retain full enzymatic activity but are unable to leave the ER owing to a defective autonomous ER export signal in their <italic>N</italic>-terminal cytosolic tail. Consequently, bulk SM production is mistargeted to the ER, the site for de novo synthesis of the SM precursor ceramide. Cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants accumulate PM-like SM levels in the ER and display an aberrant mobilization of cytosolic SM reporters, signifying a loss of transbilayer SM asymmetry presumably due to a constitutive SM scrambling across the ER bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). From this we infer that pathogenic SMS2 variants in fact abolish two types of SM gradients: one running along the secretory pathway and the other one across the bilayers of secretory organelles. These marked deviations in SM distribution also occur in OP-CDL patient fibroblasts and are accompanied by significant imbalances in cholesterol organization, glycerophospholipid profiles and membrane lipid order in the secretory pathway. Based on these findings, we postulate that pathogenic SMS2 variants undermine the capacity of osteogenic cells to uphold nonrandom lipid distributions that are critical for their bone forming activity.</p><p>As SM is the preferred interaction partner of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Slotte, 2013</xref>), bulk production of SM in the <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi and its sorting into anterograde transport vesicles would promote formation of a cholesterol gradient along the secretory pathway. However, we now find that cells harboring pathogenic SMS2 variants retain the ability to concentrate cholesterol in the PM and keep their ER levels low in spite of a dissipated SM gradient. Even though cultured cells may not make much cholesterol in the ER and instead obtain bulk cholesterol from lipoproteins in the culture medium, previous work revealed that a stream of cholesterol constantly travels from the PM to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Infante and Radhakrishnan, 2017</xref>). This implies that cells are equipped with an effective mechanism to prevent a toxic rise of cholesterol in ER bilayers with an abnormally high SM content. One mechanism for removing excess cholesterol from the ER involves its esterification and storage in lipid droplets. However, pathogenic SMS2 variants had no impact on the cellular pool of cholesteryl esters. An alternative mechanism involves the oxysterol binding protein OSBP, which mediates net transfer of cholesterol from the ER to the <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi by counter transporting phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), a lipid continuously produced in the <italic>trans-</italic>Golgi and turned over in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mesmin et al., 2013</xref>). As critical determinant of intracellular cholesterol flows, the cholesterol/PI4P exchange activity of OSBP also influences membrane lipid order in the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mesmin et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, future studies addressing whether pathogenic SMS2 variants cause an upregulation of the PI4P-consuming OSBP cycle to counteract thermodynamic trapping of cholesterol by an expanding SM pool in the ER may prove fruitful. The PI4P-dependent countertransport mechanism found to energize net transfer of cholesterol also helps drive PS export from the ER to create a PS gradient along the secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moser von Filseck et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the PM-like SM content of the ER in cells harboring pathogenic SMS2 variants indicates that such mechanism does not exist for SM and that the ER lacks transport systems to efficiently distribute this lipid to other organelles in sync with its rate of synthesis.</p><p>Membrane biogenesis in the ER requires cross-bilayer movement of phospholipids, which is mediated by ER-resident scramblases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghanbarpour et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pomorski and Menon, 2016</xref>). These scramblases display low specificity, with phospholipids and sphingolipids being translocated with similar kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalat et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, SM produced by pathogenic SMS2 variants in the luminal leaflet of the ER should readily equilibrate with the cytosolic leaflet. Indeed, both p.M64R and p.I62S variants triggered mobilization of a cytosolic SM reporter. Moreover, cells expressing SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> had similar levels of SM in the PM as controls but showed a significantly reduced SM reporter staining of their surface, indicative of a perturbed SM asymmetry across the PM. Consistent with a reduced SM pool in the exoplasmic leaflet, these cells displayed a lower lipid packing on their surface and lost their viability more rapidly when exposed to a cholesterol-absorbing agent than controls. Consistent with an elevated SM pool in the cytosolic leaflet, cells harboring pathogenic SMS2 variants displayed a reduced PM staining with a cytosolic sterol reporter that recognizes free cholesterol but not cholesterol sequestered by SM. Thus, while pathogenic SMS2 variants have no impact on PM cholesterol levels, our data suggest that they affect the equilibrium between active and SM-bound cholesterol pools on both sides of the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).</p><p>Our study also yields insights into how cells cope with a major deviation in the lipid composition of the ER. The dramatic rise in ER-associated SM levels caused by pathogenic SMS2 variants was accompanied by a marked increase in PC desaturation and a nearly twofold expansion of the PE pool. While it remains to be established how these alterations are implemented, it is conceivable that an enhanced desaturation and rise in cone-shaped, ethanolamine-containing phospholipids are part of an adaptive cellular response to counter an SM-mediated rigidification of the ER bilayer and preserve the organelle’s central role in membrane biogenesis and secretion. Strikingly, pathogenic SMS2 variants also caused a sharp rise in ER-associated Cer1P levels. Cer1P is produced by ceramide kinase CERK and functions as a key signaling lipid in the regulation of cell growth, survival and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Presa et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to stimulating production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through direct activation of a specific cytosolic phospholipase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamour et al., 2009</xref>), Cer1P promotes cell survival at least in part by blocking enzymes involved in ceramide production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Granado et al., 2009</xref>). Our present findings indicate that Cer1P production is tightly coupled to SM biosynthesis. The prospect that CERK-mediated Cer1P formation serves a role in the mechanism by which cells sense and respond to imbalances in the lipid composition of their secretory organelles merits further consideration.</p><p>While this study focuses on the impact of the missense SMS2 variants p.M64R and p.I62S on the subcellular organization of SM, the nonsense pathogenic SMS2 variant p.Arg50* is more common in patients with OP-CDL and associated with a milder bone phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mäkitie et al., 2021</xref>). We originally anticipated that this variant encodes a severely truncated and enzyme-dead version of SMS2 that contains only part of the <italic>N</italic>-terminal cytosolic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pekkinen et al., 2019</xref>). However, our recent work revealed that Met64 in the p.Arg50* variant is utilized as alternative start codon, yielding a truncated but catalytically active enzyme that is mislocalized to the <italic>cis/medial</italic> Golgi (T. Sokoya and J. Holthuis, unpublished data). Unlike pathogenic variants SMS2<sup>I62S</sup> and SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>, SMS2<sup>R50X</sup> would have no direct access to ER-derived ceramides and must compete with GlcCer synthase for ceramides delivered to the <italic>cis/medial</italic> Golgi. Backflow of SM produced in the <italic>cis/medial</italic> Golgi to the ER may affect the lipid landscape in the secretory pathway of cells expressing SMS2<sup>R50X</sup>, but to a lesser extent than that observed in cells expressing the pathogenic variants SMS2<sup>I62S</sup> and SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>.</p><p>Our findings raise the question how a disrupted subcellular organization of SM leads to osteoporosis and skeletal dysplasia. A quantitative analysis of SMS2 transcript levels in a murine tissue panel revealed the highest expression in cortical bone and vertebrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pekkinen et al., 2019</xref>). This implies that the impact of pathogenic SMS2 variants on the lipid composition of secretory organelles will be most severe in bone cells of the affected individuals. Bone formation involves deposition of collagen fibrils into a matrix and its subsequent mineralization. Interestingly, pathogenic variants of core components of COPII-coated vesicles have been reported to cause craniofacial and skeletal defects by selectively disrupting procollagen export from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boyadjiev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garbes et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, loss of TANGO1, an ER-resident transmembrane protein required for packaging the bulky procollagen fibers into COPII vesicles, results in neonatal lethality due to insufficient bone mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guillemyn et al., 2021</xref>). It is conceivable that ER export of procollagen is particularly susceptible to the bilayer rigidifying effect of SM synthesized by pathogenic SMS2 variants.</p><p>However, an alternative scenario is that a perturbed PM SM asymmetry in osteogenic cells of OP-CDL patients negatively affects bone mineralization. This process involves matrix vesicles that bud off from the apical membrane of osteoblasts and deposit their Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate-rich content where matrix mineralization is propagated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murshed, 2018</xref>). Bone mineralization critically relies on neutral SMase-2 (SMPD3), another membrane-bound enzyme highly expressed in bone that cleaves SM in the cytosolic leaflet of the PM to generate ceramide and phosphocholine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aubin et al., 2005</xref>). nSMase-2 gains access to SM upon SM scrambling by the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated scramblase TMEM16F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niekamp et al., 2022</xref>). Loss of TMEM16F leads to decreased mineral deposition in skeletal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ehlen et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that this process may require a TMEM16F-mediated supply of exoplasmic SM to nSMase-2 for SM hydrolysis in the cytosolic leaflet. This arrangement may serve to ensure a continuous supply of phosphocholine as a source of phosphate required for normal bone mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pekkinen et al., 2019</xref>). By disrupting SM asymmetry, pathogenic SMS2 variants may interfere with a coordinated release of the lipid-based phosphate store, thus impairing normal bone mineralization.</p><p>In sum, the present study indicates that bone critical SMS2 variants p.M64R and p.I62S exert their pathogenic effects by redirecting bulk SM production to the ER, thereby causing a wide-ranging perturbation of lipid distributions and membrane properties along the secretory pathway. Besides highlighting how cells respond to a major assault on the lipid code of the ER, our findings provide important insights into the pathobiochemistry underlying OP-CDL.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemical reagents</title><p>Chemical reagents used were: doxycycline (Sigma Aldrich, D891), puromycin (Sigma Aldrich, P8833), polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, TR-1003), methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Sigma Aldrich, C4555), G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, G8168), and 3-azido-7-hydroxycoumarin (Jena Bioscience, CLK-FA047).

Data are reported as mol% of total lipids measured.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-79278-transrepform1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting file.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Anant K Menon (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Since the study hinges on accurate measurement of the leaflet distribution of sphingomyelin (SM), the authors should use an alternative to the cytosolic EqtSM reporter, such as lysenin as described by Reviewer #1 in point (a), to demonstrate the location of SM on the cytoplasmic leaflets of the PM and the ER to bolster their model. The authors should also tone down interpretations of some of their results, as indicated by the three reviewers below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>a) To detect cytosolic exposure of SM the authors use a mutated form of Equinatoxin (Eqt) fused to GFP. This mutant has been reported to show preferential binding to SM over PC, and to not induce membrane lysis. In the mutant cells, they find that this reporter translocates to cytosolic puncta which they are unable to identify as they do not co-localize with any organelle they test (although they do not test autophagosomes). This is not evidence that SM is on the cytoplasmic face of the ER or the PM. Indeed, it is not even clear that these structures have membranes in them, but whatever they are, they are clearly not the ER or the PM. One problem may be that the Eqt reporter used is perhaps not the most reliable reporter for SM, as its lipid preference has not been extensively characterized beyond the initial description. Thus, the authors should also use the different SM reporter, lysenin, which has been much more widely used than Eqt-based reporters and has been successfully applied to investigating cytosolic exposure of SM in living cells. A further issue is that their images of wild-type cells quite often show some concentration of Eqt-GFP in the perinuclear region (eg Figure 6A or 9B), although it is hard to see in some cases as the images show three different reporters simultaneously, with single channel images not provided. A similar perinuclear concentration has been seen with a different Eqt-based reporter in wild-type cells (Bakrac et al. JBC 285 22186 (2010)), and it may reflect Eqt not being an ideal reporter. Hopefully, a lysenin-based reporter will give clearer results.</p><p>b) The authors state that SMS2 has an ER export &quot;IXMP motif&quot;. This is not a known motif, and indeed its sequence is not defined in this study as being IXMP. All they know is that mutations in the I and the M result in loss of ER export. They do not test the M, or indeed the other nearby resides that are also well conserved, and nor do they test sufficiency beyond transplanting a much larger part (residues 11-77) to an ER resident protein and showing it leaves the ER. Thus, all they can say is that part of SMS2 within residues 11-77 appears to be sufficient to confer ER export, and that mutation of I62 or M64 perturbs either an uncharacterized linear motif or the overall fold of the tail, such that it is no longer functional for ER export</p><p>c) When examining the location of proteins or reporters, the authors must show single channel images in gray scale of the key results (as they do in Figures 5 and 7). In several other figures, they only show multichannel images or color images, where the distribution is harder to see due to the other channels or being in color. An example is mentioned above for equinatoxin and is also the case in Figure 8, and some of the supplementary figures.</p><p>d) Do the levels of glycolipids fall in the mutant cells due to increased conversion of ceramide to SM?</p><p>e) The authors comment that cholesterol levels in the ER do not increase in the mutant. However, some caution may be needed as, firstly, cholesterol can partition out of membranes during fractionation, and secondly, cholesterol may not be able to reach the ER as the cells may not be making much in the ER but are instead obtaining it from lipoproteins in the culture medium.</p><p>f) The authors express EqtSM in the ER and report it being in mostly in the ER. This is surprising, as the paper describing this reporter showed that it is present throughout the secretory pathway (Deng et al. 2016). Moreover, this previous paper showed that the puncta that the authors comment on are actually post-Golgi carriers, and are not part of the ER as claimed here.</p><p>g) The organelle-specific reporters of lipid order are unlikely to be totally specific. The images shown in the paper reporting these reagents are of a low resolution and do not exclude multiple intracellular structures being labelled. Some note of caution is required here.</p><p>h) Why does over-expressing SMS2 not increase the levels of SM beyond that seen in wild-type cells?</p><p>i) The authors speculate that SM exposed to the cytosol could be cleaved by the neutral sphingomyelinase SMPD3 and this could be important for bone deposition. However, if this was the case then they would not be able to detect an accumulation of SM on cytosolic leaflets. Have they tried deleting SMPD3, or looking at the distribution of ceramide?</p><p>j) The authors should at least mention the puzzling finding that four patients with this bone-deposition disorder make a severely truncated version of SMS2 that contains only part of the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have several questions/comments.</p><p>1. Data: the increase in diunsaturated PC (Figure 3E, line 469) does not seem especially convincing, yet this is used as one of the main components of the overall description/conclusion that the lipid map of the cell is dysregulated. I wonder if the authors really want to comment on the ratio of di- versus mono-unsaturated PC – is this the point that they want to focus on? Perhaps this change in the ratio may be more dramatic than simply noting the change in di-unsaturated species.</p><p>2. Colours in Figure 3E are a bit confusing as they are the same as those used for the WC-ER pairing in panel D.</p><p>3. Data: Cholesterol levels are rather high in the whole cell sample (20 mole %) in Figures 3C and 4C – this should be &lt;10% – is there any explanation? perhaps some aspect of the analysis is not being read out correctly? (this would have implications for values reported for the PM etc).</p><p>4. Data: Presumably the gels in Figures 3B and 4B are loaded on an equivalents basis (not protein basis) – this should be stated explicitly.</p><p>5. The accumulation of SM in the ER suggests the absence of an efficient vesicular or non-vesicular pathway to distribute this lipid to other compartments in sync with its rate of synthesis. Transport certainly occurs by both mechanisms as SM is found in both leaflets of the PM, but its rate seems not to be high enough. The discussion of this point in lines 438-447 is rather vague and it would be nice to see a slightly more quantitative discussion. The example of SM-exclusion from COPI vesicles pertains to lumenal SM. How do the authors envisage exclusion of the cytoplasm-facing pool?</p><p>6. Data: Line 271 and Figure 5 – the punctate versus uniform staining difference on hypotonic staining is not so clear – I wonder if this could be aided by a cartoon version of one of the images?</p><p>7. Typos: line 365 – consequently LOSE their viability; line 431 – prove not proof.</p><p>8. The discussion seems excessive – it should be reduced in length and sharpened to stay a little more focused on the actual data (there seem to be many extrapolations well beyond the scope of the data). Lines 463-465 are super-clear – they encapsulate key findings and could be used as a springboard for the discussion.</p><p>9. There are many beautifully executed experiments in this paper but I was hoping for an old-fashioned one that might indicate the disruption of the sterol/SM gradient – this would be the Brown-Rose experiment which monitored the trafficking of a GPI-anchored protein through the secretory pathway, showing that it became insoluble in cold TX-100 when it reached the Golgi apparatus. While the molecular basis of this phenomenon can be debated the experiment provides a clear readout of the lipid translation that the authors write about in the Introduction and Discussion. It's not required to do this, but the authors may want to consider if it would help develop their description of the phenotypes that they are studying.</p><p>10. If I am not mistaken, there are old data by Wieland and van Meer describing changes in transbilayer asymmetry of SM and GlcCer on BFA treatment – these data essentially report on the phenomenon of the symmetrization of the transbilayer distribution of SM at the ER. This work could be cited/discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Sokoya, Parolek et al. impressively showed that pathogenic SMS2 variants result in a wide-ranging disruption of lipid distributions. Their careful mapping of organellar lipid changes is extremely interesting and valuable to the community. Complementing this with studying the effects on membrane order is helpful in trying to understand the overall consequences and, in the future, the pathobiochemistry of the disease. Certainly, this study will spawn multiple highly interesting avenues for research, some of which are elaborated on in the Discussion section. However, in the second part of the manuscript, a clear and testable hypothesis is missing. The authors mainly postulate that the production of SM at the ER dissipates the SM asymmetry not only at the ER but also at the PM. They show with several approaches that this might be the case, but some of which are complicated by technical difficulties that make a clear interpretation challenging. Details below.</p><p>The central claim – that SM production in the ER affects bilayer asymmetry in the PM – rests mainly on two observations: First, the lipidome analysis of PM isolates shows only a modest decrease in total SM levels in the disease variant, while the Eqt-staining of SM at the outer leaflet shows much reduced SM levels, leading the authors to conclude that SM is also present on the inner leaflet of the PM. Direct evidence of this would be strongly desired but was however complicated by the fact that the cytosolic EqtSM reporter could not detect SM at the inside of the PM. Likewise, the cytosolic EqtSM reporter did not directly detect SM on the cytosolic leaflet of the ER but instead localized to some yet unidentified punctate structures. As the nature of the punctae could not be clarified, an artefact induced by Eqt-SM binding (aggregates? condensates?) cannot be ruled out. Similar concerns apply to the use of EqtSMss in the ER lumen, which under isotonic show strange punctae (most of which cluster around the perinuclear region) that do not convincingly co-localize with calnexin. A clear binding of EqtSMss to calnexin-labeled membranes could only be shown in hypotonic conditions. In summary, while the use of biosensors for studying lipid localization is essential to this study, as the integrity of the cells must be preserved to properly study questions of lipid asymmetry, their use is accompanied by drawbacks that were not fully addressed. In particular, the reason why cytosolic EqtSM is not able to detect SM on the inner leaflet of the PM remains unclear.</p><p>The connection of SM mislocalization to subcellular cholesterol pools is very interesting, but not fully explored. Somewhat surprisingly, the authors found that ER cholesterol remains low even in conditions of high ER SM levels, and similarly, overall PM cholesterol levels are not affected in the disease model. Yet, detection of Chol at the inner leaflet of the PM by D4H is no longer possible when using SMS2-mutants. Instead, D4H localizes to endolysosomes. The authors do not comment on how this alternative localization potentially arises (increased Golgi-to-endosome trafficking? Cholesterol export defects of the lysosome in conditions of SM abundance?) nor confirm it with alternative methods (such as Filipin staining). Instead, they claim that the previously hypothesized SM pool in the inner leaflet of the PM renders the cholesterol inaccessible to the reporter. Here, again, potential artefacts of the reporter cannot be excluded and should be controlled for. For instance, investigating the cholesterol levels on the outer leaflet using recombinant reporters (as performed for SM) would help clarify if cholesterol distribution itself or indeed just their complex formation with SM is affected.</p><p>For better comprehension, the authors could provide a graphical representation of the downstream effects of SM production at the ER and its effects on cholesterol.</p><p>At several points in the manuscript, the authors use unpublished data to support their arguments. These data should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79278.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>a) To detect cytosolic exposure of SM the authors use a mutated form of Equinatoxin (Eqt) fused to GFP.

Previous work established that the ER harbours low specificity scramblases that catalyse flip flop of phospholipids and sphingolipids with similar kinetics (Buton et al., 2002; Chalat et al., 2012). This led us to postulate that translocation of EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub> to cytosolic puncta is driven by scrambling and cytosolic exposure of SM produced in the luminal ER leaflet. As pointed out by the reviewer, a puzzling aspect of this scenario is that the EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub>-positive puncta are largely segregated from ER markers (Figure 6A and Appendix – figure 5). We have now recapitulated this phenomenon using lysenin as alternative cytosolic SM reporter (see our response to comment #2 below). Moreover, we show that pathogenic SMS2 variants also trigger translocation of EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> to luminal puncta that are continuous with the ER network (Figure 5A). New co-localization experiments revealed considerable overlap between the luminal and cytosolic puncta (new Figure 6D, upper row), suggesting that the latter originate at least in part from the ER. Upon hypotonic swelling, the luminal puncta become largely continuous with the ER membrane (Figure 5B) and tend to segregate from the cytosolic puncta (new Figure 6D, bottom row). Under these conditions, the cytosolic puncta give rise to small vesicular structures, implying the presence of a membranous core. As requested by Reviewer #2 (comment #6), we now included a cartoon to illustrate our findings (new Figure 6E).</p><p>Our novel findings reinforce the notion that SM produced by pathogenic SMS2 variants is scrambled across the ER bilayer, triggering mobilization of both luminal and cytosolic EqtSM. Whether the condensation of EqtSM into puncta reflects binding of the reporter to pre-existing SM microdomains or involves a clustering of SM-bound reporters driven by a residual pore-forming activity remains to be established. Resolving this issue will require a substantial amount of additional work. Conceivably, binding of EqtSM to the membrane may alter its curvature and even pinch off SM-enriched membrane regions, analogous to the shedding of extracellular vesicles observed when cells are exposed to the cholesterol/SM binding protein ostreolysin A (Skocaj et al., 2016; https://doi.org/10.1016/ j.bbamem.2016.08.015). In fact, such shedding may explain why EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub>-positive puncta do not co-localize with a wide range of organellar markers (Appendix – figure 5) and why externally added recombinant EqtSM preferentially labels the positively-curved edges of adherent cells (Figure 7A). While our data underline the value of EqtSM and LysSM as tools for probing SM topology in intact cells, we now added a note of caution regarding their potential impact on the structural organization of SM-rich membranes (p. 9, lines 317320).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One problem may be that the Eqt reporter used is perhaps not the most reliable reporter for SM, as its lipid preference has not been extensively characterized beyond the initial description.

In that study, we demonstrate that mobilization of EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub> to damaged lysosomes is abolished upon targeting a bacterial SMase to the cytosolic surface of the lysosomes. Nevertheless, as requested by the reviewer, we now used lysenin as alternative cytosolic SM reporter (LysSM<sub>cyto</sub>). As shown in new Figure 6B and C, cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants mobilize GFP-tagged LysSM<sub>cyto</sub> to cytosolic puncta that colocalize extensively with mKate-tagged EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub>. These puncta do not form in cells expressing wildtype SMS2 or when using a non-SM binding variant of the probe (LysSol<sub>cyto</sub>). Our novel findings demonstrate that formation of cytosolic puncta in cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants is not an artefact inherent to the use of EqtSM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A further issue is that their images of wild-type cells quite often show some concentration of Eqt-GFP in the perinuclear region (eg Figure 6A or 9B), although it is hard to see in some cases as the images show three different reporters simultaneously, with single channel images not provided. A similar perinuclear concentration has been seen with a different Eqt-based reporter in wild-type cells (Bakrac et al. JBC 285 22186 (2010)), and it may reflect Eqt not being an ideal reporter. Hopefully, a lysenin-based reporter will give clearer results.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide single channel images of cells throughout our study. In single channel images of Figure 6A, which are presented in Appendix 1 – figure 4A and B, one can occasionally observe some concentration of GFP-tagged EqtSM in the perinuclear region of control cells. However, this type of staining can also be observed when using GFP-tagged EqtSol, a EqtSM variant that lacks affinity for SM and does not form puncta in cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants. Unlike EqtSM used in our study, the Eqt-based reporter used by Bakrac et al. (2010) was not engineered to reduce its cytotoxicity. Consequently, native Eqt retains the ability to form pores and may therefore more readily insert into membranes exposing small amounts of SM on the cytosolic surface, with the resulting damage potentially promoting further SM exposure and Eqt binding. Bakrac et al. (2010) found that native Eqt primarily stains the <italic>cis-</italic>Golgi, which may not be surprising given its close proximity to the site of bulk SM production and low content of cholesterol, a molecule known to reduce spontaneous flip-flop. We clearly do not see this phenomenon with EqtSM. Moreover, our finding that EqtSM and LysSM co-localize in cytosolic puncta that form only in cells expressing a catalytically active pathogenic SMS2 variant (Figure 6B and C) supports the notion that EqtSM is a reliable SM reporter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors state that SMS2 has an ER export &quot;IXMP motif&quot;.

As pointed out by the reviewer, and now also explicitly referred to in the manuscript (p. 5, lines 154-156), additional work will be required to determine whether mutation of Ile62 or Met64 perturbs an uncharacterized linear sequence motif or the overall fold of the enzyme’s <italic>N</italic>-terminal cytosolic tail, such that it is no longer functional for ER export.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) When examining the location of proteins or reporters, the authors must show single channel images in gray scale of the key results (as they do in Figures 5 and 7).

These data revealed a strong inverse correlation between cellular SM and glycosphingolipid (GSL) levels. As described on p. 5 (lines 172-176), this is consistent with a competition between Golgi-resident SM and glucosylceramide synthases for ceramide substrate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The authors comment that cholesterol levels in the ER do not increase in the mutant. However, some caution may be needed as, firstly, cholesterol can partition out of membranes during fractionation, and secondly, cholesterol may not be able to reach the ER as the cells may not be making much in the ER but are instead obtaining it from lipoproteins in the culture medium.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these valuable comments. If cholesterol were to partition out of membranes during isolation of the organelles, our lipidomics data indicate that this did not happen to an extent sufficient to wipe out the marked difference in cholesterol content between the ER and plasma membrane (~8 vs ~40 mol%, respectively; Figures 3D and 4D). In the revised manuscript, we modified the Discussion to acknowledge that cultured cells may not make much cholesterol in the ER but instead obtain bulk cholesterol from lipoproteins in the culture medium (p. 12, lines 444-447). We now also refer to previous work indicating that a stream of cholesterol constantly travels from the plasma membrane to the ER (Infante and Radhakrishnan, 2017). This enables the ER to continuously sample the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane and, if necessary, make adjustments via transcriptional regulation of cholesterol uptake and synthesis. Given the crucial role of SM in sequestering cholesterol (Slotte, 2013; Das et al., 2014), this raises the question how cells with plasma membrane-like levels of SM in the ER manage to keep their ER cholesterol levels low in the face of a continuous exchange of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and ER.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) The authors express EqtSM in the ER and report it being in mostly in the ER. This is surprising, as the paper describing this reporter showed that it is present throughout the secretory pathway (Deng et al. 2016).

Why EqtSM<sub>SS</sub> is largely retained in the ER of the latter two cell types is not clear.

Nevertheless, the article in which we describe these reporters for the first time includes high-resolution microscopy images of HeLa cells labelled with NR12A or NRER<sub>Cl</sub> and stained for various organellar markers (Figure S3 in Danylchuk et al. 2021; https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.0c10972). The corresponding Pearson’s coefficients (listed in Table S2) show high correlation values for NR12A and NRER<sub>Cl</sub> with plasma membrane and ER markers, respectively. Except for some minor staining of endosomes due to endocytosis, NR12A cannot really stain any other organelle than the plasma membrane as it cannot cross the plasma membrane. For NRERCl, some non-specific staining of organelles other than the ER cannot be excluded. Therefore, we now included the following sentence in the revised manuscript: “A propyl chloride group in NRER<sub>Cl</sub> targets this probe to the ER (Danylchuck et al., 2021) even though some residual staining of other organelles cannot be excluded” (p. 10, lines 345-347).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h) Why does over-expressing SMS2 not increase the levels of SM beyond that seen in wild-type cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We previously showed that SMS1, not SMS2, is responsible for bulk SM production in HeLa cells (Tafesse et al., 2007; J. Biol. Chem. 282, 17537-17547). Unlike SMS1, which exclusively resides in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi, SMS2 populates both the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi and plasma membrane. Thus, even when SMS2 is overexpressed, a substantial portion of the total enzyme pool is situated distal from SMS1 and Golgi-resident glucosylceramide synthase with respect to receiving ceramides synthesized in the ER. This may explain why SMS2 is less effective in restoring total cellular SM levels in comparison to pathogenic SMS2 upon their expression in SMS1/2 double KO HeLa cells (Figures 3D and 4D; Appendix 1 – figure 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) The authors speculate that SM exposed to the cytosol could be cleaved by the neutral sphingomyelinase SMPD3 and this could be important for bone deposition. However, if this was the case then they would not be able to detect an accumulation of SM on cytosolic leaflets. Have they tried deleting SMPD3, or looking at the distribution of ceramide?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this valuable point. Whereas SMPD3-associated neutral SMase activity is abundantly present in osteosarcoma SaOS2 cells, we found that the enzyme is barely expressed in HeLa cells (Niekamp et al., 2022, Nature Commun 13, 1875) and skin fibroblasts (our unpublished data). This may explain why expression of pathogenic SMS2 variants in HeLa cells and skin fibroblasts, but not SaOS2 cells, triggers the mobilization of EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub> (Figures 6A and 9B; our unpublished data). To challenge this possibility and gain further insight into the pathogenic mechanism underlying OP-CDL, we deleted SMPD3 in SaOS2 cells. As SMPD3 removal severely perturbed cell growth and survival, we generated a SaOS2 cell-line in which SMPD3 is under control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Experimental work to address the above issues using this cell-line is in progress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>j) The authors should at least mention the puzzling finding that four patients with this bone-deposition disorder make a severely truncated version of SMS2 that contains only part of the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the reviewer is referring to the nonsense pathogenic SMS2 variant p.Arg50*, which is more common in patients with OP-CDL and associated with a milder bone phenotype. We originally anticipated that this variant encodes a severely truncated and enzyme-dead version of SMS2 that contains only part of the <italic>N</italic>-terminal cytosolic tail (Pekinnen <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019). However, as discussed on p. 14, lines 498-509, our recent work revealed that Met64 in this variant is utilized as alternative start codon, yielding a truncated but catalytically active enzyme that is mislocalized to the <italic>cis/medial</italic> Golgi (T. Sokoya and J. Holthuis, unpublished data). Unlike pathogenic variants SMS2<sup>I62S</sup> and SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>, SMS2<sup>R50X</sup> would have no direct access to ER-derived ceramides and must compete with GlcCer synthase for ceramides delivered to the <italic>cis/medial</italic> Golgi. Backflow of SM produced in the <italic>cis/medial</italic> Golgi to the ER may affect the lipid landscape in the secretory pathway of cells expressing SMS2<sup>R50X</sup>, but to a lesser extent than that observed in cells expressing the pathogenic variants SMS2<sup>I62S</sup> and SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>. Experiments to verify this idea are in progress and will be part of another manuscript that focuses entirely on a detailed functional characterization of the pathogenic SMS2<sup>R50X</sup> variant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have several questions/comments.</p><p>1. Data: the increase in diunsaturated PC (Figure 3E, line 469) does not seem especially convincing, yet this is used as one of the main components of the overall description/conclusion that the lipid map of the cell is dysregulated. I wonder if the authors really want to comment on the ratio of di- versus mono-unsaturated PC – is this the point that they want to focus on? Perhaps this change in the ratio may be more dramatic than simply noting the change in di-unsaturated species.</p></disp-quote><p>Please note that in the Results section (p. 7, lines 232-235) we stated that the expression of SMS2<sup>M64R</sup> is accompanied by an enhanced unsaturation of bulk phospholipid in the ER, as indicated by a significant rise in diunsaturated PC at the expense of saturated and mono-unsaturated PC species (Figure 3E). As this trend could be reproduced in 4 independent experiments, we felt it was appropriate to conclude that “The dramatic rise in ER-associated SM levels caused by pathogenic SMS2 variants was accompanied by a marked increase in PC desaturation” (Discussion, p. 13, lines 482-484).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Colours in Figure 3E are a bit confusing as they are the same as those used for the WC-ER pairing in panel D.</p></disp-quote><p>For consistency and to avoid confusion regarding pairing of data sets, we have now changed the colour coding in both Figures 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The accumulation of SM in the ER suggests the absence of an efficient vesicular or non-vesicular pathway to distribute this lipid to other compartments in sync with its rate of synthesis. Transport certainly occurs by both mechanisms as SM is found in both leaflets of the PM, but its rate seems not to be high enough. The discussion of this point in lines 438-447 is rather vague and it would be nice to see a slightly more quantitative discussion. The example of SM-exclusion from COPI vesicles pertains to lumenal SM. How do the authors envisage exclusion of the cytoplasm-facing pool?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that any curvature-based exclusion of SM from COPI vesicles would pertain to the luminal SM pool only.

There are many beautifully executed experiments in this paper but I was hoping for an old-fashioned one that might indicate the disruption of the sterol/SM gradient – this would be the Brown-Rose experiment which monitored the trafficking of a GPI-anchored protein through the secretory pathway, showing that it became insoluble in cold TX-100 when it reached the Golgi apparatus. While the molecular basis of this phenomenon can be debated the experiment provides a clear readout of the lipid translation that the authors write about in the Introduction and Discussion. It's not required to do this, but the authors may want to consider if it would help develop their description of the phenotypes that they are studying.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion, which we will take into account in our future efforts to investigate the precise impact of a disrupted SM gradient on the physicochemical and functional properties of the secretory pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. If I am not mistaken, there are old data by Wieland and van Meer describing changes in transbilayer asymmetry of SM and GlcCer on BFA treatment – these data essentially report on the phenomenon of the symmetrization of the transbilayer distribution of SM at the ER. This work could be cited/discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume the reviewer is referring to the paper by Halter, Neumann, … van Meer (2007, JCB 179, 101-115; www.jcb.org/cgi/doi/10.1083/jcb.200704091) in which the authors used BFA to demonstrate that a portion of GlcCer produced on the cytosolic surface of <italic>cis</italic>Golgi cisternae travels back to the ER to gain access to the glycolipid-producing enzymes in the Golgi lumen. However, this work focuses entirely on GlcCer and does not describe any changes in SM asymmetry upon BFA treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The central claim – that SM production in the ER affects bilayer asymmetry in the PM – rests mainly on two observations: First, the lipidome analysis of PM isolates shows only a modest decrease in total SM levels in the disease variant, while the Eqt-staining of SM at the outer leaflet shows much reduced SM levels, leading the authors to conclude that SM is also present on the inner leaflet of the PM. Direct evidence of this would be strongly desired but was however complicated by the fact that the cytosolic EqtSM reporter could not detect SM at the inside of the PM. Likewise, the cytosolic EqtSM reporter did not directly detect SM on the cytosolic leaflet of the ER but instead localized to some yet unidentified punctate structures. As the nature of the punctae could not be clarified, an artefact induced by Eqt-SM binding (aggregates? condensates?) cannot be ruled out. Similar concerns apply to the use of EqtSMss in the ER lumen, which under isotonic show strange punctae (most of which cluster around the perinuclear region) that do not convincingly co-localize with calnexin. A clear binding of EqtSMss to calnexin-labeled membranes could only be shown in hypotonic conditions. In summary, while the use of biosensors for studying lipid localization is essential to this study, as the integrity of the cells must be preserved to properly study questions of lipid asymmetry, their use is accompanied by drawbacks that were not fully addressed. In particular, the reason why cytosolic EqtSM is not able to detect SM on the inner leaflet of the PM remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these critical points, which led us to perform additional experiments and modify the manuscript as outlined below.</p><p>As requested by Reviewer #1 (comment #a), we now also used lysenin (LysSM) as alternative to the cytosolic EqtSM reporter. We find that pathogenic SMS2 variants trigger translocation of LysSM to cytosolic puncta that can be labeled by both reporters (new Figure 6B and C). Moreover, new co-localization studies revealed substantial overlap between the cytosolic puncta and EqtSM<sub>SS</sub>-positive puncta that form in the ER lumen of cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants (new Figure 6D). Upon hypotonic swelling, the luminal puncta become largely continuous with the ER membrane (Figure 5B) and tend to segregate from the cytosolic puncta (new Figure 6D, bottom row). Under these conditions, the cytosolic puncta give rise to small vesicular structures, implying the presence of a membranous core. As requested by Reviewer #2 (comment #6), we now included a cartoon to illustrate these findings (new Figure 6E). Collectively, our data indicate that cytosolic puncta originate at least in part from the ER and that their formation is not an artefact inherent to the use of EqtSM. They also reinforce the notion that SM produced by pathogenic SMS2 variants is scrambled across the ER bilayer, in line with previous literature on the substrate profiles of ER-resident scramblases (Buton et al., 2002; Chalat et al., 2012).</p><p>A puzzling aspect of the above scenario is that the EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub>-positive puncta are largely segregated from ER membrane markers (VAPA, calnexin; Figure 6A and Appendix – figure 5). Whether the condensation of EqtSM into puncta reflects binding of the reporter to pre-existing SM microdomains or involves a clustering of SM-bound reporters driven by a residual pore-forming activity remains to be established. Resolving this issue will require a substantial body of additional work. As outlined in our response to comment #1 of Reviewer #1 and on p. 9 of the manuscript (lines 309-317), we envision that binding of EqtSM to the membrane may alter its curvature and even pinch off SM-enriched membrane regions, analogous to the shedding of extracellular vesicles observed when cells are exposed to the cholesterol/SM binding protein ostreolysin A (Skocaj et al., 2016; https://doi.org/10.1016/ j.bbamem.2016.08.015). In fact, such shedding may help explain why EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub>-positive puncta do not colocalize with a wide range of organellar markers (Appendix – figure 5) and why externally added recombinant EqtSM preferentially stains the positively-curved edges of adherent cells (Figure 7A). While our data underline the value of EqtSM and LysSM as tools for probing SM topology in intact cells, we now added a note of caution regarding their potential impact on the structural organization of SM-rich membranes (p. 9, lines 317-320).</p><p>To directly assess whether SM production and scrambling in the ER affect SM asymmetry across the PM and cause a rise in SM levels in the inner PM leaflet, we now also analyzed the distribution of cytosolic EqtSM in cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants after treatment with DMSO, an agent that triggers PM vesiculation or “blebbing”. In DMSO-treated U2OS cells expressing the pathogenic variant SMS2<sup>M64R</sup>, we observed numerous small EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub>-positive puncta that are continuous with the PM (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, with PM-associated puncta marked by white arrows). Such puncta were absent in control cells. However, PM staining with the cytosolic EqtSM reporter was modest, also after treatment with the neutral SMase inhibitor GW4869. We suspect that the bulk of EqtSM<sub>cyto</sub>-positive puncta in cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants originate from the ER. This may not be surprising, as ongoing SM production and scrambling in the ER would render this organelle into a sink for cytosolic SM reporters. Circumventing this problem is not trivial and would require access to potent SMS inhibitors that are currently not available. While our findings with DMSO-treated cells provide additional support for the notion that SM production in the ER affects its transbilayer distribution at the PM, we acknowledge that the PM staining observed is not very robust. Therefore, we decided not to include these novel data in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79278-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The connection of SM mislocalization to subcellular cholesterol pools is very interesting, but not fully explored. Somewhat surprisingly, the authors found that ER cholesterol remains low even in conditions of high ER SM levels, and similarly, overall PM cholesterol levels are not affected in the disease model. Yet, detection of Chol at the inner leaflet of the PM by D4H is no longer possible when using SMS2-mutants. Instead, D4H localizes to endolysosomes. The authors do not comment on how this alternative localization potentially arises (increased Golgi-to-endosome trafficking? Cholesterol export defects of the lysosome in conditions of SM abundance?) nor confirm it with alternative methods (such as Filipin staining). Instead, they claim that the previously hypothesized SM pool in the inner leaflet of the PM renders the cholesterol inaccessible to the reporter. Here, again, potential artefacts of the reporter cannot be excluded and should be controlled for. For instance, investigating the cholesterol levels on the outer leaflet using recombinant reporters (as performed for SM) would help clarify if cholesterol distribution itself or indeed just their complex formation with SM is affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that more work will be necessary to fully elucidate the impact of SM mislocalization on subcellular cholesterol pools. Whether redistribution of the sterol reporter D4H from the PM to endolysosomes in cells expressing pathogenic SMS2 variants is caused by an enhanced Golgi-to-endosome trafficking of cholesterol, impaired cholesterol export from lysosomes, or changes in the endolysosomal pool of sequestered and free cholesterol remains to be established. Addressing this question will require a quantitative MS-based assessment of cholesterol levels in purified endolysosomes combined with the application of reporters that are able to distinguish sequestered from free cholesterol. These studies are not trivial and, in our opinion, merit a study in its own right.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For better comprehension, the authors could provide a graphical representation of the downstream effects of SM production at the ER and its effects on cholesterol</p><p>At several points in the manuscript, the authors use unpublished data to support their arguments.
