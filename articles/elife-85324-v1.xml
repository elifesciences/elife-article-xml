pathological process in many neurological diseases. N1-methyladenosine (m<sup>1</sup>A) is an RNA modification that can affect gene expression and RNA stability. The m<sup>1</sup>A landscape and potential functions of m<sup>1</sup>A modification in neurons remain poorly understood. We explored RNA (mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA) m<sup>1</sup>A modification in normal and OGD/R-treated mouse neurons and the effect of m<sup>1</sup>A on diverse RNAs. We investigated the m<sup>1</sup>A landscape in primary neurons, identified m<sup>1</sup>A-modified RNAs, and found that OGD/R increased the number of m<sup>1</sup>A RNAs. m<sup>1</sup>A modification might also affect the regulatory mechanisms of noncoding RNAs, e.g., lncRNA–RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interactions and circRNA translation. We showed that m<sup>1</sup>A modification mediates the circRNA/lncRNA‒miRNA–mRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism and that 3' untranslated region (3’UTR) modification of mRNAs can hinder miRNA–mRNA binding. Three modification patterns were identified, and genes with different patterns had intrinsic mechanisms with potential m<sup>1</sup>A-regulatory specificity. Systematic analysis of the m<sup>1</sup>A landscape in normal and OGD/R neurons lays a critical foundation for understanding RNA modification and provides new perspectives and a theoretical basis for treating and developing drugs for OGD/R pathology-related diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epitranscriptomics</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>m1A modification</kwd><kwd>OGD</kwd><kwd>ncRNA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81972073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Hengxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province-Young Taishan Scholars</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>tsqn201909197</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Hengxing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013290</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0112100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Shiqing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The m1A modification plays vital roles in the regulation of the biological functions of multiple RNA species (including mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA) and influences the interactions between these RNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA modifications were first identified more than 50 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunn, 1961</xref>). With the development of sequencing technologies, our understanding of the features (location, function, and regulation) of RNA modifications has greatly improved. RNA modifications include N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A), N1-methyladenosine (m<sup>1</sup>A), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (hm5C), 5-methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C), pseudouridine (Ψ), and inosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>). Several studies have indicated that in addition to m<sup>6</sup>A, m<sup>1</sup>A is an abundant epitranscriptomic modification and regulates multiple biological processes ranging from local structural stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oerum et al., 2017</xref>) to RNA–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), apoptosis, and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2019c</xref>).</p><p>m<sup>1</sup>A was first differentiated from other RNA modifications by Dunn in 1961 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunn, 1961</xref>). m<sup>1</sup>A modification constitutes the addition of a methyl group to the N1 position of adenosine via m<sup>1</sup>A regulators. Similar to m<sup>6</sup>A RNA modification, three kinds of regulators mediate m<sup>1</sup>A status: ‘erasers’ (ALKBH1 ALKBH3 and FTO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Safra et al., 2017</xref>), ‘writers’ (TRMT10C, TRMT61B, and TRMT6/61 A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chujo and Suzuki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engel and Chen, 2018</xref>), and ‘readers’ (YTHDF1, YTHDF2, YTHDF3, and YTHDC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seo and Kleiner, 2020</xref>). Writers are methyltransferases that manipulate the level of m<sup>1</sup>A to interfere with translation. Human mitochondrial tRNAs (mt-tRNAs) contain m<sup>1</sup>A at positions 9 and 58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guelorget et al., 2010</xref>). TRMT61B and TRMT6/61 A catalyse m<sup>1</sup>A modification at position 58 in mt-RNA in human cells, while TRMT10C catalyses it at position 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ozanick et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chujo and Suzuki, 2012</xref>). Readers recognize m<sup>1</sup>A and mediate the translation and degradation of downstream RNAs. Proteins containing YTH domains directly bind to m<sup>1</sup>A-modified positions in RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2018</xref>). Erasers are demethylases that catalyze the removal of m<sup>1</sup>A from single-stranded DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Two AlkB family proteins, ALKBH3 and ALKBH1, have been found to remove m<sup>1</sup>A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ueda et al., 2017</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that m<sup>1</sup>A modification is involved in various biological functions. Wu et al. found that m<sup>1</sup>A demethylase ALKBH3 regulated glycolysis of cancer cells and further affected tumour growth and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 2022a</xref>). Wu et al. revealed that m<sup>1</sup>A regulation is significantly associated with the pathogenesis of human Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2022b</xref>). However, the roles of m<sup>1</sup>A modification in neurons remain largely unknown.</p><p>Cerebral ischaemia‒reperfusion injury (IRI) is the main pathological process in many brain diseases, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>) and acute ischaemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wiberg et al., 2016</xref>). Ischaemia and blood flow reperfusion cause damage at ischaemic sites. Neuronal oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R), which results in dysregulation of material and energy metabolism, subsequently affects neuronal biological processes such as survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sasaki et al., 2011</xref>), apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song et al., 2019</xref>), and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Dysfunction of biological processes resulting from OGD/R leads to the occurrence and aggravation of diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wiberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is highly important to study the changes in neurons undergoing OGD/R. Recently, many studies have shown that various mRNAs and noncoding RNAs (long noncoding RNAs [lncRNAs], circular RNAs [circRNAs], and microRNAs [miRNAs]) regulate the exacerbation or amelioration of pathological processes caused by OGD/R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2022</xref>) through various mechanisms. For example, the lncRNA U90926 directly binds to malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2), which could aggravate ischaemic brain injury by facilitating neutrophil infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). circUCK2 functions as a sponge to inhibit miR-125b-5p activity, resulting in an increase in growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) expression and subsequent amelioration of neuronal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). Some studies have shown that chemical modifications of these RNAs can regulate the original mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patil et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2021b</xref>). However, most studies have focused on m<sup>6</sup>A modification, and little is known about the features and functions of m<sup>1</sup>A modification of various RNAs in normal neurons and OGD/R-treated neurons.</p><p>In this study, we identified the characteristics of m<sup>1</sup>A modification of various RNAs (mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA) in mouse neurons and explored the potential effects of this modification on different RNA functions. We first identified m<sup>1</sup>A-modified peaks (m<sup>1</sup>A peaks) in normal neurons and OGD/R-treated neurons at different times and thus discovered a GA-rich motif. The number of RNAs with m<sup>1</sup>A modification, the chromosome distribution, and the changes in m<sup>1</sup>A modification on various RNAs before and after OGD/R treatment were analysed. The number of m<sup>1</sup>A RNAs was increased after OGD/R treatment, and most of these differentially expressed m1A-modified RNAs were involved in biological processes and signalling pathways related to the regulation of cellular homeostasis and synapses. In addition, the results indicated that m<sup>1</sup>A modification mediates the complex posttranscriptional regulation network and that the regulation of m<sup>1</sup>A modification in key nodes of RNA interaction networks may cause widespread changes in downstream signalling. We also proposed three patterns of m<sup>1</sup>A modification, with genes fitting these modification patterns participating in different biological functions and signalling pathways. Overall, we analysed the characteristics of m<sup>1</sup>A modification of multiple RNAs in normal neurons and OGD/R-treated neurons from multiple perspectives. The landscape and other findings provide evidence useful for the exploration of epitranscriptomic mechanisms and the development of targeted drugs in OGD/R-related pathological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The common features of m<sup>1</sup>A modification in primary neurons</title><p>The distribution of m<sup>1</sup>A modifications in the transcriptome is uncharacterized in the nervous system, especially in important component neurons. We performed m<sup>1</sup>A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) to clarify the m<sup>1</sup>A transcriptomic landscape in primary neurons and OGD/R-treated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A total of 48,260, 13,588, and 16,397 m<sup>1</sup>A peaks were identified in mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For example, regarding the m<sup>1</sup>A peaks in mRNAs, 29,066, 37,893, and 41,334 m<sup>1</sup>A peaks were identified in the Control, OGD/R 1.5 hr, and OGD/R 3 hr samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We examined the genomic distribution of those m<sup>1</sup>A peaks and found that in the Control group, 54.2% were located in coding sequences (CDSs) and 25.1% were located in the 5' untranslated region (5’UTRs) in mRNAs, with 88.4% located in CDSs and 8.9% in 5’UTRs in circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A similar proportion was found in the OGD/R 1.5 hr and 3 hr groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We used unbiased motif detection to reveal the potential motifs for m<sup>1</sup>A peaks with MEME Suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>) (v5.4.1). Various motifs that were also GA-rich were identified in mRNAs and circRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Indeed, more than 90% (4510/4646 in the Control group) of motifs in mRNA were GA-rich, and approximately 10% (579/4391 in the Control group) of motifs in circRNA were GA-rich. This pattern indicated that GA-rich m<sup>1</sup>A motifs are more prevalent in mRNA and that various mechanisms may control m<sup>1</sup>A modification in circRNA. By comparing these motifs with the known motifs in the JASPAR database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castro-Mondragon et al., 2022</xref>) (v 2022), we found that the GA-rich motifs are highly similar to those in MA0528.1 from ZNF263 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and the functions of these motifs were mainly focused on RNA polymerase II promoter regulation. Interestingly, although the motifs in circRNAs in the OGD/R 3 hr group were also GA-rich, their main function was to regulate axon guidance and the G-protein coupled receptor protein signalling pathway. These results suggest that GA-rich m<sup>1</sup>A motifs are present in neurons, although they vary across RNAs with different functions.</p><p>The dynamic regulation and function of m<sup>1</sup>A mainly depend on m<sup>1</sup>A demethylase (‘erasers’), m<sup>1</sup>A methyltransferase (‘writers’), and m<sup>1</sup>A read-binding protein (‘readers’).

However, the trends of these m<sup>1</sup>A regulators were different under different OGD/R treatments.

Three m<sup>1</sup>A modification patterns, termed Cluster 1, Cluster 2, and Cluster 3, were discovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The mixture coefficient matrix also showed that the three clusters had good discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We further explored whether the different m<sup>1</sup>A clusters had different biological functions. Cluster 1 was defined as the ‘Metabolism-associated cluster’ (MAC) since its members were enriched in signal transduction and biosynthetic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and metabolism-associated pathways, such as the chemokine and relaxin signalling pathways. In Cluster 2, autophagy-related biological processes and pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) were enriched; thus, we defined Cluster 2 as the ‘Autophagy-associated cluster’ (AAC). Finally, Cluster 3 was defined as the ‘Catabolism-associated cluster’ (CAC) because of the enrichment of catabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The above results show that m<sup>1</sup>A modification plays different regulatory roles in the different clusters, indicating the existence of specific m<sup>1</sup>A modification patterns in neurons. To further explore the upstream regulatory mechanisms of these three m<sup>1</sup>A patterns, we performed a transcription factor (TF) analysis. The ‘Enrichr’ database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/">http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/</ext-link>) was used to enrich the TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). We found that the representative TFs enriched specifically in clusters. Further prediction of the activity of these transcription factorTFs showed that different TF activation and repression patterns exist in different clusters. In MAC and CAC, most of the TFs had increased inferred activity. However, most of the TFs had decreased inferred activity in AAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–H</xref>). Based on these TFs with altered activity, we constructed a TF-target gene regulatory network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>). The above results suggested that the three m<sup>1</sup>A patterns we identified are indeed regulated by different TFs and that the activities of these TFs are also specific. Another question we are interested in is whether these three different functional m<sup>1</sup>A patterns are associated with the expression of m<sup>1</sup>A regulators. We calculated the scores of representative functions in the three m<sup>1</sup>A patterns and then calculated the correlation between these functional scores and the expression of m<sup>1</sup>A regulators.

In this study, we identified m<sup>1</sup>A modifications on three kinds of RNAs (mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs) in normal neurons and OGD/R-treated neurons. We identified thousands of m<sup>1</sup>A mRNAs and found that the number and level of mRNA m<sup>1</sup>A modifications were increased after OGD/R. Regarding lncRNAs, in addition to exploring the basic features of m<sup>1</sup>A modification, we found two important m<sup>1</sup>A lncRNAs, <italic>Meg3</italic> and <italic>Neat1</italic>, might be associated with RBPs and possibly play vital roles in the regulation of mRNA metabolism. There are approximately 3000 m1A circRNAs in neurons, and they play roles in the nervous system. The m<sup>1</sup>A modifications on circRNAs such as <italic>App</italic> and <italic>Foxo5</italic> may be involved in the mechanism of circRNA translation. Furthermore, we explored the underlying associations among m<sup>1</sup>A RNAs (circRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs) and found that there are two different complex regulatory networks for differential expression and differential methylation. We confirmed that m<sup>1</sup>A modification of some mRNAs affects the function of other regulatory mechanisms. The m<sup>1</sup>A modification patterns in neurons were also investigated. Three m<sup>1</sup>A patterns were identified: the Metabolism-associated cluster, Autophagy-associated cluster, and Catabolism-associated cluster. And there are specific TF networks in these three m<sup>1</sup>A patterns.</p><p>Relatively conserved sequences in RNAs are usually identified as sites of various chemical modifications. Methyltransferases can modify RNAs by recognizing those motifs. There are different motif sequences for different RNA modifications. m<sup>6</sup>A modification, the most important and common modification from yeast to humans, is located predominantly at RRACU (where <italic>R</italic>=A/G) consensus motifs in mammals and RGAC (where <italic>R</italic>=A/G) consensus motifs across yeast species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). Several studies have identified motifs for m<sup>1</sup>A modification. The GUUCRA motif was identified in the mitochondrial transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2017</xref>). Another study also indicated that m<sup>1</sup>A was preferentially located at a GA-rich motif in 10–15% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominissini et al., 2016</xref>). The motifs identified in these different studies were inconsistent with our findings. We identified different motifs in neurons, mRNAs (CMGCWGC and GCGGCGGCGGC), lncRNAs (AGARRAARAARAARA and TGCTGCTGCTG), and circRNAs (CWTCNTC and TGGARRA). Some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominissini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Safra et al., 2017</xref>), such as m<sup>1</sup>A, are more likely to be present in regions with a high GC content, as found in previous studies. In addition, our results show that m<sup>1</sup>A-modified motifs may have RNA species specificity. These m<sup>1</sup>A motifs differ greatly across RNAs. Combining our findings with those of a previous study indicating that motifs have RNA methyltransferase specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang and Jia, 2018</xref>), we speculate that different methyltransferases may regulate the modification of different RNAs. Currently, the results of motif identification seem relatively complex. Further identification of different methylases for different RNAs combined with experimental verification may be a future research direction.</p><p>It has been shown that m<sup>6</sup>A modifications are time-specific in developmental processes as well as in the development of some diseases. During both <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and mouse cerebellum development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2018</xref>), the level of m<sup>6</sup>A modification changes dynamically with the developmental process, which is associated with various organogenesis and specific functions. In Alzheimer’s disease, m<sup>6</sup>A modification levels also change as the disease progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shafik et al., 2021</xref>). However, whether the m<sup>1</sup>A modification is time-specific is still unknown. In the present study, we focused on the changes in m<sup>1</sup>A modification under different OGD/R treatments. Our results suggested that m<sup>1</sup>A regulators differentially expressed and mRNA and noncoding RNA has their own features in different OGD/R treatments. We suggested that this is partly indicative of the time-specificity of m<sup>1</sup>A modifications under different OGDR treatments, but more investigations are needed to determine whether m<sup>1</sup>A modifications are time-specific during development and in other disease progressions.</p><p>Different RNAs play different roles in biological processes. mRNAs are translated into proteins that regulate biological activities, while noncoding RNAs, such as lncRNAs and circRNAs, play important roles in posttranscriptional regulation via various mechanisms. Chemical modification of these RNAs changes their original regulatory mechanisms and influences their downstream effects. m<sup>6</sup>A modification of mRNAs can affect mRNA expression, stability, and splicing and can promote or prevent mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song et al., 2020</xref>). m<sup>6</sup>A modification of circRNAs can affect the translation of circRNAs and splicing of longer circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wesselhoeft et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, m<sup>6</sup>A modification of lncRNAs also plays vital roles in lncRNA-mediated gene silencing and RNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2020b</xref>). Currently, few studies have addressed the effect of m<sup>1</sup>A modification on RNA metabolism and functions. Some studies have shown that m<sup>1</sup>A modification of mRNA can regulate mRNA translation. We found that m<sup>1</sup>A modification can affect the ceRNA mechanism by affecting the binding of miRNAs to mRNAs. Similarly, little is known about the function of m<sup>1</sup>A modification on noncoding RNAs. In this study, we identified the features of m<sup>1</sup>A modification on lncRNAs and circRNAs and summarized the numbers of genomic sources and intergroup differences in m1A RNAs. Regarding m<sup>1</sup>A lncRNAs, we explored the RBPs that may interact with m<sup>1</sup>A lncRNAs and found that the RBPs bound to m<sup>1</sup>A lncRNAs are involved mainly in the metabolism and splicing of mRNAs. Regarding m<sup>1</sup>A circRNAs, in addition to providing a basic landscape, we also studied the translation characteristics of m1A circRNAs. We found that m<sup>1</sup>A circRNAs might be translated into proteins and that some of these m<sup>1</sup>A circRNAs also have m<sup>6</sup>A-modified sites. Other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2021</xref> have shown that m<sup>6</sup>A modification also regulates circRNA translation. Therefore, if a circRNA simultaneously contains two modifications, which modification has a greater impact on translation regulation, and what is the underlying mechanism? These questions deserve in-depth study. A complex relationship may exist between m<sup>6</sup>A modifications and m<sup>1</sup>A modifications. m<sup>1</sup>A can be converted to m<sup>6</sup>A under heat and alkaline conditions, which is known as Dimroth rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). m<sup>1</sup>A modification has also been found to facilitate m<sup>6</sup>A-mediated mRNA degradation via HRSP12 (m<sup>1</sup>A ‘reader’)-YTHDF2 (m<sup>6</sup>A ‘reader’), which provides evidence for a crosstalk between different RNA modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boo et al., 2022</xref>). We speculate that there may also be interactions between different modifications in neurons, which is an interesting and meaningful direction worthy of further exploration.</p><p>Transcriptome-wide m<sup>1</sup>A modification may play a role in some currently identified posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms. The regulatory mechanism of ceRNAs is generally considered to play a role at the expression level, but the effect of m1A modifications on this mechanism is not clear. In this study, two interaction networks were constructed by using differential expression and differential methylation data, and both networks were extremely complex. Similar regulatory loops between lncRNAs and circRNAs were formed by linking miRNAs, especially in the differential modification regulatory network. Modifications of these RNAs may affect the interactions in these loops. For example, m<sup>1</sup>A modification of lncRNAs, circRNAs and mRNAs may affect their interactions with miRNAs. This mechanism provides a more accurate strategy for the upstream and downstream regulation of miRNAs, which in turn more conveniently regulates biological processes. In this study, we also found multiple miRNA‒mRNA pairs, and the dual luciferase assay confirmed that m<sup>1</sup>A modification of some mRNA 3’UTRs affects the binding of miRNAs to these mRNAs. We found that these genes affected by m<sup>1</sup>A modification (<italic>Rbfox3</italic> and <italic>Arid1a</italic>) are related to neural development and differentiation; the genes that were not affected (<italic>Grin2d</italic> are <italic>Wdtc1</italic>) are related mostly to broader cellular functions. Therefore, we asked whether m<sup>1</sup>A modification preferentially occurs on certain genes. m<sup>1</sup>A modification depends on several methyltransferases. Thus, do methyltransferases exhibit preferences for different functional genes? Just as we proposed that m<sup>1</sup>A modification of different RNA species may be mediated by different m<sup>1</sup>A-related enzymes, we hypothesize that different methyltransferases may exhibit preferences for different functional genes.</p><p>The m<sup>1</sup>A modification patterns remain unclear in neurons. As our results showed, m<sup>1</sup>A modification of different RNAs may be regulated by different enzymes, and different functional genes may be regulated via different methyltransferases; thus, identification of m<sup>1</sup>A patterns is urgently needed. We identified three patterns of m<sup>1</sup>A modification in neurons: a metabolism-associated cluster, an autophagy-associated cluster, and a catabolism-associated cluster. The genes with each pattern of m<sup>1</sup>A modification perform different biological functions. These three m<sup>1</sup>A patterns are closely related to the fate of neurons. The proper functioning of neuronal metabolic mechanisms ensures the function of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dienel, 2019</xref>). The metabolic pathways of these neurons may be regulated by m<sup>1</sup>A modifications. Disruption of these metabolic pathways may contribute to the initiation or progression of neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonvento and Bolaños, 2021</xref>). Autophagy is also important in neurons. Autophagy pathways are essential in neurodevelopment as well as in the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stavoe and Holzbaur, 2019</xref>). An imbalance in catabolic processes can also lead to neuronal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Camandola and Mattson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ravera et al., 2019</xref>). Based on previous studies in other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominissini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Safra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>), we found that the function of the m<sup>1</sup>A in different cell types seems to be different and we speculate that these m<sup>1</sup>A modifications patterns are cell-type-specific. Investigation of this possibility also requires more sequencing and experimental data for analysis.</p><p>With the deepening of the RNA epitranscriptomic research studies, some m<sup>6</sup>A regulators have been selected as targets for the development of corresponding drugs, especially within the field of oncology. Nucleoside and non-nucleoside METTL3 inhibitors were designed to inhibit the function of METTL3 in different kinds of tumours and proved METTL3 was an efficient therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu and Ge, 2022</xref>). METTL14 also plays an important role in a variety of tumours. Designing activators and inhibitors of METTL14 is also an important direction for drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guan et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, m<sup>6</sup>A-modified noncoding RNAs are potential therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yi et al., 2020</xref>). In our current research, we have not only identified differentially expressed m<sup>1</sup>A regulators (<italic>Alkbh3</italic>, <italic>Trmt10c</italic>, <italic>Trmt61a</italic>, <italic>Ythdf2</italic>, and <italic>Ythdf3</italic>) in OGD/R, but also constructed noncoding RNA regulatory networks for differential expression and differential methylation under OGD/R treatment, and identified a number of noncoding RNAs that may play important roles, all of which may be targets for mitigating the effects of OGD/R.</p><p>Overall, in this study, we profiled the features and patterns of m<sup>1</sup>A modification in neurons and OGD/R-treated neurons. We identified m<sup>1</sup>A modifications on different RNAs and explored the possible effects of m<sup>1</sup>A modification on the functions of different RNAs and the posttranscriptional regulation mechanism. Although we found and proposed some roles related to m<sup>1</sup>A modification, it is still a relatively complex modification type (no completely conserved modification motif has been found, and m<sup>1</sup>A may exhibit RNA type specificity, cell type specificity, etc.). Therefore, as more research techniques are developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xie et al., 2021</xref>), in-depth study of the m<sup>1</sup>A modification for various biological processes and the development of related therapeutic targets based on this modification require considerably integrated bioinformatic and basic experimental research studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6 mice purchased from the Laboratory Animal Centre, Academy of Military Medical Science (Beijing, China), were used mainly for harvesting primary cerebral neurons.

In brief, mouse foetuses (embryonic day 17 [E17]) were removed from the uterus, and the individual foetuses were freed from the embryonic sacs. The brain and cortical tissue were dissected and placed in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM-HG) without phenol red (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA; Cat. No. 31053028). Papain solution (10 U/mL; Sigma‒Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cat. No. LS003126) was added to these cerebral tissues, which were then incubated for 15 min at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Dissociated cortical cells were plated on poly-L-lysine (Sigma‒Aldrich; Cat. No. P4832)-coated cell culture dishes and cultured in DMEM-HG (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA; Cat.

No. 21103049) supplemented with B-27 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA; Cat. No. 17504044). Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The medium was changed every 3 days. Cultures were used for in vitro experiments after 7 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>OGD/R modelling</title><p>The OGD/R model was established using a previously described method with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tasca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ryou and Mallet, 2018</xref>). Cultured primary cerebral neurons were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Sigma‒Aldrich; Cat. No. D8537) supplemented with 1% P/S after 7 days of culture. Glucose-free Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA; Cat. No. 31053028) was added to the dishes. Next, the neurons were cultured with a GENbag anaerobic incubation system (bioMérieux SA, France; Cat. No. 45534) at 37°C. The cultures were kept separate under hypoxic conditions for 1.5 hr and 3 hr to achieve OGD. Thereafter, the neurons were allowed to recover by culture in a normal serum-free medium (NM) under normal incubation conditions (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) for 24 hr. Neurons cultured in a normal serum-free medium under normoxic conditions served as Controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>RNA isolation</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from primary cultured neurons using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA; Cat.

The OD260/OD280 ratio was assessed as an index of RNA purity, and samples with OD260/OD280 values ranging from 1.8 to 2.1 met the qualifications for purity. RNA integrity was evaluated using denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Preparation of the m<sup>1</sup>A RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) library</title><p>MeRIP-seq was performed by Cloudseq Biotech Inc (Shanghai, China) according to a published procedure with slight modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). In brief, three biological replicates were used for the Control, OGD/R 1.5 hr, and OGD/R 3 hr groups. Isolated RNA was chemically degraded into fragments of approximately 100 nucleotides in length using a fragmentation buffer (Illumina, Inc, CA, USA). A Magna MeRIP m<sup>1</sup>A Kit (Merck Millipore, MA, USA; Cat. No. 17–10499) was used to perform immunoprecipitation (IP) of m<sup>1</sup>A RNA according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. IP buffer (Cat. No. CS220009), Magna ChIP Protein A/G Magnetic Beads (Cat. No. CS203152), and an anti-m<sup>1</sup>A antibody (Cat. No. MABE1006) were used to prepare the magnetic beads for IP. Next, the MeRIP reaction mixture was prepared according to the manufacturer’s guidelines, and fragmented RNA was included in this mixture. The magnetic beads and MeRIP reaction mixture were combined in tubes, and all tubes were incubated with rotation for 2 hr at 4°C. Subsequently, elution buffer was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions and was used to elute bound RNA from the beads using the anti-m<sup>1</sup>A antibody in IP buffer. Both input samples without IP and m<sup>1</sup>A input samples were used for library construction using a NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, Inc, MA, USA). Eluted RNA fragments were converted to cDNA and sequenced or treated to induce partial m<sup>1</sup>A to m<sup>6</sup>A conversion before cDNA synthesis. Library sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument (Illumina, Inc, CA, USA) with 150 bp paired-end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>MeRIP-seq data analysis</title><p>In brief, quality control of the paired-end reads was performed with FastQC (v0.11.9) prior to trimming of 3’ adaptors and removal of low-quality reads using Cutadapt software (v1.9.3). Then, HISAT2 software (v2.0.4) was used to align the clean reads from all libraries to the reference genome (mm10) downloaded from Ensembl. Peaks for which –10×log10(<italic>p</italic> value)&gt;3 were detected using Model-Based Analysis of ChIP-Seq (MACS) software (v2.2.7.1). Differentially methylated sites with a fold change of ≥2 and false discovery rate (FDR) of ≤0.0001 were identified with the diffReps differential analysis package (v1.55.6). The peaks identified by MACS and diffReps that overlapped with exons of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs were identified and selected for further analysis. In addition to conventional peak calling (conventional method), the peaks with A-&gt;T mismatches (mismatch method) were analysed. In addition, m<sup>1</sup>A sites have a partial chance of terminating reverse transcription, resulting in lower coverage in the middle of the peak (near the m<sup>1</sup>A site) than on both sides, forming a depression. These peaks and depressions (trough method) were also analysed. Moreover, when m<sup>1</sup>A was converted into m<sup>6</sup>A, the mismatch and termination properties of m<sup>6</sup>A were lost, while reverse transcription was normal. Thus, after sequencing, peaks with the normal shape could be detected at the sites (treatment method).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Preparation of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) libraries</title><p>Total RNA was used for the removal of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) using Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kits (Illumina, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Libraries were subjected to quality control and quantified using a BioAnalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, USA). RNA was purified from each sample using Oligo(dT) Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and subjected to first-strand cDNA synthesis and library preparation using a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina). Libraries (10 pM) were denatured as single-stranded DNA molecules, captured on Illumina flow cells, amplified in situ as clusters, and finally sequenced for 150 cycles on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA-seq data analysis</title><p>Quality control of paired-end reads was performed with FastQC (v0.11.9) prior to trimming of 3’ adaptors and removal of low-quality reads using Cutadapt software (v1.9.3). The high-quality reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) with HISAT2 software (v2.0.4). Then, guided by the Ensembl (GRCm39.104) GTF gene annotation file, expression was estimated in units of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKMs). The differentially expressed genes were identified as those with a fold change of ≥2 and adjusted p value of ≤0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Preparation of miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) libraries and data analysis</title><p>miRNA-seq was conducted at Cloudseq Biotech Inc (Shanghai, China). In brief, total RNA from each group was prepared and quantified with the BioAnalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, USA). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed, and the gel was cut to select the band corresponding to a length of 18–30 nt to recover small RNAs. Adaptors were then ligated to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the small RNAs. After cDNA synthesis and amplification, the PCR-amplified fragments were purified from the PAGE gel, and the complete cDNA libraries were quantified with a BioAnalyzer 2100. Sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 instrument, and 50 bp single-end reads were generated. For miRNA-seq data analysis, the adaptor sequences were trimmed, and the trimmed reads (≥15 nt) were retained by Cutadapt software (v1.9.3). Then, the trimmed reads were aligned to the merged mouse pre-miRNA databases (known pre-miRNAs from miRbase [v22.1]) using NovoAlign software (v3.02.12). The number of mature miRNA-mapped tags was defined as the raw expression level of that miRNA. Read counts were normalized by tag counts per million aligned miRNAs (TPM) values.

In general, this study is innovative, practical and well designed. Despite the interesting results obtained, there are some concerns and criticisms with their observations/conclusions.</p><p>1. Despite the authors' comprehensive exploration of m1A modifications in neuron, they seem to have overlooked an important aspect: are m1A regulators differentially expressed in normal neurons and OGD/R neurons? The currently known m1A regulators include: Trmt6, Trmt61A, Alkbh1, Alkbh3, Fto, Ythdf1, Ythdf2 and Ythdc1. The authors could also do more in-depth literature search about the m1A regulators and performed gene expression profile analyses to identify differentially expressed regulators.</p><p>2. Considering the research frontier, the biological role of m1A methylation modification should be described in detail in the Introduction section. M1A modification has been found to play a critical role in various biological conditions and diseases. Recent studies have also shown that m1A methylation regulates glycolysis of cancer cells through modulating ATP5D (PMID: 35867754, 2022) and also participate in the modulating of macrophage polarization which promotes aortic inflammation (PMID: 35620523, 2022), authors should review the latest literature on m1A modification and describe the role and significance of m1A modification in depth.</p><p>3. In Figure 6, the authors presented three patterns regulate m1A modification in neurons and the functions of these three patterns are identified. I consider this result to be of great interest. I suggest that the authors could further analyze the transcription factors to clarify the upstream regulation of these three patterns. Transcription factor analysis can tell us at least two things: 1. whether there is specific transcription factor expression in different patterns; 2. whether there is a regulatory network of transcription factors in different patterns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this is an interesting and well performed study that described a comprehensive landscape of m1A modification in primary neuron and investigated the role of m1A in the circRNA/lncRNA‒miRNA-mRNA regulatory network following OGD/R. The focus on the two different complex regulatory networks for differential expression and differential methylation is important and it will be a valuable resource for the research community that focuses on epitranscriptomics and central nerve system diseases. Collectively, the authors present an exciting piece of work that certainly adds to the literature regarding epitranscriptomic features in neuron. While interesting results obtained and the paper is nicely written, I have several comments the authors might want to consider to improve the overall strength of their manuscript.</p><p>1. In this manuscript, a meaningful conclusion is that the m1A modification on mRNA 3'UTR hinders the binding of miRNAs (Figure 5). I think this provides a good idea to study the possible roles of m1A modification in a variety of diseases. I would like to know what the authors envision for the continuation of research in this area.</p><p>2. The authors present three patterns (&quot;metabolism-associated cluster&quot;, &quot;autophagy- associated cluster&quot;, &quot;catabolism-associated cluster&quot;) of m1A modifications in the last part of RESULTS (Figure 6), which is an intriguing finding. However, it does not seem to explore the specific details of these three modification patterns further. I suggest that the authors could further analyze whether the genes in these patterns are regulated by some common transcription factors.</p><p>3. The m1A modification mainly depends on the dynamic regulation of RNA methyltransferases (writers), demethylases (erasers) and m1A-binding proteins (readers). However, in this manuscript the authors do not mention the changes in m1A regulators. I am curious about whether m1A regulators will be differentially expressed after OGD/R and suggest the authors to add this part of the analysis. Of course, if differentially expressed m1A regulators exist, the authors could further explore the role of these factors and, in particular, the association with the three m1A modification patterns.</p><p>4.

The results showed that the expression of Alkbh3, Trmt10c, Trmt61a, Ythdf2, and Ythdf3 were statistically significant (Figure 1F).

To explore the relationship between m1A regulators and three m1A modification patterns, we used GSVA for scoring the major pathways in the three patterns and subsequently calculated the correlation between these m1A regulators expression and the 3 pattern pathway scores. Our results suggested that most of m1A regulators were positively correlated with metabolism-associated functions and autophagy-associated functions, and negatively correlated with catabolism-associated functions (Figure 6—figure supplement 1H).

To clarify the transcription factor regulation of different patterns, we have performed new analyses to identify activity of transcriptional factors in those three patterns. We found that the representative transcription factors enriched specifically in cluster. Further prediction of the activity of these transcription factors showed that different transcription factor activation and repression patterns exist in different clusters. In MAC and CAC, most of the transcription factors had increased inferred activity. However, most of the transcription factors had decreased inferred activity in AAC (Figure 6F-6H). Based on these transcription factors with altered activity, we constructed a TF-target gene regulatory network (Figure 6I-6K).

We did not explore m1A modifications on tRNA in this manuscript. Here we just focused on three RNA types, mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA. tRNA was beyond the scope of this study.

Have the authors examined the topology of the m1A modification in normal and OGD/R-treated conditions or on diverse RNAs?

The main purpose of this manuscript is to construct a comprehensive m1A modification atlas in normal neurons and OGD/R-treated neurons. The m1A topology is achieved by two enzyme systems: m1A methyltransferase and m1A demethylases. We added the expression analysis of these enzymes in the in Figure 1F of the revised manuscript. In-depth study of m1A topology is an important direction for our future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The authors should elaborate this point in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this advice. Clarification of the mechanism of m1A modification in OGD/R may provide some reference for the treatment of this pathological process. We provide an additional description in the Discussion section:</p><p>“With the deepening of the RNA epitranscriptomic research studies, some m6A regulators have been selected as targets for the development of corresponding drugs, especially within the field of oncology. Nucleoside and non- nucleoside METTL3 inhibitors were designed to inhibit the function of METTL3 in different kinds of tumors and proved METTL3 was an efficient therapeutic target (Xu and Ge, 2022). METTL14 also plays an important role in a variety of tumors. Designing activators and inhibitors of METTL14 is also an important direction for drug development (Guan et al., 2022). In addition, m6A-modified noncoding RNAs are potential therapeutic targets (Yi et al., 2020). In our current research, we have not only identified differentially expressed m1A regulators (Alkbh3, Trmt10c, Trmt61a, Ythdf2, and Ythdf3) in OGD/R, but also constructed noncoding RNA regulatory networks for differential expression and differential methylation under OGDR treatment, and identified a number of noncoding RNAs that may play important roles, all of which may be targets for mitigating the effects of OGD/R.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

In the Discussion section, we add our understanding of the m1A modifications at different time points:</p><p>“It has been shown that m6A modifications are time-specific in developmental processes as well as in the development of some diseases. During both <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and mouse cerebellum development (Lence et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2018), the level of m6A modification changes dynamically with the developmental process, which is associated with various organogenesis and specific functions. In Alzheimer's disease, m6A modification levels also change as the disease progresses (Shafik et al., 2021). However, whether the m1A modification is time-specific is still unknown. In the present study, we focused on the changes of m1A modification under different OGD/R treatments. Our results suggested that m1A regulators differentially expressed and mRNA and noncoding RNA has its own features in different OGD/R treatments. We suggested that this is partly indicative of the time-specificity of m1A modifications under different OGDR treatments, but more investigations are needed to determine whether m1A modifications are time-specific during development and in other disease progressions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
