We report remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton of hESCs as they transition from primed to naïve pluripotency which includes assembly of a ring of contractile actin filaments encapsulating colonies of naïve hESCs. Activity of the Arp2/3 complex is required for formation of the actin ring, to establish uniform cell mechanics within naïve colonies, to promote nuclear translocation of the Hippo pathway effectors YAP and TAZ, and for effective transition to naïve pluripotency. RNA-sequencing analysis confirms that Arp2/3 complex activity regulates Hippo signaling in hESCs, and impaired naïve pluripotency with inhibited Arp2/3 complex activity is rescued by expressing a constitutively active, nuclear-localized YAP-S127A. Moreover, expression of YAP-S127A partially restores the actin filament fence with Arp2/3 complex inhibition, suggesting that actin filament remodeling is both upstream and downstream of YAP activity. These new findings on the cell biology of hESCs reveal a mechanism for cytoskeletal dynamics coordinating cell mechanics to regulate gene expression and facilitate transitions between pluripotency states.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>human embryonic stem cells</kwd><kwd>naive pluripotency</kwd><kwd>hippo signaling</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1933240</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Nathaniel Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Nystul</surname><given-names>Todd G</given-names></name><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>Diane L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9938488</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Nathaniel Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>Diane L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31HL162520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Tania</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD055764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Nathaniel Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Nystul</surname><given-names>Todd G</given-names></name><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>Diane L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM136348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Nathaniel Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Nystul</surname><given-names>Todd G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Clonal naïve human embryonic stem cells assemble an Arp2/3 complex-dependent contractile actin filament ring around colonies that promotes tensional forces favoring cell-cell adhesion and nuclear translocation of YAP to maintain ground-state pluripotency.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Derivation of clonal pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from embryos yields cells with a spectrum of pluripotent states, depending on the species, developmental progression of the embryo, and culture conditions. Clonal mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) represent a ground state of pluripotency and closely recapitulate the naïve blastocyst from which they are isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nichols and Smith, 2009</xref>). In contrast, clonal human and other primate PSCs, as conventionally isolated and maintained, are in a primed state of pluripotency and more closely resemble the post-implantation epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). To study the naïve state of clonal human PSCs, culture conditions have been developed that dedifferentiate primed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to a naïve state of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Theunissen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duggal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szczerbinska et al., 2019</xref>). Development of culture conditions that convert and sustain a naïve pluripotent state in human PSCs provided an opportunity to study human development before gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rossant and Tam, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Such <italic>in vitro</italic> models of naïve pluripotency provided insights into the transcriptomic, epigenetic, and proteomic programs that maintain a functional naïve pluripotency state in stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duggal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Warrier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>). We have limited understanding, however, of how established morphological changes during the transition from primed to naive states are regulated and whether morphological changes regulate state transitions. Notably, remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton in response to intracellular signaling and biophysical cues is a predominant determinant for changes in cell morphology as well as for PSC fate and associated gene expression, proliferation, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Naqvi and McNamara, 2020</xref>). Moreover, the actin cytoskeleton coordinates changes in cell shape which are essential for developmental embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chalut and Paluch, 2016</xref>), and accordingly, mechanoregulation has been studied for roles in exit from the pluripotent state toward targeted cell fates including endodermal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), ectodermal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keung et al., 2012</xref>), and mesodermal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Przybyla et al., 2016</xref>) lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ireland and Simmons, 2015</xref>). Directly targeting actin filament dynamics has been shown to also regulate PSC fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hogrebe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerecht et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, other components of the cytoskeleton, such as microtubules and intermediate filaments, have been established to modulate stem cell behavior, although studies have primarily focused on how they impact nucleus morphology and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Putra et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romero et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ndiaye et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Actin-associated proteins, including β-catenin for enabling Wnt pathway activity, facilitate the maintenance of the naïve pluripotent state in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Belly et al., 2021</xref>). During murine preimplantation development, actin filaments generate mechanical forces that contribute to differentiation throughout the blastocyst stage by modulating mechanosensitive signaling pathways such as Hippo signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hirate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zenker et al., 2018</xref>). These actin structures allow cells within the developing blastocyst to organize based on contractility, coupling mechanosensing, and fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maître et al., 2016</xref>). Despite evidence that morphological changes and actin filament remodeling determine naïve pluripotency during mouse development, their roles in hESC naïve pluripotency remain unclear.</p><p>We investigated the role of morphological changes during hESC dedifferentiation to a naïve state of pluripotency and identified the assembly of a ring of contractile actin filaments encapsulating naïve but not primed colonies that is tethered to adherens junctions and decorated with phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC) and cortactin. We found that activity of the Arp2/3 complex, an actin filament nucleator, but not formins, which also nucleate actin filaments, is necessary for the formation of the actin ring, naïve cell mechanics, including decreased cell-substrate tensional forces and colony formation, and transition to naïve pluripotency. RNAseq analysis suggested a role for Hippo pathway signaling in Arp2/3 regulated naïve pluripotency, which we confirmed by showing increased nuclear localization of the transcriptional co-activators YAP and TAZ in naïve compared with primed hESCs that is blocked by inhibition of Arp2/3 complex activity. Consistent with these findings, naïve pluripotency, as well as the actin filament ring that is blocked by inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity, is restored by expressing a nuclear-localized non-phosphorylatable YAP (YAP-S127A), indicating that actin filament remodeling is both upstream and downstream of YAP activity. Our data provide new mechanistic insights into how actin filament dynamics regulates the naïve state of hESCs pluripotency and the integration between actin filament remodeling and pluripotency.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Actin filament remodeling as hESCs transition to a naïve state</title><p>For morphological analysis of pluripotency states, HUES8 primed hESCs were grown on Matrigel and dedifferentiated to naïve pluripotency using previously reported conditions in an mTeSR-based medium supplemented with MEK (PD0325901) and GSK3 (CHIR99021) inhibitors, the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin, human leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and ascorbic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duggal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2016</xref>).

The actin filament ring we observed around naïve hESC colonies was instead tethered to adherens junctions, as indicated by co-labeling for β-catenin, with separated interdigitated adherens junctions suggesting a contractile force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, crosshairs). The contractile property of the ring was also suggested by the actin ring around naïve hESC colonies being decorated with pMLC as determined by immunolabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, primed hESC colonies had irregular aggregates of pMLC with limited co-localization with actin filaments. Additionally, immunolabeling for cortactin, a regulator of cortical branched actin filaments, partly overlapped with the actin ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The subcellular localization of the actin ring was confirmed with 3D reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these data indicate a contractile actin ring surrounding naïve but not primed hESC colonies, with the ring likely composed of unbranched actin filaments, which bind pMLC, and branched filaments, which bind cortactin.</p><p>The nature of the actin ring enclosing colonies of naïve but not primed hESC colonies suggested a potential difference in colony mechanics, which we determined by using traction force microscopy. Increased cell-matrix traction forces are associated with destabilized adherens junctions in epithelial monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mertz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scarpa et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with pMLC localization, primed colonies exhibited elevated cell-substrate tractions that were distributed throughout the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, naïve colonies exhibited overall low magnitude cell-substrate tractions that were localized to the colony periphery and largely absent from the colony interior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), suggesting decreased cell-substrate tensional force and a likely shift to more stabilized cell-cell forces. Along with pMLC localization, these low traction forces are consistent with uniform cell-cell adhesion in naïve hESC colonies. Together these data reveal a significant reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during the transition to a naïve state of pluripotency that includes the assembly of a contractile actin ring surrounding naïve cell colonies, coincident with attenuated cell-substrate traction forces and a transition to enhanced cell-cell junction traction force within the colony unit.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Arp2/3 complex activity is necessary for transition of hESC to naïve pluripotency</title><p>The assembly of an actin ring in naïve but not primed hESC colonies led us to ask whether the actin ring has a functional significance in the transition to naïve pluripotency.

We found that the actin ring assembled when naïve cells are generated in the presence of SMIFH2, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of formin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rizvi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ganguly et al., 2015</xref>) but not CK666, a selective pharmacological inhibitor of Arp2/3 complex activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nolen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2012</xref> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), despite the ring likely being composed of both unbranched and branched actin filaments as indicated by pMLC and cortactin immunolabeling.

For an unbiased global analysis of known YAP target genes, we used two publicly available datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Estarás et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pagliari et al., 2021</xref>) and found that of the 3744 YAP target genes identified in our RNAseq dataset, 3156 (84%) were not differentially expressed in any condition and 588 (16%) were enriched in one or multiple conditions.

As expected, genes significantly enriched among both DEG lists included known YAP and Hippo targets such as ANKRD1, SLIT2, and CHD10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, right). Genes significantly enriched among the CK666-treated condition include the negative Hippo regulator AMOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>), and lineage-commitment genes such as SOX6 and SPEF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, middle). To verify this prediction, we immunolabeled cells to determine YAP localization and found increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios of YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>) and TAZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) with control dedifferentiation that was blocked by CK666.

These data indicate that a Hippo signaling pathway program, driven by mediators such as YAP, is active during dedifferentiation to naïve pluripotency but is disrupted by inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity.</p><p>Consistent with our findings, actin filaments and associated proteins generate mechanical forces during preimplantation development that contribute to differentiation throughout the blastocyst stage by modulating mechanosensitive pathways such as Hippo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hirate et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zenker et al., 2018</xref>). These actin structures allow cells within the developing blastocyst to organize based on contractility, coupling mechanosensing, and fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maître et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that Arp2/3 complex activity facilitated naïve dedifferentiation through increasing YAP nuclear localization. To test this prediction, we asked whether primed hESCs stably expressing a constitutively active, nuclear-localized YAP (YAP-S127A) could restore naïve dedifferentiation in the presence of CK666. Accordingly, we found that that expression of YAP-S127A in the presence of CK666 restored two markers of the naïve state, increased nuclear localization of KLF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) and decreased SSEA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). In contrast, acquisition of a naïve pluripotency state remained blocked with CK666 treatment in cells overexpressing wildtype YAP (YAP-WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Colony formation, a functional form of naïve pluripotency, was also restored by heterologous expression of YAP-S127A but not YAP-WT in the presence of CK666 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), indicating that Arp2/3 complex activity is necessary for active nuclear-localized YAP to induce a naïve pluripotency state. In addition, we found that expressing YAP-S127A but not YAP-WT in the presence of CK666 partially restored a contractile actin ring enclosing naïve cell colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating bidirectional signaling between actin filament remodeling and active nuclear-localized YAP for assembly of the actin filament ring around naïve hESC colonies. Thus, we conclude that both the transition from primed to naïve hESC pluripotency includes an Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin filament remodeling that enables active nuclear-localized YAP, and that nuclear-localized YAP enables actin filament remodeling for naïve pluripotency.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Overexpression of YAP-S127A rescues naïve pluripotency blocked with inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity.</title><p>(<bold>A, C</bold>) Representative confocal images of control primed, control naïve cells, and cells dedifferentiated in the presence of CK666 with or without stably overexpressing YAP-WT or YAP-S127A immunolabeled for the primed marker SSEA3 (<bold>A</bold>) or the naïve marker KLF4 (<bold>C</bold>) and stained for nuclei with Hoechst and F-actin with phalloidin.

Moreover, Arp2/3 activity facilitates dedifferentiation to a naïve state of pluripotency through promoting nuclear translocation of YAP and regulating Hippo target gene expression. Consistent with these findings, whereas the transition to naïve pluripotency is blocked with inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity, this transition is restored by expression of a constitutively active, nuclear-localized YAP-S127A.</p><p>The contractile rings we describe are distinct from those that assemble around <italic>Xenopus</italic> neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shellard et al., 2018</xref>), which function to enhance migratory capacity, and around colonies of iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Närvä et al., 2017</xref>), which function to enhance cell-substrate adhesion.

Our findings also highlight distinct differences between murine cells and hESCs. Cells within the ICM of mouse blastocysts exclude YAP from the nucleus whereas cells within the ICM of human blastocysts maintain nuclear YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>). This difference in YAP localization is retained <italic>in vitro</italic>, with murine naïve PSCs having predominantly cytosolic YAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chung et al., 2016</xref>), and human naïve PSCs having predominantly nuclear YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). How this difference in YAP localization occurs between mouse and human is unknown, although YAP localization is reported to be regulated by stability of the actin cytoskeleton and contractility, as well as various mechanical regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Furukawa et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The role of the actin cytoskeleton in exit from the pluripotent state has also highlighted how actin dynamics may facilitate cell fate decisions. For example, cells located at the colony edge of primed hESCs have distinct cytoskeletal dynamics and are uniquely poised to exit pluripotency and differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rosowski et al., 2015</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). Positional differences in differentiation potential such as these have been proposed as a mechanism executed in early embryo symmetry breaking with rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton being required for the first cell fate decision in the blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Skamagki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it may be possible that the contractile actin ring we observe at the edge of naïve colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) functions as a hub for regulating cell fate dynamics through similar mechanisms as first cell fate decision including modulation of mechanosensitive signaling such as YAP and through pathways such as Hippo. Our finding that the actin ring, which is lost in the presence of CK666, is restored by YAP-S127A but not YAP-WT suggests a complex circuitry between YAP activity and actin filament remodeling.</p><p>Further highlighting differences between hESCs and mESCs, we recently reported that Arp2/3 complex activity is necessary for the differentiation of clonal mouse naïve PSCs to the primed epiblast state, which is in part mediated by translocation of myocardin-related transcription factor MRTF from the cytosol to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aloisio and Barber, 2022</xref>). Additionally, a recent report suggests that Arp2/3 complex activity may form a positive feedback loop with YAP-TEAD1 transcriptional activity controlling cytoskeletal reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pagliari et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, Arp2/3 complex activity may regulate naïve pluripotency at multiple stages including initially to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, but also during maintenance of naïve pluripotency through regulating YAP localization and hence activity.</p><p>Taken together, our findings increase our understanding of actin dynamics and cell mechanics as regulators of cell fate transitions. A role for contractile actin filaments as a mechanoresponsive element for pluripotency states is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Belly et al., 2022</xref>), and our work identifies cytoskeletal dynamics essential for uniform colony mechanics and the naïve pluripotent state, the role of Arp2/3 complex activity, and YAP/TAZ activity as a promising target for reprogramming of hESCs and for regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Primed hESC lines HUES8 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_B207">CVCL_B207</ext-link>), H9 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_1240">CVCL_1240</ext-link>), and WTC11 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_Y803">CVCL_Y803</ext-link>) were maintained on Matrigel (Corning Life Science #354277) in feeder-free mTeSR-1 medium (STEMCELL Technologies # 85850) at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with daily medium changes.

A CoolSnap HQ2 cooled charge-coupled camera (Photometrics) was used to take images with a camera triggered electronic shutter controlled by NIS Elements Imaging Software (Nikon) and a 60× Plan Apochromat TIRF 1.45 NA oil immersion objective equipped with a Borealis (Andor) to normalize illumination. High-resolution and super-resolution images were acquired using a Yokogawa CSU-W1/SoRa spinning disk confocal system (Yokogawa) and an ORCA Fusion BT sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu) using 2×2 camera binning. Nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios of immunolabeled proteins and number of puncta per cell were quantified using NIS Elements Imaging Software (Nikon). Briefly, the fluorescence in the nucleus (detected by Hoescht) and in the cytoplasm were manually sampled by selection of regions-of-interest. Three regions-of-interest outside of any cell were used to calculate background fluorescence and was subtracted from both nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence values. The ratio of fluorescence was then determined by diving the nuclear fluorescence intensity with that of the cytoplasm for a given cell. Quantification of puncta for SSEA3 was done by creating a 3D projection of full-cell z-stacks by using NIS Elements Imaging Software. Surfaces were created using the 3D thresholding tool normalized across all images and the total number of puncta was recorded. The total number of cells was then counted, as determined by the number of Hoescht positive nuclei, and the number of puncta per cell was calculated by dividing the total number of puncta by the number of cells in each field of view. Percentage of positive cells for Oct4/Sox2 staining and EdU incorporation was determined by manually counting the total number of nuclei in each field of view. Oct4, Sox2, or EdU were manually counted and the total number of positive cells was divided by the total number of cells to determine the percent positive. We used IMARIS software (Oxford Instruments) to generate 3D renderings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Traction force microscopy</title><p>Polyacrylamide gels of 7.9 kPa stiffness were made by adjusting acrylamide and bisacrylamide stock solution (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) concentrations. A solution of 40% acrylamide, 2% bisacrylamide, and 1× PBS was polymerized by adding tetramethylethylene diamine (Fisher BioReagents) and 1% ammonium persulfate. A droplet of the gel solution supplemented with 0.2 μm fluorescent beads solution (Molecular Probe, Fisher Scientific) was deposited on a quartz slide (Fisher Scientific) and covered with a 25 mm glass (Fisher) coverslip pretreated with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (Sigma-Aldrich) and glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich). After polymerization, the gel surface attached to the quartz slide was functionalized with Matrigel via polydopamine. The gel was sterilized and stored in 1× PBS before cell seeding. The traction forces exerted by colonies on the polyacrylamide gel substrates were computed by measuring the displacement of fluorescent beads embedded within the gel. Briefly, images of bead motion near the substrate surface, distributed in and around the contact region of a single cell (before and after cell detachment with 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate), were acquired with Yokogawa CSU-21/Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted spinning disk microscope with a Zeiss LD C-Apochromat 40×, 1.1 NA water-immersion objective and an Evolve EMCCD camera (Photometrics).

Library preparation and RNAseq were performed by Novogene Co. Ltd (USA). Briefly, RNA purity was measured using a NanoPhotometer spectrophotometer (IMPLEN). RNA integrity and quantity were determined using a Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies). Three paired biological replicate libraries were prepared for each condition, with each library generated with 1 µg of RNA per sample. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) following the manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. Briefly, mRNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation was carried out using divalent cations under elevated temperature in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5×). First strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primer and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H-). Second strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. Remaining overhangs were converted into blunt ends via exonuclease/polymerase activities. After adenylation of 3’ ends of DNA fragments, NEBNext Adaptor with hairpin loop structure were ligated to prepare for hybridization. In order to select cDNA fragments of preferentially 150–200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified with AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, MA, USA). Then 3 µL USER Enzyme (NEB, USA) was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37°C for 15 min followed by 5 min at 95°C before PCR. Then PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, Universal PCR primers, and Index (X) Primer.

Reference genome (ID: 51) and gene model annotation files were downloaded from genome website browser (NCBI) directly. Paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software.

Three days after virus infection, hESCs were passaged and expanded to three wells in a six-well plate. After wells reached ~75% confluency, hESCs were sorted for high mCherry expression by using a BD FACS Aria3u.

We are submitting a revised manuscript and supplemental materials with new data and edits that we believe effectively address reviewers’ requests and suggestions.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Point-by-point description of the revisions</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results of experiments where Arp2/3 is blocked (Figure 2) should be confirmed by Arp2/3 knock-down and with an independent Arp2/3 inhibitor. Several are available (CK-869, Benproperine, Pimozide). For Figure 3 and 4, that would not be necessary, but to establish the specificity of the effect in Figure 2 this is absolutely required.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we include new data with CK-869, the suggested additional Arp2/3 complex inhibitor. These new data, included in Figure S2A-C, confirm that CK-869, like our previous findings with CK-666, blocks assembly of the actin filament ring around naïve colonies of hESCs without effects on pluripotency, indicated by the naïve markers Oct4 and <italic>Sox2</italic>, or on cell proliferation, indicated by EdU incorporation.</p><p>To our knowledge, there is only one publication (PMID: 31571309) that Pimozide binds to ARPC2 and inhibits Arp2/3 complex activity. It is more widely known as an antipsychotic by antagonizing dopamine and 5-HT receptors. Hence, its selectivity for inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity is questionable. Additionally, to our knowledge, there are only 2 publications (PMID: 36558913; PMID: 30710516) that Benproperine inhibits ARPC2, compared with many publications on its antitussive effects. Hence, like Pimozide, its selectivity for inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity is not well established.</p><p>We respectfully disagree with generating a Arp2/3 knock-down hESC line. Arp2/3 complex genes are known to be essential in both mouse and human embryonic stem cells (PMID: 29662178 and PMID: 31649057). Furthermore, reports on successful knockout of complex subunits indicate that additional genetic manipulations are needed to maintain cell survival, including knockout of INK4A/ARF to bypass apoptosis associated with Arp2 shRNA knockdown (PMID: 22385962) and genetic manipulations in mouse models (PMID: 22492726). Thus, knock-down of Arp2/3 complex is not reasonable for our study nor we believe necessary based on our new data with CK-869.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I believe that the status of the actin cytoskeleton in both states is not well enough characterized. This is especially obvious for branched actin networks themselves that depend on the Arp2/3. To this end, the authors may localize Arp2/3 or cortactin, a useful surrogate that often gives a better staining. This point is particularly important since contractile fibers are not made of branched actin. Myosin cannot walk or pull along branched actin networks because of steric hindrance. It might well be that branched actin networks are debranched after Arp2/3 polymerization. I suggest staining tropomyosins that would indicate where the transition between branched and unbranched actin would be. Along this line, phosphoERMs should be localized and revealed by Western blots (we expect an increase from primed to naive state) because they cannot perform the proposed function of linker between the membrane and actin filaments if they are not phosphorylated.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we include new data with cortactin immunolabeling, which are shown in Figure 1F and Figure S2D. These new data confirm that cortactin immunolabeling overlaps with the actin filament ring around naïve hESC colonies (Figure 1F) and its localization is disrupted by inhibiting Arp2/3 complex activity with CK-666 (Figure S2D). These new data and our previous data with pMLC immunolabeling suggest that the actin ring is composed of both branched and unbranched filaments, and we added this comment in our Results section.</p><p>Also as requested, we immunoblotted cell lysates for phosphorylated ERMs; however, we did not see changes in naïve compared with primed hESCs. With the new requested data on cortactin localization, which we believe and as the Reviewer indicates is a better indicator of actin architecture in the ring, we omitted our previous data on ERM binding in Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Branched actin is required for cell cycle progression and cell proliferation in normal cells. This requirement is lost in most cancer cells (Wu et al., Cell 2012; Molinie et al., Cell Res 2019). This would be really important to know whether ESCs stop proliferating upon CK-666 treatment. In other words, do they behave like normal cells or transformed cells. Proliferation is a major function that depends on the YAP pathway. Cell counts and EdU incorporation can easily provide answers to this important question.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we include new data on proliferation with Edu incorporation as indicated by Reviewer 1. These new data, shown in Figure S2C, indicate proliferation is not changed by either CK-666 or CK-869 compared with untreated controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments 4-6 and 8.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we made appropriate corrections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment 7. What about the rescue of cell morphology? Does active YAP restore the intercellular contractile bundle?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we include new data in Figure 4 indicating that heterologous expression of active nuclear localized YAP-S127A but not YAP-WT does restore formation of the actin ring in the presence of CK666. Accordingly, we added text changes in our Results and Discussion section suggesting a reciprocal signaling circuit of actin filament remodeling being both upstream and downstream of active nuclear-localized YAP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors found that a ring of actin filaments at the colony periphery was characteristic of the naive hESCs. However, because all the data are presented as an image of a single confocal section, the 3D organization of the actin filaments is not clear. Although the authors drew a scheme for this actin ring being located in the apical domain of polarized cells, such data have not been provided in the manuscript. Since naive hESCs form dome-like colonies, it is important to show the 3D organization of actin filaments in the colony. 3D reconstruction of confocal microscopy images of the naive hESC colonies is required to show the relationship between actin filaments, adherens junctions, and the nuclei (as a reference for the Z axis). If 3D reconstruction is not technically possible, confocal images at different Z levels and maximum projection images should be obtained and provided.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, our revision includes new 3D images (Figure S1E) of the actin ring generated by using Imaris software (Oxford Instruments), which we previously used to show 3D images of mitochondrial morphology (PMID: 34038242). We found this analysis demonstrated the difficulty in determining exact positional organization in regard to the actin filaments, adherens junctions, and nuclei. From these new data we are confident in our conclusion that the actin fence surrounds naïve colonies and is present in cells at the colony periphery. We agree with the reviewer that our previous statements on the 3D organization and positional information regarding the actin fence is insufficiently demonstrated by our current data to be confident in those conclusions. As such we have omitted the scheme, which implied a specific 3D organization, and have removed any comments on the relative organization aside from its location in cells on naïve colony boarders from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the statistical analyses were inappropriate. The authors have used Student's t-test for all analyses; however, one-way ANOVA and post-hoc analysis must be used to compare three or more groups (Figures 2B, D, E, 3G, 4B, D, E).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, all relevant statistical analyses have been repeated using ANOVA and post-hoc analysis. Figure legends and methods have been updated to reflect this where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments 3.</p><p>Page 9, second paragraph. In the Discussion section, authors have written that &quot;Cells within the ICM of mouse blastocysts exclude YAP from the nucleus whereas cells within the ICM of human blastocysts maintain nuclear YAP.&quot; However, a recent study has reported that the ICM/epiblast of mouse late blastocysts also express nuclear YAP. Epiblast Formation by TEAD-YAP-Dependent Expression of Pluripotency Factors and Competitive Elimination of Unspecified Cells. Hashimoto M, Sasaki H. Dev Cell. 2019, 50:139-154.e5. doi: 10.1016/j.devcel.2019.05.024.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for alerting us to this publication. Results in this publication are in agreement with the statement we made in our Discussion section regarding the cellular localization of YAP in murine blastocysts at the relevant time point. Naïve stem cells are isolated from murine blastocysts at E3.5. This publication, as well as previous publications from this group (Hirate et al., 2012, Nishioka et al., 2009), find that YAP is excluded from cells within the ICM at this time point. In the citation provided by the reviewer, Figure 2 provides confirmation of previous data showing that cells within the ICM of E3.5 mouse blastocysts exclude YAP from the nucleus.</p><p>We note, however, that fundamental misunderstandings of the literature occur based on differences in cell models. Mouse naïve stem cells are isolated from the ICM of murine embryos at E3.5 and are distinctly different that clonal hESCs used in our study. The publication indicated by the reviewer, when carefully evaluated, agrees with our findings and conclusions in indicating “However, we previously showed that in the ICM of early blastocyst stage embryos, active Hippo signaling inactivated TEAD proteins by excluding YAP from the nuclei (Hirate et al., 2012, Nishioka et al., 2009).” Their final figure (Figure 7) also shows this in a diagram with E3.5 of YAP excluded from the nucleus. These E3.5 cells are where mouse naïve stem cells come from, and thus represent to the best of our knowledge the most appropriate comparison with the cells we used in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many of their conclusions seem to be based on the qualitative analysis of a single image (e.g. Figures 1D-G, Figure 2G, Supplementary Figure 2). The authors should provide quantitative information regarding these analyses and indicate the number of cells/replicas collected for each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, our revision includes quantitative data where feasible. We now include additional quantification of <italic>Sox2</italic>/Oct4 double positive cells to ensure pluripotency and quantification of EdU+ cells for assessing proliferation. Our data demonstrating co-localization of pMLC and βcatenin are from at least 3 separate cell preparations, as we indicate. Additionally, in the field, traction force microscopy is not commonly quantified beyond including scale bars, which our original manuscript shows. These experiments were also completed in triplicate, with representative data shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many of the images seem to require a flat-field correction. Could the authors check that the illumination is homogeneous? This artifact could affect the data analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>In response, the spinning disk microscopes we used for all images are equipped with a Borealis that provides uniformity of illumination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The actin ring surrounding hESCs colonies was previously described by Närvä et al. Although the authors cited this previous work, they do not discuss in deep the differences and similarities with their observations.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we added additional comments relative to the findings in Närvä et al., which was included as a citation in our original manuscript. These new comments in the Results and Discussion section describe differences between our findings and those of Närvä et al., including that we observe an actin filament ring only in the naïve state of pluripotency, whereas Närvä et al. observe a related actin architecture in the primed state. However, Närvä et al. use induced pluripotent stem cells, which are proposed to be closer to naïve pluripotency than primed stem cells as conventionally isolated and maintained (see PMID: 27424783 and PMID: 19497275). Additionally, we observe that the contractile actin ring in naïve pluripotent stem cells is in a higher z-plane than reported by Närvä et al., although a direct comparison is difficult to make. Moreover, we retain our original comparison, which indicated “A similar actin ring is reported to encircle colonies of clonal human pluripotent stem cells to provide a mechanosensitive element linked to focal adhesions (Närvä citation). The actin filament ring we observed around naïve hESC colonies was instead tethered to adherens junctions, as indicated by co-labeling for β-catenin.” Our findings, however, are in agreement with those in Närvä et al., in showing that a colony of pluripotent stem cells exist as a cohesive unit with a contractile actin architecture at the colony periphery with a less mechanical interior. Although Närvä et al., do not link their actin phenotype to functional pluripotency, they do demonstrate that interference with mechanosensing proteins within hESCs alters the state of pluripotency and subsequent differentiation potential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are many experimental details missing that are extremely relevant to fully understand the experiments and evaluate the robustness of the analyses (e.g., microscopy setup, fluorescent probes used for immunostaining, incubation conditions with the inhibitors SMIFH2 and CK666).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, our revision addresses this comment by including additions when indicated in the Methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The qualitative observation of Figure 3F suggests a lower overall YAP levels in primed and +CK666 cells in comparison to naive cells. Could the authors check if this is correct and, if this is the case, explain the observation?</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we include new data on immunoblotting for total YAP in lysates from primed, naïve, and +CK666 treated cells in Supplementary Figure 3. These indicate that YAP abundance is largely the same, with some variability in the total amount of YAP in +CK666 treated cells. We conclude from these data that the importance of YAP in naïve pluripotency is its cellular localization and not total abundance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should discuss deeper the rationale of the pan-ERM immunostaining experiments (since they used the individual antibodies afterwards) and provide a brief discussion of their results and, in particular, the colocalization with moesin but not with ezrin or radixin.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in our response to Review 1 comment 2, data on ERM immunolabeling is omitted in our revision in lieu of requested new data with cortactin immunolabeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Introduction makes the reader think that actin is the only cytoskeletal network involved in embryo development and stem cell properties.

Specifically, why they studied DNMT3L, DPPA3, KLF2, and KLF4 (Figure 1B) and the different set PECAM1, ESRRB, KLF4, and DNMT3L in Figure 2B.</p></disp-quote><p>We selected naïve pluripotency markers based on a number of sources studying the transcriptional regulation and differences in human naïve pluripotency (PMID: 28429706, PMID: 30673604, PMID: 29129686, and PMID: 37106060). Broadly speaking, we chose markers consistent across multiple reports as markers of human naïve pluripotency. Additionally, we chose markers of interest to many in the field, such as ESRRB, which has been reported to facilitate transition of human naïve pluripotent stem cells through a state of pluripotency called formative pluripotency. Additionally, we chose markers such as DPPA3 and DNMT3L due to their role in epigenetics, which is also of relevant interest to the field. Lastly, KLF2 and KLF4 are classical markers of naïve pluripotency and have been well established to facilitate that state. To facilitate comparison, we have adjusted Figure 1B and Figure 2B to use the same markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 1G and 2G, please include the images of the colonies.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, phase contrast images are now included for Fig1G in Figure S1D and for Figure 2G in Figure S2E.</p></body></sub-article></article>
