When motivation for food-seeking competes with avoidance of danger, the PFC likely plays a role in selecting the optimal choice. In platform-mediated active avoidance, rats avoid a tone-signaled footshock by stepping onto a nearby platform, delaying access to sucrose pellets. This avoidance requires prelimbic (PL) PFC, basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral striatum (VS). We previously showed that inhibitory tone responses of PL neurons correlate with avoidability of shock (Diehl et al., 2018). Here, we optogenetically modulated PL terminals in VS and BLA to identify PL outputs regulating avoidance. Photoactivating PL-VS projections reduced avoidance, whereas photoactivating PL-BLA projections increased avoidance. Moreover, photosilencing PL-BLA or BLA-VS projections reduced avoidance, suggesting that VS receives opposing inputs from PL and BLA. Bidirectional modulation of avoidance by PL projections to VS and BLA enables the animal to make appropriate decisions when faced with competing drives.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>channelrhodopsin</kwd><kwd>Archaerhodopsin</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-MH105185</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diehl</surname><given-names>Maria M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-MH058883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quirk</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50-MH106435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quirk</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Puerto Rico President's Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Quirk</surname><given-names>Gregory J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25-GM097635</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iravedra-Garcia</surname><given-names>Jorge M</given-names></name><name><surname>Valentín-Valentín</surname><given-names>Viviana P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R25-GM061151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gonzalez-Diaz</surname><given-names>Fabiola N</given-names></name><name><surname>Morán-Sierra</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T34-GM007821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rojas-Bowe</surname><given-names>Gabriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Projections from the prelimbic prefrontal cortex targeting the ventral striatum or the basolateral amygdala bidirectionally regulate platform-mediated active avoidance in rats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) controls goal-directed behaviors by integrating sensory, motor, and memory information to guide an individual’s actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fuster, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kesner and Churchwell, 2011</xref>).

We interpreted this as inhibitory responses in PL signaling the avoidability of the tone-predicted shock. Opposing these inhibitory responses by photoactivating PL at the baseline rate of 4 Hz impaired avoidance. Because PL projects densely to the VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sesack et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vertes, 2004</xref>), we hypothesized that inhibitory responses in PL neurons projecting to the VS would promote avoidance.

We found that photoactivation of PL-VS projections impaired avoidance, whereas photoactivation of PL-BLA projections promoted avoidance, suggesting a prefrontal circuit that bidirectionally modulates avoidance behavior. Optogenetic manipulations of BLA-VS projections also revealed that VS receives excitation from the BLA to promote avoidance. These findings add to the growing body of studies showing prefrontal control of active avoidance.</p><p>Our results show that photosilencing of the PL-VS circuit had no effect on avoidance, a result which is at odds with our hypothesis that such a manipulation would increase avoidance. One possibility is that a ceiling effect prevented us from observing an increase in avoidance, as we had observed in our initial study when PL somata were photosilenced (see Figure 2E in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diehl et al., 2018</xref>). A second possibility is that some of the optic probes for our ArchT PL-VS experiments ended up targeting the shell rather than the core of the VS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), possibly suppressing any effect of our PL-VS manipulation. Anatomical studies show that the PL-VS projection targets the core region of the VS, whereas PL-BLA projection targets the shell region of the VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heimer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gorelova and Yang, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zahm, 2000</xref>). Thus, photosilencing PL-VS fibers with the approach we used may have inadvertently photosilenced fibers of passage from PL to BLA, which could cancel out facilitating effects, as photosilencing PL-BLA decreases avoidance. To overcome these challenges, future studies using a recombinase-dependent viral vector to exclusively target PL-VS projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>) are needed to confirm the effects of photosilencing this projection.</p><p>Despite the lack of effect of photosilencing PL-VS projections, we did observe that photoactivating PL-VS projections impaired avoidance. This is in agreement with our previous findings that photoactivation of PL somata impaired avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diehl et al., 2018</xref>), and provides indirect evidence that PL inhibition facilitates avoidance. This suggests that the inhibitory tone response in PL targets the VS to drive avoidance. In contrast, we found that excitatory projections from PL to BLA drive avoidance (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Future studies using PMA could determine if PL neurons showing inhibitory tone responses project to VS, and if PL neurons showing excitatory responses project to BLA by employing photoexcitation-assisted identification of neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgos-Robles et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Suggested circuit for bidirectional modulation of avoidance by PL.</title><p>Activity in PL projections to VS decreases avoidance (top left projection).

PL-VS projections were shown to promote reward-seeking, whereas PL-thalamic projections inhibited reward-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Otis et al., 2017</xref>). A study of decision making demonstrated that PL dopamine (D2) neurons targeting the BLA signaled the probability of receiving a reward, whereas PL dopamine (D1) neurons targeting the VS signaled the probability of reward omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jenni et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, a probabilistic reversal learning task investigating the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) found that OFC-VS projections were necessary for using negative outcomes to guide choices, whereas OFC-amygdala projections were necessary for stabilizing the value of actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Groman et al., 2019</xref>). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that bidirectional control of behavior can be governed by specific circuits within PFC, allowing for the selection of the appropriate behavioral response.</p><p>A previous study using the shuttle-box avoidance task reported that pre-training lesions in VS enhance avoidance responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lichtenberg et al., 2014</xref>), which disagrees with the current study. However, successful avoidance was measured on the 7<sup>th</sup> day of training after lesions were made, introducing the possibility that other structures compensated for the loss of VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anglada-Figueroa and Quirk, 2005</xref>), thereby forcing an alternative circuit to acquire the task. Moreover, the lesion approach cannot identify which inputs to VS may be responsible for enhancing avoidance. Another shuttle-box avoidance study showed that disconnecting BLA from VS impaired avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramirez et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings extend this by showing that the activity of BLA terminals within VS is necessary for avoidance. A subset of BLA neurons projecting to VS have been shown to receive inputs from PL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGarry and Carter, 2017</xref>), consistent with our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Here, we propose that PL bidirectionally controls active avoidance by modulating the effect of BLA inputs to VS, through activation of BLA and/or feed-forward inhibition of VS, perhaps via fast-spiking interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berke, 2011</xref>). In PMA, PL driving of avoidance may be most pronounced during the early part of the tone, as pharmacological inactivation of PL delays but does not prevent avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diehl et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that BLA projections to VS may override feed-forward inhibition from PL to VS, as the tone progresses and there is increased urgency to avoid.</p><p>The rodent PL is thought to be homologous to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bicks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heilbronner et al., 2016</xref>). Neuroimaging studies have found that decreased activity in dACC correlates with the predictability of an aversive stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wood et al., 2015</xref>) and the avoidance of a threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aupperle et al., 2015</xref>). In the latter case, decreased activation of dACC was accompanied by increased activation of VS. Another study showed increased coupling between dACC and amygdala during active avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate bidirectional control of active avoidance by dACC and are consistent with PL in rodents guiding appropriate action during the tone (lever pressing vs. moving to the platform).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>)</td><td>AAV5:CaMKIIα::hChR2(H134R)-eYFP</td><td>UNC vector core</td><td>channelrhodopsin <break/>(ChR2)</td><td>Serotype 5; <break/>4 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/mL</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Aequorea victoria</italic>)</td><td>AAV5:CaMKIIα::eYFP</td><td>UNC vector core</td><td>Enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP)</td><td>Serotype 5; 3 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/mL</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Halorubrum sodomense)</italic></td><td>AAV5:CaMKIIα::eArchT3.0-eYFP</td><td>UNC vector core</td><td>Archaerhodopsin (ArchT)</td><td>Serotype 5; 4 × 10<sup>12</sup> particles/mL</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>ANY-Maze behavioral software</td><td>Stoelting</td><td>ANY-Maze</td><td>Woodale, IL</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>118 adult male Sprague Dawley rats (Envigo Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) aged 3–5 months and weighing 320–420 g were housed and handled as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diehl et al., 2018</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Geoffrey Schoenbaum as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael A McDannald (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors follow up a prior report showing that inhibitory activity in PL was necessary for PMA behavior. While the prior report provided evidence using optogenetic manipulations that the novel inhibitory activity was likely involved in the avoidance behavior, the current study extends that to show that this apparently simple relationship is more complex, involving projections to BLA and VS and also from BLA to VS. Specifically, they show that activating (inhibiting) projections from PL-&gt;BLA or from BLA-&gt;VS promotes (suppresses) PMA. Further they show that activating projections from PL-&gt;VS suppresses avoidance; interestingly inhibiting these projections did not cause increased avoidance.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Both reviewers thought the work was elegant in its design and execution and the results were for the most part very clear. The main issue is the discrepancy between the prior result, that inhibition of activity in some PL neurons is necessary to drive PMA, and the failure to clearly demonstrate this effect at terminals downstream in either BLA or VS. This seems to be a key finding that the authors were looking for but did not find, but the discussion and model at the end are presented without commenting on this missing result. This was noted by both reviewers, and on discussion was agreed to be important to address. We are happy to have this addressed with textual changes for now, and the reviews note a variety of reasons this might have occurred. If the authors could consider these and any others they think are worthwhile clearly in the Discussion, and implications for their functional model, that should do it.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>Some clarification regarding the role of inhibitory activity in PL versus at the terminals in VS, BLA and maybe other areas is needed to resolve the discrepancy described above and in reviews.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors follow up a prior report showing that inhibitory activity in PL was necessary for PMA behavior. While the prior report provided evidence using optogenetic manipulations that the novel inhibitory activity was likely involved in the avoidance behavior, the current study extends that to show that this apparently simple relationship is more complex, involving projections to BLA and VS and also from BLA to VS. Specifically, they show that activating (inhibiting) projections from PL-&gt;BLA or from BLA-&gt;VS promotes (suppresses) PMA. Further they show that activating projections from PL-&gt;VS suppresses avoidance; interestingly inhibiting these projections did not cause increased avoidance.</p><p>Generally, these results seem very straightforward and clear. The bidirectional effects are striking, and the work is nicely done and very clean. However I am bothered a bit by what seems to me to be a lack of consistency with the prior report, which is not addressed. Though it is also possible that I simply missed it. Depending on which it is, the authors can likely fix it in the text or straighten me out.</p><p>So the issue is this – the prior report claimed that the inhibitory correlates in PL were the unique and prime mover in supporting avoidance. Yet here they fail to find any such effect of inhibition of the downstream terminals. In BLA, inhibition of PL terminals disrupts avoidance and in VS inhibition has no effect. Further they find that activation of output from PL to both areas plays a role in modulating the PMA, which somewhat contradicts the assertation that such activity playing the same role in PMA as in other fear and extinction related procedures.</p><p>My own suspicion is that the lack of effects of inhibition in Figure 1F-H is due to a ceiling effect, and that if they had trained the rats more lightly or had extinguished as done in Figures 2 and 3, then they would have found that inhibition of the PL-&gt;VS pathway does support PMA. Such data would resolve the seeming inconsistency and, coupled with a more clear discussion of what the effects of activation mean for interpreting the excitatory responses, make more sense to me than the current interpretation, which seems to mostly ignore the issue.</p><p>The other possibility to me is that inhibiting across the entire tone is not the same as the neural suppression in some of the neurons at the time of the tone, in which case their approach is not well designed to mimic the correlates.</p><p>Of course as I said I may simply not understand how the data all fit together. If this is the case, the authors can clarify it for me. If this is not the case, then I think the failure to find the site where inhibitory PL activity facilitates PMA is a problem for the clean story of bidirectional control the authors want to paint. I am more than happy to have it addressed in the text if the authors want to do this, noting the above caveats and modifying how things are discussed. As I said, I think it is likely an unfortunate ceiling effect. Or the authors could do this experiment if they do not want to fix it textually, but I this is not something I'd require. This is really my only substantive issue with an otherwise very elegant set of results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an elegant series of studies that builds up on Diehl and colleagues prior publication. The rationale for the circuits investigated is clear. The experiments were well designed, executed and interpreted. The results are an important contribution to an emerging literature for the neural circuits supporting avoidance learning.</p><p>1) Like the authors, I was a little surprised to see that photoinhibition of PL terminals in the VS did not promote avoidance behavior. I think this null effect warrants more discussion. Looking at the histology in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, it appears that the optical placements for photo-inhibition were ventral to those for photoexcitation. So perhaps photoexcitation more effectively stimulated the accumbens core, whereas photoinhibition targeted the accumbens shell. Also clear is that the PL -&gt; VS projections are extensive. Might it be the case that photoinhibition only targeted a small percentage of PL fibers, a number insufficient to facilitate avoidance? To this second point, the Sabitini lab has developed means of sharpening ferrules to achieve greater light diffusion: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5533215/.</p><p>2) The use of the term ventral striatum is warranted here, as both the PL and BLA target the shell and core subregions of the nucleus accumbens. Moving forward, it will likely be important to acknowledge and examine dissociable roles for the core and shell in avoidance. The authors rightly discuss the Ramirez study examining core.

While the prior report provided evidence using optogenetic manipulations that the novel inhibitory activity was likely involved in the avoidance behavior, the current study extends that to show that this apparently simple relationship is more complex, involving projections to BLA and VS and also from BLA to VS. Specifically, they show that activating (inhibiting) projections from PL-&gt;BLA or from BLA-&gt;VS promotes (suppresses) PMA. Further they show that activating projections from PL-&gt;VS suppresses avoidance; interestingly inhibiting these projections did not cause increased avoidance.</p><p>Generally, these results seem very straightforward and clear. The bidirectional effects are striking, and the work is nicely done and very clean. However I am bothered a bit by what seems to me to be a lack of consistency with the prior report, which is not addressed. Though it is also possible that I simply missed it. Depending on which it is, the authors can likely fix it in the text or straighten me out.</p><p>So the issue is this – the prior report claimed that the inhibitory correlates in PL were the unique and prime mover in supporting avoidance. Yet here they fail to find any such effect of inhibition of the downstream terminals. In BLA, inhibition of PL terminals disrupts avoidance and in VS inhibition has no effect. Further they find that activation of output from PL to both areas plays a role in modulating the PMA, which somewhat contradicts the assertation that such activity playing the same role in PMA as in other fear and extinction related procedures.</p><p>My own suspicion is that the lack of effects of inhibition in Figure 1F-H is due to a ceiling effect, and that if they had trained the rats more lightly or had extinguished as done in Figures 2 and 3, then they would have found that inhibition of the PL-&gt;VS pathway does support PMA. Such data would resolve the seeming inconsistency and, coupled with a more clear discussion of what the effects of activation mean for interpreting the excitatory responses, make more sense to me than the current interpretation, which seems to mostly ignore the issue.</p><p>The other possibility to me is that inhibiting across the entire tone is not the same as the neural suppression in some of the neurons at the time of the tone, in which case their approach is not well designed to mimic the correlates.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that photo-silencing PL projections for 30 sec is not equivalent to mimicking inhibitory tone responses in PL, since there is great variability in the duration of inhibition among these neurons. Rather, we are interested in how the overall inhibition of the PL-VS projection across the entire tone drives avoidance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Of course as I said I may simply not understand how the data all fit together. If this is the case, the authors can clarify it for me. If this is not the case, then I think the failure to find the site where inhibitory PL activity facilitates PMA is a problem for the clean story of bidirectional control the authors want to paint. I am more than happy to have it addressed in the text if the authors want to do this, noting the above caveats and modifying how things are discussed. As I said, I think it is likely an unfortunate ceiling effect. Or the authors could do this experiment if they do not want to fix it textually, but I this is not something I'd require. This is really my only substantive issue with an otherwise very elegant set of results.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to point out that the lack of effect of silencing PL-VS appears to be inconsistent with our original report (Diehl, et al., 2018) and was not dealt with directly in the previous version of the manuscript. We have updated the text in the Discussion to address this point and mention the possibility of: 1) a ceiling effect, 2) fibers of passage from PL to BLA that may have been inadvertently silenced when silencing PL-VS projections, and 3) variation in our optic probe placement affecting our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an elegant series of studies that builds up on Diehl and colleagues prior publication. The rationale for the circuits investigated is clear. The experiments were well designed, executed and interpreted. The results are an important contribution to an emerging literature for the neural circuits supporting avoidance learning.</p><p>1) Like the authors, I was a little surprised to see that photoinhibition of PL terminals in the VS did not promote avoidance behavior. I think this null effect warrants more discussion. Looking at the histology in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, it appears that the optical placements for photo-inhibition were ventral to those for photoexcitation. So perhaps photoexcitation more effectively stimulated the accumbens core, whereas photoinhibition targeted the accumbens shell. Also clear is that the PL -&gt; VS projections are extensive. Might it be the case that photoinhibition only targeted a small percentage of PL fibers, a number insufficient to facilitate avoidance? To this second point, the Sabitini lab has developed means of sharpening ferrules to achieve greater light diffusion: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5533215/.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-examined the optical probe placements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> with individual data points labeled, from Figure 1G) and some of these placements indeed targeted the shell, rather than the core for our PL-VS experiments. Rats with optical probes that targeted the shell region showed lower avoidance compared to most of the rats with optical probes targeting the core region. We mention this caveat in the Discussion. We also thank the reviewer for the reference on how to improve our ferrules to achieve greater light illumination for our future studies.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59281-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The use of the term ventral striatum is warranted here, as both the PL and BLA target the shell and core subregions of the nucleus accumbens. Moving forward, it will likely be important to acknowledge and examine dissociable roles for the core and shell in avoidance. The authors rightly discuss the Ramirez study examining core. Some discussion of the finding by Lichtenberg et al., 2014 is warranted and could be the basis of a more specific discussion of core vs. shell.</p></disp-quote><p>The study by Lichtenberg et al., 2014 reported that pre-training lesions in VS enhance avoidance responses in the shuttle task. However, successful avoidance was measured on the 7th day of training after lesions were made, introducing the possibility that other brain structures are likely compensating for the loss of VS (Anglada-Figueroa and Quirk, 2005), thereby forcing an alternative circuit to acquire the task. Moreover, the lesion approach cannot tell us which inputs to VS may be responsible for enhancing avoidance. We now mention this study in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On discussion, the reviewer's felt that the paper presents enough new data and is enough at odds with the prior report that it would be better presented as a new article than as a straightforward Research Advance follow up.
