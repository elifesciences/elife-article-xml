potassium channel is regulated by co-assembly with KCNE auxiliary subunits. KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels generate the slow delayed rectifier current, I<sub>Ks</sub>, which contributes to the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. A three amino acid motif (F57-T58-L59, FTL) in KCNE1 is essential for slow activation of KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels. However, how this motif interacts with KCNQ1 to control its function is unknown. Combining computational modeling with electrophysiological studies, we developed structural models of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex that suggest how KCNE1 controls KCNQ1 activation. The FTL motif binds at a cleft between the voltage-sensing and pore domains and appears to affect the channel gate by an allosteric mechanism. Comparison with the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel structure suggests a common transmembrane-binding mode for different KCNEs and illuminates how specific differences in the interaction of their triplet motifs determine the profound differences in KCNQ1 functional modulation by KCNE1 versus KCNE3.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KCNQ1</kwd><kwd>KCNE1</kwd><kwd>long QT syndrome</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated potassium ion channel</kwd><kwd>Rosetta</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics simulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL122010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanders</surname><given-names>Charles R</given-names></name><name><surname>George</surname><given-names>Alfred L</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Meiler</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM080403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meiler</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18POST34080422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuenze</surname><given-names>Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KU 3510/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuenze</surname><given-names>Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1423/421152132</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meiler</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM065086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>Eli F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008320</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brewer</surname><given-names>Kathryn R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An integrative structural biology approach provides refined models of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel complex, which propose a new mechanism to explain how KCNE1 modulates KCNQ1 channel activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> (K<sub>V</sub>) channels facilitate the movement of K<sup>+</sup> ions across the lipid bilayer in response to membrane depolarization and are essential for signaling in electrically excitable tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jan and Jan, 2012</xref>). Among K<sub>V</sub> channels, KCNQ1 (K<sub>V</sub>7.1, K<sub>V</sub>LQT1) is special because of its wide range of physiological behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott, 2014</xref>). This versatility enables KCNQ1 to function distinctly in both excitable cells such as cardiomyocytes and in non-excitable cells such as epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott, 2014</xref>). The functional diversity of KCNQ1 is a consequence of its ability to form channel complexes with any one of five tissue-specific KCNE auxiliary proteins (KCNE1-5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schroeder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tinel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Teng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelo et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>KCNQ1 channels consist of four identical pore-forming subunits, each containing six membrane-spanning segments (S1-S6) and a pore loop (P loop) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The centrally located pore domain (PD, S5-P-S6) forms the ion permeation pathway and is surrounded by four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs, S1-S4). The VSD S4 helix carries positively charged residues that trigger S4 movement upon membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bezanilla, 2000</xref>), leading to three detectable VSD conformational states in KCNQ1 (resting, intermediate, andÂ activated) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Panaghie and Abbott, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zaydman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>).

However, a clear structural explanation is lacking owing to the absence of a high-resolution structure for the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex. Previously, low-resolution spatial restraints for the KCNQ1-KCNE1 interaction were derived from disulfide crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), metal ion bridging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tapper and George, 2001</xref>), and site-directed mutagenesis data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In conjunction with computational modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2008</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gofman et al., 2012</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), these restraints have provided initial insight into the KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel architecture. Those models suggested that KCNE1 binds in a cleft surrounded by two VSDs and the PD, and is therefore in a location where it can simultaneously modulate S4 and the channel gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gofman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Additional studies have determined sites in KCNE1 that are crucial for its functional modulation of KCNQ1. Specifically, a three amino acid motif (F57-T58-L59, FTL) in the middle of the KCNE1 TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was found to be necessary for induction of slow activation of KCNQ1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melman et al., 2001</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melman et al., 2002</xref>). Replacement of the corresponding segment in KCNE3 (T71-V72-G73, TVG) with FTL confers KCNE1-like gating properties onto the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melman et al., 2002</xref>). Likewise, mutation of FTL to TVG renders the KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel similar to KCNQ1-KCNE3, in that faster activation at more negative potentials is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melman et al., 2001</xref>). How this so-called âactivation motifâ determines the distinct gating properties of KCNQ1-KCNE channels is unclear. Mutations of residues in S6 (S338, F339, F340) alter the effect of mutations in the activation motif and vice versa, which was interpreted as a consequence of direct physical interaction between KCNE1 and S6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Panaghie et al., 2006</xref>). However, this idea has been challenged recently, because these S6 residues reside deep within the PD in the KCNQ1 structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sun and MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>) and cysteine exchange experiments failed to confirm disulfide bond formation with any of the residues in the activation motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we combined computational protein-protein docking, molecular dynamics, and electrophysiology to develop refined molecular models for the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex to address the question of how the KCNE1 TMD modulates activation gating. Our results suggest that the KCNE1 FTL motif interacts with sites in S1, S4, and S5 in KCNQ1, and affects the channel gate by an allosteric network involving the S5-S6 interface. Comparison of independentlyÂ constructed KCNQ1-KCNE1 models with the recently determined structures of the KCNQ1-KCNE3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>) shows a conserved TMD-binding mode for KCNE1 and KCNE3, but reveals specific differences in the interaction of the activation motif with the channel, consistent with the different effects of these KCNE proteins on channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>). Our results provide more precise information on the state-specific structural requirements and specificity of KCNE subunit interactions with KCNQ1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Probing the spatial proximity of KCNQ1 V141 and I274 to KCNE1</title><p>For building KCNQ1-KCNE1 models, we collected residue contact restraints from previously published biophysical experiments on the KCNQ1-KCNE1 interaction: disulfide crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), Cd(II)-cysteine bridging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tapper and George, 2001</xref>), and double mutant cycle analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>).

For three of those mutations (V141M, I274V, V307L) a gain-of-function phenotype is observed only when KCNE1 is present, suggesting a physical interaction. Indeed, in cysteine exchange experiments, V141C was previously shown to crosslink with residues flanking the KCNE1 TMD on the extracellular side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2012</xref>).

In contrast, channels formed by co-expression of KCNQ1 V141C with KCNE1 L48C exhibited smaller current amplitude under reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), indicating that disulfide bond formation between V141C and L48C favored the open state.

The N-terminal end of the KCNE1 TMD leans towards S1, S5, and S6, and its C-terminal end contacts S1 and the bottom of S4. The FTL motif resides deep in the membrane and is oriented toward KCNQ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B+C</xref>). In the AO model, the KCNE1 TMD C-terminus forms additional interactions with the cytosolic end of S6, which is kinked toward the membrane. Those interactions are absent in the RC model, in which S6 extends more vertically into the cytoplasm. Other than these small differences, the KCNE1 TMD-binding mode within the RC and AO KCNQ1 channel is deemed similar.</p><p>The KCNQ1-KCNE1 models satisfied the experimental restraints remarkably well. Many of the restrained KCNQ1-KCNE1 CÎ±-CÎ± distances were below the upper cutoff (12 Ã) employed in docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and came close to the expected maximal CÎ±-CÎ± crosslinking distance (disulfide: 7â8 Ã, cysteine-Cd(II)-cysteine: 10â11 Ã) when considering dynamics in the protein model by conducting MD simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1Â â Table 2 and 3</xref>). Only one medium restraint violation (3.5 Ã) and two large restraint violations (&gt;5 Ã) were observed in the RC model. The restraint with the medium violation involved residues KCNE1 L45 and KCNQ1 I274. It is possible that crosslinking between these cysteine-substituted sites slightly perturbed the KCNQ1-KCNE1 structure leading to a low-conductance closed-like state, which could explain why in the WT channel model these residue sidechains have suboptimal geometry for disulfide bond formation. The two largest violations involved pairs of residues originally believed to be in direct contact based on results of double mutant cycle experiments: KCNE1 T58âKCNQ1 F340 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>) and KCNE1 Y65âKCNQ1 A344 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>).

Satisfying either of the two restraints would require hard-to-rationalize conformational changes in KCNE1 and/or KCNQ1. Moreover, Xu and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2013</xref>) confirmed previously that the FTL motif residues are unable to form disulfide bonds with S338, F339, or F340 in KCNQ1, suggesting that energetic coupling between those KCNQ1-KCNE1 residue pairs is mediated by allosteric networks rather than a direct interaction.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mapping of experimental distance restraint sites onto the KCNQ1-KCNE1 models.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Interaction of KCNE1 with the KCNQ1 RC and AO model in the transmembrane region.

We therefore used electrophysiology to experimentally confirm an interaction with KCNE1. Substitution of Y267 with Phe, which maintains the aromatic sidechain character but lacks a hydroxyl group, resulted in a significant alteration of the voltage-dependence of KCNQ1-KCNE1 activation (ÎV<sub>1/2app,Y267F</sub> = 13.5 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D+E</xref>).

The latter interaction may specifically contribute to the stability of the open state by reducing the dynamics of S6 and locking the S6 gate open. To test this hypothesis, we introduced Ala mutations at K362 and N365 in S6, and determined the effect on the voltage-dependence of KCNQ1 activation.

A proximity between the C-terminal ends of the KCNE1 TMD and S6 is supported by the results of cysteine-crosslinking experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lvov et al., 2010</xref>), which showed that H363C in KCNQ1 formed disulfide bonds with H73C, S74C, and D76C in KCNE1. While these residues were not included in our docking because of their location in a flexible linker region, they are close to the last KCNE1 residue in our models. Extending the models by five additional KCNE1 residues can bring H73, S74, and D76 in contact with H363 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, using double mutant cycle analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2020</xref> recently suggested that H73, S74, and D76 can interact with another residue on S6, I368.

Residues withÂ &gt;20% ÎSASA are partially or fully buried in the KCNQ1-KCNE1 interface and expected to be more sensitive to mutation. We observed a fairly good match between the pattern of KCNE1 interface positions (in both the RC and AO model) and the location of high-impact mutation sites (according to a |ÎV<sub>1/2</sub>| threshold criterion; see legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). 87% (14/16) of the high impact mutation sites in KCNE1 were located at the interface with KCNQ1 (ÎSASAÂ &gt;20%), and 71% (5/7) of the positions with low impact on channel activation were solvent-exposed (ÎSASAÂ &lt;20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, there is a clear dependence between KCNQ1-contact sites and high-impact mutation sites in KCNE1 for the orientation proposed by the structural models (p&lt;0.05, Ï<sup>2</sup>-test). However, no significant correlation was found when we simulated other hypothetical orientations for KCNE1 by rotation around its helical screw axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This result and the following in-depth mutational analysis of selected KCNE1 residues support the model-predicted binding mode for KCNE1.</p><p>Mutation of Y46 to Ala and Leu produced channels that were activated at more negative potentials (ÎV<sub>1/2app,Y46A</sub> = -36.3 mV, ÎV<sub>1/2app,Y46L</sub> = -27.7 mV) and had faster activation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left panel). These data suggest that mutating Y46 destabilized the closed state. This observation resembles the mutational phenotype for KCNQ1 W323 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In our structural model, W323 and Y46 are in direct contact, which can explain why mutations at either position perturb KCNQ1-KCNE1 function in a similar manner. Simultaneous substitution of both W323 and Y46 with Ala led to a channel with almost complete loss of current, which prohibited us from confirming this interaction by double mutant cycle analysis. Substituting W323 or Y46 with Phe, however, maintained WT-like channel properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>), which suggests that an aromatic or large hydrophobic sidechain is a sufficient structural property required for interaction between these residues. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the sidechain properties at Y46 also influence ion conduction through the KCNQ1-KCNE1 pore, as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2013</xref>. Small amino acids (Gly, Cys) and positively charged sidechain modifications (Cys-MTSET) increased the conductance of Cs<sup>+</sup> relative to K<sup>+</sup>, whereas aromatic amino acids (Phe, Trp) did not significantly change the Cs/K conductance ratio compared to WT KCNE1. The position of Y46 in our structural models seems well suited to control this effect, and sidechain volume may influence the steric pressure on the nearby P helix to increase or restrict the conductance of larger Cs<sup>+</sup> ions through the selectivity filter.</p><p>Mutations at F57 and Y65 also had a significant impact on KCNQ1-KCNE1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Mutations F57A and F57L produced channels that opened at more negative voltages (ÎV<sub>1/2app,F57A</sub> = -5.8 mV, ÎV<sub>1/2app,F57L</sub> = -17.7 mV) with faster kinetics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1Â âÂ TableÂ 6</xref>). Mutations at Y65 led to a shift of V<sub>1/2app</sub> to more positive voltages (ÎV<sub>1/2app,Y65A</sub> = 4.3 mV, ÎV<sub>1/2app,Y65L</sub> = 12.3 mV, ÎV<sub>1/2app,Y65F</sub> = 9.4 mV), and Y65L and Y65A showed faster activation and deactivation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right panel). This is consistent with the observation of Y65 forming sidechain packing and hydrogen bond interactions with multiple KCNQ1 residues in the MD simulations. Mutation I66A, while failing to meet our threshold criterion (|ÎV<sub>1/2app</sub>| &gt;10 mV) to be considered a high impact mutation site, still induced a significant change in activation voltage-dependence compared to WT (ÎV<sub>1/2app,I66A</sub> = 8.2 mV, p&lt;0.001), consistent with the interface location of this residue. In contrast, mutations at F56 and L63 failed to produce significant functional perturbations, as expected from their lipid-exposed positions.</p><p>Taken together, these results have identified several KCNE1 residues that interact with KCNQ1.

A hydroxylated amino acid at the middle position of this motif was previously found to be necessary for this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melman et al., 2002</xref>). Replacement of FTL with TVG from KCNE3 shifts the G(V) curve of KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels towards that of KCNQ1-KCNE3 and removes KCNE1-specific effects on the gate and S4 movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>).

However, later studies have failed to confirm a direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Our refined models of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex together with recently released structures of the KCNQ1-KCNE3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>) provide new insight into the binding and mode of action of the activation motifs from KCNE1 and KCNE3.</p><p>The TMDs of KCNE1 and KCNE3 bind in the same location in KCNQ1 in both open and closed states and share the same overall orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). When superimposing the TM segments of KCNQ1 from both complexes with each other, KCNE1 and KCNE3 deviate by a CÎ±-RMSD of less than 3.1 Ã (RC model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) and 5.9 Ã (AO model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), respectively, along their TM region. Small observable differences between KCNE1 and KCNE3, such as the degree of helix curvature, are expected and are likely related to different intrinsic conformational properties of the TMDs of KCNE1 and KCNE3. Previous NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kroncke et al., 2016</xref>) and EPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sahu et al., 2014</xref>) studies revealed that the TMDs of unbound KCNE1 and KCNE3 are curved and that the degree of helix curvature can vary. Importantly, despite these small differences, we found that homologous residues in KCNE1 and KCNE3 occupy the same spatial position and point in the same direction toward KCNQ1. For instance, KCNE1 Y46 and Y65, and their corresponding residues in KCNE3, Y60 and Y79, make similar interactions with KCNQ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C+E</xref>). The FTL and TVG motifs also share a common binding site, between S1 and S4 from one subunit and S5 from a second subunit, but make different specific interactions with KCNQ1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Most strikingly, we noticed an H-bond between KCNE1 T58 and KCNQ1 Y267 in the MD simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), an observation that offers an explanation for why a hydroxylated amino acid in the middle of the activation motif is required for KCNE1 function. In order to test if Y267 and T58 are interacting, we performed a double mutant cycle experiment by substituting Y267 with Phe and T58 with Val, either separately or in combination, and determined the changes in the activation energy of the resulting channel complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The energy changes for KCNQ1 Y267FâKCNE1 (Î<italic>G</italic>Â =Â 0.66 kcal/mol), KCNQ1âKCNE1 T58V (Î<italic>G</italic>Â =Â â0.36 kcal/mol) and KCNQ1 Y267FâKCNE1 T58V (Î<italic>G</italic>Â =Â 0.90 kcal/mol) were not additive, however, the net energy change (|ÎÎ<italic>G</italic>|Â =Â 0.60 kcal/mol) was smaller than 1.0 kcal/mol, which is commonly used as lower cutoff to identify two residues as interacting. Thus, we were not able to experimentally confirm an interaction between Y267 and T58. However, we note that the free energy changes at T58 were previously observed to have a pronounced sidechain volume dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>) and that substitutions to amino acids involving a more drastic change in sidechain size could reveal a stronger energetic coupling between Y267 and T58 than determined in this work. In the KCNQ1-KCNE3 complex, V72 and Y267 are not interacting. The Y267 sidechain is oriented differently and is in H-bond distance to D242 (or M238) on S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Different interactions are also observed for the first and third motif residues, F57 (T71) and L59 (G73), which are bulkier in KCNE1, probably causing different steric effects on the surrounding residues in KCNQ1. Thus, our structural analysis of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 and KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel complexes suggests that the different functions of KCNE1 and KCNE3 are the consequence of distinct interactions involving their activation motif sites, as discussed below, while interactions with the top and bottom of the TMD help to preserve the same overall KCNE TMD-binding mode.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>How KCNE subunits modify KCNQ1 function in such profoundly different ways is a longstanding topic of investigation. Our KCNQ1-KCNE1 models and subsequent comparative analysis with structures of the KCNQ1-KCNE3 channel aim to address two questions: How does the KCNE1 FTL motif interact with KCNQ1 to control KCNQ1 activation gating? And, what can be concluded about the TMD-binding mode for both KCNE1 and KCNE3 and the mechanism underlying the different impact on channel activation by KCNE3?</p><p>We found that KCNE1 FTL binds in a cleft between the KCNQ1 S1 (F127, F130), S4 (V241), and S5 (I263, L266, Y267 and F270) in both the RC and AO conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9AÂ andÂ B</xref>). This binding mode places the activation motif in proximity to the conserved PAG (P343-A344-G345) motif in S6 â a segment that undergoes critical conformational changes during channel gating. Gating occurs as a consequence of S6 bending at the PAG motif, which causes S6 to swing away from the channel axis, opening the cytosolic gate. While the FTL residues are not in direct contact with S6, our structural model suggests that they can affect the nearby PAG motif through the mediation of S5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Alanine mutational scanning of S5 previously showed that the V<sub>1/2</sub> shift of KCNQ1 activation by KCNE1 is reduced by mutations Y267A and F270A, and to a smaller extent by L271A, I274A, and F275A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>). Mutation F270A also altered the volume-dependency of V<sub>1/2</sub> changes resulting from substitution of KCNE1 T58 with amino acids of different size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, KCNE1 FTL was responsible for the suppression of constitutive currents in KCNQ1 channels with mutation I268A, even in cases of functionally decoupled voltage sensor and pore domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>). These data are consistent with binding of FTL to this region on S5 leading to triggering of changes in the activation gate of KCNQ1. Indeed, dynamical network analysis of our MD simulations shows that S5 connects KCNE1 T58 with KCNQ1 S6 through several short pathways in a residue interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1AÂ andÂ B</xref>). These allosteric interactions could alter the conformational dynamics of S6 around the PAG motif and influence gate opening.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Comparison of KCNQ1-KCNE1 models with structures of the KCNQ1-KCNE3 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: KCNE1 model bound to KCNQ1 in the RC conformation.

KCNQ1 residues F339 and F340, which are one helix turn before the PAG motif, were shown to be energetically coupled to KCNE1 T58 based on double mutant cycle analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>). This is in accord with our dynamical network analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>) and with the observation that mutations at either F339, F340, or T58 produce similar functional outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Melman et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the phenotype of some mutations in S6 can be altered or rescued by KCNE1: non-functional KCNQ1 A341V mutant channels can be rendered functional when co-expressed with KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mikuni et al., 2011</xref>), and constitutively active F340W channels can be suppressed by mutation at KCNE1 T58 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Panaghie et al., 2006</xref>), which points to an effect of KCNE1 on the channel gate. Previously, these data were taken as evidence for a direct physical contact between T58 and S6, leading to a model in which KCNE1 lies close to or forms a part of the KCNQ1 PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tapper and George, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Melman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>). However, our KCNQ1-KCNE1 models, in accord with structures of the related KCNQ1-KCNE3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>), indicate that KCNE1 is too far away to directly contact the middle region of S6. Instead, we propose an allosteric mechanism for control of KCNQ1 gating, in which binding of the FTL motif influences the conformational state of the S6 PAG motif by interacting with S5, which then directly impacts the key gating residues in S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of the binding modes of KCNE1 and KCNE3 also suggests how the activation motifs of these proteins could trigger different effects on the KCNQ1 gate through mediation of S5. We observed different interactions are made by the KCNE1 FTL versus the KCNE3 TVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B+C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). KCNE1 F57 and L59 are much bulkier than the corresponding KCNE3 residues, T71 and G73, possibly leading to different steric effects on neighboring residues in KCNQ1 S1 and S5. Furthermore, the model predicts an H-bond between KCNE1 T58 and KCNQ1 Y267, which is absent for KCNE3 V72. Replacing V72 with a hydroxylated amino acid could restore this H-bond interaction, which offers an explanation why the KCNE3 V72T mutant leads to channel properties akin to KCNQ1-KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Melman et al., 2002</xref>). Scoring with the Rosetta energy function suggests a larger binding free energy for FTL compared to TVG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) and a decrease of binding by Ala mutations of residues in S5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Together these observations support the notion that FTL and TVG induce distinct interactions of varying strength with S5 that determine the effect of the KCNE subunits on the S6 gate.</p><media id="video4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-57680-video4.mp4"><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>Animation and comparison of the interaction sites of the activation motifs from KCNE1 and KCNE3.</title></caption></media><p>The outlined mechanistic model agrees qualitatively with observations from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>, who showed that KCNE1 and KCNE3 have different effects on the VSD and PD. While KCNE1 acts both on the VSD and PD, shifting S4 movement to more negative potentials and gate opening to more positive potentials, KCNE3 mainly affects the VSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>), effectively eliminating gating by stabilizing the intermediate and fully activated VSD states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sun and MacKinnon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kroncke et al., 2016</xref>). The FTL and TVG motifs were found to determine whether the KCNE subunits affect the gate and the second S4 movement that is seen in voltage clamp fluorometry studies of KCNQ1-KCNE1 and correlates with the opening of KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barro-Soria et al., 2017</xref>). This can be explained by the differences in the interaction modes between FTL and TVG seen in our models. Furthermore, significantly less contacts are observed for FTL or TVG with S4 (only KCNQ1 V241 is within van der Waals distance of either T58 or V72) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), which is consistent with the notion that these sites have minimal impact on S4 movement. This is in contrast to other residues in KCNE1 and KCNE3, one to two helix turns C-terminal to FTL and TVG, which make direct contacts with S4, explaining how both KCNE proteins affect S4 movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Panaghie and Abbott, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakajo and Kubo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rocheleau and Kobertz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Osteen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruscic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barro-Soria et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barro-Soria et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite different interactions of KCNQ1 with the activation motifs from KCNE1 and KCNE3, we observed impressive similarity in their global TMD-binding modes. This observation led us to wonder if this feature is conserved for other KCNEs. Some support for this hypothesis comes from the overall high degree of sequence homology of the TMD within the KCNE family (11â60% identity, 45â78% similarity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9âfigure supplement 2</xref>). It is noteworthy that Y46 in KCNE1, which we identified as a high impact mutation site, is conserved in all KCNE proteins. Perhaps, this site is part of a channel docking/anchoring mechanism shared by all KCNE family members. A region with considerably less sequence homology exists in the middle of the TMD and coincides with the FTL motif from KCNE1. We speculate that different KCNEs might have evolved different amino acid sequences for this motif in order to elicit different functional responses in KCNQ1 and other ion channels. This sequence motif may therefore represent a common regulatory element in KCNEs.</p><p>There is relatively little structure-function data available for other KCNEs to inform on the degree of conservation of their TMD-binding modes. Using cysteine scanning mutagenesis and analyzing the pattern of functional perturbations in KCNE2, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2012</xref>Â developed a schematic model for the orientation of the KCNE2 TMD within the KCNQ1 channel complex. KCNQ1 C331 was observed to form disulfide bonds to different positions in KCNE1 (F54) and KCNE2 (M59, corresponding to F53 in KCNE1), which trapped the channel in open and closed states, respectively. While this result could imply a rotation of the KCNE subunit during channel open-to-close transition, it could also indicate a different TMD orientation. In contrast to this hypothesis, our KCNQ1-KCNE1 models and the KCNQ1-KCNE3 structures fail to reveal a significant rotation for the KCNE subunit between open and closed channel conformations. Furthermore, in these structures, F53 and F54 (L67 and F68 in KCNE3) have approximately the same distance to C331 (KCNE1: F53 â 10.1 Ã, F54 â 13.2 Ã; KCNE3: L67 â 9.4 Ã, F68 â 12.5 Ã). We suggest that the proposed KCNE1 binding pose of this work could potentially satisfy both disulfide bond restraints, and that experimental KCNE-specific differences in disulfide bond formation could be the result of local structural differences in and around the activation triplet between KCNE1 and KCNE2. Another study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref> identified functional interactions between the KCNQ1 PD (F275, F340) and the middle residue in the KCNE2 activation triplet (I64). This is consistent with our proposed allosteric mechanism between those corresponding sites in KCNE1 and suggests a similar mechanism may exist in KCNE2.</p><p>In summary, our results imply that all KCNE subunits interact with KCNQ1 by adopting a common binding mode within their TMD. Moreover, our experimental/computational models of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel complex provide an explanation for how the KCNE1 TMD interacts with the KCNQ1 channel and controls KCNQ1 activation through its intramembrane FTL motif. Binding of the FTL motif appears to affect the channel gate through allosteric interactions with S6 that are mediated by S5. Differences in their interactions with S5 appear to explain the different effects of KCNE1 and KCNE3 on the gate in KCNQ1.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

KCNE1 was docked to human KCNQ1 models of the closed state with the VSD and PD in resting and closed (RC) conformations and to models of the open state with the VSD and PD in fully activated and open (AO) conformations. Molecular modeling was guided by contact restraints derived from the results of disulfide crosslinking and site-directed mutagenesis experiments, which were obtained in this study or collected from previous literature reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tapper and George, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Strutz-Seebohm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Two separate restraint lists for docking of KCNE1 to either the closed or open KCNQ1 model were compiled based on the functional annotation of the channel state under the experimental conditions. A crosslink restraint was assigned the closed or open conformation if it trapped the channel in the closed or open state, respectively, or both conformations if the channel state was unclear. For example, Chung and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chung et al., 2009</xref>) reported that disulfide crosslinks KCNE1 K41âKCNQ1 I145 and KCNE1 L42âKCNQ1 V324 favored the open state, whereas crosslinks KCNE1 K41âKCNQ1 V324 and KCNE1 L42âKCNQ1 I145 stabilized the closed state. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2011</xref>Â concluded, in the closed state, KCNQ1 residues T144, I145, Q147 are preferably crosslinked to KCNE1 R36-E43, whereas in the open state, those positions in KCNQ1 crosslink with KCNE1 G40, and KCNQ1 Q147 can be disulfide-bonded to KCNE1 R36, G38, and K41. Complete restraint lists for development of the closed and open KCNQ1-KCNE1 model can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1Â â Table 2 and 3</xref>, respectively.</p><p>Prior to docking, the TMD and a short stretch of the N-terminal juxtamembrane domain of the ten deposited models of the KCNE1 NMR structure (PDB: 2K21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2008</xref>), hereupon termed KCNE1 TMD (residues S37-L71), were energy-minimized with Rosetta using the RosettaMembrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yarov-Yarovoy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barth et al., 2007</xref>) energy function. KCNE1 TMD was then placed near the transmembrane region of our previously published KCNQ1 homology models of the RC and AO state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuenze et al., 2019</xref>), and a total of 40,000 KCNQ1-KCNE1 models were generated for each state using the Rosetta protein-protein docking algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gray et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gray, 2006</xref>). The disulfide crosslinks and additional contact information were implemented as CÎ±-atom pair distance restraints with an upper bound of 12 Ã, which corresponds to the length of an extended disulfide crosslink (7 Ã) plus an additional 5 Ã padding to account for the effect of protein flexibility. For Cd(II)-cysteine crosslinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tapper and George, 2001</xref>), the upper bound distance was increased to 15 Ã (corresponding to 10 Ã theoretical distance plus 5 Ã padding). Distance restraints were evaluated with a harmonic penalty function that was zero below 12 Ã (15 Ã for Cd(II)-bridged crosslinks) and grew quadratically beyond that distance. The KCNQ1-KCNE1 docking models were filtered by a combination of score criteria (interface scoreÂ &lt;0 REU, ÎG<sub>Binding</sub>Â &lt;0 REU, atom pair restraint scoreÂ &lt;350 REU) and the remaining models were sorted by the binding energy between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (ÎG<sub>Binding</sub>). The 1000 best-scoring KCNQ1-KCNE1 models were then used as input structures for a subsequent round of docking to generate additional 40,000 model complexes. This alternating docking-filtering procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>) was iterated until the change in ÎG<sub>Binding</sub> averaged over the ten lowest-energy models from iteration to iteration converged to less than 5%. In subsequent iterations, the atom pair restraint score cutoff was gradually decreased from 350 REU to 100 REU in the last docking round in order to apply a more restrictive experimental filter. In addition, the allowed range of translational and rotational perturbations at the beginning of each docking run was decreased from initially 3 Ã / 8Â° to 1 Ã / 3Â° to enable a more fine-grained conformational sampling. Docking calculations converged after five to seven iterations, and representative models were chosen by RMSD-based clustering of the 5000 best-scoring models, followed by visual inspection and MolProbity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis et al., 2007</xref>) analysis of the 10â20 lowest-energy models from the ten largest clusters. The model with the best combined ÎG<sub>Binding</sub> and MolProbity scores from the largest model cluster as well as two additional low-energy models from the same cluster were selected for further MD analysis.</p><p>For MD simulations, KCNQ1-KCNE1 models were prepared with a stoichiometry of 4:2 KCNQ1:KCNE1 subunits.

The docked conformation of KCNE1 was duplicated and aligned with the opposite half of KCNQ1 by 180Â° rotation around the central channel axis. Subsequently, the interface of both KCNE1 molecules with KCNQ1 was relaxed by sidechain rotamer repacking and energy minimization of all backbone and sidechain degrees of freedom in Rosetta.

Activated/Open and Resting /Closed, based in large part on an extensive review of experimentally-derived constraints. The models reported, deposited in PDB-dev will be of great value to the community.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Lucie Delemotte as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Leon D Islas (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>KCNQ1 channels are a principal component of the slow-activating repolarization current in the heart. The slow activation character is produced by an interaction with the KCNE1 regulatory subunit. Although a well-characterized interaction, the molecular details of this are still controversial. The paper by Kuenze et al. investigates the molecular details of the association between the KCNQ1 channel and its regulatory subunit, KCNE1. Through molecular modeling and protein-protein docking, the authors arrive at a proposed mode of interaction between KCNE1 and models of the closed and open KCNQ1 channel. These detailed molecular interactions then are validated via a varied number of experiments, including mutagenesis, electrophysiological analysis of the effects of mutations and cysteine-cysteine crosslinking. Contrary to previous belief, the FTL motif in KCNE1 is not directly interacting with S6. Instead, the authors propose that FTL affects S6 via a allosteric network via S5. Comparing their KCNQ1/KCNE1 models with the KCNQ1/KCNE3 structure, they found that KCNE1 and KCNE3 share a very similar binding site. But different interactions of FTL in KCNE1 and TVD in KCNE3 with KCNQ1 are proposed to account for the different functional modulation of KCNQ1 by different KCNE subunits.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the models deposited in PDB-dev would be of great value to the community, and that the review of experimental restraints used to build the models are in and of itself of great value. They also judged that the experimental validation of the proposed models was thorough and increased the confidence in the proposed modes of interaction between the two proteins. The data were thus convincing, but the conclusions about interactions were sometimes overstated and a more extensive discussion about the mechanism of KCNE1 was needed. Additionally there were some concerns about the way the cross-linking experiments were carried out. A detailed review is included below.</p><p>Experiments:</p><p>1) Related to Figure 2 and all other experiments using crosslinking: the authors show that under control, reducing or oxidizing conditions the magnitude of the currents are different. The way the data are presented and described led us to understand that each treatment, control, DTT or Cu-Phenantroline was applied to different groups of cells. If this is the case, this is a major experimental problem. Since there is variability in expression level and possibly changes in open probability and/or single channel conductance in each of the mutants that the authors are not accounting for, a simple comparison of the current density magnitude between different treatments is meaningless. These experiments should be carried out in the same cell. Typically disulfide bond formation (crosslinking) is induced by Cu-Phe after basal current recording and then reversed by DTT. There is a vast literature making use of this technique and this is the accepted way of performing this experiment. The authors should clarify if this is indeed what they did and show an example of such an experiment.</p><p>Conversely, if each treatment was applied to different groups of cells, the authors should show that the introduced cysteine residue produces no changes in open probability and single-channel conductance.</p><p>2) The recordings shown by the authors were obtained in a limited voltage range, up to 60 mV. The tail currents show that the activation is far from saturation at this voltage and in consequence the estimation of the V1/2 from these curves incurs in an error, which could be very large. The authors should comment on these limitations or alternatively estimate this parameter from currents obtained at a wider range of voltages.</p><p>Modeling:</p><p>1) To strengthen confidence in the modeling procedure, the following controls should be carried out: the docking of E1 should be done on the recent human structures of the activated/open state hKCNQ1 instead of only on the author's previous model. Conversely, docking of E3 to their AO model (and to the experimental structure mentioned above) should be performed to demonstrate that the procedure allows to recapitulate the experimental binding pose.</p><p>2) Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 shows a comparison of the models obtained in this work with the cryo-EM structure. The authors show that the backbone RMSD is fairly low between models and structure, but it would be more informative to show the degree of deviation of the position of side chains, especially in the regions in the models that were used for docking the KCNE1.</p><p>3) Another aspect that is not even mentioned by the authors is the fact that the stoichiometry of KCNQ1-KCNE1 complexes appears to be variable. There is no experimental consensus on how many KCNE1 subunits are present per tetrameric KCNQ1 and the evidence seems to support the view that the number of KCNE1 subunits associated with a KCNQ1 tetramer depends on the expression level of the former. The authors seem to have chosen a 2:1 KCNE1:tetramer assembly for their simulations. Although a different stoichiometry might or might not alter the details of the interaction, it has been show that the variable stoichiometry can alter the biophysical effect (degree of voltage shift among others) of KCNE1, indeed suggesting that the mode of interaction might also not be unique. Did you try docking four KCNE1s per tetramer? Would this different stoichiometry alter the mode of interaction between KCNE1s and KCNQ1? At the very least, the authors should discuss this variable affects and their choice of stoichiometry.</p><p>Contextualization and Interpretation of data:</p><p>1) Abstract: &quot;FTLâ¦ affects the channel gate via an allosteric network.&quot; This is not shown, but only a proposed mechanism. Please state as suggestion, not fact.</p><p>2) â Likewise, mutation of FTL to TVG renders the KCNQ1-KCNE1 channel constitutively active, similar to KCNQ1-KCNE3â and other similar statements. Previous studies have shown that KCNQ1/KCNE1-TVG is not a constitutively open KCNQ1/KCNE3-like channel (Panaghie et al., 2006; Barro-Soria et al., 2017), in contrast to the work by Melman. Maybe good to tone down this conclusion? Or more evidence showing that TVG converts KCNQ1-KCNE1 into constitutively conductive KCNQ1-KCNE3 would be good.</p><p>3) In Figure 2, why was the focus of the experiments on the extracellular portion of the (TM) region of E1? From the SI tables, there seems to be fewer constraints from interactions of the intracellular portion.</p><p>4) â Both mutations resulted in smaller peak current amplitudes and significantly depolarized activation V<sub>1/2</sub> (ÎV<sub>1/2</sub>,<sub>K362A</sub> = 14.7 mV, ÎV<sub>1/2,N365A</sub> = 14.7 mV) (Figure 5D+E, Supplementary file 1âtable 5), indicating that these mutant channels required more energy to open, possibly due to a loss of stabilizing interactions with KCNE1.â. The conclusion is a little too strong. The fact that mutations at K362 and N365 make the channel activate at more depolarized voltages doesn't mean they affect the interaction with KCNE1, even though they seem close to KCNE1 in the model. K362 and N365 are in S6 and maybe just important for pore opening. Crosslinking or double mutant cycle analysis for the C ends of S6 and E1 (say K362 and S68), or KCNE1-dependent effects of K362 and N365 mutations would be needed to claim interactions.</p><p>5) Subsection âExperimental validation of KCNE1 residues interacting with KCNQ1â paragraph four. Mutations at W323 and Y46 share similar phenotypes of GV relations, but authors didn't show any experimental evidence to confirm that they are in direct contact (In the model they seem to be close together). Also, Y46 mutant had faster activation kinetics while W323 had wt-like activation kinetics, why is that if they are indeed functionally interacting?</p><p>6) Discussion paragraph two. &quot;FTL can affect the nearly PAG motif through the mediation of S5&quot;, what residues in S5 is responsible for the mediation? From Figure 9 the authors labeled 263, 266, 267 and 270 and mentioned that mutations of them change the channel activation. Please clarify these mutational effects and discuss how they would differ for the FTL motif and the TVG motif.</p><p>7) Discussion paragraph three. This whole paragraph provides some experimental studies to support the model that FTL motif affects PAG motif via S5 involvement. But how this model induces the slower activation gating of KCNQ1 is not clear. To answer this question that the authors mentioned in the beginning of discussion, we would like more evidence and discussion concerning how FTL motif makes the KCNQ1 channel slow to open.</p><p>8) Discussion paragraph five. In Barro-Soria et al., 2017, they concluded that FTL also affects the S4 movement.</p><p>9) â This mechanism may account for at least some of the gating differences between KCNE1 and KCNE3â and â This proposed mechanism can account for the different effects of KCNE1 and KCNE3 on KCNQ1 gatingâ. This is too strong a statement. Similar to comment 7 above, how does the FTL motif makes Q1 channel open slowly while TVG motif makes Q1 constitutively leaky using this proposed model. It seems like the authors have more ideas about how KCNE1 affects KCNQ1 than how KCNE3 affects KCNQ1? Maybe stick to the more obvious effects seen/proposed?</p><p>10) Figure 5. Why does the amplitude go down for mutants? Is this really a good parameter to measure interactions? What is the rationale behind this conclusion?</p><p>11) Figure 8. Y267-T58 interaction seems very important for the proposed mechanism, but very little data is shown for this interaction (just simulations, except Y267F reducing expression, but consider concern above). Any more data for this interactions?</p><p>12) Figure 7. Y65A looks as good as Y65 or Y65F. So is the aromatic ring at Y65 really important?</p><p>13) In several places, data that is used to impose constraints in the model is then used to corroborate the relevance of the model. That should be avoided, or at least clarified.</p><p>14) The role of the interaction between Y267 and residues on S4 (M238 and D242) is intriguing, and its disruption when E1 is bound but not E3. Are those state-dependent and can they be related to the stabilization of the specific VSD state?</p><p>15) The 274-45 pair that are suggested to crosslink are not that close in either model (15A) and seem to point in different directions.</p><p>Presentation of results:</p><p>1) In Figure 5, the authors focus on residue W323, Y267 and K362/N365 because they had the largest number of contacts with E1 in a specific segment. Where is the data supporting this claim? The way the contacts are presented in this figure was confusing to several reviewers.</p><p>2) Figure 2âfigure supplement 2. This is not the correct figure. wt KCNE1 should be shown, not as now with mutant KCNE1. This is a crucial control experiment. Also, the very important controls for wt KCNQ1 coexpressed with KCNE1 cys mutants are missing.</p><p>3) Figure 7 B-C. What are the authors trying to convey with these data? The reviewers did not see any obvious pattern. Is the correlation they propose really significant?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57680.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers agreed that the models deposited in PDB-dev would be of great value to the community, and that the review of experimental restraints used to build the models are in and of itself of great value.

However, the I<sub>Ks</sub> current when analyzed by whole-cell voltage clamp in mammalian cells exhibits rundown (see Vanoye et al., 2018, Supplemental Figure 2), which varies in both rate and magnitude, thus confounding experiments in which there is a time lapse between conditions or treatments. To avoid this problem, we recorded from multiple cells for each treatment (Control, +DTT, +Cu-phen.) to average the cell-to-cell variability. In addition, we recorded cells for all treatments from a specific cell transfection batch, and we used at least 3 transfections for each KCNQ1-KCNE1 combination. This information was previously omitted from Materials and methods, it has now been added to the end of subsection âElectrophysiologyâ.</p><p>We also now show that introduction of cysteine residues to KCNQ1 positions 141 and 274 do not affect channel activity behavior alone or in the presence of wild-type KCNE1 under control, +DTT or +Cu-phen (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 2, respectively).

We have performed these important control experiments and docked the NMR structures of KCNE1 and KCNE3 to the new cryo-EM structure of human KCNQ1 in the AO state and to the Rosetta AO model. The results of these experiments are presented in the paper in Figure 3âfigure supplement 4 and in the text:</p><p>âTo assure the robustness of our structure prediction protocol, control docking calculations were performed with the cryo-EM-determined AO state structure of human KCNQ1 (Sun and MacKinnon, 2020), which became available only after our KCNQ1-KCNE1 models were completed. These control calculations arrived at a model that was very similar to the one developed by docking KCNE1 to the Rosetta homology model of KCNQ1 (interface RMSD (I-RMSD) = 3.5 Ã, Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A). Additional control calculations were carried out with KCNE3, starting either with the cryo-EM-determined or Rosetta-predicted KCNQ1 model. Guided by a set of published experimental restraints for the KCNQ1-KCNE3 complex (Kroncke et al., 2016), this procedure was able to reproduce the experimental KCNE3 binding pose with an accuracy of I-RMSD = 2.5 Ã or 4.2 Ã, respectively, for these two structures (Figure 3âfigure supplement 4B+C).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 shows a comparison of the models obtained in this work with the cryo-EM structure.

We have calculated the sidechain RMSD and rotamer similarity of surface-exposed residues in these segments. The results of this analysis have been added to Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 and are described in the paper: âIn the putative KCNE1 binding region used for docking, the homology models agree well with the cryo-EM structures; surface-exposed residues have a sidechain RMSD less than 2.5Ã and 4.0Ã in the RC and AO model, respectively (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another aspect that is not even mentioned by the authors is the fact that the stoichiometry of KCNQ1-KCNE1 complexes appears to be variable.

In addition to describing the preparation of KCNQ1-KCNE1 models with 4:2 stoichiometry in Materials and methods, we have now added more discussion about our choice of the KCNQ1:KCNE1 stoichiometry and the variable effects on KCNQ1 function that can be caused by different numbers of KCNE1 subunits.</p><p>âFor MD simulations, KCNQ1-KCNE1 models were prepared with a stoichiometry of 4:2 KCNQ1:KCNE1 subunits.

It has also been our experience that crosslinking of intracellular sites of KCNQ1+KCNE1 expressed in mammalian cells is technically challenging due to the limited accessibility of these sites to the oxidizing/reducing reagents.</p><p>We have now added an additional paragraph to the manuscript comparing our models with published interaction data for the intracellular C-terminal domains of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 (see response to the next comment). These restraints were initially not used in model building because the interaction sites are located in flexible linker regions of KCNE1 and inclusion of flexible linkers in docking proved computationally intractable. However, the experimentally observed interaction sites are close to the last KCNE1 residue in our models.

[â¦] These data are consistent with a binding of FTL to this region on S5 leading to triggering of changes in the activation gate of KCNQ1.â</p><p>We describe differences between the interaction modes of FTL and TVG, and, using Rosetta energy calculations and <italic>in-silico</italic> alanine mutagenesis, compare possible changes in their binding strength with S5.</p><p>âWe observed different interactions are made by the KCNE1 FTL versus the KCNE3 TVG (Figure 9B+C, Video 4). [â¦] Scoring with the Rosetta energy function suggests a larger binding free energy for FTL compared to TVG (Figure 9D, Figure 9âfigure supplement 1C) and a decrease of binding by Ala mutations of residues in S5 (Figure 9âfigure supplement 1D). [â¦]â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion paragraph three. This whole paragraph provides some experimental studies to support the model that FTL motif affects PAG motif via S5 involvement. But how this model induces the slower activation gating of KCNQ1 is not clear. To answer this question that the authors mentioned in the beginning of discussion, we would like more evidence and discussion concerning how FTL motif makes the KCNQ1 channel slow to open.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our structural models cannot fully explain how the KCNE1 FTL motif causes slow activation gating of KCNQ1.Therefore, we have revised our discussion and focus on questions which are answered more directly by the models developed in this work.</p><p>âHow does the KCNE1 FTL motif interact with KCNQ1 to control KCNQ1 activation gating? And, what can be concluded about the TMD binding mode for both KCNE1 and KCNE3 and the mechanism underlying the different impact on channel activation by KCNE3?â</p><p>As in our previous manuscript version, we describe the basis for an allosteric mechanism by which KCNE1 appears to affect the KCNQ1 gate, and provide experimental evidences for this mechanism.</p><p>We then discuss how differences between the binding modes of KCNE1 FTL and KCNE3 TVG lead to different molecular forces acting on S5, and propose that different force transductions determine the effect of the KCNE proteins on the KCNQ1 gate via involvement of S5.</p><p>âComparison of the binding modes of KCNE1 and KCNE3 also suggests how the activation motifs of these proteins could trigger different effects on the KCNQ1 gate through mediation of S5. [â¦] Together these observations support the notion that FTL and TVG induce distinct interactions of varying strength with S5 that determine the effect of the KCNE subunits on the S6 gate.â</p><p>As in our previous manuscript submission, we conclude the discussion with thoughts about whether the TMD binding mode seen for KCNE1 and KCNE3 could be conserved in other KCNE proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Discussion paragraph five. In Barro-Soria et al., 2017, they concluded that FTL also affects the S4 movement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this statement: âThe FTL and TVG motifs were found to determine whether the KCNE subunits affect the gate and the second S4 movement that is seen in voltage clamp fluorometry studies of KCNQ1-KCNE1 and correlates with the opening of KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) â This mechanism may account for at least some of the gating differences between KCNE1 and KCNE3â and â This proposed mechanism can account for the different effects of KCNE1 and KCNE3 on KCNQ1 gatingâ. This is too strong a statement. Similar to comment 7 above, how does the FTL motif makes Q1 channel open slowly while TVG motif makes Q1 constitutively leaky using this proposed model. It seems like the authors have more ideas about how KCNE1 affects KCNQ1 than how KCNE3 affects KCNQ1? Maybe stick to the more obvious effects seen/proposed?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have revised our discussion and stick to the more obvious effects proposed by the structural models (see our response to comment 7). We have adjusted our claims and removed the first statement and rephrased the second statement as a suggestion: âDifferences in their interactions with S5 appear to explain the different effects of KCNE1 and KCNE3 on the gate in KCNQ1.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Figure 5. Why does the amplitude go down for mutants? Is this really a good parameter to measure interactions? What is the rationale behind this conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that current amplitude is not a good parameter to measure KCNQ1-KCNE1 interaction. In fact, in our manuscript, conclusions about the KCNQ1-KCNE1 interaction were not derived from peak current data. We reported these data in order to fully describe the functional phenotype of the KCNQ1- KCNE1 mutants tested. To avoid confusion, we have removed the unnormalized I-V curves from Figure 5E and Figure 7A. Instead, we show the activation and deactivation times for KCNE1 Y46, F57, and Y65 mutants in Figure 7A. We include the current density data in Supplementary file 1âtable 6, but have removed statements comparing current density between WT and mutant conditions from the manuscript text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 8. Y267-T58 interaction seems very important for the proposed mechanism, but very little data is shown for this interaction (just simulations, except Y267F reducing expression, but consider concern above). Any more data for this interactions?</p></disp-quote><p>To test if KCNQ1 Y267 and KCNE1 T58 are interacting, we have performed a double mutant cycle experiment by substituting Y267 with Phe and T58 with Val, either separately or in combination, and determined the changes in the free energy of activation of the resulting channel complexes.</p><p>âThe energy changes for KCNQ1 Y267FâKCNE1 (Î<italic>G</italic> = 0.66 kcal/mol), KCNQ1âKCNE1 T58V (Î<italic>G</italic> = -0.36 kcal/mol) and KCNQ1 Y267FâKCNE1 T58V (Î<italic>G</italic> = 0.90 kcal/mol) were not additive, however, the net energy change (|ÎÎG| = 0.60 kcal/mol) was smaller than 1.0 kcal/mol, which is commonly used as lower cutoff to identify two residues as interacting. Thus, we were not able to experimentally confirm an interaction between Y267 and T58. However, we note that the free energy changes at T58 were previously observed to have a pronounced sidechain volume dependency (Strutz-Seebohm el al., 2011) and that substitutions to amino acids involving a more drastic change in sidechain size could reveal a stronger energetic coupling between Y267 and T58 than determined in this work.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Figure 7. Y65A looks as good as Y65 or Y65F. So is the aromatic ring at Y65 really important?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data suggest that both sidechain size and OH functionality at KCNE1 Y65 contribute to in the interaction with KCNQ1, because mutations to Phe, which preserves the aromatic ring but lacks the OH group, as well as substitutions with Leu or Ala led to significant changes in channel activation properties as described:</p><p>âMutations at Y65 led to a shift of V<sub>1/2app</sub> to more positive voltages (ÎV<sub>1/2app,Y65A</sub> = 4.3 mV, ÎV<sub>1/2app,Y65L</sub> = 12.3 mV, ÎV<sub>1/2app,Y65F</sub> = 9.4 mV), and Y65L and Y65A showed faster activation and deactivation kinetics (Figure 7A, right panel). This is consistent with the observation of Y65 forming sidechain packing and hydrogen bond interactions with multiple KCNQ1 residues in the MD simulations.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) In several places, data that is used to impose constraints in the model is then used to corroborate the relevance of the model. That should be avoided, or at least clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this mistake. We have removed the sentence about mutation W323C from the manuscript. Our intention was to compare the volume effects of different mutations at position 323. We now compare our results to mutational effects at other residues in S6 and helix P that are close to W323.</p><p>âMutations of other residues in S6 (V324, V334) and in the nearby P helix (A300, V307) also caused channel opening at more negative voltages, likely via destabilization of the closed state. This region has been implicated with the positive G(V) shift by KCNE1 (Kakajo et al., 2011).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The role of the interaction between Y267 and residues on S4 (M238 and D242) is intriguing, and its disruption when E1 is bound but not E3. Are those state-dependent and can they be related to the stabilization of the specific VSD state?</p></disp-quote><p>In our structural modeling work of the KCNQ1 VSD in different activation states we have observed that Y267 can make interactions with different S4 residues in the resting, intermediate, and activated state, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). It is possible that the type and strength of these state-dependent interactions are affected differently by the presence of KCNE1 or KCNE3 as basis for stabilizing specific VSD states. To fully and quantitatively investigate this hypothesis, we are considering additional computational and functional experiments.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Interactions between Y267 and S4 in KCNQ1 models of the resting, intermediate, and activated state.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57680-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The 274-45 pair that are suggested to crosslink are not that close in either model (15A) and seem to point in different directions.</p></disp-quote><p>In the model of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 closed state, which appears to be the state that is promoted by I274C-L45C crosslinking, L45 and I274 are oriented at an angle of about 90Â° and have a CA-CA distance of ~15 Ã (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). In MD simulations, which allowed for exploration of additional protein flexibility, L45 and I274 came within a CA-CA distance of 13.5 Ã which is still larger than the expected maximal CA-CA cysteine-crosslinking distance of ~8 Ã. We speculate that this experimentally observed crosslink may have induced a moderate perturbation of the KCNQ1-KCNE1 structure which brought L45C and I274C closer together than in the WT model inducing a low-conductance closed-like state.</p><p>We have added a sentence to the manuscript providing a possible explanation for this restraint violation:</p><p>âThe restraint with the medium violation involved residues KCNE1 L45 and KCNQ1 I274. It is possible that crosslinking between these cysteine-substituted sites slightly perturbed the KCNQ1-KCNE1 structure leading to a low-conductance closed-like state, which could explain why in the WT channel model these residue sidechains have suboptimal geometry for disulfide bond formation.â</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57680-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Presentation of results:</p><p>1) In Figure 5, the authors focus on residue W323, Y267 and K362/N365 because they had the largest number of contacts with E1 in a specific segment.

Our negative results with those three KCNQ1-KCNE1 residue pairs indicated to us that the effects we observed in the presence of DTT or Cu-phenanthroline with KCNQ1_V141C-KCNE1_L48C or KCNQ1_I274C-KCNE_L45C are residue pair specific. In addition, earlier experiments carried out in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>) showed that the KCNQ1_V141C-KCNE1_L45C pair was insensitive to oxidizing conditions.

We compare the significance of this correlation between the model-predicted KCNE1 binding mode and three other hypothetical binding orientations where the KCNE1 TM helix is rotated 90Â° or 180Â° in the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction.
