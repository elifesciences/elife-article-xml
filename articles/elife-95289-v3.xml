Columns are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. Broadly, this work provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>As we develop, the long bones in our arms and legs must grow bigger and stronger to support our weight and movements. The width and length of these bones increase rapidly while in the womb, but after birth, they lengthen more quickly than they widen.</p><p>Both expansion and extension occur at the growth plates, two narrow zones located at each bone’s ends and which host cells that can divide and increase in size. Traditionally, bone lengthening has been understood resulting from these ‘chondrocytes’ expanding in size after having organized themselves into columns that run parallel to the long axis of the bone. This is possible due to newly born cells performing a complex 90-degree rotation that results in this characteristic organization in column stacks. How bones widen, however, is less well-understood.</p><p>To shed light on these mechanisms, Rubin, Agrawal et al. took advantage of recent technologies that allowed them to track the spatial organization of cells in 3D during development. Their experiments showed that, in mice, chondrocytes in the growth plate were rarely organized in columns before birth, with most cells not performing a 90-degree rotation of their division plane. This led to most clusters growing perpendicularly to the long axis of the bone, resulting in bone widening.</p><p>After birth, however, most chondrocytes successfully completed the rotation, establishing columns running parallel to the long axis; fewer clusters contributing to the widening of the bone were present.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that controlling the rotation of the division plane in chondrocytes helps create different growth strategies before and after birth. They also indicate that elongation in the womb may not require chondrocytes to be systematically organized in columns. Overall, the findings by Rubin, Agrawal et al. point to new mechanisms underpinning bone growth, which could be important to investigate further in both health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>columns</kwd><kwd>growth plate</kwd><kwd>chondrocyte</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1387/23</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zelzer</surname><given-names>Elazar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Weizmann - Sagol Institute for Longetivity Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zelzer</surname><given-names>Elazar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Julie and Eric Borman Family Research Funds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zelzer</surname><given-names>Elazar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Michigan School of Dentistry</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>Tomer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Michigan Oral Health Sciences PhD program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lian</surname><given-names>Meng-Jia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Modulation of division plane rotation in proliferating chondrocytes determines the ratio of clusters and columns, which may support the multifunctional design of the growth plate.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular organization plays a major role in tissue and organ morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lecuit and Le Goff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailles et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collinet and Lecuit, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutherland et al., 2020</xref>). The mammalian growth plate is an excellent example for this concept as its complex architecture is the engine driving longitudinal bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breur et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilsman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilsman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 2013</xref>). The growth plate, which is located at both ends of developing long bones, drives bone elongation by a tightly regulated process of cell proliferation and differentiation, which involves increase in cell size and their organization along the proximal-distal (P-D) axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kronenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mackie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cancedda and Cancedda, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Noonan et al., 1998</xref>). The growth plate comprises four zones. At the most distal epiphyseal end is the resting zone (RZ), where chondrocytes are small and disorganized. Underneath lies the proliferative zone (PZ), where chondrocytes increase in volume, adopt a flat and elongated morphology, and organize into columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abad et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodds, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Dudley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romereim et al., 2014</xref>). In the subsequent prehypertrophic (PHZ) and hypertrophic zones (HZ), cells reach their maximum size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breur et al., 1997</xref>). These changes in cell size and spatial organization determine the rate of bone elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breur et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilsman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilsman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kember and Walker, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Columnar arrangement of chondrocytes has been a subject of study for nearly a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodds, 1930</xref>), gaining attention due to the remarkable emergence of cellular order from the highly disordered RZ. This columnar arrangement facilitates bone elongation by maximizing cell density in the longitudinal axis while limiting it laterally, thereby constraining hypertrophic cell growth to the P-D axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romereim and Dudley, 2011</xref>). In the PZ, the division of column-forming cells is perpendicular to the P-D axis. Considering that these cells ultimately orient themselves with their short axis parallel to the P-D axis, the rearrangement into elongated columns requires a robust morphogenetic mechanism. Originally, analyses of two-dimensional static images suggested that in the embryonic growth plate, columns form through a process akin to convergent extension, an evolutionarily conserved tissue elongation mechanism involving cell intercalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Dudley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahrens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2003</xref>). However, more recent live imaging studies in various model systems showed that cells do not intercalate to form columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romereim and Dudley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>). Instead, following cell division, sister cells undergo a cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion-dependent 90° rotation prior to separation. This rotation ensures that cells are neatly stacked with their short axis parallel to the P-D axis.</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted three fundamental principles governing column formation. First, columns consist of clonal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Dudley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romereim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahrens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Newton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizuhashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hallett et al., 2022</xref>). Whereas embryonic columns are multiclonal, postnatally, following the formation of secondary ossification centers, columns become monoclonal and originate from Pthrp + RZ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Newton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizuhashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hallett et al., 2022</xref>). The second principle is that cells within the column orient their short axis parallel to the P-D axis of the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Dudley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romereim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahrens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aszodi et al., 2003</xref>) within a threshold of 12° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The third rule pertains to the alignment of the column itself. The long axis is oriented parallel to the P-D axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodds, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Dudley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romereim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahrens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aszodi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moss-Salentijn et al., 1987</xref>) within a 12° threshold for single columns and a 20° threshold for complex columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Over the years, numerous studies have been dedicated to deciphering the molecular and cellular processes underpinning the formation of columns and their involvement in bone elongation. Studies in embryonic and postnatal mouse limbs have shown the importance of interactions between chondrocytes and the surrounding ECM. These studies have identified beta 1 and alpha 10 integrins, along with α-parvin, as physical regulators governing cell polarity and rotation during column formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aszodi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bengtsson et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, studies in embryonic chick and mouse limbs have shown that cell surface signaling through the Fz/Vangl/PCP pathway plays a major role in regulating chondrocyte polarity and rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Dudley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahrens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>) and that GDF5 is involved in chondrocyte orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, studies in paralyzed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Killion et al., 2017</xref>) and muscle-less mouse embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pierantoni et al., 2021</xref> have uncovered the important role of muscle load in regulating cell polarity and column formation.</p><p>In this study, we analyze the 3D architecture of confetti-labeled clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plate of mice. Intriguingly, we found that chondrocytes in the embryonic growth plate are rarely arranged in columns. Instead, successive incomplete rotations during cell division result in non-stereotypic cell stacking that, in turn, give rise to elongated clusters oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal bone axis. However, in the postnatal growth plate clones, the rate of complete cell rotations increases, leading to the formation of complex columns through a combination of stereotypical and non-stereotypic cell stacking, as well as of small, orthogonally oriented clusters. Additionally, we observed that column formation is buffered, permitting deviations of up to 60% incomplete rotations between successive cells within columns. The presence of clusters and columns correlated temporally with the rates of growth plate elongation and expansion, suggesting that these structures support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development, while highlighting the imperative role of 3D analysis when studying complex cellular arrangements.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>3D imaging of cell clones in the embryonic growth plate reveals stacking patterns that do not support column formation</title><p>To date, a comprehensive 3D analysis of column formation in the mouse embryonic growth plate has not been performed. To address this gap, we conducted multicolor clonal lineage tracing on proximal tibia and distal femur growth plates of Col2a1-CreER:R26R-Confetti embryos. Labeled cellular clones were subjected to 3D morphometric analysis using our previously reported 3D MAPs pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In a spherical coordinate system, the elevation angle between two perfectly stacked cells at origin 0 would be 90° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating a complete rotation of the division plane during cell division. Visualization of cell doublets representative of various elevation angles employing two orthogonal viewing directions revealed that in 3D, typically stacked column cells are expected to exhibit elevation angles in the range of 60–90° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Notably, however, quantification of elevation angles revealed that less than 20% of doublets within a clone were typically stacked (distal femur, 17.6%; proximal tibia, 19.4%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>).

Atypically stacked cells, with elevation angles less than 60°, could still support longitudinal growth if the clones have elongated morphologies along the P-D axis of the growth plate. Thus, to characterize clone morphology, we extracted the long, medium, and short axes and measured the ratios between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). Ratios close to 1 across all axes would indicate a spherical shape, whereas ratios approaching 0 would reveal a flattened ellipsoidal shape. Results showed that the long axis of the clones was consistently at least twice the length of the short axis. Moreover, in half of the clones the long axes measured at least five times the length of the short axes (distal femur, 58%; proximal tibia, 47%), indicating ellipsoid morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Our findings of two distinct morphologies of postnatal clones and non-stereotypic stacking patterns in embryonic growth plate clones raised the question of the rotational threshold that is required to maintain a columnar structure.

Altogether, these results suggest that column formation is resilient, capable of tolerating 60% incomplete rotations. As incomplete rotations accumulate in a clone with every cell division and, subsequently, cross this tolerance threshold, the structure will expand orthogonal to the P-D axis and form a cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The ratio between growth plate expansion and elongation decreases as the bone grows</title><p>Our finding that the majority of embryonic clones formed clusters perpendicular to the P-D axis and that columns appeared only in the postnatal growth plate suggests that a multifunctional design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fröhlich et al., 2019</xref>) may allow pre- and postnatal bones to grow differently. Specifically, we hypothesized that while columns support bone elongation, clusters may support bone expansion. This implies that embryonic bones should expand at a higher rate than postnatal bones.

In this work, we studied column formation by analyzing the 3D structure of cell clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice, using a modified version of 3D MAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>). Addressing the three criteria for a column, we found that uniclonal and multiclonal columns are rare in the embryonic growth plate. Instead, most clones form elongated clusters that orient orthogonal to the longitudinal bone axis as a result of numerous incomplete rotations that occur during cell division within a clone. Postnatally, clones form complex columns from a combination of ordered and disordered stacks of cells, as well as small orthogonally oriented clusters. These morphological entities correlate with the temporal dynamics of growth plate elongation and expansion, suggesting that clusters and columns support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for the multifunctional design of the growth plate and its relation to bone growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During oriented cell division in the growth plate, the division plane rotation can range from 0° to 90° (brown–blue).

During this process, clones of flat PZ cells form stacks, resulting in alignment of the long axis of the column with the longitudinal bone axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodds, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Dudley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romereim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romereim and Dudley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aszodi et al., 2003</xref>). This arrangement is thought to restrict lateral cell density, thereby maximizing the effect of chondrocyte hypertrophy along the elongation axis of the bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romereim and Dudley, 2011</xref>). Our discovery that during embryogenesis, when bone elongation is at its highest, the growth plates contain only few columns, contradicts previous studies and reveals the need to reconsider the underlying mechanisms. Several possibilities could explain these differences. One plausible explanation is that earlier studies focused on the mechanism of division plane rotation in column formation, but they either analyzed small subsets of clonal doublets without tracking their contributions to columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romereim et al., 2014</xref>) or examined non-clonal doublets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>). Without integrating these aspects into a comprehensive study, it is difficult to confirm the existence of clonal columns and determine whether they are formed by cells that have undergone complete division plane rotation. Additionally, it is plausible that the clusters we identified intercalate in a manner that forms geometric non-clonal columns. This could explain the columnar arrangement of chondrocytes observed in histological sections of the growth plate. Moreover, the underlying mechanisms of column formation and the function of bone elongation may be regulated by this organization of clusters into geometric non-clonal columns, or increase in cell volume. The latter has been shown to be a major driver of longitudinal bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breur et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilsman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilsman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Breur et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Changes in chondrocyte morphology, proliferation, and matrix secretion may also play important roles in this process; however, their exact contributions to embryonic bone elongation are unclear.</p><p>As the cellular entity that regulates bone growth and morphology, the growth plate must balance between different requirements and constraints while performing its functions. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the growth plate follows the ‘multifunctional design’ principle. This concept addresses the need to reduce the size and complexity of systems which perform multiple tasks by implementing several functions within a single structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fröhlich et al., 2019</xref>). Our finding that embryonic bones extensively expand as they elongate supports the existence of a multifunctional design mechanism that allows coping with these different growth requirements. Elongated clusters that orient orthogonal to the longitudinal axis due to incomplete rotations during cell divisions might be the cellular strategy that enables growth plate expansion in the embryo. In line with this idea, disruption of cell polarity, which leads to more incomplete division plane rotations, causes bone widening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahrens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aszodi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuss et al., 2014</xref>), whereas recent simulation of the growth plate predicted that lack of rotation during cell division causes the bone to expand in width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yokoyama et al., 2024</xref>). Later, during postnatal stages, bone expansion decreases dramatically while longitudinal growth is maintained. Correlating with this change in growth strategy is the appearance of columns in the center of the growth plate and small orthogonal clusters on the edges. Interestingly, these small clusters were observed nearly a century ago by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dodds, 1930</xref> in the RZ of human phalanx growth plates. Our current analysis of these different morphologies suggests that columns contribute to bone elongation, as previously thought, whereas clusters may provide a mechanism to control local morphology of the growing bones. Additionally, clones in articular cartilage were shown to form by non-stereotypic cell stacking, similar to the clusters we observed, raising the question of the function they may serve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Decker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The rotation of the division plane is the cellular mechanism that underlies the formation of columns versus clusters. If indeed these cellular modalities are utilized to promote different growth strategies, then the mechanism that controls the division plane can be central in the regulation of bone morphology. Moreover, it can provide an adaptable means to shift between different growth strategies such as elongation, expansion, and curvature formation. Interestingly, a simulation of cell adhesion in the growth plate showed that considering the mechanical confinement of the chondrocyte matrix, a complete rotation is energetically favorable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yokoyama et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, the low rates of complete division plane rotations, deduced from the doublet elevation angle analysis, suggest that the orientation of the division plane is tightly regulated. While the mechanisms that regulates the rotation of the division plane during bone growth are not fully understood, previous work provides several indications for both mechanical and molecular signals. These include Fz/Vangl/PCP signaling, integrins and muscle force, as well as matrix composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li and Dudley, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahrens et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shwartz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aszodi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bengtsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang and Mlodzik, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Killion et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pierantoni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prein et al., 2016</xref>).

Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that clones switch from orthogonally oriented clusters to parallel columns at that time point.</p><p>One limitation of our rotation analysis is that in order to calculate the relative position between neighboring cells, we assumed that chondrocyte rotation and orientation are correlated and that chondrocytes do not move after rotating, as was previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Romereim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover. growth plates of various organisms employ different strategies to create bones of diverse morphologies, which serve different functions such as running, swimming, flying, etc. Thus, it is possible that in each context, the ratio between clusters and columns is adjusted to cope with these different requirements.</p><p>Here, we discovered that the core mechanism underlying chondrocyte column formation, namely a complete rotation of the division plane during chondrocyte proliferation, is rare in the embryonic growth plate. Our 3D analyses reveal the temporal dynamics of division plane rotations and their effect on the formation of columns and clusters in the pre- and postnatal growth plate, as well as the correlation of these morphogenetic processes with different growth behaviors. Overall, these findings establish a new model for column formation and provide a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation and expansion during development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Col2-CreER<sup>T</sup></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:006774">IMSR_JAX:006774</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (mouse)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R26R-Confetti</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:017492">IMSR_JAX:017492</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Col2CreER-F</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers (stock # 006774)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAC TGC GGG CTC TAC TTC AT</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Col2CreER-R</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers<break/>(stock # 006774)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ACC AGC AGC ACT TTT GGA AG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Confetti-mutant Forward</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers<break/>(stock # 017492)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GAA TTA ATT CCG GTA TAA CTT CG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Confetti-WT Forward</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers<break/>(stock # 017492)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAA GTC GCT CTG AGT TGT TAT</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Confetti-common</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers<break/>(stock # 017492)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CCA GAT GAC TAC CTA TCC TC</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tamoxifen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T-5648</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Draq5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">62252</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1:2000 for embryonic samples and 1:1500 for postnatal samples</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>For genetic labeling of chondrocyte clones in embryonic and postnatal growth plates, Col2a1-CreER:R26R-Confetti heterozygous mice were generated by crossing mice homozygous for Col2-CreER<sup>T</sup> (Jackson Laboratories, FVB-Tg (Col2a1-cre/ERT)KA3Smac/J; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakamura et al., 2006</xref>) with R26R-Confetti homozygotes (Jackson Laboratories, B6.129P2-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(CAG-Brainbow2.1)Cle</sup></italic>/J; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Snippert et al., 2010</xref>).

As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Newton et al., 2019</xref>), we rarely observed GFP clones in the growth plate.</p><p>Growth plates were imaged as a z-stack using a galvo scanner through a HC PL APO ×20/0.75 CS2 objective (scan speed, 400 Hz; zoom, 0.75; line average, 4; bit depth, 8; Z step, 0.39 µm). For embryonic samples, a format of 4096 × 4096 (XY) was used resulting in a pixel size of 180 nm (XY) and for postnatal samples, a format of 2000 × 2000 (XY) produced a pixel size of 369 nm (XY). Z stacks were acquired using the galvo scanner (objective movement) at 0.39 µm intervals.</p><p>Embryonic samples were imaged with a single field of view (FOV), which covered the middle of the RZ through the beginning of the COJ. Postnatal samples were imaged with multiple overlapping FOVs (10% overlap), which covered the entire growth plate from the bottom of the secondary ossification center through the beginning of the COJ. Postnatal images were stitched in ImarisStitcher 9.9.0 (Bitplane).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Growth plate segmentation</title><p>To generate a mask of the growth plate, Microscopy Image Browser (version 2.81) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belevich et al., 2016</xref>) was used to manually segment the region between the secondary ossification center and the COJ in postnatal images and the entire growth plate region until the COJ in embryonic images. Additionally, a mask of the HZ was created by identifying the cells with the stereotypic chromatin staining unique to this zone.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Nuclei segmentation</title><p>Images of fluorescently stained nuclei were automatically segmented as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartschat et al., 2016</xref>). For embryonic images, a Gaussian blur filter (radius 2) and background subtraction (rolling ball radius 25) was applied in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) prior to segmentation. We used standard deviations of <italic>σ</italic> = 12 for RZ, PZ, and PHZ nuclei and of <italic>σ</italic> = 25 for HZ nuclei for embryonic images and <italic>σ</italic> = 5 for RZ, PZ, and PHZ nuclei and of <italic>σ</italic> = 8 for HZ nuclei for postnatal images. Subsequently, local intensity maxima were extracted from the LoG-filtered image and reported as potential nuclear centers. For each potential seed point, we computed the mean intensity in a 4 × 4 × 4 voxel-wide cube for embryonic samples and 2 × 2 × 2 voxel-wide cube for postnatal samples surrounding the centroid. All image analyses were performed on a Windows Server 2012 R2 64-bit workstation with 2 Intel(R) Xeon(R)CPU E5-2687W v4 processors, 512 GB RAM, 24 cores and 48 logical processors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Clone segmentation</title><p>To generate a mask of each clone, .lif files were converted to.ims files using the Imaris file converter (version 9.8.0). Imaris surfaces tool was used to create surfaces and extract the three clone masks (yfp, rfp, and cfp) from the image; Gfp clones were not present in the images. Surfaces were created with a grain size of 1.00 µm using the absolute intensity feature, with thresholds varying depending on the image. Surfaces with volumes greater than 150 µm<sup>3</sup> were kept for further analysis. Next, the clone masks were overlapped with the raw signal in Fiji to inspect the quality of the segmentation. Quality was high in images where clones did not touch each other. In images with high labeling efficiency, where clones touched each other, some clone segmentations needed to be manually corrected in MIB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Nucleus and clone feature extraction</title><p>Following image segmentation and masking, separate segmented images were created for each clone mask in Fiji (S1 data) by assigning pixels outside of the clone mask and growth plate mask a value of 0. Next, segmented clone and nuclear images were relabeled using Morpholib plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Legland et al., 2016</xref>) and converted to 16- or 32-bit float depending on the number of objects in each image (S2 data). Images were reoriented in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) so that the proximal-distal bone axis aligned to the Y-axis of the image coordinate. Nucleus and clone features were extracted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>) in MATLAB (version R2017b) with a volume range of 100–1200 µm for nuclei and 150–500 × 10<sup>7</sup> µm for clones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Morphometric analysis</title><p>Clone morphometrics, such as PC coefficients and PC orientations, were calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>). Cluster, column, or clone size was defined as the number of nuclei per cluster, column, or clone. These morphometric features were displayed as a histogram, a 3D morphology map, or both.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Correlation analysis between cells and nuclei</title><p>To evaluate whether nuclear centroids can be used as a proxy for cell centroids, we performed correlation analysis on our previously published dataset of a wild-type tibia sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>). This dataset included segmentation data on both nuclei and cells from the entire growth plate, but not clone information. We matched between cells and nuclei in the dataset by calculating pairwise distances between centroids of cells and nuclei. Pairs were considered matched if the centroid distance was less than 20 μm and the ‘closest cell to a nucleus’ was a mutual neighbor to the ‘closest nucleus to a cell’, resulting in 45,166 paired cells and nuclei.</p><p>To simulate random clones in the tibia sample, we generated clones of various sizes, radii, and random positions along the P-D axis. These parameters were sampled from real clone sizes in the embryonic distal femur sample. Within the pool of matched cell–nucleus pairs, we determined the number of cell centroid positions falling within the randomly sampled sphere radius and P-D positions, allowing a variation of up to 15% of the P-D height on either side. While cells meeting these criteria may or may not match the desired clone size, we calculated pairwise distances for these cells, sorting them from largest to smallest. Using the single-connected component method, detailed in the ‘Doublet quantification’ subsection, we removed the farthest-apart cells and continued this process to obtain single connected components of cells with the desired clone size.</p><p>A total of 1278 random clones were generated in the paired data. Within these clones, we calculated the elevation angle for cell doublets and nuclear doublets separately and visualized the variation between them in a histogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The results indicated a striking similarity in histogram distribution. Additionally, we computed the Pearson correlation between the mean elevation angle in a clone based on either cell or nuclear centroids, resulting in a correlation value of 0.79 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results suggest that elevation angle calculation performed on nuclei can serve as a reliable proxy for cell-based measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Doublet quantification</title><p>For doublet quantification in clones, the process starts by measuring distances between the centroids of all possible pairs of nuclei to identify the nearest neighbor pairs. These distances are sorted from low to high, establishing them as edges in the graph. For instance, in a clone with five nodes, there are 10 potential edges. The single-connected component method is applied to understand the graph’s topology and the distribution of nuclei within the clone. In a linear or columnar topology, a connected component should have a maximum of four edges (e.g., 1–2, 2–3, 3–4, 4–5). In a spherical-like topology, a connected component can have all 10 edges. The analysis begins with the smallest edge in the list. It is checked if this edge forms a single connected component. If not, the next smallest edge is added in the list, and this process continues. When a single connected component is achieved, the addition of edges stops. The final list of edges obtained in this manner defines the clone’s topology, with each edge termed as a doublet. These edges, present in the final list, are utilized as total number of doublets for the subsequent elevation angle analysis.</p><p>To evaluate the potential noise introduced into the measurement by measuring all nuclei pairs, the proportion of elevation angles as a function of number of nuclei neighbors per columns and clusters was calculated as well as the population statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We observed consistent patterns for both columns and clusters at any chosen number of nuclei neighbors. The range of the proportion of elevation angles between 60 and 90° for 1–5 neighbors in columns was 13.2–15.5% for the distal femur and 16.3–21% for the proximal tibia. For clusters, the range was 27.8–35.5% for the distal femur and 29.1–36.5% for the proximal tibia. The mean elevation angle distribution (60–90°) from 1 to 10 neighbors is 14.5% (columns) and 28.4% (clusters) in the distal femur and 19.5% (columns) and 29.7% (clusters) in the proximal tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). The proportion of elevation angles up to 10 nuclei neighbors within columns and clusters represents up to 99.1% (distal femur: 99.1%; proximal tibia: 98.8%) of all nuclei doublet pairs in columns and up to 71.6% (distal femur: 71.6%; proximal tibia: 62%) in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3E and F</xref>). While examination of the influence of increasing neighbors on the proportion of elevation angles between 60 and 90° did not show any statistical significance in columns, we found clusters to show statistical significance (p-value&lt;0.05, two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test) when comparing the mean of lower number of neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lecuit and Lenne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Irvine and Wieschaus, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailles et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collinet and Lecuit, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutherland et al., 2020</xref>) with larger numbers of nuclei neighbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sutherland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rubin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breur et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilsman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wilsman et al., 1996</xref>) for both the distal femur and proximal tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). This suggests that measuring elevation angle of nuclei doublets in clusters has slight noise present due to the spatial organization of nuclei in the clone, while the variation in columns is insignificant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Calculation of elevation angle and the angle between clone and PD axis</title><p>To determine the elevation angle between nuclei in a doublet, we first transformed the Cartesian coordinates of doublet to a spherical coordinate system, in which the Z-axis represents the P-D bone axis. Then, we shifted the mean position of a doublet to the origin zero and used the MATLAB function cart2sph to obtain the elevation angle (phi) and the radius (r). The elevation angle was measured as the angle between the projected line of a nucleus on the XY plane to the line connecting two nuclear centroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The XY plane is perpendicular to the Z-axis. If one nucleus in the doublet has an elevation angle of phi, the angle of the other nucleus is -phi. The elevation angle values are in the range of [-pi/2, pi/2]. The radius in the spherical coordinate system is equivalent to half of the distance between two nuclei in a Cartesian coordinate system. The elevation angle between two nuclei lying on top of one another is 90°, whereas the angle between two nuclei that are positioned next to each other in the XY plane is 0. Because the elevation angles of nuclei in a doublet mirror each other, we only used the absolute value.</p><p>To determine the distribution of elevation angles, we divided them into seven categories: between 0 and &lt;15° (magenta), between 15 and &lt;30° (yellow), between 30 and &lt;45° (cyan), between 45 and &lt;60° (green), between 60 and &lt;70° (orange), between 70 and &lt;80° (red), and between 80 and 90° (blue). The mean value of each category is reported as the elevation angle for column or cluster clone.</p><p>The angle between clone and PD axis (theta) was calculated using the MATLAB function ‘theta = atan2(norm(cross(u,v)),dot(u,v))’, where u and v are two vector representing PD axis and clone orientation. If the function value exceeded 90°, the reported value was (180°-theta). Finally, to use the same notation as for the elevation angle analysis, the PD-PC angle is reported as (90°-theta). Thus, if the longest axis of the clone (PC1) is parallel to PD axis, then the reported value is 90°, and if it is perpendicular, then the reported value is 0°.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Multiclone formation analysis through clone merging</title><p>In our analysis of embryonic data, clones were merged based on the criterion that the distance between any nucleus within one clone to any neighboring clone was less than 15 μm.

All properties of merged clones were computed in the same manner as for individual clones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification of growth plate elongation and expansion rates</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>Micro-CT image dataset</title><p>We used a previously published micro-CT database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stern et al., 2015</xref>) to analyze eight different growth plates at three developmental stages (E17.5-E18.5, P14-P16, and P32-P40).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Prove the validity of the methodology that the authors used to measure nuclear elevation angles and define clonal orientations (morphometric analyses: are fetal clone sizes sufficiently large to reflect the orientation?) – related to comments by Reviewer 2 and 3.</p><p>2) Establish the correlation between column/cluster organization and length-width ratios by calcein dye front labeling (or another method) to measure the change in the growth cartilage diameter over the same time – related to comments by Reviewer 1 and 2.</p><p>3) Stratify clone data according to the position in the resting and proliferative zones (top, middle, and bottom of each zone) to map clone development over time – related to comments by Reviewer 2.</p><p>4) Address inconsistencies with the literature and provide a more balanced consideration of the past findings to place the current findings better in context.

You would then be able to test the hypothesis that the change in orientation of the columns is correlated (or not) with the dominant direction(s) of growth over the time period of interest.</p><p>It would be nice to make the code for the analysis pipeline available publicly in the interest of open science.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this is an interesting study that introduces a more sophisticated clonal generation method and presents a new approach to data collection and analysis that together may also have high potential more generally for studies of tissue growth and morphology. However, there are several major issues that need addressing to increase confidence in these results and conclusions:</p><p>1. The title &quot;Bone elongation in the embryo occurs without column formation in the growth plate&quot; is misleading for two reasons: (1) Figure 1 clearly shows columns of cells in the embryo – as acknowledged by the authors – and (2) the conclusion results from correlative studies and was not tested by experimental manipulation. One should not make such strong statements in the absence of mechanistic data or the presence of conflicting evidence. State what the data show, not what you want it to show.</p><p>2. The main argument in this manuscript appears to be more semantic than substantive. The authors report that the vast majority of clones in the embryo exist as clusters, yet 2D imaging of the embryo mostly reveals short columns (as stated above). The authors state that the cluster arrangement of clones can only be visualized in 3D. This suggests that &quot;clusters&quot; are possibly &quot;clusters of columns&quot; and not clusters of the structure diagrammed in Figure 6. As mentioned in the first paragraph, we already knew that not all cells rotate completely (some partial and some not) after division and therefore a single clone forming adjacent columns or &quot;branching&quot; is expected at some frequency based on the efficiency and geometry of rotation. It might be more accurate to state the current work shows that the efficiency of rotation is less or that under-rotating cells have a greater effect on clone morphology than previously thought. Either way, this is a refinement, not a violation, of the current mechanistic paradigm.</p><p>3. The emphasis on nuclear elevation measurements is not particularly convincing. Whether the alignment of nuclei reflects rotation or is simply the most efficient packing method for two cells in a constrained environment is not certain. Presenting the expectation of nuclear stacking is a &quot;straw man&quot; argument.</p><p>4. Concerns about the measured data extend to the methodology. In general, the final &quot;calculated&quot; model should reflect what is observed in the raw data. The &quot;clusters&quot; described in the graphs or schematized in Figure 6 are not visible in the raw data. The authors mention the 2D vs. 3D problem, but this is not the issue. A single section (physical or optical) should cut through different clusters at different angles. The final result should be an image containing clone morphologies at the ratio in which they appear in the tissue. This is especially true for clones arranged medial to lateral – the predominant clone type reported – given the sagittal sections and radial symmetry of the growth plate. Unfortunately, the graphical data and the raw image data appear in conflict and therefore I do not have high confidence in this analysis and the resulting model.</p><p>5. Although clonal analysis is a powerful technique, this specific study is predicated on the assumption that the clones observed in the proliferative zone originated from recombination events in single proliferative zone cells. However, a confounding factor is that endochondral ossification progressively removes proliferative chondrocytes through hypertrophy and remodeling of the calcified cartilage matrix. This means that the short (P-D axis) clones in the short proliferative zone of embryonic growth plates have limited resident lifetimes, which based on the growth rate is probably 24-48 hours. This would not affect the analysis of the longer clones of the postnatal growth plate that would require substantially longer periods to be completely removed. This is an important distinction because the authors induce recombination (cell labeling) in the embryo 96 hours before performing the analysis. Thus, most of the clones that were analyzed are likely to have derived from recombination events that occurred in the resting zone. Previous work demonstrated that resting zone clones expand in clusters and laterally rather than in columns as is common with proliferative chondrocytes. Therefore, a resting zone clone that enters the proliferative zone could appear as a single column (if labeled after the last resting cell division), or as a cluster of columns or a mixture of columns and other cell arrangements depending on how many cells in the resting clone are synchronously incorporated into the proliferative zone and how many cells in the new proliferative cluster divide before analysis. This is potentially a fatal flaw for this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Review attachment:</p><p>https://submit.elifesciences.org/<italic>eLife</italic>_files/2024/01/02/00127070/00/127070_0_attach_6_4060_convrt.pdf</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Limited column formation in the embryonic growth plate implies divergent growth mechanisms during pre- and postnatal bone development&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kathryn Cheah (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>We would like to sincerely apologize for the substantial delay in getting back to you, which was due to the family emergency of both the reviewer and the reviewing editor. As you see below, we think that the additional concerns from the two reviewers can be addressed by modifying the main text/title and appending the discussion without any additional experimentation.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>First, I would like to apologize to the authors, the other reviewers, and the editor for this delayed response. I have been out of town dealing with medical issues pertaining to my parents. I should have been more responsive to the request ofr re-review, but each day's needs ate up all my time and energy.</p><p>I appreciate the effort by the authors to present new data and analyses to support the conclusions of the manuscript. I am especially pleased with the growth study as these data support a long-held conjecture that was never directly tested. I also appreciate the short-term labeling experiment, although these results raise more questions than answers as most small clones appear columnar and the unexpected large clones (not expected to exceed 4 cells in 48 hours) suggest either the presence of a subset of unusually proliferative cells or a potential caveat with the labeling method.</p><p>At this point, I support publication of these data with some small additions to the text. I am still not convinced of the conclusions, but I think the community should have access to the data to stimulate new experiments. The text additions are to put some of the findings into context and to highlight some remaining disconnects.</p><p>A. The claim that prenatal chondrocytes rarely form columns is at odds with two established observations in the field. (1) Histological analysis of tissue sections shows that most (80-90%) of groups of chondrocytes in the proliferative zone of embryonic cartilage exhibit what most would call columnar organization. I have revisited serial sections generated by my own lab to confirm this idea, which is also supported by the 2D images in this manuscript. (2) Live-imaging observations show that the majority (80-90%) of cell divisions result in rotation to a position consistent with column structure.</p><p>I think these differences between past literature and this manuscript should be explicitly stated and addressed in the discussion. What is the disconnect between these experimental observations?</p><p>B. I still don't understand why the cluster structure and orthogonal expansion is only observable by 3D clonal imaging and why cluster structures only observable from a &quot;particular viewing angle&quot;. Regardless of how clones are oriented in the cartilage, sagittal and transverse histological or optical sections should intersect these cluster structures, but non-column structures are rarely observed in histological sections and many of your 2D images also predominantly show column structures. It is interesting that most of the non-columnar organizations and expansions appear in the z-axis (based on the representative images), for which resolution of optical microscopes is reduced by about 2.5 fold relative to the x and y axes. If clones are defined by cells labeled with the same color that are close together, close is different in the z-axis. What is unique about clusters such that only your method shows these cell groups?</p><p>C. In the discussion, you state &quot;the very low rate of complete rotations we observed in the embryo suggests that the orientation of the division plane is tightly regulated to prevent such rotations.&quot; (1) You did not observe rotations. Rotations were inferred retrospectively from static data from fixed tissue. Only live imaging allows observation of rotations. This is a crucial distinction, and efforts should be made not to mislead the reader. (2) How is the orientation of the division plane the main factor in cluster formation? Live cell imaging established long ago that the division plane is tightly regulated in proliferative chondrocytes, most of which undergo normal rotations. It is rare to observe wild type chondrocytes that position the cell division plane (i.e., cleavage furrow) other than parallel (+/- 15 degrees) to the column axis to generate two cells that are initially oriented orthogonal to the column axis. How does regulating the orientation of the division plane factor into your model considering these established observations of cells that undergo normal rotation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Many of my comments were consistent with those of Reviewers 1 and 2. I do appreciate that the authors changed the title of the manuscript, because I agree with Reviewer 2 that the first submission overstated the findings and their advance to the field. The new title is much more appropriate.</p><p>In Figure 5 S2, I appreciate the effort to correlate nuclear position with cell centroid, but I don't understand why the authors used previously published growth plate data for proximal tibia rather than segmenting the data in this manuscript to show this correlation holds at younger and older stages.</p><p>I do find Figure 1S2 to be helpful in thinking about the organization of these clones in three-dimensions. However, given these complex 3D morphologies, I think it's important to note in the second paragraph of the Results that these doublet pairs do not necessarily (and often don't) represent sister cells. I had previously thought these were sister pairs, so the complexity of cell orientations in a cluster was initially lost on me.</p><p>I appreciate the clone size subdivision to show that clone orientation isn't simply a function of clone size.</p><p>I appreciate that the authors recognize that there was previous awareness in the literature of the variance of columnar organization by species/growth plate/age, and I acknowledge that these past works were not able to take clonality into consideration. Yes, reviews and textbooks have oversimplified the illustration of 'growth plate organization', but this manuscript isn't the first data to show it's more nuanced, and although the prior literature wasn't so nicely quantitative, it was more than 'anecdotal'. Acknowledging these past works does not detract from a revised model with new data, and I think that Reviewer 2 and I both saw that this manuscript overstated its findings and impact on the field in this regard. I do appreciate that the authors have now added a sentence about the 'cell nests' observed by Dodd and that they discuss the fact that growth plate organization differs by species. The change in the title has helped, as did the removal of direct 'compare and contrast' with recent chick data.</p><p>I think that the quantification of elongation and lateral enlargement over time has added substantially to the manuscript and provides a plausible explanation for WHY there may be a difference in clonal organization in young versus older growth plates. This adds to the story in a meaningful way, and the revised manuscript is advances the field more than the initially submitted version.</p><p>Suggested title change: &quot;Postnatal columnar organization of the mouse growth plate follows limited columnar organization in the embryo and shifts the axes of bone growth&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95289.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) Prove the validity of the methodology that the authors used to measure nuclear elevation angles and define clonal orientations (morphometric analyses: are fetal clone sizes sufficiently large to reflect the orientation?) – related to comments by Reviewer 2 and 3.</p></disp-quote><p>The validation of our methodologies is described above in our responses to points 3 and 5 of Reviewer 2 and points 2-5 of Reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Establish the correlation between column/cluster organization and length-width ratios by calcein dye front labeling (or another method) to measure the change in the growth cartilage diameter over the same time – related to comments by Reviewer 1 and 2.</p></disp-quote><p>The correlation between column/cluster organization and length-width ratios is described in our responses to point 1 of Reviewer 1 and point 9 of Reviewer 3.

In the embryo, even if we ignore local cell stacking behaviors and focus only on global orientation of the clone with a permissive range of ±30 degrees, most clones do not orient in the direction of longitudinal bone growth. This violates the current mechanistic paradigm of a columnar structure and, thus, in our opinion the clones cannot be viewed as &quot;clusters of columns&quot;. In the postnatal growth plate, where we did observe columns, we agree that branching does not change the paradigm, but rather is a refinement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

For that, we used previously published growth plate data [1] of the proximal tibia, where cell and nuclear segmentations were available, to generate artificial clones. We then measured the elevation angles between cell doublets using either nuclear centroids or cell centroids as input. As seen in Supplementary figure 6A, the distributions of elevation angles were nearly identical. Additionally, Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.79 shows that the data based on nucleus and cell centroids are highly correlated (Supplementary figure 6B). Together, these results show that the alignment of nuclei reflects the amount of cell rotation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This is potentially a fatal flaw for this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer’s assertion that allowing the cells to divide and rearrange for 4 days prior to analysis is a flaw. The growth plate is an engine that drives bone growth through the sequential morphogenesis and rearrangement of cells along its zones. The current dogma is that this happens through column formation and subsequent hypertrophy, which together directs growth along the longitudinal axis of the bone. Thus, the concept is that clone morphology supports growth in a preferred direction. If this is true, although we would expect most clones to originate in the proliferative zone, its origin does not matter. Additionally, the reviewer’s claim is based on the assumption that the proliferation rate and resident lifetime of chondrocytes are correlated. To our knowledge, no one has yet tested the behavior of proliferating chondrocytes experimentally and the proportion of chondrocytes that are stationary or move out of the zone is unknown.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concerns about labeling time, we performed new pulsechase experiments of up to 48 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>).

In Figure 1h of the 2017 paper, the authors describe that &quot;For individual clones with more than two cells, the angle (&lt;t) between the minor axis of each cell relative to the tissue proximodistal axis was measured (h1).&quot; In this current manuscript under consideration, the authors describe the elevation angle as the angle between two nuclei in a spherical coordinate system (illustrated in Figure 1F). They are clear about describing these two approaches, but then they try to make a direct comparison by stating &quot;Interestingly, perfect rotations characterized by elevation angles between 80-90°, which were previously predicted to be prevalent (19) were rare (. Figure 3G).&quot; Reference 19 is Li et al. 2017. I don't think this is an equivalent comparison given the difference in measurement approach, cell axis versus nuclei position, further discussed below.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we removed the direct comparison of column orientations using the different methods. The revised sentence reads:</p><p>“Moreover, perfect rotations, characterized by elevation angles between 80°-90°, were rare (5.8% in the DF and 5.6% in the PT; Figure 3G).”</p><p>2. The authors also do not clearly describe how they measure the nuclear elevation angle. As described in the methods, they shifted the mean position of a doublet to the origin (0) in a spherical coordinate system, and then Figure 1F illustrates an elevation angle relative to an X-Z plane. It is unclear from this illustration and from the description in the methods exactly how the XZ plane is established. It is also unclear from this illustration exactly how the elevation angle is calculated in three dimensions given that the three schematics (0, 45, 90 degrees) differ only in a two dimensional plane. There are examples for real cells in Figure 1G, but the figure resolution makes it impossible to tell which are solid and which are dashed black lines and what is the relevant angle.</p><p>We clarified in the Methods section and in Figure 1F and its legend how the elevation angle was calculated. Additionally, we added to the Results section a citation of a recent preprint that uses the same method to calculate elevation angles between cilia and nuclei [3]. The revised Methods subsection is listed below:</p><p>To determine the elevation angle between nuclei in a doublet, we first transformed the Cartesian coordinates of doublet to a spherical coordinate system, in which the Z-axis represents the P-D bone axis. Then, we shifted the mean position of a doublet to the origin zero and used the MATLAB function cart2sph to obtain the elevation angle (phi) and the radius (r).</p><p>The elevation angle was measured as the angle between the projected line of a nucleus on the XY plane to the line connecting two nuclear centroids (Figure 1F). The XY plane is perpendicular to the Z-axis. If one nucleus in the doublet has an elevation angle of phi, the angle of the other nucleus is -phi. The elevation angle values are in the range of [-pi/2, pi/2]. The radius in the spherical coordinate system is equivalent to half of the distance between two nuclei in a Cartesian coordinate system. The elevation angle between two nuclei lying on top of one another is 90°, whereas the angle between two nuclei that are positioned next to each other in the XY plane is 0. Because the elevation angles of nuclei in a doublet mirror each other, we only used the absolute value.</p><p>3. Perhaps using the geometric center of each cell rather than the nuclei positions would be a more accurate reflection of cell position.</p><p>Similar to our response to point 3 of Reviewer 2, we addressed this request experimentally by performing correlation analysis between elevation angles calculated from cell or nucleus centroids, as shown in Supplementary figure 6. Our results indicate that nuclear centers are a good proxy for cell centers.</p><p>4. The methods state &quot;Clone morphometrics, such as PC coefficients and PC orientations, were calculated as described previously (7).&quot; The referenced manuscript describes an approach to extract axes for individual cells but not for more complex clonal morphologies. Does PC1 map through the furthest two points on the perimeter of a clone, which is what I could consider the 'long axis' of a clone? If not, why not and what is the justification for using the PC1 axis for clone orientation versus the furthest two points on a perimeter?</p><p>PC1 maps the first principal component of the clone mask, corresponding to the major axis of the clone, along which the point clouds have the highest variance. The clone mask represents the combined cell cytoplasm and, thus, PC1 represents the long axis of the clone. We overlaid the PC1 vector with the clone mask and observed that it faithfully represents the long axis of the clone in both clusters and columns. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> shows several examples of embryonic and postnatal clones with their PC1 vectors indicated by black arrows.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>PC1 vectors overlaid on clones.</title><p>Three orthogonal viewing angles (XZ, YZ, XY) of PC1 vectors marked by black arrow overlaid on four clones from embryonic (a-d) and postnatal (e-h) growth plates. a,b,e,f are clusters, whereas c,d,g,h are columns.

The postnatal labeling time was 10 days, and clone sizes were <bold>much</bold> larger postnatally than at the fetal time point. This gives opportunity for larger clones to develop a longer long axis, which may align better with the true axis of growth. By contrast, the labeling duration of 4 days from E14.5 may not achieve sufficient clone sizes to reflect the overall proliferative zone growth structure. For example, if two flat cells with a long axis diameter of 10 μm each sit side by side in a small clone within a column that is aligned with the growth axis, there would have to be more than four well stacked cells with a short axis diameter of 5 μm each for the clone long axis to reflect its growth axis. Therefore, smaller clones could have axes that aren't reflective of the larger order they might be contained within. Either the labeling time should be extended, or the authors should show that fetal clone sizes are sufficiently large to reflect the orientation of their expansion.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concerns about the labeling time, we compared the ratio of columns per clone size in pre- and postnatal growth plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A-D</xref>). When we compared clones of the same size, i.e. 3-5 cells, 6-10 cells, and 11-20 cells, columns were consistently more frequent in postnatal growth plates. This suggests that the ability of cells to form columns is innately different between these two developmental stages. Additionally, we were fortunate to receive raw imaging data from Newton <italic>et al.</italic> (2019), who performed a 10-day pulse and chase experiment (E14.5 – P5) using the same mouse strains. Similar to our results, the clones in these growth plates also failed to form columns.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Column frequency per clone size.</title><p>Frequency of columns and clusters as a function of clone size in embryonic (A,B) and postnatal growth plates (C,D).

Interpretations – that this is a 'discovery' that some growth plates have no columns or that columns aren't perfectly organized in stacks and that 'longitudinal bone growth is governed by different cellular mechanisms during embryonic and postnatal development'. It has been documented that there is great variance in growth plate morphology both between species, within species, and by age. This includes variance in proliferative zone 'columnar organization'. The differences have been associated with relative growth rate with defined columns and larger hypertrophic chondrocytes observed in faster growing bones [see for example Dodds <italic>The Anatomical Record</italic> (1930), Wilsman et al. <italic>Journal of Orthopaedic Research</italic> (2008), and Hunziker <italic>Microscopy Research and Technique</italic> (1994)]. Dodds notes “'cell nests' in the distal end of a human infant phalanx (Figure 13 below) that 'do not pass through the flattened stage and no rows are formed' prior to enlarging near the marrow front and states that 'in the proximal end of the same bone the cells are in typical rows' (Figure 12 below). Therefore, a lack of strict columnar organization in growth plate cartilage is not a new observation.”</p><p>We are aware of the differential growth of growth plates, which is why we studied columns in the fast-growing growth plates of the proximal tibia and distal femur [2, 4-7]. The papers referenced by the reviewer do not report results of lineage tracing analyses, without which it is impossible to determine whether or not cell clones form columns. Clonality is a key part of the column definition. Additionally, while possible variability in column formation may have been discussed anecdotally, this is not reflected in the textbooks. As this is the first rigorous lineage tracing-based 3D study of column formation, we stand by our statement that the scarcity of clonal columns in the embryonic growth plate (less than 5%) is a discovery. To put our discovery in context, we added to the Discussion the limitations that we cannot rule out the possibility that clonal columns exist in other species.</p><p>7. Ernst Hunziker also notes the striking differences between species in his 1994 review. He remarks that &quot;The avian growth plate (proximal tibia; 4-week-old chick) is characterized by a very high cellularity, which somewhat masks a fairly high degree of structural anisotropy.&quot; It is therefore not surprising that the observations here in mice might differ from observations in chicken embryos (Li et al. 2017) even if the quantifications of cell orientations were done the same.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that we cannot rule out the possibility that our observations are unique to mice. To prevent confusion regarding the reach of our claims, we added to the Discussion a paragraph about possible diversity in growth plates of different organisms.</p><p>8. Most of the small orthogonally oriented clusters are clearly within the resting zone or very upper proliferative zone whereas the elongate clones are in the proliferative zone, and the authors state this. Dodds also described these 'cell nests' within the resting zone (epiphyseal) as small clusters separated by matrix space. Their discovery in this analysis is not new or surprising.</p><p>To clarify that “cell nests” were previously described as small clusters, we added a reference to Dodds’ paper to the Discussion.</p><p>9. Specifically, I would like to see the authors measure the rate of linear growth in each stage [P14.5-18.5 (or longer) and P30-P40], by calcein dye front labeling or another method, and to measure the change in diameter of the growth cartilage over the same time. I suspect that the ratio of longitudinal/axial growth at the fetal stage is lower than at the late juvenile stage, consistent with the difference in clone orientation orthogonal to the elongation axis. This would support the interpretation proposed in the discussion that clones oriented more orthogonal to the long axis might support greater axial versus longitudinal growth.</p><p>This very helpful suggestion was also made by Reviewer 1 (point 1). As detailed in our response to that comment, we performed this analysis, which indeed produced interesting findings on the relationship between the proportion of clusters and columns and elongation and expansion during bone growth. These results were added to Figure 6 and supplementary figure 8 (Figures L1 and L2 above).</p><p>10. In conclusion, I think the methods of measuring cell stacking and clone orientation need to be more clearly described and justified, especially to account for differences in nuclear versus cell stacking.</p><p>As mentioned, we clarified in the Methods section and in Figure 1F how the elevation angle was calculated and added a citation of a recent preprint reporting a similar analysis of elevation angles between cilia and nuclei. We performed correlation analysis to show that nuclear centers are a good proxy for cell centers for computation of elevation angles (Supplementary figure 6). Lastly, in the reply to point 4 above, we provide justification for clone orientation measurements.</p><p>11. I also think the findings need to be placed more accurately in the context of existing literature, because they are not as novel and surprising as they are currently presented.</p><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have expanded the discussion on how our findings fit into the context of existing literature.</p><p>12. Instances of 'embryonic' should be replaced with 'fetal', and these clones were labeled from E14.5 to E18.5. These are fetal stages.</p><p>The distinction between embryonic and fetal stages is important in the context of human in utero development. However, in studies of mouse development, this distinction is rarely made and the terms “embryo” and “embryonic” are used throughout gestation. For example, this citation is from a review by Crawford et al. (2010), which also references the seminal “The Atlas of Mouse Development” by Matthew H. Kaufman:</p><p>“The term “embryo” is used for the developing human individual from the time of implantation until the time of onset of bone marrow formation in the humerus, which is about the end of the eighth week postconception. After this stage and until birth, the term “fetus” is used… Since the mouse has a much shorter gestation period, the designation of “embryo” versus “fetus” is less important, whereas the developmental age post-conception is critically important. For this reason, the term “embryo” is used to define all stages of murine development between fertilization and birth with the stage of development indicated by the gestational age (E0.5 + days postconception) (Kaufman 1999).”</p><p>Crawford LW, Foley JF, Elmore SA.

Cells per area of tissue? I don't think this has been quantified, and it would vary by species/stage and matrix thickness. I think the authors mean that more cells are passing through the longitudinal axis, so perhaps instead use 'cell turnover'?</p><p>What we meant by this quote is that cells in the growth plate are concentrated along the proximal-distal axis as opposed to the medial-lateral or dorsal-ventral axis.

I have been out of town dealing with medical issues pertaining to my parents. I should have been more responsive to the request ofr re-review, but each day's needs ate up all my time and energy.</p><p>I appreciate the effort by the authors to present new data and analyses to support the conclusions of the manuscript. I am especially pleased with the growth study as these data support a long-held conjecture that was never directly tested. I also appreciate the short-term labeling experiment, although these results raise more questions than answers as most small clones appear columnar and the unexpected large clones (not expected to exceed 4 cells in 48 hours) suggest either the presence of a subset of unusually proliferative cells or a potential caveat with the labeling method.</p><p>At this point, I support publication of these data with some small additions to the text. I am still not convinced of the conclusions, but I think the community should have access to the data to stimulate new experiments. The text additions are to put some of the findings into context and to highlight some remaining disconnects.</p><p>A. The claim that prenatal chondrocytes rarely form columns is at odds with two established observations in the field. (1) Histological analysis of tissue sections shows that most (80-90%) of groups of chondrocytes in the proliferative zone of embryonic cartilage exhibit what most would call columnar organization. I have revisited serial sections generated by my own lab to confirm this idea, which is also supported by the 2D images in this manuscript. (2) Live-imaging observations show that the majority (80-90%) of cell divisions result in rotation to a position consistent with column structure.</p><p>I think these differences between past literature and this manuscript should be explicitly stated and addressed in the discussion. What is the disconnect between these experimental observations?</p></disp-quote><p>To address the differences highlighted by the reviewer between past literature and our manuscript we have added a paragraph to the discussion that explains these apparent differences.</p><p>“Our discovery that during embryogenesis, when bone elongation is at its highest, the growth plates contain only few columns, contradicts previous studies and reveals the need to reconsider the underlying mechanisms. Several possibilities could explain these differences. One plausible explanation is that earlier studies focused on the mechanism of division plane rotation in column formation, but they either analyzed small subsets of clonal doublets without tracking their contributions to columns (<italic>19, 20</italic>) or examined non-clonal doublets (<italic>30</italic>). Without integrating these aspects into a comprehensive study, it is difficult to confirm the existence of clonal columns and determine whether they are formed by cells that have undergone complete division plane rotation. Additionally, it is plausible that the clusters we identified intercalate in a manner that forms geometric non-clonal columns. This could explain the columnar arrangement of chondrocytes observed in histological sections of the growth plate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B. I still don't understand why the cluster structure and orthogonal expansion is only observable by 3D clonal imaging and why cluster structures only observable from a &quot;particular viewing angle&quot;. Regardless of how clones are oriented in the cartilage, sagittal and transverse histological or optical sections should intersect these cluster structures, but non-column structures are rarely observed in histological sections and many of your 2D images also predominantly show column structures. It is interesting that most of the non-columnar organizations and expansions appear in the z-axis (based on the representative images), for which resolution of optical microscopes is reduced by about 2.5 fold relative to the x and y axes. If clones are defined by cells labeled with the same color that are close together, close is different in the z-axis. What is unique about clusters such that only your method shows these cell groups?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised the possibility that our results might be due to imaging artifacts. To address this concern, we would like to draw the reviewer's attention to Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 and Videos 1-11, where it is clearly apparent that the clusters are visible in all axes, not just along the Z axis. Furthermore, as cited in our paper, the study by Decker et al. (2017) on articular cartilage found that upon chondrocyte proliferation, clusters and stacks of non-daughter cells were formed. This provides additional support that our observations are not artifacts. Finally, to rule out any possibility that our data is flawed in a way that could lead to incorrect conclusions, we reached out to Prof. Andrei S. Chagin, who generously shared with us his imaging data from Newton et al. (2019). In this study, they initiated labeling of chondrocytes in the growth plate at E14.5 and analyzed clones at P5. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> of our last response letter, we found that, similar to our data, many clones form clusters rather than columns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C. In the discussion, you state &quot;the very low rate of complete rotations we observed in the embryo suggests that the orientation of the division plane is tightly regulated to prevent such rotations.&quot; (1) You did not observe rotations. Rotations were inferred retrospectively from static data from fixed tissue. Only live imaging allows observation of rotations. This is a crucial distinction, and efforts should be made not to mislead the reader. (2) How is the orientation of the division plane the main factor in cluster formation? Live cell imaging established long ago that the division plane is tightly regulated in proliferative chondrocytes, most of which undergo normal rotations. It is rare to observe wild type chondrocytes that position the cell division plane (i.e., cleavage furrow) other than parallel (+/- 15 degrees) to the column axis to generate two cells that are initially oriented orthogonal to the column axis. How does regulating the orientation of the division plane factor into your model considering these established observations of cells that undergo normal rotation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer's suggestion and have changed the wording of this paragraph.</p><p>“The rotation of the division plane is the cellular mechanism that underlies the formation of columns versus clusters. If indeed these cellular modalities are utilized to promote different growth strategies, then the mechanism that controls the division plane can be central in the regulation of bone morphology. Moreover, it can provide an adaptable means to shift between different growth strategies such as elongation, expansion, and curvature formation. Interestingly, a simulation of cell adhesion in the growth plate showed that considering the mechanical confinement of the chondrocyte matrix, a complete rotation is energetically favorable (<italic>44</italic>). Thus, the low rates of complete division plane rotations, deduced from the doublet elevation angle analysis, suggests that the orientation of the division plane is tightly regulated.”</p><p>Regarding the further questions raised by the reviewer, we have provided a comprehensive answer, which we have now included in the Discussion section in response to the first remark. We have also included in the discussion a paragraph stating the limitations of our study.</p><p>“One limitation of our rotation analysis is that in order to calculate the relative position between neighboring cells, we assumed that chondrocyte rotation and orientation are correlated and that chondrocytes do not move after rotating, as was previously suggested (20, 30)”</p><p>Finally, assuming that after division the chondrocytes do not change their positions, then in cases where the rotation of the division plane is partial, instead of stacking to form a column, the cells would spread horizontally, forming a cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Many of my comments were consistent with those of Reviewers 1 and 2.

The new title is much more appropriate.</p><p>In Figure 5 S2, I appreciate the effort to correlate nuclear position with cell centroid, but I don't understand why the authors used previously published growth plate data for proximal tibia rather than segmenting the data in this manuscript to show this correlation holds at younger and older stages.</p></disp-quote><p>Accurate 3D cell segmentation is a time-consuming process.
