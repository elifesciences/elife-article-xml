While PTH can stimulate osteo-progenitor expansion and bone synthesis, how the PTH-signaling intensity in progenitors is controlled is unclear. Endochondral bone osteoblasts arise from perichondrium-derived osteoprogenitors and hypertrophic chondrocytes (HC). We found, via single-cell transcriptomics, that HC-descendent cells activate membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) and the PTH pathway as they transition to osteoblasts in neonatal and adult mice. Unlike <italic>Mmp14</italic> global knockouts, postnatal day 10 (p10) HC lineage-specific <italic>Mmp14</italic> null mutants (Mmp14ΔHC) produce more bone. Mechanistically, MMP14 cleaves the extracellular domain of PTH1R, dampening PTH signaling, and consistent with the implied regulatory role, in Mmp14ΔHC mutants, PTH signaling is enhanced. We found that HC-derived osteoblasts contribute ~50% of osteogenesis promoted by treatment with PTH 1–34, and this response was amplified in Mmp14ΔHC. MMP14 control of PTH signaling likely applies also to both HC- and non-HC-derived osteoblasts because their transcriptomes are highly similar. Our study identifies a novel paradigm of MMP14 activity-mediated modulation of PTH signaling in the osteoblast lineage, contributing new insights into bone metabolism with therapeutic significance for bone-wasting diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteogenesis</kwd><kwd>bone mass</kwd><kwd>chondrocyte-osteoblast lineage</kwd><kwd>parathyroid hormone signaling</kwd><kwd>metalloproteinases</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AoE/M-04/04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheah</surname><given-names>Kathryn Song Eng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T12-708/12N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheah</surname><given-names>Kathryn Song Eng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Health and Medical Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>07183766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheah</surname><given-names>Kathryn Song Eng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003803</institution-id><institution>University of Hong Kong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Jimmy &amp; Emily Tang Professorship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheah</surname><given-names>Kathryn Song Eng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>MMP14 activity-mediated cleavage of the ectodomain of PTH1R modulates PTH signaling in the chondrocyte-derived osteoblast lineage, regulating osteogenesis and thereby bone metabolism, with therapeutic significance for bone-wasting diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Developing and maintaining appropriate proportions of cells of the osteoblast lineage and other cell types (e.g., osteoclasts, endothelial cells, adipocytes, stem cells) in the bone marrow are crucial for healthy bones. These cell types together maintain bone mass via concerted activities of bone building (anabolic) by osteoblasts versus bone resorption (catabolic) by osteoclasts, with input from factors produced by osteocytes to orchestrate the remodeling process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Florencio-Silva et al., 2015</xref>). Through this continuous remodeling, and balanced anabolic and catabolic activity, a homeostatic condition is achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karsenty et al., 2009</xref>). This homeostasis is regulated by growth factors and cytokines produced within bone and systemic factors such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and estrogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wein and Kronenberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DiGirolamo et al., 2012</xref>). An imbalance in proportions of these cells in bone impairs bone resorption and formation, which can result in diseases of bone mass such as osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteopetrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayturk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kenkre and Bassett, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Long bones form by endochondral ossification, a process in which chondrocytes differentiate, proliferate, mature, and become hypertrophic, forming a cartilaginous growth plate that coordinates longitudinal bone growth and is recapitulated in fracture repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Javaheri et al., 2018</xref>). Hypertrophic cartilage is remodeled by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsang and Cheah, 2019</xref>). The chondrocyte differentiation cascade is coordinated by many transcription factors and signaling pathways, including reciprocal signaling via the parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHRP)-Indian hedgehog (IHH) feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kronenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Long and Ornitz, 2013</xref>). Resting chondrocytes secrete PTHRP, which binds to parathyroid hormone 1 receptor (PTH1R) expressed by pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes, acting to delay their differentiation to hypertrophic chondrocytes (HCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizuhashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Newton et al., 2019</xref>). HCs specifically produce collagen type X (<italic>Col10a1</italic>), downregulate PTH1R, and undergo distinct phases of cell enlargement for bone elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cooper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>). Recent work has shown that osteoblasts in trabecular bone are derived from HCs in the growth plate and from osteoprogenitors in the perichondrium that accompany invading blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>). HCs have been shown to contribute to the full spectrum of cells in the osteoblast lineage in endochondral bone, trabeculae, endosteal/endocortical bone, including osteocytes, and, to a minor degree, bone marrow stromal cells and adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). HC transformation to osteoblasts also occurs in bone healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>). The functional importance of the HC lineage has been demonstrated in mice, which have reduced bone mass as a consequence of ablating β-catenin and <italic>Irx3/5</italic> genes specifically in HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Houben et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is not known whether the HC-derived osteogenic lineage is molecularly distinct from the non-HC lineage (contributed by the perichondrium, periosteum, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells), which specific MMPs act at the chondro-osseous junction to facilitate the transition of HCs to osteoblasts, and what physiological contribution(s) they make to maintain bone homeostasis and anabolism in response to extrinsic signals.</p><p>Here, using single-cell transcriptomics, we characterized the HC-derived osteoblast populations in endochondral bone and found that their transcriptomes are broadly similar to that of non-HC-derived osteoblasts. We found that HC-derived osteoblasts activate membrane-type 1 metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14) and the PTH/PTH1R pathway upon transition into sub-chondral bone. Using mouse mutants and biochemical approaches, we identified the cleavage of PTH1R by MMP14 in HC-derived osteoblasts as a novel mechanism that curbs the intensity of PTH signaling. Like their non–HC-derived counterparts, HC-derived osteoblasts respond to exogenous PTH treatment and contribute significantly to the bone anabolic response. MMP14 modulation of PTH signaling intensity controls the differentiation and survival of osteoblasts and thereby the anabolic response to PTH in building bone mass.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HC derivatives activate MMP14 as they transition to become osteoblasts</title><p>To reveal key transcriptional changes and MMPs that could potentially facilitate the translocation of HC lineage cells as they cross the chondro-osseus junction to contribute to forming trabecular bones, we exploited <italic>Col10a1</italic><sup>Cre/+</sup> (C10Cre); <italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-tdTomato/LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic> (RtdT) (abbreviated C10Cre;RtdT) mice wherein the HC-derived osteoblast lineage is marked by the expression of tdTomato because of the specific activity of Cre recombinase on the RtdT <italic>Cre</italic> reporter in HCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>).

The other three populations varied between 20% and 40% in both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Using the tdTomato expression criterion, we found that the HC-derived osteoblasts appeared randomly dispersed in the combined osteogenic cells of P6 and P56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).

Overall, 23.8% of the P6 and 31.6% of the P56 osteogenic cells were HC-derived. We cannot exclude that the variations in relative percentages of cell populations detected at P6 and P56 were related to the limits in sensitivity in detecting tdTomato mRNAs and differences in the ease of releasing deeply embedded cells within the bone matrix versus more superficially located ones.

However, these findings are insufficient to account for the increased trabecular bone observed in Mmp14ΔHC mice, suggesting a yet undiscovered mechanism could be the underlying cause of the phenotype. Interestingly, MMP14 was shown to be a downstream target of PTH signaling in osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delgado-Calle et al., 2018</xref>). It has been proposed that, because cleavage of PTH1R can be inhibited by TIMP2, but not TIMP1, MMP-dependent cleavage of PTH1R causes reduced stability and degradation of PTH1R, raising the possibility that cleavage by an MMP might inhibit PTH signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klenk et al., 2010</xref>).

Therefore, we hypothesized that MMP14 can proteolytically process and perhaps inhibit PTH/PTH1R signaling.

To test this, we incubated rhMMP14 with a synthetic peptide with amino acid sequence 55–67 from PTH1R.

Since MMP14 has a wide range of substrates ranging from collagens to transmembrane ligands, we hypothesized that cleavage of MMP14 promoted the degradation of PTH1R. To explore the molecular consequences of MMP14 cleavage on PTH1R, 293T cells stably expressing PTH1R transfected with MT1-FL or MT1-EA were challenged with PTH and their responses examined by calculating the relative amounts of phospho-CREB (p-CREB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). As expected, lower relative amounts of p-CREB, p-ERK, and cyclic-AMP (cAMP) were observed after PTH challenge in 293T cells expressing MT1-FL compared to control, suggesting that MMP14 inhibits PTH signaling by facilitating receptor degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>).

Here we show that chondrocyte-derived osteoblasts contribute a significant proportion to osteogenesis arising from PTH-mediated stimulation of bone formation. The data implicate hypertrophic chondrocytes as a reservoir of progenitors supplying osteoblast precursors and this process is controlled by MMP14 modulation of PTH signaling by direct cleavage of PTH1R. MMP14 inhibits PTH1R signaling and genetic targeting of MMP14 boosts PTH-mediated bone synthesis.</p><p>Our study has provided new in vivo insights into the properties and functional contribution of chondrocyte-derived osteoblasts to maintaining normal bone mass in response to PTH. The single-cell transcriptomic analyses and lineage tracing in mouse models show that HC-derived cells express genes characteristic of skeletal progenitors, mesenchymal cells, immature and mature osteoblasts, and terminally differentiated osteocytes even at maturity (P56) in trabecular and endosteal/endocortical bone. Despite this gross similarity, there were a few genes that were differentially expressed between C10Cre-labeled HC-derived and non-HC-derived osteoblasts, within the primary spongiosa, the functional significance of which is unknown and worthy of future study.</p><p>In our study, we have found, by contrast to the decreased trabecular bone caused by global knockout of <italic>Mmp14</italic>, that conditionally inactivating MMP14 in the HC-derived lineage results in a modest increase in bone at P10 by promoting their survival. Our findings identify MMP14 as a key protease that processes PTH1R, regulating the response of HC derivatives to PTH and thereby their contribution to trabecular bone. MMP14 inhibits osteoclastogenesis via controlled release of soluble RANKL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delgado-Calle et al., 2018</xref>). RANKL has been reported to be a downstream target of PTH and a substrate of MMP14, which implies that MMP14 is downstream of PTH signaling, but the exact molecular relationship is unclear. Notably osteoclastogenesis was normal in the P10 Mmp14ΔHC mutants, suggesting that the increased bone mass is intrinsic to HC-derived osteoblasts and unrelated to an impact on the production of soluble RANKL in the absence of MMP14. Because inactivating MMP14-mediated intracellular signaling constitutively by mutating the cytoplasmic tail of MMP14 leads to increased trabecular bone and decreased adipocytes in mice, it has been suggested that MMP14 regulates the osteogenic versus adipogenic cell fate decision of differentiating bone marrow skeletal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attur et al., 2020</xref>). However, there was no effect on the frequency of HC-derived adipocytes in Mmp14ΔHC mutants, suggesting that the increased osteogenesis is not caused by a change in HC cell fate.</p><p>GPCR is the largest family of transmembrane proteins with contributing to ~35% of encoded proteins. Around 3–40% of drugs are derived to target GPCRs. Few preliminary reports propose proteolytic modification of GPCRs by MMPs or ADAMs might modulate their signaling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lackman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goth et al., 2017</xref>). A recent paper proposed that cleavage of PTH1R could regulate its downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klenk et al., 2022</xref>). Our study has uncovered that PTH1R, a class-B G-protein coupled receptor, is a novel direct substrate for MMP14, which, MMP14, by cleaving PTH1R acts to inhibit PTH1R signaling. PTH1R was previously found to be regulated by different post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qiu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Izumida et al., 2020</xref>). The detailed structure of PTH1R and the lack of functional impact of HA-tagging in this domain suggest the unstructured region encoded by exon 2 does not participate in receptor-ligand binding nor signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehrenmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Couvineau et al., 2008</xref>). Our results demonstrate that proteolytic modification of this region directly influences GPCR signaling via GPCR stability. We propose a novel paradigm of MMP14 activity in which it also mediates direct titration of PTH signaling in the HC-osteoblast lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In this model, the intensity of PTH stimulation of osteogenesis is curbed via MMP14 cleavage of the ectodomain of PTH1R. Hence, inactivation of MMP14 in HC descendants spares the ectodomain of PTH1R from cleavage, resulting in an increased anabolic response to PTH and therefore places MMP14 also upstream of PTH signaling. Since MMP14 is upregulated by PTH signaling in osteogenic cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delgado-Calle et al., 2018</xref>), it is possible that MMP14 is also involved in a negative feedback protection mechanism to constrain osteogenesis in response to PTH challenge. Given that other MMPs or ADAMs have been shown to participate in transmembrane proteins cleavage, whether MMPs other than MMP14 are involved in this process and whether PTH1R undergoes additional proteolytic modification remains to be solved in future. Interestingly, in humans several mutations, including a G100-&gt;D mutation in the ectodomain of PTH1R, has been associated with Olliers disease. Whether any of these mutations cause abnormal MMP14 cleavage of PTH1R should be verified in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Couvineau et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Maintaining appropriate amount of bone throughout life, mediated by hormones such as PTH, is critical for healthy aging and quality of life. However, there is a gap in knowledge on the specific contributions of individual cell types to maintaining homeostasis in bone because of the myriad of signaling pathways and diverse cell-type responses. The importance and need of a molecular and functional definition of the contribution of specific cell types in bone are illustrated by the long-term systemic treatment of osteoporosis by teriparatide (PTH 1–34). The treatment is complicated by side effects because of the physiological and pleiotropic effects of PTH signaling on different cells in the whole body. We have shown that HC-derived osteoblasts contribute to the anabolic activity in bone, responding to PTH in the same way as their non-HC-derived counterparts, and constitute a significant proportion of the osteogenic precursors stimulated by teriparatide (PTH 1–34) treatment, even in adult mice. This response to PTH occurs in early postnatal (P10) and mature mice (1 year). Questions for future study are whether the response is as robust in aged mice (2 years or older) and whether, compared to other sources of osteoblasts, the history of PTHRP/PTH1R signaling in pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizuhashi et al., 2018</xref>) produces a molecular memory that is advantageous for the ability of HC descendants to mount a response to PTH. Intermittent treatment with PTH/teraparatide also induces bone resorption leading to an ‘anabolic window’ of bone mass gain that restricts long-term use of this treatment strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hattersley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sharma et al., 2022</xref>). It would be important in future to determine the long-term impact of increased PTH signaling on bone anabolism and physiology in Mmp14ΔHC mice as they age. Other questions that should be followed up are whether a defect in the HC-lineage progression underlies the increase in trabecular bone in <italic>Mmp13</italic> global knockouts and <italic>Col1a1</italic>-cre mediated conditional <italic>Mmp13</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stickens et al., 2004</xref>), and the exact underlying molecular mechanism(s). MMP14 controls other signaling pathways such as FGF signaling and also YAP/TAZ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hikita et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). It would also be important to identify additional pathways and substrates affected by MMP14 deficiency in the osteogenic lineage, and to what degree such impact contributes to the overall changes in bone anabolism. Further, it would be important to determine whether there is a causal link between the MMP14 deficiency in the chondrocyte-osteoblast lineage and human bone-wasting disorders.</p><p>Our study illuminates understanding of the relative contribution of different cell types to maintaining bone homeostasis and highlights the importance of HCs as a source of pre-osteoblasts capable of rapid response to PTH treatment. The minor differences in transcriptomic signature between HC-derived and non-HC-derived osteoblasts and their co-expression of <italic>Mmp14</italic> and <italic>Pth1r</italic> suggest that the same paradigm of MMP14-mediated titration of PTH signaling applies in all osteoblasts. Addressing this possibility purely in non-HC-derived osteoblasts is hampered by the lack of appropriate cre reagents that can target osteoblasts in the perichondrium specifically and the intrinsic skeletal defects in Osterix–cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang and Olsen, 2015</xref>). The discovery that MMP14 titrates the response to PTH and bone anabolism in vivo, contributes new insights into the mechanism of adjusting PTH control of osteogenesis and bone homeostasis, and has significance for understanding bone metabolism with implications for the development of treatments for bone-wasting diseases such as osteoporosis and in overcoming the side effects of teriparatide (PTH 1–34). Our work also contributes to understanding the scientific basis of PTH therapy.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>Our findings provide ideas for potential therapeutic enhancement of treating skeletal diseases.

By contrast, a pan osteoblast-specific or HC-derived osteoblast-specific targeted manipulation approach could have a significant advantage as MMP14 activity (and therefore PTH signaling) only needs to be manipulated in a single cell type. Perhaps such an approach could avoid the need for systemic intermittent injection of PTH and thereby ameliorate side effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genetically modified mouse strains</title><p><italic>Mmp14<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Mmp14</italic> <sup>flox/flox</sup> mice were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Col10a1-</italic>Cre and <italic>Col10a1-</italic>CreERT mouse lines are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>. <italic>Col1a1--</italic>GFP and <italic>Rosa26</italic> reporter transgenic mice were obtained as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalajzic et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srinivas et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Col1a1-</italic> GFP (abbreviated as C1-GFP) transgenic mice were made by directed expression of GFP by a 2.3 kb rat type I collagen fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalajzic et al., 2002</xref>).

The peptides and recombinant proteins were incubated with recombinant MMP14 (BML-SE259-0010, Enzo Lifesciences) for 16 hr, and the mixture was analyzed using western blotting or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Centre for Proteomics, the University of Hong Kong).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Western blotting was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, RIPA cell lysis buffer was prepared using 150  mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 50  mM Tris, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate. Protein lysate was then blotting on a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, MA) and transferred for 1 hr at 15 V using Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). The PVDF membrane was blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hr and incubated with agitation with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The membrane was further incubated in secondary antibody conjugated to HRP diluted in blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature with agitation. Nonspecific binding of HRP secondary antibody to the PVDF membrane was washed for three times with TBST each for 3–5 min. To develop the signals for chemiluminescence of the targeted proteins, WesternBright ECL kit (K-12045-D50) from Advansta was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After incubation with the ECL substrate, the PVDF membrane was taken to the ChemiDocTM MP Imaging system for the visualization of target proteins.</p><p>To detect the cleaved fragments of PTH1R by western blotting, the cell lysate was either not boiled or heated to 70℃ for 5 min for denaturation. Boiling will cause PTH1R containing 7-transmembrane domain to aggregate. EDTA was added to the RIPA cell lysis buffer to a concentration of 5 mM to inhibit membrane metalloproteinase activity. PTH1R was deglycosylated by 1 hr (secondary cell lines) or overnight incubation (primary cells or tissue lysate) with PNGaseF at 37°C (NEB, Cat#, P0704S). 1 µl of 1 M DTT was added to 50 µl of cell lysate to ensure complete dissociation of disulfide bonds linking cleaved extracellular domain of PTH1R. The processed protein fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>TUNEL labeling and Edu incorporation assay</title><p>Proliferation and apoptosis assays were described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>.

role in bone formation in hypertrophic chondrocyte (HC)-derived osteoblasts and MMP14 cleaves PTH1R and inhibits PTH signaling.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Di Chen as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mei Wan (Reviewer #2); Marc N Wein (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is unclear how specific the MMP14/PTH1R pathway is in the transition of HCs to osteoblasts. Are other MMPs besides MMP14 involved in the PTH1R cleavage? Is PTH1R the only substrate of MMP14?</p><p>2) It seems that MMP14 cleaves the PTH1R after amino acid 61, which thus should generate a short fragment. How can this be reconciled with the in vivo cleavage pattern that is observed?</p><p>3) The authors need to demonstrate the co-expression of PTH1R and MMP14 in the same cells (HC-derived osteoblasts).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 3E bottom panel, it would be better if the authors can show the uncropped gel image of the PTH1R blot as did in Figure 3C such that both truncated and intact PTH1R bands can be shown in one image.</p><p>2. It is important that the authors not only detected MMP14-induced PTH1R cleavage in an in vitro 293T cell culture system but also detected the truncated 55kDa form of PTH1R in trabecular bone tissue lysates (Figure 3E) and trabecular osteoblast culture (Supplementary Figure 4D). I suggest this piece of data (Supplementary Figure 4D) move to the main figures section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I will not duplicate assessments about the overall impact in this section. Specific suggestions and questions for the authors are as follows:</p><p>1. For Figure 1, how confident are the authors that their digestion protocol liberates a sizeable fraction of bone-associated osteoblasts/osteocytes from the matrix? This information may be important in interpreting whether different subsets of osteoblasts are HC- or non-HC-derived. For example, the authors could examine bone fragments before and after digestion for expression of osteoblast and osteocyte marker genes. It is clear (and not surprising) that digestion efficiency varies considerably between P6 and P56 mice.</p><p>2. For Figure 1, a feature plot demonstrating tdTomato mRNA expression across different subsets would be helpful. Overall, more information is needed, at the single cell level, about which cells in these digested bone fragments do and do not express tdTomato.</p><p>3. It is confusing why the authors need to stain sections with an RFP antibody rather than examine intrinsic tdTomato fluorescence. Clarification should be provided as to why this non-standard tdTomato detection method was required.</p><p>4. For Figure 3A, the violin plots shown really do not demonstrate the co-expression of Pth1r and Mmp14 in the same cells. These plots demonstrate that groups of HC-derived osteoblasts and groups of non-HC-derived osteoblasts express widely varying levels of these two transcripts. Co-expression could be demonstrated using feature plots or other methods to reanalyze scRNA-seq data at the single-cell level.</p><p>5. Figure 3E shows an important result: that a truncated Pth1r immunoreactive band is absent in Mmp14-/- samples. The entire immunoblot here in the main figure (rather than the data supplement) should be shown here rather than cropped portions for full transparency.</p><p>6. The MMP14-induced PTH1R cleavage pattern seen in vitro is difficult to reconcile with the immunoblotting results in vivo. It seems that MMP14 cleaves the receptor after amino acid 61, which thus should generate a short fragment. How can this be reconciled with the in vivo cleavage pattern that is observed? This is an important point that should be addressed.</p><p>7. Overall, the quantified effects of MMP14 expression on biochemical PTH-stimulated endpoints are somewhat modest. The graphs in Figure 4B are difficult to follow (significance bars seem to compare EV and MT1EA) and should be clarified. Moreover, it is difficult to understand the physiologic significance of the changes in pCREB seen in MMP14-/- cells treated with PTH.

Overall, the methods section could be reorganized to match the order of techniques as they appear in the Results section.</p><p>10. The findings in Figure 7 are interesting, but say nothing about the MMP14/PTH1R relationship studied in the rest of the manuscript. At the very least, it would make sense to look at MMP14 and PTH1R expression in situ in tdTomato-positive cells observed in the vehicle and PTH-treated aged mice.</p><p>11. The discussion could be modified to clearly note differences between cells labeled by collagen X-cre and hypertrophic chondrocytes.

So it is difficult to conclude with absolute certainty that tdTomato-positive cells in this study are all derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes.</p><p>12. Reference 55 is interesting, but there are many other studies demonstrating that intermittent PTH treatment in humans with osteoporosis does affect cortical bone (PMID 23044908 and 26964731 for example).</p><p>13. The discussion should be modified to include the possibility that substrates of MMP14 other than the PTH receptor might contribute to the bone phenotypes observed. An important priority for future study should be to generate PTH receptor mutants that cannot be cleaved by MMP14 for in vivo analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82142.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

For that reason we used sequential protease digestions and the cells encapsulated for sequencing after the third digestion (see Methods section). We do recognise that we may not have isolated all the cells from the trabecular bone. The main purpose of the experiments were to identify candidate protease mediators of the HC transition to osteoblasts by isolating and analysing HC descendants. We were not aiming to make a comprehensive quantification of all populations in the trabecular bone. However, given that we identified osteogenic cells of differing maturity (pre-osteoblasts, mature osteoblasts and osteocytes) as identified by known molecular signatures, this suggests we have a good representation of the different HC-derived and non-HC-derived populations. Our identification of HC-derived cells is based on the detection of cells expressing the lineage marker, tdTomato and its surrogate sequence, WPRE (see Methods), and osteogenic cells which do not express tdTomato/WPRE. The proportion of TdTomato positive osteogenic cells identified is in broad agreement with the frequency determined from the quantitation of HC-derived cells in tibia sections (approximately 30% at P6) as shown in Figure 1H and Figure 1 —figure supplement 1. Of note, we found 25% of <italic>Sost</italic> -expressing cells are tdtomato positive, suggesting the method of extraction had succeeded in releasing the most mature osteogenic cells. The broad agreement between the frequencies of the single cell populations and the quantitation of HCderived cells in equivalent stage tibia, suggest that the data presented is representative of the in vivo state. Please note that in the revised manuscript we have substituted new P56 scRNAseq data derived from <italic>MMp14 +/-</italic> tibia (mice have normal phenotype) as we were able to isolate more cells and we think this is a more representative dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This is an important point that should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good question. For cell line experiments, the truncated PTH1R appears at around 55kDa in HEK293 cells transfected with PTH1R and in vivo Mmp14+/+ trabecular bone lysate, suggesting a proteolytic event is possible at around amino acid ~90. To further investigate this proteolytic event, a recombinant extracellular human PTH1R-ECD (with amino acid 1-181) labeled with polyhistidine at the C-terminus from Sinobiologicals was incubated with recombinant rMMP14 (Figure 3D). After deglycosylation, the uncleaved full length PTH1R-ECD appears at ~25kDa (Figure 3D lane3) in SDS-PAGE with a theoretical predicted molecular size of 21kDa (a 4kDa difference from theoretical). Cleavage of PTH1RECD by rMMP14 results in one peptide observed at ~20kDa and another peptide observed at ~15kDa (lane2). These results indicate multiple cleavage of PTH1R-ECD by rMMP14 is likely, with one cleavage site at around amino acid 61, and another cleavage site at amino acid 90~100. To confirm one of the exact cleavage sites of PTH1R by MMP14, a peptide from amino acid 55~65 was synthesized (Genscript) and incubated with rMMP14. The resulting mixture was analyzed by mass spectrometry and the data confirmed amino acid 61 is one of the MMP14-PTH1R cleavage sites. In summary the rPTH1R fragments involved in in vitro experiments are,</p><p>1. Deglycosylated uncleaved PTH1R-ECD + histag theoretical 21kDa, observed 25kDa (Figure 3D lane 1 and 3)</p><p>2.

It has been widely accepted that p-CREB is an immediate downstream readout of PTH signalling (2, 3).

We have added to Figure 6—figure supplement 1C images showing increased Cyclin D and Runx2 expression in <italic>Mmp14ΔHC</italic> mutants, suggesting increased downstream action of PTHMMP14 axis which suggests a direct effect on osteogenesis and cell cycle regulation in HCderived cell fraction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

That HCs can contribute to osteogenic lineage has been confirmed by many studies. It has been shown in a pulse and chase lineage tracing experiment (4) that at 16h Col10a1-CreERT initially labels predominantly HCs and very few cells at the chondro-osseus junction but by 24h there are fewer HC labelled cells in but labelled cells are now in the primary spongiosa. This finding has been reproduced in a recent (5) study in which a 12h, 24h and 2 week pulse and chase lineage tracing experiment was performed. The specificity of <italic>Col10a1</italic> expression in HCs has also been well validated and it is therefore used to identify the cell of origin in lineage studies. Perhaps the reviewer was referring to <italic>Col2a1</italic> CreERT lineage tracing studies where indeed a broader spectrum of cells are labelled initially due to the activity in the perichondrium (see supplementary figure in (4)) and therefore HCs are not the only cell of origin when <italic>Col2a1</italic> CreERT is used. Of course it is also interesting that <italic>Col10a1-cre</italic> lineage studies show that HC s can also contribute to adipogenic and other progenitors e.g (5, 6).

We agree that future studies should define functionally the critical cleavage sites in PTH1R and the contribution of uncleaved PTH1R to the bone phenotype. We also agree that consideration should be given to the possibility of contribution of other MMP14 substrates. In Figure3-supplement 1 we tested various A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase (ADAMs) for their cleavage of PTH1R. ADAMs were known to cleave various transmembrane proteins such as RANKL. We did not find that ADAM10, 15, 17 could cleave PTH1R. We have added these points to the discussion.</p><p>1. Delgado-Calle J, Hancock B, Likine EF, Sato AY, McAndrews K, Sanudo C, et al.
