The ability to maintain circadian clock functions in response to various stresses and perturbations is important for organismal fitness. Here, we show that the nutrient-sensing GCN2 signaling pathway is required for robust circadian clock function under amino acid starvation in <italic>Neurospora</italic>. The deletion of GCN2 pathway components disrupts rhythmic transcription of clock gene <italic>frq</italic> by suppressing WC complex binding at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter due to its reduced histone H3 acetylation levels. Under amino acid starvation, the activation of GCN2 kinase and its downstream transcription factor CPC-1 establish a proper chromatin state at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter by recruiting the histone acetyltransferase GCN-5. The arrhythmic phenotype of the GCN2 kinase mutants under amino acid starvation can be rescued by inhibiting histone deacetylation. Finally, genome-wide transcriptional analysis indicates that the GCN2 signaling pathway maintains robust rhythmic expression of metabolic genes under amino acid starvation. Together, these results uncover an essential role of the GCN2 signaling pathway in maintaining the robust circadian clock function in response to amino acid starvation, and demonstrate the importance of histone acetylation at the <italic>frq</italic> locus in rhythmic gene expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd><italic>Neurospora

Rhythmic gene expression allows different organisms to regulate their daily molecular, cellular, behavioral, and physiological activities. The ability to maintain circadian clock function in response to various stresses and perturbations is an important property of living systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bass, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hogenesch and Ueda, 2011</xref>). Although gene expression is sensitive to temperature changes, temperature compensation is a key feature of circadian clocks to maintain circadian period length at different physiological temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Narasimamurthy and Virshup, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ode and Ueda, 2018</xref>). DNA damage and translation stress are known to reset the circadian clock through the checkpoint kinase 2 signaling pathway in <italic>Neurospora</italic> and the ATM signaling pathway in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diernfellner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oklejewicz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pregueiro et al., 2006</xref>). Cellular redox balance, including oxidative stress, regulates the circadian clock by modulating CLOCK and NPAS2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nakahata et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rutter et al., 2001</xref>). Nutritional stress, such as a high-fat diet, can disrupt the oscillating metabolites and behavioral rhythms in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eckel-Mahan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kohsaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Panda, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Starvation for all or certain amino acids leads to induced transcription followed by derepression of genes in many amino acid biosynthetic pathways, referred as general amino acid control in yeast and cross-pathway control (CPC) in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). General control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase, called CPC-3 in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, is a serine/threonine kinase that functions as an amino acid sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Efeyan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sattlegger et al., 1998</xref>). GCN2 is activated by accumulated uncharged tRNAs when intracellular amino acids are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ramirez et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wek et al., 1995</xref>). Activated GCN2 phosphorylates the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) to translationally repress protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lyu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). Meanwhile, it also upregulates the transcription activator GCN4, named CPC-1 in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, which activates amino acid biosynthetic and transport pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ebbole et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that circadian clock control of the GCN2-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation is necessary for rhythmic translation initiation in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karki et al., 2020</xref>). Although amino acid starvation is known to activate the GCN2–GCN4 signaling pathway, how nutrient limitation, especially amino acid starvation, affects circadian clock is not known.</p><p>Despite evolutionary divergence in eukaryotes, circadian rhythms are controlled by the conserved transcription/translation-based negative feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> has been established as one of the best studied model systems for analyzing the molecular mechanism of eukaryotic circadian clocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunlap and Loros, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heintzen and Liu, 2007</xref>). In the <italic>Neurospora</italic> core circadian negative feedback loop, two PAS-domain-containing transcription factors, White Collar-1 (WC-1) and WC-2 form a complex (WCC) and bind to the C-box of the <italic>frq</italic> promoter to activate its transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheng et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crosthwaite et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Froehlich et al., 2002</xref>). FRQ protein is translated from <italic>frq</italic> mRNA in the cytosol and progressively phosphorylated at about 103 phosphorylation sites, which plays a major role in determining circadian periodicity by regulating the FRQ–CK1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Larrondo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tang et al., 2009</xref>). To close the negative feedback loop, FRQ forms a complex with its partner FRQ-interacting RNA helicase (FRH) to inhibit the activity of the WCC by promoting WCC phosphorylation mediated by CK1 and CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He and Liu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schafmeier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin structure and histone modification changes play important roles in regulating the transcription of circadian clock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Papazyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takahashi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhu and Belden, 2020</xref>). In mammals, rhythmic H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac modifications have been shown to be enriched at the promoter of clock genes and positively correlated with gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Etchegaray et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Katada and Sassone-Corsi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Koike et al., 2012</xref>). In <italic>Neurospora</italic>, rhythmic binding of WCC to the <italic>frq</italic> promoter is regulated by ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors, such as the SWI/SNF complex, the INO80 complex, the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding-1 (CHD1), and the Clock ATPase (CATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Histone chaperone FACT complex and histone modification enzymes, SET1, SET2, and RPD3 complex, have also been shown to affect <italic>frq</italic> transcription by regulating rhythmic histone compositions and modifications at the <italic>frq</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Raduwan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is still unknown how the chromatin structure is organized to allow rhythmic clock gene expression under nutrient limitation conditions.</p><p>In this study, we discovered that the disruption of the GCN2 (CPC-3) signaling pathway abolished robust circadian rhythms under amino acid starvation, which was important for rhythmic expression of metabolic genes. In the GCN2 signaling pathway mutants, amino acid starvation abolished the rhythmic binding of WC-2 at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter by decreasing its histone H3 acetylation levels. Amino acid starvation activated CPC-3 and CPC-1, which re-established a proper chromatin state at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter by recruiting the histone acetyltransferase GCN-5 to allow rhythmic <italic>frq</italic> expression.

Disruption of the CPC-3 and CPC-1 signaling pathway resulted in decreased histone acetylation levels of the <italic>frq</italic> gene promoter, reduced WCC binding and damped circadian oscillations in response to the amino acid starvation stress (Right).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85241-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Maintaining robust rhythmic gene expression and circadian activities in response to various environmental and nutritional stresses is important for the health or survival of different organisms. Circadian clock synchronizes metabolic processes and systemic metabolite levels, while nutrients and energy signals also feedback to circadian clocks to adapt their metabolic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bass, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hurley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klemz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Reinke and Asher, 2019</xref>). Amino acid starvation is known to inhibit the global translation efficiency through activating GCN2-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation, which conserves energy and allows cells to reprogram gene expression to relieve stress damage. It was recently shown that circadian clock control of GCN2-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation was necessary for rhythmic translation initiation in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ding et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karki et al., 2020</xref>). However, it was previously unknown whether circadian clock would be affected by amino acid starvation stress. After activation of the GCN2-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation by amino acid starvation, a subset of transcripts containing overlapping upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in their 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) are efficiently translated, including the yeast transcription factor GCN4, the <italic>Neurospora</italic> CPC-1 and their mammalian ortholog ATF4, which activate the transcription of various amino acid biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hinnebusch, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Paluh et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>). Our ChIP results showed that CPC-1 could rhythmically bind to the region close to C-box at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter to activate <italic>frq</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). WCC binding at the <italic>frq</italic> C-box region was slightly decreased under normal condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and dramatically decreased under amino acid starvation in the <italic>cpc-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that CPC-1 cooperates with WCC to promote <italic>frq</italic> transcription in response to amino acid starvation. Although CPC-1 rhythmically bound at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter, ChIP experiments showed that CPC-1 binding at several selected amino acid biosynthetic genes did not appear to be rhythmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, our RT-qPCR results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the previous RNA-seq data showed that many CPC-1-targeted metabolic genes were rhythmic expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hurley et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that the binding of CPC-1 to these promoters is still rhythmic but with low amplitudes. As a result, the limited sensitivity of our ChIP assays failed to detect these rhythms. Alternatively, the rhythmic transcription of these genes might be controlled by the rhythmic transcriptional activation activity of CPC-1 rather than its binding. In addition, the rhythmic binding of WCC or WCC-controlled transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hurley et al., 2014</xref>) might also contribute to their rhythmic transcription.</p><p>Amino acid starvation was able to affect gene expression by regulating chromatin modifications. Mammalian transcription factor ATF2 was reported to promote the modification of the chromatin structure in response to amino acid starvation to enhance the transcription of numbers of amino acid-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruhat et al., 2007</xref>). Amino acid starvation was also shown to induce reactivation of silenced transgenes and latent HIV-1 provirus by downregulation of histone deacetylase 4 in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Palmisano et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we found that amino acid starvation suppressed <italic>frq</italic> expression by decreasing the histone acetylation levels likely through activation of histone deacetylases or inhibition of histone acetyltransferases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The activated GCN2 signaling pathway resulted in recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase SAGA complex to the <italic>frq</italic> promoter through its interaction with CPC-1 to re-establish a proper histone acetylation state to relieve the repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Although histone acetylation and deacetylation rhythms have been reported in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Papazyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takahashi, 2017</xref>), SAGA complex has also been reported to be involved in circadian regulation through interaction with the CLOCK complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mahesh et al., 2020</xref>), their function in circadian clock is unclear in <italic>Neurospora</italic>. Here we demonstrated the important role of GCN-5 in regulating the rhythmic histone acetylation and WC-2 binding at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our study unveiled an unsuspected link between nutrient limitation and circadian clock function mediated by the GCN2 signaling pathway. These results provide key insights into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of circadian gene expression during amino acid starvation.</p><p>The nutrient-sensing GCN2 signaling pathway is highly conserved in eukaryotic cells from yeast to mammals. In the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the filamentous fungus <italic>N. crassa</italic>, the GCN2 kinase responds to nutrient deprivation, whereas it phosphorylates eIF2α and upregulates the master transcription factors GCN4 or CPC-1, respectively, which binds target DNA as a dimer to activate amino acid biosynthetic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ebbole et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hope and Struhl, 1987</xref>). In mammalian cells, several GCN2-related kinases can phosphorylate eIF2α in response to various stress conditions, triggering the integrated stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costa-Mattioli and Walter, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Donnelly et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, different from the normal circadian period of <italic>cpc-3<sup>KO</sup></italic> strain in <italic>Neurospora</italic> without amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), it was reported that GCN2 modulated circadian period by phosphorylation of eIF2α in mammals under normal condition, but it was unknown whether GCN2 was involved in circadian regulation of metabolism under nutrient limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pathak et al., 2019</xref>). Our results suggest that the GCN2 signaling pathway is required for maintaining circadian clock under amino acid starvation, which is important for robust rhythmic expression of metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Because GCN2 signaling pathway is important for nutrient sensing, it may also be important for nutritional compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kelliher et al., 2023</xref>) and plays a role in maintaining the robustness of rhythms in a range of nutritional conditions. Time-restricted feeding prevents obesity and metabolic syndrome through circadian-related mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaix et al., 2019</xref>), but how eating pattern affects circadian regulation is unclear. The conservation of the GCN2 signaling pathway and our results here suggest that GCN2 may play an important role in mediating circadian regulation of metabolism during nutrient limitation caused by feeding restrictions in mammals. Together, our studies suggest a conserved role of the GCN2 signaling pathway in maintaining the robustness of circadian clock under nutrient starvation in eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Briefly, tissues were ground in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle and suspended in ice-cold extraction buffer (50 mM Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid HEPES (pH 7.4), 137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) with protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml Pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml Leupeptin, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride PMSF). After centrifugation, protein concentrations were measured using protein assay dye (Bio-Rad). For western blot analyses, equal amounts of total protein (40 μg) were loaded in each protein lane of 7.5% or 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) gels containing a ratio of 37.5:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto PVDF membranes, and western blot analyses using FRQ, WC-1, WC-2, P-eIF2α (Abcam, ab32157), and CPC-1 antibodies were performed. Western blot signals were detected by X-ray films and scanned for quantification.</p><p>To detect the phosphorylation levels of WC-1 and WC-2, PPase inhibitors (25 mM NaF, 10 mM Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·10H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA) were made fresh and added to the protein extraction buffer.

The membrane was probed with [<sup>32</sup>P] UTP (PerkinElmer)-labeled RNA probes specific for <italic>frq</italic>. RNA probes were transcribed in vitro from PCR products by T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen, AM1314M) with the manufacturer’s protocol. The <italic>frq</italic> primers used for the template amplification are shown in Key Resources Table.</p><p>For RT-qPCR, the cultures of WT and <italic>cpc-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> strains were collected at the indicated time points in constant darkness in liquid growth medium (1× Vogel’s, 2% glucose). RT-qPCR were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cui et al., 2020</xref>). Each RNA sample (1 μg) was subjected to reverse transcription with HiScript II reverse transcriptase (Vazyme, R223), and then amplified by real-time PCR (Bio-Rad, CFX96). For RT-qPCR, primers target the coding genes of <italic>frq</italic> (NCU02265), <italic>his-3</italic> (NCU03139), <italic>ser-2</italic> (NCU01439), <italic>trp-3</italic> (NCU08409), <italic>his-4</italic> (NCU06974), <italic>arg-1</italic> (NCU02639), and <italic>arg-10</italic> (NCU08162) were designed, and the β-tubulin (NCU04054) was used as an internal control.

After incubation with antibody for 3 hr, 40 μl GammaBind G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, 17061801) were added, and samples were incubated for 1 hr. Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times using extraction buffer before western blot analysis. IP experiments were performed using cultures harvested in constant light.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>ChIP analysis</title><p>ChIP assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) with 1 mg protein used for each immunoprecipitation reaction.

Immunoprecipitated DNA was quantified by real-time qPCR. Occupancies were normalized by the ratio of ChIP to Input DNA. ChIP was performed using 2 μl c-Myc monoclonal antibody (TransGen, HT101) to examine occupancy of Myc.GCN-5. Occupancies of ChIP were normalized using IgG. The primers used for ChIP-qPCR are shown in Key Resources Table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>The WT and <italic>cpc-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> strains were cultured with or without 12 mM 3-AT treatment in constant light. Total RNAs were extracted using Trizol reagents. Libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed using 150 bp paired-end Illumina sequencing (Annoroad Gene Technology, Beijing). After sequencing, the raw data were treated and mapped to the genome of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> and transformed into expression value. The gene expression levels were scored by fragments per kb per million (FPKM) method. The differences in gene expression between samples was compared by comparing FPKM values, and those with fold change more than 1 (False Discovery Rate FDR &lt;0.1) were thought to be differentially expressed genes. The functional category enrichments, including Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes KEGG terms, were analyzed. The KEGG pathway enrichment was evaluated based on hypergeometric distribution, and the R package ‘ggplot2’ version 3.3.6 was used to visualize the enrichment results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Quantification of western blot data were performed using Image J software. Error bars are standard deviations for ChIP assays from at least three independent technical experiments, and standard error of means for race tube assays from at least three independent biological experiments, unless otherwise indicated. Statistical significance was determined by Student’s <italic>t</italic> test. Statistical tests for the presence of rhythmicity and differences between two rhythms in parameters, including amplitude, phase, and mesor (the midline estimating statistic of rhythms) were analyzed using CircaSingle and CircaCompare (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rwparsons.shinyapps.io/circacompare/">https://rwparsons.shinyapps.io/circacompare/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Parsons et al., 2020</xref>). CircaCompare was used to compare the differences between two rhythmic datasets, and CircaSingle was used to re-analyze the rhythmic parameters of the RNA-seq results by eJTK Cycle. Amplitude refers to half of the difference between the peak and trough of a given response variable, phase refers to the time at which the response variable peaks, and mesor refers to the rhythm-adjusted mean level of a response variable around which a wave function oscillates. Statistical tests for the presence of rhythmicity and statistically significant differences between two groups of rhythmic parameters are indicated by p-values. A p-value &lt;0.05 indicates the presence of rhythmicity, but a p-value &gt;0.05 indicates the loss of rhythmicity.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joanna Chiu (Reviewer #2); Bin Wang and Jay C Dunlap (Reviewer #3, co-reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor Alan Hinnebusch has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Conduct statistical analysis to assess the significance of the circadian rhythms claimed for FRQ mRNA abundance, and for WC complex binding, H3Ac levels, GCN-5 binding, and CPC-1 binding at the FRQ promoter.</p><p>2) The data are not compelling that CPC-1 occupancy at FRQ is rhythmic. If the statistically significant rhythmic binding of CPC-1 is not demonstrated, then the molecular basis of the rhythmic recruitment of Gcn5 and H3Ac will be unclear. In that event, the authors may need to consider the model that CPC-1 assists constitutively in recruiting Gcn5 and attendant H3 acetylation, and that some other factor is involved in producing the circadian rhythms of these events, and in turn, the rhythmic binding of WC complex at the FRQ promoter.</p><p>3) It appears that the experiments to examine the involvement of GCN-5 and ADA-2 in the rhythmic transcription of FRQ were performed only in non-starvation conditions. If this was indeed the case, then at a minimum, key conclusions would have to be qualified. More likely, the experiments would have to be extended to include starvation conditions.</p><p>4) Provide clarification about why knock out of GCN5 reduces FRQ protein expression and diminishes its rhythm without corresponding effects on FRQ mRNA abundance (Figure 5C vs 5D). Are the data lacking in precision or accuracy, or is a more complex model required to explain these results?</p><p>5) The data provided to support the claim of rhythmic transcription of the four candidate amino acid biosynthetic genes in Figure 7F is not very compelling. If the statistical analysis fails to confirm their rhythmic transcription in WT, it might be possible to bolster their claim by evaluating published RNA-seq data (sampled every 2 hrs over 2 days, done in triplicate) for known CPC-1 target genes. Because these published experiments were not carried out in amino acid starvation conditions however, the measured expression of the biosynthetic gene transcripts might be dominated by transcription factors that bind constitutively rather than by CPC-1. In the absence of published data supporting rhythmic transcription of amino acid biosynthetic genes regulated by CPC-1, the authors should consider conducting additional RNA-Seq experiments at different time points in amino acid-starved cells. Alternatively, it might be possible to provide RT-qPCR data on additional candidate genes, coupled with statistical analysis of rhythmic transcription. Failing that, the authors would likely need to soften or eliminate claims of rhythmic transcription of these genes.</p><p>6) The proposed rhythmic transcription of amino acid biosynthetic genes would also predict rhythmic binding by CPC-1 in their promoters under starvation conditions. Conducting ChIP analysis of CPC-1 binding at a few candidate biosynthetic genes that show convincing rhythmic transcription would be highly desirable, and if observed, might compensate for less compelling transcript data. Such measurements would also be relevant to the question noted above of whether CPC-1 binding at the FRQ promoter itself is truly rhythmic.</p><p>7) It is necessary to add new text to address queries raised by Referees #2 and #3 about various findings that require additional clarification or qualification.</p><p>8) It is important to provide raw source data for all measurements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>i) Explain why knock out of GCN5 eliminates rhythmic FRQ expression but does not have a corresponding effect on FRQ mRNA abundance.</p><p>ii) Determine whether elimination of HDA1 restores H3ac and WCC binding at FRQ, and rhythmic growth, in 3AT-treated cpc-1 and gcn5 mutants.</p><p>iii) Provide stronger evidence for rhythmic transcription of aa biosynthetic genes.</p><p>iv) Possibly attempt to determine whether CPC-1 occupancy at aa biosynthetic genes (and at FRQ itself) is rhythmic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors should use circadian statistics (e.g. CircaCompare; Parsons et al. 2020) to compute the phase and amplitude of the mRNA, DNA binding of WC complex, and H3Ac rhythms. This will allow them to compare between rhythms and provide statistical significance values, rather than just providing qualitative descriptions, e.g. &quot;slightly decreased&quot; in lines 189-190. This will be valuable when comparing rhythms between strains and between nutrient conditions.</p><p>2. Line 119: The authors indicate that the rhythmicity of histone acetylation at the frq gene promoter is lost in many of the mutants they tested, e.g. CPC-3 and CPC-1. However, it is not clear whether these mutants simply have a lower level of H3ac (Figure 3D), resulting in a lower level of WC binding to frq promoter (Figure 2C-D), and consequently lower level of frq mRNA (Figure 1D). When the levels of these measures are low, it is difficult to observe any rhythms. Furthermore, is it really necessary to emphasize the maintenance of rhythms? When clock mRNA levels are too low, clocks are normally disrupted anyway.</p><p>3. The authors propose that GCN5 works downstream of CPC-1 and CPC-3. If that is the case, why does frq mRNA in gcn-5 KO strain show dampened but consistently high level (Figure 5D), rather than a consistently low level as in the case of cpc-1 and cpc-3 ko strains? Can the authors comment on this? Also, it appears that H3ac and WC binding to frq promoter is lower compared to WT (Figure 5E-F). Can the authors explain why frq mRNA level is higher given H3ac and WC binding to frq promoter is lower?</p><p>4. There is no data in this study showing that the GCN2 pathway is activated in amino acid-starved conditions, only that it is required to maintain robust frq and conidiation rhythms. Can the authors clarify how they are defining &quot;activation of the GCN2 pathway&quot; in this study? For example, is it recruitment of GCN-5 and SAGA complex to frq promoter?</p><p>5. The experiments to examine the involvement of GCN-5 and ADA-2 were performed in normal conditions (no amino acid starvation). Unlike cpc-1 and cpc-3 KO strains, gcn-5 and ada-2 KO strains showed severely disrupted frq rhythms, suggesting they are normally required for robust circadian rhythms. If GCN-5 and the SAGA complex are normally involved in regulating H3ac rhythms in the frq loci, how does the GCN2 pathway modulates the activity of GCN-5 and SAGA complex in conditions of amino acid starvation? Are the interactions between GCN2/4 with GCN-5 and SAGA complex different in normal vs amino acid starved conditions? The authors should clarify their model.</p><p>6. Given that the GCN2 pathway is important for nutrient sensing, the authors should not disregard the alternative hypothesis that the GCN2 pathway may be important for nutrient compensation and plays a role in maintaining the robustness of rhythms in a range of nutrient conditions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;The nutrient-sensing GCN2 signaling pathway is essential for circadian clock function by regulating histone acetylation under amino acid starvation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor, Alan Hinnebusch.</p><p>It appears that you have satisfied some, but not all, of the major issues raised about the previous version of the paper. It was recognized that you provided new evidence indicating that knockout of GCN5 eliminates rhythmic FRQ expression with a corresponding effect on FRQ mRNA abundance. While you also provided new ChIP evidence suggesting that CPC-1 occupancy at FRQ is rhythmic; it was provided only to the referees. You performed statistical analysis of rhythmicity using the CircaCompare tool; however, the application of tests and the resulting statistics have not been presented in a transparent or comprehensive manner. It also appears that you incorrectly cited published evidence regarding the rhythmicity of amino acid biosynthetic gene expression. These and a few other issues are fully described below:</p><p>1. The description of the CircaCompare statistical tests of rhythmicity is inadequate and needs to be better explained, providing a brief &quot;layman's&quot; description in the Methods of the meaning of the statistical parameters and how the tests were applied to their data. In addition, the results need to be documented completely for all experiments in which rhythmicity was concluded to exist for any parameter. While the authors added time-series statistics in certain figure legends, they did not indicate the p-values for rhythmicity, and the asterisks in figure panels seem to refer to t-tests rather than to RAIN/CircaCompare statistics. To increase transparency, the results of the CircaCompare statistical tests could be summarized in an additional supplementary table.</p><p>2. Discrepancies remain regarding whether transcription of amino acid (AA) biosynthetic genes is rhythmic as, contrary to the statement in the Response to Reviewers, the publication by Hurley et al. 2014 does not show ser-2 (NCU01439), trp-3 (NCU08409) or arg-1 (NCU02639) to be rhythmic. The authors should note that the original data were re-analyzed using better statistical tools, described in Suppl Dataset S1 of Hurley et al. (2018), and in the re-analyzed data, ser-2(NCU01439) is not rhythmic at the RNA level, although it is rhythmic at the protein level; trp-3(NCU08409) is rhythmic at the RNA level, and arg-1 (NCU02639)- is rhythmic at the RNA level. The authors need to carefully examine the results of Hurley et al. (2018) and provide an accurate summary of the presence or absence of rhythmicity in the expression of all known CPC-1-induced target genes, possibly with an additional supplementary table that lists the key statistical criteria for the assessments. They should also explain to the reviewers why they incorrectly cited the findings of Hurley et al. (2014) in the revised manuscript.</p><p>3. The new ChIP data for CPC-1 binding at the AA genes should be included as a supplementary figure with the addition of the appropriate explanatory text in Results and Discussion, including the suggestion made in their Response to Reviewers of rhythmic binding of WCC or WCC-controlled transcription factors, at the AA genes and whether any evidence exists in the literature for the latter.</p><p>4. Clarify whether the authors are interpreting their data to indicate that GCN5/SAGA perform the same functions at FRQ promoter in both non-starved and starved cells and are simply being additionally mobilized by CPC-1 in starved cells, possibly by altering the model in Figure 8.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors appear to have satisfied some, but not all, of the major issues raised about the previous version of the paper. They have provided new evidence indicating that knock out of GCN5 eliminates rhythmic FRQ expression with a corresponding effect on FRQ mRNA abundance. They also provided new ChIP evidence suggesting that CPC-1 occupancy at FRQ is rhythmic. However, the following issues seem to require additional attention and adequate responses from the authors.</p><p>1. To support the conclusions of rhythmic FRQ mRNA abundance, WCC complex binding, H3Ac levels, GCN-5 binding, and CPC-1 binding at the FRQ promoter, and of expression levels of amino acid biosynthetic genes in WT cells, they claim to have conducted a statistical analysis using CircaCompare. However, I could not find even a cursory explanation of this tool and the meaning of the different parameters it evaluates in Methods, nor a description of how it was being applied in comparing results for WT and mutants. In addition, it is generally unclear what data have been analyzed with CircaCompare and what the outcomes were. In particular, the legends often state that data were judged to be arhythmic in a cpc mutant without indicating whether it was significantly rhythmic in WT. What is needed is a table that lists clearly all the CircaCompare tests that were conducted and the P-values for all of the parameters that were analyzed, with a final column indicating whether the data are rhythmic or arhythmic and from what results this assessment was made. In short, for each experiment, it is necessary to provide justification using CircaCompare that the data are significantly rhythmic in WT, not only that they are arhythmic in mutants, and to make the CircaCompare tests and results completely transparent, accessible, and understandable to a general audience.</p><p>2. The aforementioned shortcoming is particularly notable regarding the expression of amino acid (AA) biosynthetic genes in WT cells. It is unclear whether the CircaCompare analysis actually confirms rhythmic mRNA expression for these genes in WT cells, both for the group of genes they examined by RT-PCR and those interrogated using published RNA-seq data. It is also unclear why they are showing the published RNA-seq results for only 4 genes out of a presumably much larger number of AA biosynthetic genes known to be induced by CPC-1 in starved cells. Did many other AA genes not show rhythmic transcription? It would useful to have a table summarizing the CircaCompare analysis of the RNA-seq data for all known CPC-1 target genes.</p><p>3. This last issue of whether AA biosynthetic gene transcription is truly rhythmic was exacerbated by their new CPC-1 ChIP data (presented only for referees) indicating constitutive CPC-1 occupancy at all four AA biosynthetic genes they tested, in contrast to its apparently rhythmic binding at the FRQ gene. They suggest that the AA biosynthetic genes might exhibit rhythmic binding of WCC, or some other transcriptional activator; however, is there any evidence that WCC binds to these AA genes, or that any other activator besides WCC binds to promoters rhythmically? I remain skeptical of the claim of rhythmic transcription of AA biosynthetic genes that are induced by CPC-1 in starved cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have adequately addressed my comments and concerns from the previous manuscript version, in some cases with additional experiments. I greatly appreciate their effort. I think this study is a nice contribution to the field and will inform on the metabolic regulation of circadian rhythms at the chromatin level. One minor comment that will help clarify this complex model for readers.</p><p>In the previous version, I commented:</p><p>&quot;The experiments to examine the involvement of GCN-5 and ADA-2 were performed in normal conditions (no amino acid starvation). Unlike cpc-1 and cpc-3 KO strains, gcn-5 and ada-2 KO strains showed severely disrupted frq rhythms in normal nutrient conditions, suggesting they are normally already required for robust circadian rhythms. If GCN-5 and the SAGA complex are normally involved in regulating H3ac rhythms in the frq loci, how does GCN2 pathway modulates the activity of GCN-5 and SAGA complex in conditions of amino acid starvation? Are the interactions between GCN2/4 with GCN-5 and SAGA complex different in normal vs amino acid starved conditions? &quot;</p><p>Based on the additional experiments and their text edit, there appears to be no difference in the activity of GCN-5 and SAGA complex in normal vs amino acid-starved conditions. It's doing what it normally does in normal conditions even when it is in amino acid-starved conditions. Its activity is however more necessary in amino acid-starved conditions because the chromatin at frq promoter is constitutively compacted in amino acid-starved conditions. So since CPC-3 and CPC-1 are necessary to activate the GCN-5/ADA-2 complex and since an amino acid-starved condition activates the GCN2 pathway and induced CPC-1 expression, the arrhythmic phenotype in circadian rhythm is more severe in CPC-3 and CPC-1 KO mutants in amino acid starved condition when compared to normal condition.</p><p>I wonder if the model figure (Figure 8) would be more clear to readers if it includes the normal scenario instead of just having the amino acid-starved conditions. Besides that, I think the manuscript is much approved.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are frequent and numerous issues with English usage that should be corrected.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. In the new Supplementary file S1. The authors have provided lists of 148 cpc-1 up-regulated genes and 127 cpc-1 down-regulated genes, of which 79 up-regulated genes apparently show rhythmic expression and 67 down-regulated genes apparently show rhythmic expression. They have not however provided the statistics of the CircaCompare tests of rhythmicity for the WT strain, which needs to be added for each gene listed in the new file S1. In addition, they should provide new text in the RESULTS explaining that ~53% of both the up- and down-regulated genes exhibit rhythmicity and indicate that this represents a highly significant enrichment of all cpc-1 regulated genes as judged by the hypergeometric distribution test, providing the P-value. The file S1 should also include a notes sheet fully explaining the data provided there.</p><p>2.

If the statistically significant rhythmic binding of CPC-1 is not demonstrated, then the molecular basis of the rhythmic recruitment of Gcn5 and H3Ac will be unclear. In that event, the authors may need to consider the model that CPC-1 assists constitutively in recruiting Gcn5 and attendant H3 acetylation, and that some other factor is involved in producing the circadian rhythms of these events, and in turn, the rhythmic binding of WC complex at the FRQ promoter.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we now performed ChIP assays using the CPC-1 antibody instead of Myc antibody. As shown in the revised Figure 4A, the CPC-1 enrichment at DD14/DD18 was significantly higher than that of DD10/DD22.

Thus, the <italic>frq</italic> mRNA and FRQ protein results are consistent with each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The data provided to support the claim of rhythmic transcription of the four candidate amino acid biosynthetic genes in Figure 7F is not very compelling. If the statistical analysis fails to confirm their rhythmic transcription in WT, it might be possible to bolster their claim by evaluating published RNA-seq data (sampled every 2 hrs over 2 days, done in triplicate) for known CPC-1 target genes. Because these published experiments were not carried out in amino acid starvation conditions however, the measured expression of the biosynthetic gene transcripts might be dominated by transcription factors that bind constitutively rather than by CPC-1. In the absence of published data supporting rhythmic transcription of amino acid biosynthetic genes regulated by CPC-1, the authors should consider conducting additional RNA-Seq experiments at different time points in amino acid-starved cells. Alternatively, it might be possible to provide RT-qPCR data on additional candidate genes, coupled with statistical analysis of rhythmic transcription. Failing that, the authors would likely need to soften or eliminate claims of rhythmic transcription of these genes.</p></disp-quote><p>The rhythmic expression of these candidate amino acid biosynthetic genes are supported by the following evidence. First, we analyzed the published rhythmic RNA-seq data from Dr. Jay Dunlap’s lab (Hurley JM <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014, PMID: 25362047) and found that these amino acid biosynthetic gene (<italic>ser-2</italic>, <italic>trp-3</italic>, <italic>arg-1</italic>) were expressed rhythmically. Our analysis data is now presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1C. Second, we also performed RT-qPCR analysis to examine the relative mRNA levels of <italic>his-3</italic>, <italic>ser-2</italic>, <italic>trp-3</italic>, and three additional amino acid biosynthetic genes (<italic>his-4</italic>, <italic>arg-1</italic> and <italic>arg-10)</italic> at different time points (sampled every 6 hrs over 30 hrs). We found that these amino acid biosynthetic genes were rhythmic expressed in the WT but not in the <italic>cpc-1</italic><sup>KO</sup> strain with/without 3-AT treatment (Figure 7 F and Figure 7—figure supplement 1D and 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The proposed rhythmic transcription of amino acid biosynthetic genes would also predict rhythmic binding by CPC-1 in their promoters under starvation conditions. Conducting ChIP analysis of CPC-1 binding at a few candidate biosynthetic genes that show convincing rhythmic transcription would be highly desirable, and if observed, might compensate for less compelling transcript data. Such measurements would also be relevant to the question noted above of whether CPC-1 binding at the FRQ promoter itself is truly rhythmic.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we performed ChIP using our CPC-1 antibody to analyze CPC-1 occupancy at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter and a few amino acid biosynthetic genes including <italic>his-3</italic>, <italic>ser-2</italic> and <italic>trp-3</italic>. As the results shown in Figure 4A, CPC-1 binding at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter was rhythmic (measured with CircaCompare). However, the CPC-1 occupancy at the <italic>his-3</italic>, <italic>ser-2</italic> and <italic>trp-3</italic> promoters was not rhythmic (measured with CircaCompare). These results suggested that CPC-1 binding is rhythmic at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter but not at the amino acid biosynthetic genes. Thus, the rhythmic transcription of amino acid biosynthetic genes might be controlled by rhythmic binding of WCC or WCC-controlled transcription factors but not by rhythmic CPC-1 binding.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85241-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is necessary to add new text to address queries raised by Referees #2 and #3 about various findings that require additional clarification or qualification.</p></disp-quote><p>Revised as suggested.

The authors should use circadian statistics (e.g. CircaCompare; Parsons et al. 2020) to compute the phase and amplitude of the mRNA, DNA binding of WC complex, and H3Ac rhythms. This will allow them to compare between rhythms and provide statistical significance values, rather than just providing qualitative descriptions, e.g. &quot;slightly decreased&quot; in lines 189-190. This will be valuable when comparing rhythms between strains and between nutrient conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we used CircaCompare to analyze our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 119: The authors indicate that the rhythmicity of histone acetylation at the frq gene promoter is lost in many of the mutants they tested, e.g. CPC-3 and CPC-1. However, it is not clear whether these mutants simply have a lower level of H3ac (Figure 3D), resulting in a lower level of WC binding to frq promoter (Figure 2C-D), and consequently lower level of frq mRNA (Figure 1D). When the levels of these measures are low, it is difficult to observe any rhythms. Furthermore, is it really necessary to emphasize the maintenance of rhythms? When clock mRNA levels are too low, clocks are normally disrupted anyway.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestions. We re-analyzed the data using CircaCompare and revised the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors propose that GCN5 works downstream of CPC-1 and CPC-3. If that is the case, why does frq mRNA in gcn-5 KO strain show dampened but consistently high level (Figure 5D), rather than a consistently low level as in the case of cpc-1 and cpc-3 ko strains? Can the authors comment on this? Also, it appears that H3ac and WC binding to frq promoter is lower compared to WT (Figure 5E-F). Can the authors explain why frq mRNA level is higher given H3ac and WC binding to frq promoter is lower?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to Essential revisions point 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There is no data in this study showing that the GCN2 pathway is activated in amino acid-starved conditions, only that it is required to maintain robust frq and conidiation rhythms. Can the authors clarify how they are defining &quot;activation of the GCN2 pathway&quot; in this study? For example, is it recruitment of GCN-5 and SAGA complex to frq promoter?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the question. CPC-3, the GCN2 homolog in <italic>Neurospora</italic>, is the only eIF2α kinase responsible for eIF2α phosphorylation at serine 51(Karki S et al. 2020, PMID: 32355000). As shown in the revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, the eIF2α phosphorylation and CPC-1 were induced by 3-AT treatment in the WT but not in the <italic>cpc-3</italic><sup>KO</sup> strain. These results demonstrate that the GCN2 pathway is activated by amino acid starvation, and as a result, the CPC-1 expression is activated to recruit the SAGA complex to the <italic>frq</italic> promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The experiments to examine the involvement of GCN-5 and ADA-2 were performed in normal conditions (no amino acid starvation). Unlike cpc-1 and cpc-3 KO strains, gcn-5 and ada-2 KO strains showed severely disrupted frq rhythms, suggesting they are normally required for robust circadian rhythms. If GCN-5 and the SAGA complex are normally involved in regulating H3ac rhythms in the frq loci, how does the GCN2 pathway modulates the activity of GCN-5 and SAGA complex in conditions of amino acid starvation? Are the interactions between GCN2/4 with GCN-5 and SAGA complex different in normal vs amino acid starved conditions? The authors should clarify their model.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, our data suggested that GCN-5 and ADA-2 are required for robust circadian rhythms under normal conditions. As suggested, we did detect dampened rhythmic expression of <italic>frq</italic> in the <italic>gcn-5<sup>KO</sup></italic> and <italic>ada-2<sup>KO</sup></italic> strains under amino acid starvation (Figure 5D and 5E and Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and 1F). We also performed Co-IP to compare the difference of interactions between CPC-1 with ADA-2 and GCN5 with ADA-2 under normal and amino acid starved conditions. The results showed that although the Myc.GCN-5, MYC.CPC-1 or Flag.ADA-2 protein level was repressed by 3 mM 3-AT treatment (likely due to global translational inhibition by induced eIF2α phosphorylation) (Karki S et al. 2020, PMID: 32355000), the interactions between CPC-1 with ADA-2 and GCN-5 with ADA-2 were almost the same under normal and amino acid starved conditions (IP was normalized with Input) (Figure 4B and 4C). These results indicated that amino acid starved conditions had little impact on the protein interactions between CPC-1 with GCN-5 and SAGA complex.</p><p>In our model, we proposed that amino acid starvation resulted in compact chromatin structure (due to decreased H3ac) in the <italic>frq</italic> promoter in the WT strain (Figure 3B), likely due to activation of histone deacetylases or inhibition of histone acetyltransferases. Amino acid starvation activates GCN2 pathway and induces CPC-1 expression. The induced CPC-1 can recruit GCN5-containing SAGA complex to the <italic>frq</italic> promoter to loosen the chromatin structure, promoting <italic>frq</italic> rhythmic transcription under starvation conditions. However, in the <italic>cpc-3<sup>KO</sup></italic> mutants, CPC-1 could not effectively recruit GCN5 containing SAGA complex to <italic>frq</italic> promoter, resulting in arrhythmic <italic>frq</italic> transcription. We have now clarified our model in the revised discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Discrepancies remain regarding whether transcription of amino acid (AA) biosynthetic genes is rhythmic as, contrary to the statement in the Response to Reviewers, the publication by Hurley et al. 2014 does not show ser-2 (NCU01439), trp-3 (NCU08409) or arg-1 (NCU02639) to be rhythmic. The authors should note that the original data were re-analyzed using better statistical tools, described in Suppl Dataset S1 of Hurley et al. (2018), and in the re-analyzed data, ser-2(NCU01439) is not rhythmic at the RNA level, although it is rhythmic at the protein level; trp-3(NCU08409) is rhythmic at the RNA level, and arg-1 (NCU02639)- is rhythmic at the RNA level. The authors need to carefully examine the results of Hurley et al. (2018) and provide an accurate summary of the presence or absence of rhythmicity in the expression of all known CPC-1-induced target genes, possibly with an additional supplementary table that lists the key statistical criteria for the assessments.

They have provided new evidence indicating that knock out of GCN5 eliminates rhythmic FRQ expression with a corresponding effect on FRQ mRNA abundance. They also provided new ChIP evidence suggesting that CPC-1 occupancy at FRQ is rhythmic. However, the following issues seem to require additional attention and adequate responses from the authors.</p><p>1. To support the conclusions of rhythmic FRQ mRNA abundance, WCC complex binding, H3Ac levels, GCN-5 binding, and CPC-1 binding at the FRQ promoter, and of expression levels of amino acid biosynthetic genes in WT cells, they claim to have conducted a statistical analysis using CircaCompare. However, I could not find even a cursory explanation of this tool and the meaning of the different parameters it evaluates in Methods, nor a description of how it was being applied in comparing results for WT and mutants. In addition, it is generally unclear what data have been analyzed with CircaCompare and what the outcomes were. In particular, the legends often state that data were judged to be arhythmic in a cpc mutant without indicating whether it was significantly rhythmic in WT. What is needed is a table that lists clearly all the CircaCompare tests that were conducted and the P-values for all of the parameters that were analyzed, with a final column indicating whether the data are rhythmic or arhythmic and from what results this assessment was made. In short, for each experiment, it is necessary to provide justification using CircaCompare that the data are significantly rhythmic in WT, not only that they are arhythmic in mutants, and to make the CircaCompare tests and results completely transparent, accessible, and understandable to a general audience.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments and suggestions. We have now revised the manuscript as suggested. We have added in the Methods details of the CircaCompare statistical analysis described in previously published papers (X. Liu et al., 2021; Parsons et al., 2020). The results of the CircaCompare statistical tests were summarized in the Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The aforementioned shortcoming is particularly notable regarding the expression of amino acid (AA) biosynthetic genes in WT cells. It is unclear whether the CircaCompare analysis actually confirms rhythmic mRNA expression for these genes in WT cells, both for the group of genes they examined by RT-PCR and those interrogated using published RNA-seq data. It is also unclear why they are showing the published RNA-seq results for only 4 genes out of a presumably much larger number of AA biosynthetic genes known to be induced by CPC-1 in starved cells. Did many other AA genes not show rhythmic transcription? It would useful to have a table summarizing the CircaCompare analysis of the RNA-seq data for all known CPC-1 target genes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestions. In the previous manuscript, we only cited the Hurley et al. (2014) paper, because we downloaded and re-analyzed the RNA-seq data in that study. However, the data were re-analyzed using improved statistical methods described in the Supplemental Dataset 1 (https://doi.org/10.17632/r68j3rnxhw.1) of Hurley et al. (2018). We have now cited both papers in our manuscript.</p><p>In our study, there were 148 up-regulated and 127 down-regulated genes found in the WT strain after 3-AT treatment but their regulation were abolished in the <italic>cpc-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> strain (Figure 7D and Figure 7—figure supplement 1A), suggesting that these genes were regulated by CPC-1 under amino acid starvation. As shown in the Supplementary file 1, we summarized the rhythmic expression of 79 up-regulated and 67 down-regulated CPC-1 target genes based on the results of Hurley et al. (2018) (its Supplemental Dataset 1). We also performed RT-qPCR experiments to re-analyze the expression rhythms for some of those genes and found that the rhythmic expression of <italic>his-3</italic> (NCU03139), <italic>trp-3</italic> (NCU08409) and <italic>arg-1</italic> (NCU02639) in the WT was abolished in the <italic>cpc-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> strain under amino acid starvation, which is consistent with the published RNA-seq analysis results. In addition, we found that <italic>ser-2</italic> (NCU01439) was also rhythmic in the WT but not in the <italic>cpc-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> strain under amino acid starvation, even though it was not previously shown to be rhythmic in the published RNA-seq analysis study. These results suggest that many CPC-1 activated metabolic genes under amino acid starvation are regulated by circadian clock.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. This last issue of whether AA biosynthetic gene transcription is truly rhythmic was exacerbated by their new CPC-1 ChIP data (presented only for referees) indicating constitutive CPC-1 occupancy at all four AA biosynthetic genes they tested, in contrast to its apparently rhythmic binding at the FRQ gene. They suggest that the AA biosynthetic genes might exhibit rhythmic binding of WCC, or some other transcriptional activator; however, is there any evidence that WCC binds to these AA genes, or that any other activator besides WCC binds to promoters rhythmically? I remain skeptical of the claim of rhythmic transcription of AA biosynthetic genes that are induced by CPC-1 in starved cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the concern of this review. Our results and those of Hurley et al. (2018) demonstrated that CPC-1 is required for the rhythmic expression of many CPC-1 targeted metabolic genes. We agree with this reviewer that the exact mechanism for how this regulation is achieved is still unclear since our ChIP experiments showed that the CPC-1 binding at several selected amino acid biosynthetic genes was not rhythmic (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). There are several possibilities. First, the rhythms of CPC-1 binding at these amino acid biosynthetic genes have very low amplitude and could not be detected by our ChIP assays. Second, the rhythmic transcription of these genes could be controlled by rhythmic binding of WCC or WCC-controlled transcription factors (Hurley et al. 2014). Indeed, the ChIP-seq analysis by Hurley et al. (2014) showed that WC-2 is associated at the promoter of <italic>arg-1</italic> (NCU02639) (https://www.pnas.org/doi/suppl/10.1073/pnas.1418963111/suppl_file/pnas.1418963111.sd11.xlsx). Third, although the binding of CPC-1 is arrhythmic, its activity in activating transcription can still be rhythmic, which could be due to rhythmic posttranslational modification/association of other factors.</p><p>We have now revised the manuscript to address this concern. In the results, we described “We performed ChIP experiments to examine whether CPC-1 directly activates the expression of amino acid synthetic genes. As shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1C, CPC-1 was found to be constitutively enriched at the promoters of <italic>his-3</italic> (NCU03139), <italic>trp-3</italic> (NCU08409) and <italic>ser-2</italic> (NCU01439) genes, and the enrichment was enhanced by 3-AT treatment”. In the discussion, we added that “Although CPC-1 rhythmically binds at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter, ChIP experiments showed that CPC-1 binding at several selected amino acid biosynthetic genes did not appear to be rhythmic (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). However, our RT-qPCR results (Figure 7F and Figure 7—figure supplement 1) and the previous RNA-seq data showed that many CPC-1 targeted metabolic genes were rhythmic expressed (Hurley et al., 2018). It is possible that the binding of CPC-1 on these promoters are still rhythmic but with low amplitudes. As a result, the limited sensitivity of our ChIP assays failed to detected these rhythms. Alternatively, the rhythmic transcription of these genes might be controlled by rhythmic transcriptional activation activity of CPC-1 rather than its binding. In addition, the rhythmic binding of WCC or WCC-controlled transcription factors (Hurley et al., 2014) might also contribute to their rhythmic transcription.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have adequately addressed my comments and concerns from the previous manuscript version, in some cases with additional experiments. I greatly appreciate their effort. I think this study is a nice contribution to the field and will inform on the metabolic regulation of circadian rhythms at the chromatin level. One minor comment that will help clarify this complex model for readers.</p><p>In the previous version, I commented:</p><p>&quot;The experiments to examine the involvement of GCN-5 and ADA-2 were performed in normal conditions (no amino acid starvation). Unlike cpc-1 and cpc-3 KO strains, gcn-5 and ada-2 KO strains showed severely disrupted frq rhythms in normal nutrient conditions, suggesting they are normally already required for robust circadian rhythms. If GCN-5 and the SAGA complex are normally involved in regulating H3ac rhythms in the frq loci, how does GCN2 pathway modulates the activity of GCN-5 and SAGA complex in conditions of amino acid starvation? Are the interactions between GCN2/4 with GCN-5 and SAGA complex different in normal vs amino acid starved conditions? &quot;</p><p>Based on the additional experiments and their text edit, there appears to be no difference in the activity of GCN-5 and SAGA complex in normal vs amino acid-starved conditions. It's doing what it normally does in normal conditions even when it is in amino acid-starved conditions. Its activity is however more necessary in amino acid-starved conditions because the chromatin at frq promoter is constitutively compacted in amino acid-starved conditions. So since CPC-3 and CPC-1 are necessary to activate the GCN-5/ADA-2 complex and since an amino acid-starved condition activates the GCN2 pathway and induced CPC-1 expression, the arrhythmic phenotype in circadian rhythm is more severe in CPC-3 and CPC-1 KO mutants in amino acid starved condition when compared to normal condition.</p><p>I wonder if the model figure (Figure 8) would be more clear to readers if it includes the normal scenario instead of just having the amino acid-starved conditions. Besides that, I think the manuscript is much approved.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments and suggestions. It’s correct that the interaction between CPC-1 with ADA-2 and GCN5 is not changed by amino acid starvation. However, the activity of GCN-5 and SAGA complex is more important in the <italic>cpc-3<sup>KO</sup></italic> and <italic>cpc-1<sup>KO</sup></italic> mutants compared to the WT strain under amino acid starved conditions. Because the chromatin structure at the <italic>frq</italic> promoter is constitutively compacted by amino acid starvation, CPC-1 protein level is a limiting factor for efficiently recruiting GCN-5 and SAGA complex to loosen the chromatin to drive rhythmic <italic>frq</italic> expression under amino acid starved conditions. As suggested, we have now revised the model in Figure 8 and edited the figure legend and discussion to make it more clear to readers.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. In the new Supplementary file S1. The authors have provided lists of 148 cpc-1 up-regulated genes and 127 cpc-1 down-regulated genes, of which 79 up-regulated genes apparently show rhythmic expression and 67 down-regulated genes apparently show rhythmic expression. They have not however provided the statistics of the CircaCompare tests of rhythmicity for the WT strain, which needs to be added for each gene listed in the new file S1. In addition, they should provide new text in the RESULTS explaining that ~53% of both the up- and down-regulated genes exhibit rhythmicity and indicate that this represents a highly significant enrichment of all cpc-1 regulated genes as judged by the hypergeometric distribution test, providing the P-value. The file S1 should also include a notes sheet fully explaining the data provided there.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments to our revised manuscript. We have now revised the manuscript to address the concerns.</p><p>First, it should be noted that the published RNA-seq data were first generated by Hurley et al. in 2014 and were re-analyzed by them using the improved statistical tool eJTK Cycle in 2018. The P-values of eJTK Cycle analysis (from the Supplemental Datasets 1 and 2 of Hurley et al., 2018) has now been added in our revised Supplementary file 1. CircaCompare is used to compare the differences between two rhythmic datasets and CircaSingle (Parsons et al., 2020) is used to analyze the rhythmic parameters of a single group. As suggested by the reviewer, we re-analyzed the rhythmicity of CPC-1 targeted genes (148 up-regulated and 127 down-regulated) using CircaSingle and added the P-values in the revised Supplementary file 1. There were 146 rhythmic genes based on the eJTK Cycle and 132 rhythmic genes based on the CircaSingle. There were 106 overlapping genes between the two sets of data, confirming the results using eJTK Cycle. Thus, we performed further analysis based on the data from eJTK Cycle.</p><p>Second, we have now added the description of the rhythmicity of CPC-1 targeted genes in the Results “There were 146/275 (53%) of the CPC-1 up- and down-regulated genes under amino acid starvation exhibiting rhythmicity, indicating a highly significant enrichment of CPC-1 regulated genes as clock-controlled genes (p = 3.341905e-06, hypergeometric distribution test)”. The rhythmic genes and all detected genes of RNA-seq data from Hurley et al. 2018 were added in the revised Supplementary file 1, which was used for the hypergeometric distribution test.</p><p>Third, we have now revised the Supplementary file 1 by adding a notes sheet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A notes sheet should also be added to the new Supplementary file S2 in which the results in each sheet should be linked to data in the corresponding figures, and also stipulating the difference between results listed in different sheets for FRQ versus frq (Protein vs. mRNA?). In short, each Supplementary file should be understandable as a stand-alone document.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestions. We have now added a notes sheet for Supplementary file 2 and stipulated the information for FRQ protein and <italic>frq</italic> mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
