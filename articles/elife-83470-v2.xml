reservoirs repeatedly cross species barriers to infect humans. Dogs are the closest companion animals to humans, but the role of dogs in the ecology of influenza viruses is unclear. H3N2 avian influenza viruses were transmitted to dogs around 2006 and have formed stable lineages. The long-term epidemic of avian-origin H3N2 virus in canines offers the best models to investigate the effect of dogs on the evolution of influenza viruses. Here, we carried out a systematic and comparative identification of the biological characteristics of H3N2 canine influenza viruses (CIVs) isolated worldwide over 10 years. We found that, during adaptation in dogs, H3N2 CIVs became able to recognize the human-like SAα2,6-Gal receptor, showed gradually increased hemagglutination (HA) acid stability and replication ability in human airway epithelial cells, and acquired a 100% transmission rate via respiratory droplets in a ferret model. We also found that human populations lack immunity to H3N2 CIVs, and even preexisting immunity derived from the present human seasonal influenza viruses cannot provide protection against H3N2 CIVs. Our results showed that canines may serve as intermediates for the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to humans. Continuous surveillance coordinated with risk assessment for CIVs is necessary.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>canine h3n2 influenza virus</kwd><kwd>airborne transmissibility</kwd><kwd>HA</kwd><kwd>PB1</kwd><kwd>public health</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant No. 32172838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yipeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant No. 32192451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jinhua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013314</institution-id><institution>Higher Education Discipline Innovation Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>111 Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yipeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During adaptation in dogs, H3N2 canine influenza viruses (CIVs) became to recognize human-like SAα2,6-Gal receptor, increased replication ability in human cells, acquired a 100% transmission rate via respiratory droplet in ferret model, and human population lacked immunity to H3N2 CIVs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the 21<sup>st</sup> century, newly emerging viruses, such as influenza A H7N9, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus, are posing serious challenges to healthcare systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jacob et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Imai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yakob and Walker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thakur and Ratho, 2022</xref>). These challenges are constant reminders to the scientific community to pay attention to emerging animal-borne zoonotic diseases. Influenza A viruses have a relatively broad host range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Long et al., 2019</xref>). When animal-borne viruses with different antigenicities acquire human-human aerosol transmission abilities, they become epidemic in the population. The four human pandemic viruses in recorded history underwent avian or swine influenza virus gene reassortment with human influenza virus or acquired human adaptive mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vijaykrishna et al., 2010</xref>). Animal-borne virus adaption to a mammalian intermediate host is an important way that they are able to establish infections in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parrish et al., 2015</xref>). Swine are considered a typical intermediate host; for example, the Eurasian avian-origin lineage of H1 subtype swine influenza viruses that originated in European swine in the 1970s gradually accumulated amino-acid mutations related to human adaptation and gained increased infectivity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mena et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown, 2013</xref>). However, the role of other mammals in viral ecology is still unclear.</p><p>Similar to that of pigs, the canine respiratory tract contains both types of sialic acid receptors used by influenza viruses (α2,3- and α2,6-linked) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wasik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ning et al., 2012</xref>). Dogs are susceptible to natural influenza virus infections caused by transmission from avian (H3N2 and H5N1), equine (H3N8), or human (pdmH1N1 and H3N2) virus reservoirs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crawford et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Song et al., 2008</xref>). Several reassortment events in influenza viruses have occurred from different host sources in dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voorhees et al., 2017</xref>), such as reassortment between canine H3N2 and human H1N1 viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Song et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moon et al., 2015</xref>) and canine H3N2 and swine influenza viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eichorst et al., 2018</xref>). Dogs are important companion animals, and once a new zoonotic disease appears in dogs, there is a high chance to infect humans. However, whether dogs can act as intermediate hosts to produce zoonotic influenza viruses is not established.</p><p>Although dogs have been found infected with multiple influenza viruses, only equine-origin H3N8 and avian-origin H3N2 viruses have established lineages in dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hayward et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lyu et al., 2019</xref>). Compared with H3N8 CIV, H3N2 CIV has a broader host range, infecting multiple mammalian animals, including ferrets, guinea pigs, mice, and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lee et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lyoo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jeoung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song et al., 2011</xref>). H3N2 CIV was first isolated in 2006 from Guangdong Province in China, and was found to be genetically most closely related to the H3N2 avian influenza viruses prevalent in aquatic birds in South Korea for all eight gene segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Su et al., 2012</xref>). Since then, H3N2 CIV has been prevalent in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2021</xref>) and South Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lee et al., 2016a</xref>), and has circulated in the United States since 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voorhees et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Voorhees et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martinez-Sobrido et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dalziel et al., 2014</xref>). The long-term epidemic of avian-origin H3N2 virus in canines offers the best opportunities to investigate the potential role of dogs in the ecology of influenza A viruses.</p><p>In the present study, we thus systematically investigated the evolution of genetic and biological properties of this avian-origin virus during its circulation in dogs. We found that during the adaptation of H3N2 CIVs to dogs, H3N2 CIVs became able to recognize the human-like SAα2, 6Gal receptor, showed gradually increased HA acid stability and replication ability in human airway epithelial cells, and had a 100% transmission rate via respiratory droplets in a ferret mode. Our results revealed that dogs might serve as potential intermediate hosts for animal influenza viruses’ adaption to humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Continued genetic evolution of avian-origin H3N2 CIVs in dogs</title><p>From 2012 to 2019, we collected tracheal swab samples from 4174 dogs with signs of respiratory disease from animal hospitals and kennels in nine provinces or municipalities of China (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A total of 235 samples (5.63%) were positive for H3N2 infection. The mean positive rates for each year increased from 1.98% in 2012 to 10.85% in 2019 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), with a sharp increase after 2016. According to isolation time and location, 117 representative viruses were selected for full genome sequencing, including 51 strains isolated from 2012–2017 that were previously uploaded to the GenBank database by our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lyu et al., 2019</xref>). The whole genomes of these viruses were analyzed along with all complete H3N2 CIV genomes publicly available in GenBank and the GISAID database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org/">https://www.gisaid.org/</ext-link>) (n=229), and we constructed the maximum-likelihood phylogenic trees of eight viral gene segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">10</xref>). The inferred trees for all genomic segments exhibited a similar topology; thus, we grouped the viruses into six clades (clades 0–5) according to HA phylogeny, with several viruses consistently clustering together with high posterior probability values (bootstrap values ≥70). Clade 0 contains viruses isolated in China from 2006 to 2007, and clade 1 contains isolates exclusively from South Korea from 2007 and 2012. Clade 2 represents viruses isolated in China from 2009 to 2016, Thailand in 2012, and the United States in 2017; and clade 3 contains viruses collected in South Korea from 2012 and 2013. Clade 4 contains strains isolated in the United States from 2015 to 2017 and South Korea in 2015, and clade 5 encompasses isolates from China from 2016 to 2019 and the United States from 2017 to 2018. Most H3N2 CIVs after 2019 isolated in China have formed a further subclade 5.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Comparing sequences of H3N2 CIVs with human influenza viruses and ancestral avian influenza viruses showed that, compared with ancestral avian influenza viruses, H3N2 CIVs that were initially introduced to dogs possessed several substitutions identical to human influenza viruses with high frequencies (&gt;90%). A noteworthy observation was the number of human-like amino-acid substitutions that had gradually accumulated during the evolution of H3N2 CIVs in dogs and increased significantly after 2016 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicated that H3N2 CIVs may have increased their adaptability to humans during their evolution in dogs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic and antigenic characterization of H3N2 CIVs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of hemagglutinin (HA) genomic segment of H3N2 CIVs.

Of note, threats to human health might increase during H3N2 CIVs’ adaptation to dogs. Specifically, we observed changes in receptor binding specificity, from viruses recognizing only α–2,3-linked sialosides to those recognizing both α–2,3- and α–2,6-linked sialosides, as well as gradually increased HA acid stability and replication in human airway epithelial cells and ferrets and the ability to be transmitted by aerosol among ferrets. In addition, humans lack immunity to the H3N2 CIVs, and increased isolation of H3N2 CIVs in the dog population might increase the chance of transmission to humans. Therefore, we suggested that dogs are potential intermediate hosts in which avian influenza viruses can adapt to humans.</p><p>We found that H3N2 CIVs formed different clades after entering the dog population, and these clades were related to the time of virus isolation. Early H3N2 CIVs (clades 0 and 1) are not transmitted efficiently among dogs. After a particular opportunity, the avian H3N2 subtype influenza virus enters and gradually adapts to dogs. The H3N2 CIVs isolated after 2012 can reach 100% transmission in dogs. Clade 5 viruses isolated after 2016 were transmitted to all three contact animals within 2 dpi; thus the transmission time interval had shortened. Moreover, the replication ability of clade 5.1 strains generated after 2019 has further improved. Additionally, H3N2 CIV antigenicity has continuously evolved to form groups A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. The gradual improvement in viral infection and transmission ability and the continuous evolution of antigenicity promoted the prevalence of H3N2 CIV in dogs.</p><p>The high isolation rate of H3N2 CIVs in companion animal dogs might increase the opportunity for viral cross-species transmission to humans. We found that the number and frequency of substitutions identical to human influenza viruses increased in H3N2 CIVs during the adaptation process in dogs, and the number of homology sites increased significantly after 2016. Therefore, we evaluated the potential threat of H3N2 CIVs to public health and found that mutation of HA-G146S around the receptor-binding domain after 2016 caused a shift from the recognition of only α–2,3-linked sialosides (clade 0, 1, 2, and 3 viruses) to both α–2,3- and α–2,6-linked sialosides (clade 4, 5, and 5.1). Furthermore, the HA-G16S and HA-N188D mutations resulted in enhanced acid and thermostability, and the PB1-D154G mutation resulted in increased polymerase activity, which together resulted in the acquisition of aerosol-transmitting properties in ferrets. Notably, the proportions of HA-G146S, HA-N188D, and PB1-D154G are all higher than 90% in human influenza viruses. Therefore, during the gradual adaptation of CIVs in dogs, clade 5 CIVs with high adaptability to mammals were selected. Additionally, we found that clade 5 CIVs further adapted after 2019. The HA-G16S mutation, which improves acid stability, further improved the replication ability and shortened the transmission time of CIVs in ferrets.</p><p>Although our results suggest that, after the avian-origin H3N2 influenza viruses were introduced to dogs, they adapted to canines and might represent an increased threat to public health, no studies have yet reported human infection with H3N2 CIV. Additionally, although influenza viruses that can be transmitted between humans possess transmissibility via respiratory droplets to ferrets, the reverse scenario does not necessarily occur. Nevertheless, to lower the prevalence of novel influenza viruses that are a potential public health threat, controlling the prevailing H3N2 CIVs in dogs and continuous monitoring of their biological characteristics should be implemented.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Viruses and cells</title><p>Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from dogs with signs of respiratory disease in animal hospitals or kennels in nine provinces or municipalities of China (Liaoning, Beijing, Tianjin, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Shanxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan) between 2017 and 2019.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sara Sawyer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hongquan Wan (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission. Personally, I am very excited about this paper, and I hope you will be able to address the outstanding issues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Anyone who reads this paper is going to wonder if human seasonal H3N2 will provide us protection from this virus if it does jump from dogs to humans. The authors indicate not, but they state this is a single sentence in the paper and a supplemental table. This fact needs to be emphasized (possibly even in the abstract). Data needs to be brought into the main paper, and also anti-NA antibody assays must be performed. (One of reasons proposed as to the lower impact of the H3N2 pandemic was the presence of anti-N2 antibodies in the human population.). Regardless of the outcome of the N2 experiment, we would still be interested in the data being in the main paper. Either way the paper is still very compelling.</p><p>2) Please work with a professional English editor to strengthen the writing of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

It should also be specified how many animals in each group were followed up for clinical signs. In this reviewer's opinion, if the dogs sacrificed for virus titration were not included for the monitoring of clinical signs, the authors should describe the virus titration first, and then the clinical signs and virus transmission.
