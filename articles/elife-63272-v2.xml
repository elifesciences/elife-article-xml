Across multiple experiments (375 participants), we tested whether senior medical students differed from younger colleagues and lay controls in the way they assess people’s pain and take into consideration their feedback. We found that medical training affected the sensitivity to pain faces, an effect shown by the lower ratings and highlighted by a decrease in neural response of the insula and cingulate cortex. Instead, distrust toward the expressions’ authenticity affected the processing of feedbacks, by decreasing activity in the ventral striatum whenever patients’ self-reports matched participants’ evaluations, and by promoting strong reliance on the opinion of other doctors.

Unlike other medical conditions, which are diagnosed through reliable tests, pain is difficult to quantify objectively, and it is mainly assessed by medical practitioners (physicians, nurses, medical students, etc.) using indirect information or self-reports. As such, healthcare providers systematically underestimate patients’ pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davoudi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duignan and Dunn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kappesser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Puntillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Teske et al., 1983</xref>), a phenomenon which emerges as early as during university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xie et al., 2018</xref>), becomes more pronounced with long-lasting experience in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choinière et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davoudi et al., 2008</xref>), and affects prevalently women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greenwood et al., 2018</xref>) and ethnical minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghoshal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaseweter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Todd et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Despite extensive research, the causes of pain underestimation are still unclear. A popular theory suggests a major role of medical experience. Indeed, due to their daily exposure to the severe conditions, often characterized by high levels of suffering, healthcare providers could have progressively changed their frame of reference of what characterizes an extreme pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergh and Sjöström, 1999</xref>). Hence, they might be inclined to provide less intense evaluations than those individuals (e.g. the average patient) who do not share the same experience. Within this framework, neuroimaging literature repeatedly implicated brain regions, such as the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in processing other people’s pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jauniaux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kogler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Timmers et al., 2018</xref>). As this network is partly common to that involved in first-hand pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kogler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>), scholars interpreted this activations in terms of empathy, whereby individuals simulate the observed state on oneself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernhardt and Singer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lamm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stietz et al., 2019</xref>). Critically, expert medical practitioners exhibited lower neural response in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>), whereas they appear to over-recruit prefrontal structures, often implicated in regulation and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>), possibly reflecting enhanced ability at regulating their primary empathetic responses to the sight of people potential sufferance.</p><p>Medical experience and emotion regulation might not be sufficient for explaining the entirety of the phenomenon. In clinical settings, acknowledging high levels of pain often leads to the prescription of strong analgesics, which however have contraindications for patients’ health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckeridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Makris et al., 2014</xref>). Concerns for such side-effects (e.g. opiophobia) contribute to inadequate pain treatment in medical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Carr, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertrand et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2019</xref>), as healthcare providers prioritize those cases in which pain is unequivocally established. In this perspective, one study showed that doctors and nurses tended to underestimate pain in larger extent when presented with cues that patients might have lied or exaggerate their ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kappesser et al., 2006</xref>). In a similar vein, recent qualitative investigations revealed that emergency nurses tend to privilege their own personal judgments rather than patients pain-ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johannessen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vuille et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, when their clinical assessment is inconsistent with the self-reports (e.g. patients denounce high suffering while few minutes before they were chatting/laughing), nurses try to convince patients to reappraise their pain, or at least mark their own point of view in the clinical chart when transferring the case to a colleague (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vuille et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, healthcare providers appear to scrutinize the reliability of patients’ pain and, in some case, even to mistrust their reports and feedbacks, at the advantage of the opinion of other medical practitioners. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study investigated systematically the role played by patients’ feedbacks in pain assessments, and whether this influence changes with respect to that of other physicians.</p><p>Psychology and neuroscience literature provided us with several tools to investigate the role of social influence in individuals’ perceptual decisions and subjective experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schnuerch and Gibbons, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). In a seminal paradigm, participants evaluated the attractiveness of women and, subsequently, saw a feedback representative of peers’ mean ratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref>). Critically, when unexpectedly requested to repeat the task, participants reappraised each face consistently with the feedback received. Furthermore, a large discrepancy with others’ evaluations increased the neural activity in the dorsal-posterior portion of the medial prefrontal cortex (dpMPFC), often implicated in prediction error, whereas agreement with these feedbacks recruited the reward system in the ventral striatum (VS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2016</xref> as meta-analysis). These effects have supported the idea that, even in subjective decisions with no correct/incorrect answers, participants considered the opinion of peers as an indirect proxy of their proficiency in the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The present research aims at testing the degree with which healthcare providers take into account feedbacks about their pain assessment, and whether they weight in different extent the opinion of the patient from that of other physicians. Across two-experiments, we implemented a modified version of the social influence paradigm described above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Here, individuals appraised the pain of facial expression video-clips, and subsequently were confronted with two feedbacks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): the self-report of the person in pain (the <italic>Target</italic> of each video) and the average opinion of 20 medical practitioners (hereafter, <italic>MPs</italic>). The two feedbacks occurred simultaneously, and each of them could appear either at a lower, equal or higher position with respect to participants’ initial rating (see Materials and methods). After 30 min from the end of this first session, participants were unexpectedly asked to evaluate again the same facial expressions, thus providing the opportunity to assess if their initial evaluations changed and, in that case, which feedback (<italic>Target</italic> vs. <italic>MPs</italic>) best explained the reappraisal. In the context of pain assessments, the rating of the patient should represent the most reliable source of information to which compare one’s performance. Hence, individuals’ behavioral and neural responses should ideally be influenced in privileged fashion by the <italic>Target</italic>‘s feedback, as opposed to that of <italic>MPs</italic> who are not experiencing the pain directly. However, healthcare providers might mistrust information arising from the person in pain, and privilege the one of physicians, toward which they have developed positive dispositions. Hence, when confronted with feedbacks about their pain assessment, they might value in greater extent the opinion of other doctors at the expense of that of the patients.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of trial structure in the first session.</title><p>For demonstrative purposes, one author of the study (GD) is depicted in the figure expressing pain in similar way to the video-clips used as stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lamm et al., 2007</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63272-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Population validation</title><p>In the present study, we recruited as a population of interest medical students from different years of medical faculty. This population was chosen due to its feasibility in terms of recruitment, and the straightforward quantification of individual experience (corresponding to the year of enrollment at university, regardless of future specializations, department, hierarchy, etc.). Furthermore, pain underestimation has been documented also in medical students (at least after 3 years, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xie et al., 2018</xref>), thus making this population suitable for our research question. Finally, we assumed that these individuals would display stronger positive dispositions toward the category of physicians, relatively to lay individuals. This assumption was validated by a pilot experiment (Pilot 1, see Appendix 1) run on an independent population of 155 participants, organized in four groups: 38 Experienced Medical Students (EMS, from the 5th and 6th year), 32 Intermediate Medical Students (IMS, from the 3rd and 4th year), 56 Young Medical Students (YMS, from the 1st and 2nd year), and 29 lay Controls (from different faculties/professions, except those related to medicine, infirmary, dentistry and physiotherapy). Through an implicit association task (IAT), we calculated an index (D-score) reflecting strength of positive disposition toward the category of <italic>MPs</italic> (relative to non-<italic>MPs</italic>). An Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) aimed at testing for group differences revealed higher D-scores in EMS, relative to Controls and less experienced students (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> for a similar effect in subjects from Experiment 2).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Behavioral Results of IAT and first session.</title><p>Boxplots and individual data describing (<bold>A–D</bold>) the IAT D-score across groups (higher values refer to stronger implicit positive dispositions toward the category of MPs; see Appendix 1); (<bold>B–E</bold>), Pain Intensity Ratings from first session of the task; (<bold>C–F</bold>) the Distrust about pain authenticity from the final debrief session. In all plots, data are divided across groups, referring to Controls [C], Young Medical Students [YMS], Intermediate Medical Students [IMS] and Experienced Medical Students [EMS].

In Experiment 1, we recruited 120 participants, organized as 30 Controls, 30 YMS, 30 IMS, and 30 EMS. <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref> provides full details about demographic information of these participants, with controls displaying comparable age to EMS. As first step, we tested whether the mean pain rating prior to the presentation of any feedback changed as function of <italic>Group</italic> through an ANOVA with <italic>Gender</italic> and <italic>Age</italic> as nuisance control variables. The analysis confirmed an effect of <italic>Group</italic> (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3,114)</sub> = 3.09; p=0.030). Post-hoc t-tests showed that YMS were associated with higher ratings than both Controls (<italic>t</italic><sub>(58)</sub> = 2.55; p=0.013) and EMS (<italic>t</italic><sub>(58)</sub> = 2.79; p=0.007, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). No significant difference was found when testing all the other possible combinations of groups (|<italic>t</italic><sub>(58)</sub>|&lt;1.75, p&gt;0.082). We also found an effect of <italic>Gender</italic> (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,114)</sub> = 5.58; p=0.020), reflecting more pronounced ratings in female, relative to male, subjects (<italic>Age: F</italic><sub>(1,114)</sub> = 1.27; p=0.271).</p><p>In Experiment 2, we repeated the same paradigm (with minor adjustments, see methods) by focusing specifically on 52 participants (26 Controls and 26 EMS), and by recording neural responses (through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging [fMRI]). The pain ratings from this experiment did not change as function of <italic>Group</italic> (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,48)</sub> = 0.84; p=0.369; all other effects <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1.36; p&gt;0.249, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), consistently with Experiment one when the same groups were compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We then looked at the neural activity and searched for regions sensitive to the ‘painfulness’ of the expressions (and not for the mere presentation of a face). This was achieved by testing effects significantly associated with the parametrical modulation of pain ratings (whilst controlling for <italic>Gender</italic> and <italic>Age</italic>). We first tested the main effect (activations common to both groups) and found a positive linear relationship at the level of amygdala extending to the periaqueductal grey (PAG), and to the fusiform gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, green blobs). Furthermore, when applying small volume correction in regions previously implicated in paradigms for pain empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kogler et al., 2020</xref>, see methods) the left anterior insula (AI) was also found (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref> for full details). These effects were consistent with previous literature on emotional facial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pessoa and Adolphs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vuilleumier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vuilleumier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vuilleumier and Pourtois, 2007</xref>), and on processing others’ pain through the same networks of first-hand pain experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kogler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Subsequently, we analyzed group differences. We found stronger modulations in Controls as opposed to EMS in the dorsal portion of the anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Under small volume correction, we also implicated the left ventral AI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, red blobs).

For this purpose, we run two experiments (plus preliminary pilots): the first testing behavioral effects in students at different years of enrolment in medical faculty (plus lay controls), and the second recording neural activity (with fMRI) specifically on EMS and Controls. We found that EMS show decreased sensitivity toward painful facial expressions, in terms of both behavioral ratings and neural response in a predefined brain network (centered on AI and dACC) implicated in the processing people’s sufferance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jauniaux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kogler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Timmers et al., 2018</xref>).

Overall, our study underscores the multiple processes influencing the evaluation of pain in medical practitioners, as early as in university years: whereas the students’ seniority influenced the assessment of the patient’s pain, it is distrust that affected the way in which feedbacks from other people (including the patient) are taken into account.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Experience in medical university influences pain processing</title><p>Consistently with previous studies showing that medical students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xie et al., 2018</xref>) and practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davoudi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duignan and Dunn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kappesser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Puntillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Teske et al., 1983</xref>) underestimated others’ pain proportionally to their experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choinière et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Davoudi et al., 2008</xref>), in Experiment 1 we found that students’ seniority influenced negatively the rating of others’ pain expressions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Such effect appeared driven in large extent by young students who provide higher ratings than the other groups, whereas no difference was observed between Controls with no medical education and EMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). This suggests that, at the beginning of their medical tenure, individuals might be highly vigilant to signs about patients’ conditions (including pain), and that this effect decreased linearly in subsequent years.</p><p>Interestingly, Experiment two showed discrepancies between Controls and EMS in the neural response evoked from painful facial expressions. In particular, a network comprehending the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) showed stronger linear effects of pain ratings in controls than in EMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This network has been repeatedly implicated in previous experiments involving the processing and empathizing with others’ pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jauniaux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kogler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Timmers et al., 2018</xref>), and has been often considered the neural substrate for empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernhardt and Singer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lamm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stietz et al., 2019</xref>).

Our data extend these neural findings to a younger population at the end of their university program in medicine, thus suggesting a major role played by medical education in the responsiveness of this network. Furthermore, the analysis of brain activity of Experiment two allows to detect group differences (Controls vs. EMS) which were not observed from the behavioral measures from both experiments. This underlies the ability of neuroimaging techniques to capture also those neural processes which are too subtle to impact overt behavior.</p><p>The negative effect played by medical scholarly and professional experience in the neural response to others’ pain has been often interpreted in terms of decreased empathic response, possibly promoted by enhanced regulatory abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Decety et al., 2010</xref>), and allowing healthcare providers to interact with patients without any contagion from their sufferance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gleichgerrcht and Decety, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vaes and Muratore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weilenmann et al., 2018</xref>). Our data are not against this interpretation, although we advise caution in interpreting modulations in AI/dACC to others’ pain as reflective of overall empathy changes. Indeed, our groups did not differ in terms of empathic traits from dedicated questionnaires (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>), and replacing the grouping variable with these scores in the neuroimaging analysis did not led to any result (scores of perspective taking influenced behavioral ratings, but only in Experiment 2). Also in the literature, positive correlations between AI/dACC response to others’ pain and empathy scores were found in only ~30% of neuroimaging studies who tested this relation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>, for meta-analytic evidence). Furthermore, in contrast to neuroimaging findings, studies testing the role of medical experience on empathy scores have mixed results, with some suggesting a negative modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellini and Shea, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hojat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Neumann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2017</xref>), and others reporting no change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cameron and Inzlicht, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xie et al., 2018</xref>) or even a positive effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Handford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kataoka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2017</xref>), with the direction of the effect changing as function of the score employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The mixed evidence from the literature could reflect the heterogeneity of the notion of empathy, which varies extensively across domains and scholars in terms of definitions and measures, with some tailored at measuring individuals’ ability to share and resonate with pain specifically, whereas others tapping a more broad sensitivity to different emotional states (disgust, anger, joy) which are less relevant in healthcare settings. For these reasons, we prefer a more parsimonious interpretation, whereby medical experience impacts individual sensitivity to others’ pain, rather than individuals overall empathetic abilities. This process has the beneficial effect of shielding physicians from the emotional weight sharing others’ suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gleichgerrcht and Decety, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vaes and Muratore, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weilenmann et al., 2018</xref>), but at the same time exposes patients (especially women and individuals from ethnical minorities, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ghoshal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greenwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaseweter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Todd et al., 2000</xref>) to the risk of being unrelieved from their condition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>General and specific effects in feedback processing</title><p>When analyzing the degree to which individuals react to feedbacks, we found evidence of both general effects (common to <italic>Target</italic> and <italic>MPs</italic>), but also modulations specific for one source of information. At the behavioral level, we found that participants adjusted their pain ratings as function of any kind of feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This was mirrored by the analysis of brain activity, which revealed that the signal in a widespread network centered in dpMPFC increased linearly with the absolute discrepancy between participants’ initial ratings and the presentation of any kind of feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These converging effects of discrepancy for <italic>Target</italic>/<italic>MPs</italic> were highly reminiscent to those observed in previous studies testing social discrepancy in other forms of perceptual judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, there are three alternative ways to interpret these general effects. First, part of participants’ monitoring system treats information from the physicians as relevant as that from the person experiencing pain directly. Hence, although the feedbacks are interpreted in terms of their social meaning, none of them are taken into account in a privileged fashion, at least in the context of discrepancies. Second, it is possible that participants were captured by the presence of any visual stimulus far from their current attentional focus (the initial rating). This conjecture draws from a recent study employing a similar paradigm, in which participants’ reappraisal was also influenced by feedbacks with no social meaning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim and Hommel, 2015</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref>). Third, scholars suggested a potential confound of the initial rating, which depends on the position of the feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ihmels and Ache, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim and Hommel, 2018</xref>). Indeed, trials with large deviance in one direction are by definition those in which the initial rating is sufficiently distant from the physical boundary of the scale to allow the presentation of the feedback (see methods). Hence, discrepancy effects could (at least in principle) be a delayed after-effects of the previous rated pain. Currently, our results do not allow to dissociate between these three alternative interpretations. Future research, involving the implementation of additional control conditions, will ascertain whether the divergence effects observed here underlie a true processing of the social information conveyed by the feedbacks.</p><p>In sharp contrast from discrepancy effects, the neural modulations evoked by agreement appear to be selective for one source of information. More specifically, in line with previous studies investigating effects of social influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), we found that the agreement with the <italic>Target</italic> feedback enhanced activity in the VS and Putamen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Critically, such effect was not observed for <italic>MPs</italic> feedback, a pattern confirmed also when testing the direct contrast <italic>Target</italic> &gt;<italic>MPs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Hence, the analysis of convergences provides clear evidence that participants do take into account the social meaning of the feedbacks (over and above other potential non-social confounds), with VS/Putamen privileging information arising from the person in pain as opposed to that coming from physicians. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study documenting a dissociation of different networks subtending divergence <italic>vs</italic>. agreement effects in social influence paradigms. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref> interpreted the neural responses in social influence paradigms as part of a unique mechanism for reinforcement learning, according to which midbrain dopaminergic signals monitor whether an outcome is perceived as negative or positive by projecting to neural structures in dpMPFC and VS, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref>). Within this framework, divergence/convergence effects are essentially two sides of the same coin. However, this view is not supported by our data showing a further functional differentiation among the two sets of regions. Whereas discrepancy effects appear to work on a more general level (without distinguishing between different sources of information), agreement effects in VS/Putamen were specific for the feedback from the person in pain, suggesting a selective monitoring of the most relevant source of information for the decision. Hence, VS is not merely the opposite of dpMPFC, but responds according to different principles/priorities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Distrust influences specific feedback processing</title><p>Across both experiments, we found that <italic>Distrust</italic> was the key factor explaining whether participants valued in greater extent the information arising from <italic>Target</italic> or <italic>MPs</italic>.

Hence, our effects might not reflect experience, belongingness or personal positive dispositions toward <italic>MPs</italic>, but possibly the fact that doctors are figures of authority which become much more salient when the facial expression cannot be relied upon.</p><p>Previous studies already revealed that healthcare providers underestimated patients’ pain in greater extent when they were given hints about potential deceptive attempts to get attention or non-necessary medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kappesser et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, qualitative investigations suggested that emergency nurses sometimes have difficulty suspending their point of view when confronted with patients whose pain-reports conflict strongly with their initial judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johannessen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vuille et al., 2018</xref>). Our study provides a mechanistic explanation of these observations, by revealing that distrust operates on part of the network for feedback-based learning, and specifically by altering the sensitivity of the reward system to information from the person in pain. Plainly put, if the <italic>Target</italic> is not to be trusted, his/her self-reports become less relevant, and VS might react less strongly to any agreement with one’s rating.</p><p>Our findings are particularly relevant in clinical settings, where pain appraisal is the basis for the selection of subsequent therapeutic procedures, including the prescription of strong (and potentially dangerous) painkillers. In this context, the deontological need to relieve patient’s pain is often counterweighted by the equally relevant need to prevent future side-effects and complications, a conflict that is often resolved by each individual based on personal ability to cope with uncertainty and sensitivity to errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corradi-Dell'Acqua et al., 2019</xref>). Obviously, a key source of information for these decisions is the reliability of available pain cues (e.g. <italic>is the facial expression genuine?</italic>) which, if estimated below a given threshold, can relieve caregivers from any struggle by prioritizing other clinical considerations over the management of patients’ pain. As unfortunate drawback, estimated reliability might be vulnerable to biases, including those related to the social and ethical condition of the patient. Previous studies showed that confronting individuals from different social and ethnic group can impact profoundly representation of trust and associated activity in VS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hughes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stanley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stanley et al., 2011</xref>), but also sensitivity to their pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avenanti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mende-Siedlecki et al., 2019</xref>) including the neural responses in AI and dACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). As such, the interplay between the reward system and AI-dACC network might offer a plausible model to explain why specific social/ethnic categories are less likely to be acknowledged for their pain and receive adequate treatment. Future studies will need to explore this.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations of the study and concluding remarks</title><p>The present study investigates the role of medical experience by recruiting independent groups at different years of university. As such, our study shares the weaknesses of cross-sectional investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang and Cheng, 2020</xref>), as the role of experience was not tested longitudinally in the same population. In particular, some of our effects might be influenced by individual traits and features which are more frequently observed in medical students (especially those who reach the end of their tenure) as opposed to lay controls. In our analysis, we took care to account for several potential confounding variables, such as gender, age, or empathic traits. Other measures (e.g. personality traits) appeared fairly stable across the different groups (with only few differences, not systematic across experiments; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>), and therefore are unlikely to have confounded our results. Yet, it is still possible that our results could have been influenced also by other factors untested in the present study. For instance, relevant missing information are the detailed educational level of Controls (including their year of enrollment at university) and participants’ ethnic group. Finally, in designing our study we followed previous paradigms in which social feedbacks (in our case <italic>MPs</italic>) were described as the aggregate opinion of many individuals from a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koban and Wager, 2016</xref>). This however opens the question as to whether <italic>Distrust</italic> promotes reliance toward <italic>MPs</italic> feedback due to their professional background, their size (an opinion of 20 is more reliable than that of one) or a combination of both factors. Future studies will need to duly account for these limitations.</p><p>Notwithstanding these considerations, our study provides compelling evidence of an independent contribution of experience and <italic>Distrust</italic> in different aspects of pain management. Experience in medical faculty influenced individuals’ assessment of pain, both at the level of explicit ratings, and on a network comprehending insular and cingulate cortex knowingly sensitive to cues about people’s suffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jauniaux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kogler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lamm et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Timmers et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Distrust</italic> affected the processing of feedbacks about one’s assessments, by decreasing striatal activity whenever the <italic>Target</italic>’s reports match participants’ initial ratings, and by leading participants to rely more on the opinion of other doctors. Overall, our study documents relevant changes in the neural circuity underling pain assessment and feedback processing that occur already at the very early stages of medical career.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Because this was an exploratory experiment, we recruited an overall of 120 participants, organized in four groups of 30 subjects. The first group comprehended lay individuals (12 males out of 30, mean age = 25.03 years±4.75 Standard Deviation [SD]) who were recruited among different faculties and professions, except those related to medicine, infirmary, dentistry, and physiotherapy. The remaining 90 participants (26 males, mean age = 22.56 ± 2.86) were recruited among students enrolled from the 1 st to the 6th year of medical faculty at the University of Geneva and Lausanne (1 st year = 14, 2nd year = 16, 3rd year, N = 15; 4th year, N = 15; 5th year, N = 17; 6th year, N = 13). We divided the total sample into additional groups of 30 participants each: controls, Young Medical Students (YMS) from the 1st and 2nd year of faculty, Intermediate Medical Students (IMS) from the 3rd and 4th year and Experienced Medical Students (EMS) from the 5th and 6th year. The participants did not report any history of neurological nor psychiatric illness and were naïve to the purpose of the study. Furthermore, they signed an informed consent prior to the experiment. This research (both experiments) was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethical committee (Commission Cantonale d'Éthique e de la Recherce [CCER] of Geneva, protocol code: CCER N. 2016–01862).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Stimuli</title><p>We used a database of 44 videos of painful facial expressions from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lamm et al., 2007</xref> depicting Caucasian actors wearing headphones and simulating painful reactions to a high pitch noise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A validation pilot experiment (Pilot 2) on 24 independent lay participants (seven males, age 23.54 ± 4.12) revealed that the pain of these expressions was rated on average 7.42 ± 1.26 on a scale ranging from 1 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst pain imaginable). Ratings for each isolated video were highly similar with one another, with the least painful clip evaluated on average 7.01 ± 1.55 and the most painful clip 7.88 ± 1.41.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Experimental set-up</title><p>The main experimental session was organized in three blocks. In the first block, participants saw a fixation cross (1 s) followed by one video (3 s) and were asked to estimate the amount of pain experienced by the person in the video, by moving a randomly-presented rectangular cursor on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) ranging from ‘no pain at all’ (corresponding to value 1) to ‘the worst pain imaginable’ (corresponding to value 10). Following the rating (7 s), participants were exposed to two simultaneous feedbacks (3 s) that represented the judgement of the <italic>Target</italic> of the video and the average judgement of 20 emergency doctors that previously rated the same video-clips. These two feedbacks were displayed by cursors similar to that of the participant but of different colors (color codes were randomized across participants). Each kind of feedback was independent and orthogonal as respect to the other and described pain levels, which could be higher, equal or lower, compared to the participant. This led to a 3 × 3 design, with nine different conditions. Feedbacks were located on the scale according to a normal distribution with mean +2.2, 0 and −2.2 scale points for values higher, equal and lower ratings respectively, and ±0.5 as standard deviation that helped in providing an effect of variability consistent with that of a human judgement. In case the feedbacks had to appear out of the physical limit of the scale, they were instead displayed at the further extremity within the scale. Each video appeared just once (total number = 44) and was randomly assigned to one of the nine conditions. This led to eight conditions associated with five videos, and one condition associated with four videos (5<italic>*</italic>8 + 4 <italic>=</italic> 44). The association between conditions and videos was different for each subject, thus preventing the presence of one condition systematically associated with less videos.</p><p>In a second block, participants completed a battery of questionnaires in a time-window of 30 min (see below). This block served also to the purpose of allowing some time to pass between the first and the third block. If participants completed the questionnaires before the end of the 30-min session, they were asked to wait for the remaining time. If they were still filling the questionnaires at the end of the 30<sup>th</sup> minute, they were asked to discontinue and finish after the third block. This insured that for all participants the same delay was implemented between the first and third block. The questionnaires comprehended the French versions of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Davis, 1980</xref>); the Situation Pain Questionnaire (SPQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark and Yang, 1983</xref>); the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sullivan et al., 1995</xref>) and the Big Five Inventory (BFI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Plaisant et al., 2010</xref>). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref> for more details.</p><p>Finally, in the third block participants were unexpectedly asked to rate again all 44 videoclips, without however being exposed to any feedback. The experiment was programmed using Cogent (Wellcome Dept., London, UK) toolbox as implemented in Matlab R2012a (Mathworks, Natick, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Procedure</title><p>After signing the informed consent, participants could read the instructions and familiarize with the association between the cursors’ colors and their meaning. During the rating session, responses were collected by pressing highlighted keys on the computer keyboard. The overall experiment lasted approximately 75 min (block 1:~15; block 2: 30 min and block 3:~15), and was followed by a short debriefing session in which participants replied to ad hoc questions testing several aspects of the experimental manipulation (see Appendix 1 for further details). Finally, participants were asked to complete a set of questionnaires that they started during block two in case they could not finish before 30 min. The experiment took place at the Brain Behavioral Laboratory (BBL) in the Centre Médical Universitaire (CMU) of the University of Geneva, Switzerland.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Data analysis</title><p>As a first step, we analyzed if the four groups of interest changed as function of their rating from the first session. This was achieved by feeding the median pain ratings in an Analysis of Variance with <italic>Group</italic> as between-subject factor. To account for potential age differences between the group, the ANOVA was also repeated by using age as covariate.</p><p>Subsequently, we assessed whether participants changed their initial ratings as function of the social feedback. Following previous studies in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klucharev et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koban and Wager, 2016</xref>), a measure of Reappraisal was considered, defined as the differential rating between the third and first block for each video. Single trial Reappraisal values were fed to a Linear Mixed Model (LMM) with the relative position of the <italic>Target</italic> and <italic>MPs</italic> feedbacks as continuous predictors. Furthermore, we also included <italic>Group</italic>, <italic>Gender</italic>, and <italic>Age</italic> as between-subject predictors, each modeled as both main effect and in interaction with <italic>Target</italic> and <italic>MPs</italic>. Finally, the identity of the subjects and of the individuals portrayed in the videos was modeled as random factor (with random intercept, and slope for <italic>Target</italic> and <italic>MPs</italic>). Additionally, we assessed whether individual differences in the task could be well explained in terms of beliefs about the authenticity of the pain observed. To assess this, the same LMM described above was repeated by replacing the <italic>Group</italic> factor with <italic>Distrust</italic> scores as continuous between-subject predictor. This score was obtained by the combination of two post-experimental debrief items (see Appendix 1 for more details). <italic>Item 1</italic>: ‘I had the impression that the people in the video were simulating unpleasantness’ (in French: ‘J'ai eu l'impression que les gens de la vidéo ont simulé le désagrément’); <italic>Item 2</italic>: ‘I had the impression that the pain observed was real’ (‘J'ai eu l'impression que la douleur observée était réelle’). For both items, participants could give an answer in a five points Likert scale ranging from 1 [not at all] to 5 [absolutely]. As the reports of these two debrief items are complementary, a combined measure was calculated as follows: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi/><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi/><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi/><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, which describes a <italic>Distrust</italic> scalar ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The significance of the relevant effects in the LMM was calculated using the Satterthwaite approximation of the degrees of freedom, as implemented in the lmerTest package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kuznetsova et al., 2015</xref>) from R.3.4.4 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experiment 2</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>For this experiment, 28 experienced medical students (EMS) enrolled to the 5th and 6th year of medicine at the University of Geneva, responded to our recruitment call. Two of them were excluded due to non-agreement with the task. Therefore, the final sample of EMS was composed by 26 participants (nine males, age = 24.15 ± 1.40). EMS participants were associated with a matched control group of 26 students not enrolled in medical-related faculties (13 males, age = 23.73 ± 4.11). The recruitment was carried out as for Experiment 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Experimental set-up and procedure</title><p>After having read and signed the consent form and MRI security check-list, participants lay supine on the scanner with their head fixated by firm foam pads. They underwent a unique scanning session of about 20 min, where they carried out the same task as in Experiment 1-block 1, with few changes. Firstly, due to exigencies of the functional data acquisition in the MRI, the inter-stimulus interval was jittered and ranged from 2 to 5 s. Furthermore, the two social feedbacks were not rectangular shapes, like in the case of the previous experiment, but two little icons representing schematically a physician (a shape of a person with a stethoscope) and the person depicted in the video (a shape of a person with headphones; consistently with the video database implemented, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This change was motivated by the fact that the rectangular feedbacks used in Experiment 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) could have been easily confused. Although all participants from Experiment one recalled the association between the rectangle color and its meaning in the debrief, it is still possible that, in several instances during the task, the different meaning of the two feedbacks might have slipped participants’ mind. Hence, replacing the rectangular shapes with icons transparently interpretable should have minimized any risk of confusion, and provide a more sensitive experimental setting. A behavioral pilot study (Pilot 3) on 23 Control students (11 males, 22.26 ± 3.86 years old), confirmed that this modified set-up led to the similar effects of Reappraisal than Experiment 1 (main effect of <italic>Target: b</italic> = 0.07, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,26.60)</sub> = 3.09, p=0.081; <italic>MPs: b</italic> = 0.15, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,20.17)</sub> = 7.08, p=0.015). Furthermore, when comparing the data from this pilot with those from the Controls from Experiment 1, no effect of Experiment was found, neither as main effect, nor as interaction with <italic>Target/MPs</italic> (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1.22, p&gt;0.270). Hence, the modified set-up had no impact in Controls’ behavioral responses.</p><p>Following the main task, participants exited the scanner, and filled demographic for about 30 min. Subsequently, as for Experiment 1, they were unexpectedly asked to rate again all the videoclips again, without being exposed to any feedback. Subjects carried out an Implicit Association Task identical to that of Pilot 1, and finally were debriefed. The whole experiment took place at the Human Neuroscience Platform of the Campus Biotech in Geneva.</p><p>The visual stimuli were presented on a 23’ MRI compatible LCD screen (BOLDScreen23; Cambridge Research Systems, UK), at a resolution of 1024 × 768 (refresh rate 60 Hz) subtending a visual angle of approximately 11.8° (vertical) x 15.6°. Key-presses were recorded on an MRI-compatible bimanual response button box (HH-2 × 4 C; Current Designs Inc, Philadelphia, PA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Behavioral data from Experiment two were organized and analyzed in the same way like that of Experiment 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Brain activity</title><p>As for the neuroimaging data, these were acquired through a Siemens Magnetom Prisma 3T scanner with a 64-channel head-and-neck coil. We used a multiband sequence with TR = 1100 ms, (TE) = 32 ms, flip angle = 50°, 66 interleaved slices, 112 × 112 in-plane resolution, 2 × 2×2 mm voxel size, no inter-slice gap, multiband acceleration factor 6. Field map was estimated through the acquisition of 2 functional images with a different echo time (short TE = 4.92 ms; long TE = 7.38 ms). Structural images were acquired with a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence (192 slices, TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.32 ms, flip angle = 8°, slice thickness of 0.9 mm, in-plane resolution = 256 × 256, 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 mm voxel size).</p><p>Functional images were fed to standard preprocessing pipeline as implemented in SPM12 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, United Kingdom). This pipeline did realignment, unwrapping (using a field map image to account for geometric distortions because of magnetic field inhomogeneity), and normalization to the 152 Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) with voxel size resolution of 2 × 2×2 mm. Finally, the volumes were smoothed by convolution with an 8 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel.</p><p>The preprocessed images of each individual were then fed to a first level analysis using the general linear model framework implemented in SPM. More specifically, we modelled the onset of each pain expression as events of 3 s (corresponding to the duration of the video-clip). We also assessed whether face-evoked activity was explained by the pain ratings that participants were about to make through a dedicated parametrical modulator. Subsequently, we modelled the occurrence of the VAS as events of 7 s (corresponding to the delay between the presentation of the scale and the subsequent feedbacks). For this condition, we also modeled the actual displacement carried out by participants (the absolute difference between the randomly presented initial position of the cursor and participants’ final rating) as a parametric modulator. Finally, and more critically, we modeled the occurrence of the feedbacks as events of 3 s. Feedback-related activity was associated with two parametric modulators: first the absolute deviation between participants’ rating and the position of the <italic>Target</italic>’s feedback, and the absolute deviation between participants’ rating and the position of <italic>MPs</italic> feedback. Please note that, within this model, positive effects of each of these parametric modulators should be interpreted as brain activity increasing linearly with feedbacks’ divergence from participants’ initial rating. Instead, negative effects should capture effects related with feedbacks’ convergence with the participants’ rating. For each of the three main events vectors (facial expressions, VAS, and feedbacks), we accounted for habituation effects in neural responses by using the time-modulation option implemented in SPM, which creates additional regressors in which the trial order is modulated parametrically. This led to an overall of 10 regressors (three conditions + 7 parametric modulators), which were convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function and associated with regressors describing their first-order time derivative. To account for movement-related variance, physiological-related artifacts, and other sources of noise, we also included the six realignment parameters, an estimate of cardiac- and inspiration-induced changes in the BOLD signal based on PhysIO toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kasper et al., 2017</xref>), and the average non-gray matter signal, defined as the coordinates with grey matter tissue probability &lt;0.02. This is the largest non-grey matter mask whose average signal is not confounded by the task manipulation (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table7">Appendix 1—table 7</xref>), and as such represents an estimate of for global sources of noise that might can be accounted for without biasing the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Desjardins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Junghöfer et al., 2005</xref>). Low-frequency signal drifts were filtered using a cutoff period of 128 s. Serial correlations in the neural signal were accounted through exponential covariance structures, as implemented in the ‘FAST’ option of SPM.</p><p>Parameters associated with conditions of interest (e.g. parametric modulators of <italic>Target</italic>, <italic>MPs</italic> or contrast testing the differential effect between the two) were then fed in a second level, independent-samples t-test using random-effect analysis. Furthermore, inter-individual differences related to the IAT D-Score or to distrust estimates were modelled through linear regression. In all analyses, <italic>Gender</italic> and <italic>Age</italic> were always modeled as nuisance regressors. As first step, we considered only those effects throughout the whole brain that exceeded p&lt;0.05, family-wise correction for multiple comparisons at the cluster level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friston et al., 1994</xref>), with an underlying height threshold of p&lt;0.001, uncorrected. As second step, we also restricted our hypothesis based on regions previously implicated in the same paradigms. Specifically, for the processing of painful expressions, we took the most recent meta-analysis on pain empathy from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kogler et al., 2020</xref>, and selected the regions jointly implicated in processing the sight of others’ suffering and one’s own pain response (Figure 15 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kogler et al., 2020</xref>, freely available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://anima.fz-juelich.de/studies/Kogler_Empathy_2020">https://anima.fz-juelich.de/studies/Kogler_Empathy_2020</ext-link>). Instead for the processing of social feedback, we took the meta-analysis maps from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2016</xref> revealing differential effects for: (1) divergence from social feedbacks, implicating a network containing mPFC and right AI; (2) convergence with social feedbacks, implicating VS (see Table 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; provided by the study’s author). In both cases, the meta-analytic activation maps (thresholded to survive FWE correction for the whole brain) were binarized and used for small volume correction in our study. Within these areas, we considered significant those effects associated with p&lt;0.05 FWE small volume correction at the voxel level.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was financed by the Swiss National Science Foundation grants n PP00O1_157424 and PP00P1_183715 awarded to CCD.

This assumption was tested through an independent pilot online experiment (Pilot 1) carried out on 155 subjects (41 males, mean age = 21.85 ± 2.81), divided into 29 Controls, 56 YMS, 32 IMS and 38 EMS. These carried out an online Implicit Association Task (IAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenwald et al., 1998</xref>), aimed at detecting the mental association between positive/negative terms (hereafter categories) and pictures of MPs or Bankers (hereafter target pairs). For this task, positive and negative words were taken from the French version of <italic>Project Implicit</italic> of Harvard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/">https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/</ext-link>), whereas the target pairs were half-body photos of people wearing either white coats (MPs) or a suit (bankers), balanced for gender. The task was composed by seven blocks, each preceded by instructions. The experiment was designed and carried out using the <italic>iatgen</italic> tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iatgen.wordpress.com/">https://iatgen.wordpress.com/</ext-link>) on the online software <italic>Qualtrics</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.qualtrics.com/fr/">https://www.qualtrics.com/fr/</ext-link>), under default parameters. More specifically, the task was organized into 6 blocks of 20 trials each, where individuals were asked to classify either targets or categories by pressing one of two keyboard keys. In each trial, a fixation cross appeared for 250 ms in the middle of the screen, followed by a target/category which remained visible until a keypress was provided. In case a sorting errors, a red cross was superimposed to the stimulus for 300 ms. At that point participant could press the correct key.</p><p>In the two main conditions, participants classified a category-target association. In the ‘positive’ blocks they had to press one key for the occurrence of MPs or positive words, and the other key for bankers or negative words. In the ‘negative’ blocks, they had to press one key for the occurrence of MPs or negative words, and the other key for bankers or positive words. Individuals positively-biased towards MPs should be faster when positive words were mentally associated with MPs pictures, as opposed to Bankers. In this perspective, the average response times between the ‘negative’ blocks was subtracted with that of ‘positive’ blocks. The resulting differential value was normalized by the pooled standard deviation of the two blocks (see default settings from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://iatgen.wordpress.com/">https://iatgen.wordpress.com/</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Greenwald et al., 1998</xref>, for more details). The higher this D-score parameter, the stronger the association between positive valence and MPs.</p><p>An analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the D-score as dependent variable and Group, Gender and Age as independent variables revealed only a main effect of Group (<italic>F</italic><sub>(3,148) </sub>= 3.19; p=0.025; all other effects: <italic>F</italic> &lt; 0.51; p&gt;0.475).

Here we run follow-up analyses to test whether these effects were confounded by an overall lack of reliance towards the experimental manipulation, rather than the facial expressions specifically. For this purpose, we analyzed <italic>Distrust</italic> in combination with another post-experimental debrief measure: ‘I had the impression that the judgment from either protagonist or doctor judgments were not real’ (see Appendix 1 for all debrief questions). Like for the case of <italic>Distrust</italic>, also the scores from this question reflect participants’ doubts about some aspects of the paradigm. However, in this case participants did not focus on the video clips, but rather on the delivery of the feedback. Interestingly, scores from this item (hereafter <italic>ExpDistrust</italic>) correlated significantly/marginally with those of <italic>Distrust</italic> (Exp. 1: Spearman’s <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.15, p=0.097; Exp. 2: <italic>ρ</italic> = 0.42, p=0.003) pointing to a common source of variance.</p><p>In the present study, Distrust was implicated in the behavioral responses of Experiment 1. More specifically, pain ratings were negatively influenced by <italic>Distrust</italic> (<italic>b</italic> = −0.31, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,113)</sub> = 5.50, p=0.021), whereas the analysis of Reappraisal was significantly associated with a <italic>MPs*Distrust</italic> interaction (<italic>b</italic> = 0.04, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,3628.3)</sub> = 6.58, p=0.010 – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). We then repeated the same analyses by replacing the scores of <italic>Distrust</italic> with those from <italic>ExpDistrust</italic>, in order to assess whether this new predictor led to similar results. In none of the analyses we found any effect associated with <italic>ExpDistrust.</italic> More specifically, we found no negative modulation in the analysis of pain ratings (<italic>b</italic> = −0.01, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,113)</sub> = 0.005, p=0.941), and no <italic>MPs*ExpDistrust</italic> interaction in the analysis of Reappraisal (<italic>b</italic> = 0.003, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,1329.3)</sub> = 0.08, p=0.771). Subsequently, we repeated the analyses by modeling <italic>Distrust</italic> and <italic>ExpDistrust</italic> together, with the former used as a variable of interest, and the latter as a nuisance covariate. Within this setting, we confirmed all results associated with <italic>Distrust</italic>, both in the analysis of pain ratings (<italic>b</italic> = −0.32, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,112)</sub> = 5.46, p=0.021), and that of Reappraisal (<italic>MPs*Distrust: b</italic> = 0.04, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,3513.8)</sub> = 6.55, p=0.011).</p><p><italic>Distrust</italic> was also implicated in the analysis of neural response in Experiment 2. More specifically, we found that the VS activity evoked by <italic>Target</italic> agreement decreased linearly with <italic>Distrust</italic> (local maxima: x = 0, y = 10, z = 4, <italic>t</italic><sub>(44)</sub> = 3.55, <italic>p</italic> (uncorrected) &lt;0.001, <italic>p</italic> (small volume correction) = 0.021 – see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>). The same region was implicated in the interaction between the source of the feedback (<italic>Target vs. MPs</italic>) and <italic>Distrust</italic> (local maxima: x = 14, y = 20, z = 6, <italic>t</italic><sub>(44)</sub> = 4.90, <italic>p</italic> (uncorrected) &lt;0.001, Cluster size = 277, <italic>p</italic> (whole-brain correction at the cluster level) = 0.003 – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table6">Appendix 1—table 6</xref>). We then repeated the same analyses by replacing the scores of <italic>Distrust</italic> with those from <italic>ExpDistrust</italic>, and found no significant effects, neither under whole-brain correction, nor under small volume correction searching within a predefined network of interest (see methods). Finally we then repeated the analysis by modeling both <italic>Distrust</italic> and <italic>ExpDistrust</italic> (the latter as nuisance covariate). Under this setting we confirmed the interaction between source of the feedback (<italic>Target vs. MPs</italic>) and <italic>Distrust</italic> previously observed (x = 14, y = 20, z = 6, <italic>t</italic><sub>(43)</sub> = 4.49, <italic>p</italic> (uncorrected) &lt;0.001, Cluster size = 308, <italic>p</italic> (whole-brain correction at the cluster level) = 0.002). Unfortunately, we did not confirm the simple negative linear relationship between the VS activity evoked by <italic>Target</italic> agreement and <italic>Distrust</italic>. We therefore extracted the data from the same coordinates reported in the main analysis and observed that, with the addition of the new covariate, the strength of the effect fell just below the threshold (x = 0, y = 10, z = 4, <italic>t</italic><sub>(43)</sub> = 2.97, <italic>p</italic> (uncorrected) = 0.002, <italic>p</italic> (small volume correction) = 0.078). Please note, however, that this specific negative modulation can be considered redundant to our other findings (especially those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As such, it is not reported in the main results section, and its presence/absence does not alter for the main conclusions of this study.</p><p>Overall, the present follow-up analyses provide compelling evidence that the effects implicated by <italic>Distrust</italic> were not confounded by a broader assessment of the experimental set-up, but reflect a true consideration about the authenticity of the facial expressions. None of the effects associated with <italic>Distrust</italic> were observable when modeling instead <italic>ExpDistrust</italic> as a predictor of interest. Furthermore, in all-but-one cases the effects of <italic>Distrust</italic> could be replicated when adding <italic>ExpDistrust</italic> as additional nuisance predictor.</p><table-wrap id="app1table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—table 1.</label><caption><title>Demographic characteristics of the sample tested in the present study.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th colspan="4" valign="top">Experiment 1</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">Experiment 2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th valign="top">Group</th><th valign="top">Controls</th><th valign="top">YMS</th><th valign="top">IMS</th><th valign="top">EMS</th><th valign="top">Controls</th><th valign="top">EMS</th></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Size</italic></td><td valign="top">30</td><td valign="top">30</td><td valign="top">30</td><td valign="top">30</td><td valign="top">26</td><td valign="top">26</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Age (sd)</italic></td><td valign="top">25.03 (4.75)</td><td valign="top">21.37 (3.81)</td><td valign="top">22.03 (1.40)</td><td valign="top">24.25 (2.00)</td><td valign="top">23.73 (4.11)</td><td valign="top">24.15 (1.41)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Males</italic></td><td valign="top">12 (40%)</td><td valign="top">6 (20%)</td><td valign="top">10 (33.33%)</td><td valign="top">10 (33.33%)</td><td valign="top">13 (50%)</td><td valign="top">9 (34.62%)</td></tr><tr><th valign="top"/><th colspan="4" valign="top">Pilot 1</th><th valign="top">Pilot 2</th><th valign="top">Pilot 3</th></tr><tr><th valign="top">Group</th><th valign="top">Controls</th><th valign="top">YMS</th><th valign="top">IMS</th><th valign="top">EMS</th><th valign="top">Controls</th><th valign="top">Controls</th></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Size</italic></td><td valign="top">29</td><td valign="top">56</td><td valign="top">32</td><td valign="top">38</td><td valign="top">24</td><td valign="top">23</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Age (sd)</italic></td><td valign="top">21.69 (3.52)</td><td valign="top">20.11 (2.33)</td><td valign="top">22.03 (1.43)</td><td valign="top">24.34 (1.68)</td><td valign="top">23.54 (4.12)</td><td valign="top">22.26 (3.86)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>Males</italic></td><td valign="top">4 (13.79%)</td><td valign="top">16 (28.57%)</td><td valign="top">6 (18.75%)</td><td valign="top">15 (39.47%)</td><td valign="top">7 (29.17%)</td><td valign="top">11 (47.83%)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="app1table2" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—table 2.</label><caption><title>Group differences in Empathic and personality traits, and in scores of pain sensitivity and coping.</title><p>Scores are described in terms of mean and standard deviation.

The main findings are that medical training affects sensitivity to pain faces (indexed by lower ratings and decreased neural responses in the insula and cingulate cortices). These are interesting findings highlighting a phenomenon with real-world implications for medical practice. Previous studies on social influence have tested influences from one source, whereas here the authors test adjustments towards two (orthogonal) sources of influence (the person receiving pain/protagonist and a group of medical doctors [MPs]). The study assesses the effects of medical training by using a quasi-experimental design and reports that experienced medical students rate pain as lower and show reduced brain responses to others' pain. Distrust of patients/protagonists has an independent influence on pain reappraisals and brain responses. Overall, the reviewers agree that this is an important and highly interesting paper that aims to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the effect of medical training on patient pain underestimation. There are several notable strengths of this paper, namely the medical trainee sample at differing levels of experience, pilot study examining trainees' implicit attitudes towards medical practitioners (MPs), use of neuroimaging to understand underlying neural mechanisms of the effect of medical training on pain underestimation, and converging evidence in a large sample of participants over more than one experiment. Major concerns requiring additional analyses and revisions to the text should be addressed in the revision are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– There is an entire literature on racial disparities in pain underestimation (eg. physicians tend to underestimate pain in Black patients). This seems relevant and should be mentioned in the introduction as one aspect of the phenomenon under investigation. These biases are important to note as moderators of pain estimation.</p><p>– Relatedly, what was the racial composition of the participants and the faces used as stimuli in the experiment?</p><p>– It is not clear why medical students were the subjects of the study, rather than older more experienced physicians.</p><p>– The methods state that for neuroimaging analyses, &quot;we also restricted our hypothesis based on regions previously implicated in the same paradigm&quot;. I think it would be important to report whole-brain results at the same threshold, without this masking, in order to more fully evaluate the strength of the reported effects.</p><p>– Given the applied nature of the research questions, I found the Introduction and Discussion to be somewhat lacking in the consideration of clinical relevance. I appreciated discussion of how the results were consistent or different from prior studies using social influence paradigms. However, I think a more clearly defined clinical relevance section is warranted given the applied research questions and medical trainee study sample. Within this section, the authors could also address the question of whether pain underestimation is necessarily bad, or whether physician emotion regulation serves some useful functions (e.g., to reduce cognitive load and burnout, Weilenmann et al., 2018, Front Psychiatry; Decety, J., Yang, C.-Y., and Cheng, Y. (2010), NeuroImage).</p><p>– I had a few issues with how Distrust was introduced, measured, and discussed in this paper. First, I think more justification in the Introduction for why practitioners might distrust patient pain report is warranted. Prior evidence that factors such as provider fear of patient opioid addiction and belief that women and racial/ethnic minorities exaggerate pain are relevant here (see review by Ghoshal et al., (2020) J Pain Res, work by Mende-Siedlecki et al., (2019), J Exp Psychol, and others). Several of these topics intersect with the broader issue of gender and racial/ethnic disparities in pain, which I realize is not the main focus of the present study. Nonetheless, this is a major applied area where provider pain underestimation is a known problem, and I think it could be acknowledged more in both the Introduction and Discussion to strengthen the clinical relevance of this paper.</p><p>– My other concern with Distrust in this paper is the discrepancy between how the concept was measured and how it is being described in the paper. The debriefing items used to define Distrust really seem to be measuring the realism or believability of the experimental paradigm, rather than the much more clinically relevant belief by the rater that the Protagonist is faking or exaggerating their pain. This discrepancy makes the conclusions drawn by the authors somewhat harder to understand.</p><p>– Furthermore, given that Distrust really only affected how feedback from MPs was taken into account, and not neural activity related to viewing Protagonist pain, is it possible that this measure is reflecting distrust or low-confidence in the rater's own judgments? This relates to an issue in the study design that does not appear to be addressed by the authors, which is the difference between the raters' level of medical training (notably not yet physicians) and the &quot;average judgment of 20 emergency doctors.&quot; Is it possible that the raters were perceiving an authoritativeness in the 20 ER doctors due to both the number of doctors and the higher level of training of the doctors providing the feedback? Finally, more discussion of the fact that the distrust effect was regardless of medical training is warranted. Does this suggest that the factors that influence distrust of patient pain are more stable, such as implicit bias or beliefs about pain appropriateness? More consideration of the implications and limitations of the Distrust measure would help the reader contextualize the conclusions drawn.</p><p>– The authors controlled for participant age in models but did not address participant gender despite prior evidence of gender differences in empathic responding (Christov-Moore et al., 2014, Neurosci Biobehav Rev). Do the effects hold if also controlling for gender?</p><p>– One limitation that should be discussed more thoroughly is that the design remains quasi-experimental (and cross-sectional). Thus, despite the claims that medical training leads to reduced pain ratings, this is not entirely clear (and some kind of longitudinal 'training' or exposure study would be better suited to test this). First, there seem to be some group differences regarding sex. It is also not reported whether other important person-level variables may differ between medical students and controls (e.g., SES, IQ). Personality factors such as empathy, big five, PCS were assessed but not included in the Suppl. Table or elsewhere. Could any of those be related to the effects?</p><p>– Related to comment #1, it should be mentioned early on whether groups differed on other important variables, such as age, sex, education, etc.; Are controls also senior students, in another discipline than medicine? This applies to Experiment 1 (so far few details regarding potential group differences) as well as Experiment 2 (for which more details could be provided).</p><p>– The authors report having used global scaling (lines 666). This can dramatically alter the results of all statistical results and should be only done if there is no relationship between whole brain signal and task (which is very unlikely to ever be the case). I would recommend repeating the analysis without global scaling unless the authors can make a strong case (1) why it is needed here and (2) that there is no correlation between task and global brain activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63272.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– There is an entire literature on racial disparities in pain underestimation (eg. physicians tend to underestimate pain in Black patients).

As such, the interplay between the reward system and AI-dACC network might offer a plausible model to explain why specific social/ethnic categories are less likely to be acknowledged for their pain and receive adequate treatment” (Discussion, page 26, lines 10-16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Relatedly, what was the racial composition of the participants and the faces used as stimuli in the experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>The video clips of facial expressions of pain were taken from Lamm and colleagues (2007) and include only Caucasian expressions.

Indeed, we agree that it would have been interesting to test professional physicians. This being said, several considerations influenced our choice and favored instead the selection of a student population. First, students have a major advantage in terms of feasibility, as they can be more easily recruited than adults (physicians, nurses, and also lay controls) who are often constrained under busy working schedules. Second, the recruitment of students at different years of enrolment allow for a clear-cut organization of homogeneous groups based on experience. This would have been less straightforward for professional physicians, whose experience cannot only be quantified in terms of years, but also vary at a qualitative level (as function of specialty, working department, part- vs. full-time engagement, etc.). In this perspective, any experiment recruiting physicians would have necessarily required restricting to specific subcategories, and relying possibly on smaller samples, not homogeneous in their different experience levels. Third, effects at the level of pain assessment and IAT D-Scores might very well manifest themselves already during university training, as suggested by some studies (Xie et al., 2018). As such, medical students represent the ideal target population to investigate the emergence of these effects.</p><p>Overall, although we acknowledge that scholarly and professional medical experience are not the same, we believe that medical students provide a relevant sample for our purposes, with benefits outweighing the limitations. In our revision we took care to make all these considerations explicit to the reader. Please check the revised versions of the Introduction and Results sections of the manuscript.</p><p>“As such, healthcare providers systematically underestimate patients’ pain (Davoudi et al., 2008; Duignan and Dunn, 2008; Kappesser et al., 2006; Puntillo et al., 2003; Teske et al., 1983), a phenomenon which emerges as early as during university (Xie et al., 2018), becomes more pronounced with long-lasting experience in the field (Choinière et al., 1990; Davoudi et al., 2008).” (Introduction, page 3, lines 5-10).</p><p>“This population was chosen due to its feasibility in terms of recruitment, and the straightforward quantification of individual experience (corresponding to the year of enrollment at university, regardless of future specializations, department, hierarchy, etc.). Furthermore, pain underestimation has been documented also in medical students (at least after 3 years, Xie et al., 2018), thus making this population suitable for our research question.” (Results, page 7, lines 4-9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The methods state that for neuroimaging analyses, &quot;we also restricted our hypothesis based on regions previously implicated in the same paradigm&quot;. I think it would be important to report whole-brain results at the same threshold, without this masking, in order to more fully evaluate the strength of the reported effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the original version of the manuscript was misleading for this specific point. Of course, as first step, we inspected results using always a common threshold, corresponding to FWE cluster-corrected p &lt; 0.05. This is a well-established approach for inspecting whole-brain fMRI effects (Friston et al., 1993) which, under the current settings (SPM12 software, no image upscaling, 8 mm FWHM smoothing kernel, an underlying voxel-level threshold of p &lt; 0.001 uncorrected), allows adequate protection from the α error (Flandin and Friston, 2019; Mueller et al., 2017). This was clarified in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>“As first step, we considered only those effects throughout the whole brain that exceeded p &lt; 0.05, family-wise correction for multiple comparisons at the cluster level (Friston et al., 1993), with an underlying height threshold of p &lt; 0.001, uncorrected.” (Methods, page 36, lines 9-11).</p><p>In three specific instances (two described in the main text), such threshold did not reveal significant effects in regions of theoretical interest for the contrast. For this reason, we followed established recommendations to apply small volume correction (SVC) within a specific a priori defined network (in our case based on meta-analytic ALE maps from previous studies using the same paradigm, see methods).</p><p>“As second step, we also restricted our hypothesis based on regions previously implicated in the same paradigms. Specifically, for the processing of painful expressions, we took the most recent meta-analysis on pain empathy from Kogler et al., (2020) […]. Instead for the processing of social feedback, we took the meta-analysis maps from Wu et al., (2016) […]. In both cases the meta-analytic activation maps (thresholded to survive FWE correction for the whole brain) were binarized and used for small volume correction in our study. Within these areas, we considered significant those effects associated with p &lt; 0.05 FWE small volume correction at the voxel level.” (Methods, page 36, lines 11-24).</p><p>The reviewer fears that the use of multiple thresholds prevents the reader to fully evaluate the strength of reported effects. We apologize for this. As SVC was productively used only in specific instances (of course if hypothesized activations are visible already under whole brain correction there was no need to inspect the same network further), we decided to single out these cases so that any potential reader could clearly see them as exceptions. This was done in the text, figure legends and tables. In particular, in tables we italicized the results surviving only under SVC. In this perspective, non-italics entries correspond to the findings obtained when inspecting the whole brain under a common (cluster-corrected) threshold.</p><p>“…a positive linear relationship at the level of amygdala extending to the periaqueductal grey (PAG), and to the fusiform gyrus (Figure 3, green blobs). Furthermore, when applying small volume correction in regions previously implicated in paradigms for pain empathy (Kogler et al., 2020, see methods) the left anterior insula (AI) was also found (see Supplementary Table S3 for full details). […] We found stronger modulations in Controls as opposed to EMS in the dorsal portion of the anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Under small volume correction, we also implicated the left ventral AI (Figure 3, red blobs)” (Results, pages 9-10).</p><p>“Effects are displayed under a height threshold corresponding to p &lt; 0.001, with each region surviving cluster-correction for multiple comparisons for the whole brain, or associated with a peak surviving small volume correction for a mask of interest (this is the case of the two insular activations).” (Figure 3 legend, page 10, lines 15-18).</p><p>“Table S3. Regions implicated when observing painful facial expressions. As default regions are displayed if surviving correction for multiple comparisons for the whole brain at the cluster level. Entries in italic refer to regions surviving only small volume correction for brain structures implicated in previous meta-analyses on the same paradigm” (Supplements, page 56, lines 1-4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Given the applied nature of the research questions, I found the Introduction and Discussion to be somewhat lacking in the consideration of clinical relevance.

Nonetheless, this is a major applied area where provider pain underestimation is a known problem, and I think it could be acknowledged more in both the Introduction and Discussion to strengthen the clinical relevance of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Following our reply to the reviewer’s previous comment, we do acknowledge that the paper will benefit from a more in depth introduction and discussion of the notion of Distrust in relation to clinically-relevant topic, such as opiophobia and pain underestimation ethnic minorities. Please see the revised theoretical section of the manuscript.</p><p>“In clinical settings, acknowledging high levels of pain often leads to the prescription of strong analgesics, which however have contraindications for patients’ health (Buckeridge et al., 2010; Butler et al., 2016; Makris et al., 2014). Concerns for such side-effects (e.g., opiophobia) contribute to inadequate pain treatment in medical settings (Bennett and Carr, 2002; Bertrand et al., 2021; Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2019), as healthcare providers prioritize those cases in which pain is unequivocally established. In this perspective, one study showed that doctors and nurses tended to underestimate pain in larger extent when presented with cues that patients might have lied or exaggerate their ratings (Kappesser et al., 2006).” (Introduction, page 4, lines 8-16).</p><p>“Our findings are particularly relevant in clinical settings, where pain appraisal is the basis for the selection of subsequent therapeutic procedures, including the prescription of strong (and potentially dangerous) painkillers. In this context, the deontological need to relieve patient’s pain is often counterweighted by the equally relevant need to prevent future side-effects and complications, a conflict that is often resolved by each individual based on personal ability to cope with uncertainty and sensitivity to errors (Corradi-Dell’Acqua et al., 2019). Obviously, a key source of information for these decisions is the reliability of available pain cues (e.g., is the facial expression genuine?) which, if estimated below a given threshold, can relieve caregivers from any struggle by prioritizing other clinical considerations over the management of patients’ pain. As unfortunate drawback, estimated reliability might be vulnerable to biases, including those related to the social and ethical condition of the patient. Previous studies showed that confronting individuals from different social and ethnic group can impact profoundly representation of trust and associated activity in VS (Hughes et al., 2017; Stanley et al., 2012, 2011), but also sensitivity to their pain (Avenanti et al., 2010; Mende-Siedlecki et al., 2019) including the neural responses in AI and dACC (Cao et al., 2015; Hein et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2009). As such, the interplay between the reward system and AI-dACC network might offer a plausible model to explain why specific social/ethnic categories are less likely to be acknowledged for their pain and receive adequate treatment. Future studies will need to explore this.” (Discussion, pages 24-25).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– My other concern with Distrust in this paper is the discrepancy between how the concept was measured and how it is being described in the paper. The debriefing items used to define Distrust really seem to be measuring the realism or believability of the experimental paradigm, rather than the much more clinically relevant belief by the rater that the Protagonist is faking or exaggerating their pain. This discrepancy makes the conclusions drawn by the authors somewhat harder to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if in the original manuscript the items investigating disgust were described in a simplistic (and potentially misleading) fashion. The precise (French) questions asked in the final debrief in the original language were the followingL</p><p>1. J'ai eu l'impression que les gens de la vidéo ont simulé le désagrément. This translates as “I had the impression that the people in the video were simulating unpleasantness”.</p><p>2. J'ai eu l'impression que la douleur observée était réelle. This translates as “I had the impression that the pain observed was real”.</p><p>As the reviewer can see, these question address specifically the realism of the facial expressions, rather of the experimental paradigm. This is chiefly the case of Item 1 does explicitly ask participants whether the people in the videos were faking pain. The correct formulation (in both French and English translations) is now reported in the revised version of the manuscript (Methods, pages 31-32).</p><p>This being said, we do acknowledge that participants’ debrief ratings might (at least in principle) be confounded by considerations about the experimental set-up. To shed more light on this potential confound, we exploited an additional item from the debrief questionnaire, which assessed specifically participants’ distrust about other parts of the paradigm than the video-clips.</p><p>3. J’ai eu l’impression que le jugement soit du protagoniste du vidéo soit du médecin n’était pas réel. This translates as “I had the impression that the judgment from either protagonist or doctor judgments were not real”.</p><p>Importantly, the scores of this new item (hereafter ExpDistrust) correlated with those of Distrust, albeit in Experiment 1 this was only marginally the case (Experiment 1: Spearman’s ρ = 0.15, p = 0.097; Experiment 2: ρ = 0.42, p = 0.003). This seems to confirm the suspicion of the reviewer that assessments about the expressions’ authenticity are partly confounded by overall considerations about the experimental set-up.</p><p>At this point we decided to assess whether the effects associated with Distrust from our first submissions reflected genuine considerations about the facial expressions, or underlie a broader assessment of the paradigm. As first step, we repeated all the relevant analyses by replacing Distrust with ExpDistrust. In principle, if the effects described in the first submission reflected broad considerations about the experimental set-up, the same effects should be observed under this new predictor. This was never the case.</p><p>Subsequently, we tested again effects of Distrust by adding ExpDistrust as additional nuisance covariance of interest. In all-but-one cases the effect of Distrust remained significant despite the inclusion of the new predictor, thus confirming that the effects observed were independent by general considerations about the paradigm. The only exception was the effect reported in Supplementary Table S4 (last line). This was an activation obtained only under small volume correction and that shifted just below threshold following the inclusion of ExpDistrust as covariate. As such, this specific was removed by the Results section (but discussed on supplements), with no consequence for the overall conclusions of the study.</p><p>Overall, we hope we convinced the reviewer that the effects related to Distrust reflect a true consideration about the authenticity of the facial expressions, and not a broader assessment of the experimental set-up. In the revised manuscript, we included a brief sentence about this issue (see below), reminding to a new supplementary result section where all analyses involving ExpDistrust are described and commented (pages 45-47). In addition, we also included in supplements a full list of all question employed in the debrief session (pages 42-43).</p><p>“Finally, we carried out control analyses to assess whether the effects of Distrust were confounded by an overall lack of reliance towards the experimental paradigm (rather than the facial expression specifically). For this purpose, we reanalyzed Distrust in combination of another item form the post-experimental debrief assessing individual thoughts about another part of the task (the feedbacks). Full details are provided in Supplementary Results, and confirm that participants’ responses in our task were influenced selectively by considerations towards the authenticity of the facial expressions”. (Results, page 17, lines 14-20).</p><p>“Importantly, such effect is not confounded with participants’ overall distrust towards the experimental set-up, but reflect specific considerations of the facial expressions implemented (see Supplementary Results).” (Discussion, page 25, lines 4-7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Furthermore, given that Distrust really only affected how feedback from MPs was taken into account, and not neural activity related to viewing Protagonist pain, is it possible that this measure is reflecting distrust or low-confidence in the rater's own judgments?</p></disp-quote><p>If by “rater” the reviewer refers to the participants themselves who are rating the video-clips during the task, then we can reassure the reviewer that our results are safe from this possibility. First of all, as quantifying others’ pain is far from trivial, it is entirely possible that part of our sample felt low confidence about their own abilities. It is also in principle possible that such confidence could have biased the distrust post-experimental ratings (although we have no way to establish this). However, even if this was the case, it would not account for our results. Low confidence in one’s own ratings would explain why participants follow feedbacks in general (i.e., opinion of others rather than oneself), but would not explain why participants follow in privileged fashion the opinion of MPs, as opposed to the person who is feeling pain directly. Our results make sense only if we acknowledge that our Distrust predictor measures low confidence towards the person in the video rather than oneself.</p><p>Instead, if by “rater” the reviewer refers to the person in the video whose rating is presented as feedback, then the answer might be less straightforward. Although we asked participants to rate their distrust towards the authenticity of the facial expressions, it is entirely possible that their judgment could have generalized also to the feedbacks (someone who fakes their own facial expressions might very well fake also self-reports) or to the Target in general (this person seems untrustworthy). One way to partially address this issue would be to repeat the same argument used in our previous answer. I.e., in the debrief session, we asked participants to rate the authenticity of the feedbacks. As the effects of Distrust from our study were independent from those associated with this item, they relate specifically to considerations about the facial expressions (see our answer to the previous point from the reviewers). Unfortunately, this argument is only partially effective, as in the debrief we asked to estimate of the reliability of both feedbacks combined, and not that of the Target specifically. This serves well the purpose of controlling for the reliance on the experimental manipulation (as we did in the previous point) but does not account for the reliance on Target’s rating specifically.</p><p>We should stress, at this point, that the reviewer well-founded argument is not a treat to the main conclusion of the study. Ultimately, in many clinical settings, trust is modulated by several factors beyond perceived symptom authenticity. In our answers to previous points (and in the Discussion section of the manuscript page 26, lines 8-17) we already acknowledged how estimates of the expression reliability could be vulnerable to biases, including (but not limited to) those related to social/ethnic group. These modulations of distrust, although not strictly related on the pain expressed by the patient, are nonetheless expected to influence the way in which patients’ feedbacks are taken into account for the selection of a treatment. Likewise, also in our study, it is possible that Distrust about the pain expression could be influenced by a general unreliance about the Target, and this could affect in turn the way in which feedbacks are processed and taken into account for subsequent evaluations. Both in our original and present submission, we considered Distrust as a subjective experience, and as such vulnerable to personal biases and influences. This however does not undermine the importance of studying how this factor influences the different facets of pain management.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– This relates to an issue in the study design that does not appear to be addressed by the authors, which is the difference between the raters' level of medical training (notably not yet physicians) and the &quot;average judgment of 20 emergency doctors.&quot; Is it possible that the raters were perceiving an authoritativeness in the 20 ER doctors due to both the number of doctors and the higher level of training of the doctors providing the feedback? Finally, more discussion of the fact that the distrust effect was regardless of medical training is warranted. Does this suggest that the factors that influence distrust of patient pain are more stable, such as implicit bias or beliefs about pain appropriateness? More consideration of the implications and limitations of the Distrust measure would help the reader contextualize the conclusions drawn.</p></disp-quote><p>The welcome the reviewer’s point that the social modulation observed in this study is well interpretable in terms of “authoritativeness”. The original studies employing this paradigm refer to “conformity” (Klucharev et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2016), although this does not fit entirely our case. Indeed conformity effects are expected to operate in privileged fashion towards in-group members (Stallen et al., 2013), but in our study (1) the target population (medical students, not yet doctors) does not belong to the same social group than the MPs who provide the feedback, and (2) the factors modulating the reliance of the MPs’ feedback operate regardless of the group (thus also in controls). In the original version of the manuscript we used the term “Social Influence” to characterize effects that could occur regardless of the belonging group. However, the reviewer offers a plausible alternative. MPs are not followed because “peers”, but rather because they are figures of authority which are more relied upon when both medical students and controls distrust the Target. In the revised version of the manuscript we discuss briefly about this.</p><p>“Distrust operates independently from the grouping factor and from the personal dispositions towards the category of doctors (measured through the IAT). Hence, our effects might not reflect experience, belongingness or personal positive dispositions towards MPs, but possibly the fact that doctors are figures of authority which become much more salient when the facial expression cannot be relied upon.” (Discussion, page 25, lines 7-11).</p><p>As for the number, we chose to define MP cues in keeping with previous studies using the same paradigm, in which social cues are often described as the combined information from different individuals from one community (Klucharev et al., 2009; Koban and Wager, 2016; Shestakova et al., 2013). This serves the purpose of making the social cue at the same time reliable and anonymous (if the opinion was described arising from one doctor only, this would raise questions about its’ identity/expertise/etc.). This being said, the reviewer is in principle correct, as the authoritativeness could reflect the number people (20 MPs vs. 1 patient) rather than their background. This is now acknowledged as limitation.</p><p>“in designing our study we followed previous paradigms in which social feedbacks (in our case MPs) were described as the aggregate opinion of many individuals from a community (Klucharev et al., 2009; Koban and Wager, 2016). This however opens the question as to whether Distrust promotes reliance towards MPs feedback due to their professional background, their size (an opinion of 20 is more reliable than that of one) or a combination of both factors.” (Discussion, page 27, lines 8-13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors controlled for participant age in models but did not address participant gender despite prior evidence of gender differences in empathic responding (Christov-Moore et al., 2014, Neurosci Biobehav Rev).

Thus, despite the claims that medical training leads to reduced pain ratings, this is not entirely clear (and some kind of longitudinal 'training' or exposure study would be better suited to test this). First, there seem to be some group differences regarding sex. It is also not reported whether other important person-level variables may differ between medical students and controls (e.g., SES, IQ). Personality factors such as empathy, big five, PCS were assessed but not included in the Suppl. Table or elsewhere. Could any of those be related to the effects?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and apologize for not having stressed this limitation in the previous version of the manuscript. This was rectified this in the new “limitations” subsection of the Results:</p><p>“The present study investigates the role of medical experience by recruiting independent groups at different years of university. As such, our study shares the weaknesses of cross-sectional investigations (Wang and Cheng, 2020), as the role of experience was not tested longitudinally in the same population. In particular, some of our effects might be influenced by individual traits and features which are more frequently observed in medical students (especially those who reach the end of their tenure) as opposed to lay controls.” (Discussion, pages 26, lines 19-24)</p><p>The reviewer wonders whether group differences might be confounded by other variables than medical scholarly experience. We now acknowledge that this could be the case (at least in principle), and that our study controlled for this possibility only through a limited set of control measures. In particular, consistently with our reply to other points raised by the reviewers, we now included in all analyses age, gender and empathic traits as additional nuisance predictors, with almost no consequence for the results. Furthermore, we also included a new table (Supplementary Table S2) showing the scores for all questionnaires reported. For almost all of them, no group differences were found. As exceptions, the scores from the Situational Pain Questionnaire, suggest that Controls from Experiment 1 (but not Experiment 2) are less sensitive than the other groups to their own pain in imagined context; furthermore Controls from Experiment 2 (but not Experiment 1) have lower scores of conscientiousness (from Big Five Inventory) than medical students. We believe that these differences do not represent a serious threat to our results. This information has been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>“In our analysis we took care to account for several potential confounding variables, such as gender, age or empathic traits. Other measures (e.g., personality traits) appeared fairly stable across the different groups (with only few differences, not systematic across experiments; see Supplementary Table S2), and therefore are unlikely to have confounded our results. Yet, it is still possible that our results could have been influenced also by other factors untested in the present study.” (Discussion, pages 26-27).</p><p>“Table S2.

Unfortunately, we do not know conclusively that all participants were university students. We did, however, asked them about their highest scholarly degree. In this perspective, Controls educational level ranged from those who finished high-school (Exp 1: 39%; Experiment 2: 48%), those who acquired a bachelor degree (Exp 1: 25%; Experiment 2: 36%), or a master degree (Exp 1: 36%; Experiment 2: 16%). However, a more systematic comparison with other groups is difficult as medical faculty in Geneva and Lausanne is organized into a unique 6-years cycle (with no difference between Bachelor and Master). For this reason, to account for difference in seniority between groups, we decided to focus only on age, for which controls are similar to the most experienced medical students. This being said, we now acknowledge the lack of detailed information about Controls’ educational level in the limitation section of the study:</p><p>“…relevant missing information are the detailed educational level of Controls (including their year of enrolment at university) and […].” (Discussion, page 27, lines 6-7)</p><p>Finally, the reviewer also expressed the wish that demographic information about the participants would be made available earlier in the text.

This can dramatically alter the results of all statistical results and should be only done if there is no relationship between whole brain signal and task (which is very unlikely to ever be the case). I would recommend repeating the analysis without global scaling unless the authors can make a strong case (1) why it is needed here and (2) that there is no correlation between task and global brain activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if our analytical choices were not adequately justified in our first submission. Indeed, we originally reasoned that global variations of BOLD signal could reflect residual nuisance sources of variance independent of task manipulation, which are particularly pronounced in multiband sequences despite the correction for movement/physiological artefacts. The reviewer fears that the employment of global scaling might bias the results. Indeed, if the task effects are so widespread to influence the overall brain signal, then applying such correction might decrease the strength of the effects, or even produce artefactual deactivations (Aguirre et al., 1998; Desjardins et al., 2001; Junghöfer et al., 2005). In this perspective, it could be argued that also the outcome of the present study could be an artefactual effect of the global scaling.</p><p>To address this important point, we first assessed whether the global signal from our study is indeed influenced by the task. To do so, for each subject, we extracted the average time-course of the BOLD signal from the whole brain (as defined by the inclusive mask generated by the first-level models) and fed it to the general linear model similar to that used for the main fMRI analysis. This was achieved through the MarsBaR 0.44 toolbox (http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/; Brett et al., 2002) which allows to fit SPM-like models to the time-course of specific ROIs (in our case, the whole brain volume). <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref> describes the results of group analyses.

In this perspective, we reasoned that task-independent global confounds should be expressed also in the signal outside the grey matter. We therefore modified the first-level analysis by removing the Global Scaling, and including instead the time course of the global signal outside the grey matter as a nuisance covariate.</p><p>Coordinates of interest were identified based on SPM tissue probability maps, by including those voxels with grey matter p &lt; 0.02.

The reviewer could argue that the outlined regions represent only a sub-portion of the regions outside the grey matter, and that a more inclusive mask would be preferable. However, it should be underscored that any cut-off larger than p &lt; 0.02 would have led to an average signal influenced statistically by the task, and therefore vulnerable to the same critique raised for the use of Global Scaling. In this perspective, it is reasonable to assume that BOLD signal from white matter might be partly confounded by neighboring grey matter structures, as a result of smoothing, suboptimal normalization or movement. Hence, only by focusing on coordinates reliably far away from the grey matter we could obtain an unbiased estimate of task-unrelated signal.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63272-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Finally, as last step, we inspected how the fMRI results were influenced by the changes in the first-level analysis. Overall, the results from the original version of the task were broadly unaffected by the modifications, with only two noticeable differences. On the one hand, the analysis of the face epochs was negatively impacted from the revision, with differential group effects no longer surviving correction for multiple comparisons for the whole brain, but only small volume correction for a network of interest (defined by previous ALE meta-analyses on similar paradigms Kogler et al., 2020). On the other hand, the analysis of the feedback epochs benefited from the revision, with some contrasts surviving now correction for multiple comparisons for the whole brain (and not only small volume correction).To sum up, we hope we convinced the reviewer that the results from the present study were neither artefactual to the scaling of global signal, nor idiosyncratic to the analytical pipeline employed in general. Despite some fluctuations in the strength of the effects, clearly the outcome of the study remains unchanged. For the purpose of this revision, we now replaced the original results with the new ones obtained when accounting only for task-independent non-grey matter signal. Please see the revised methods and Results sections for more details.</p><p>“To account for movement-related variance, physiological-related artifacts, and other sources of noise, we also included the 6 realignment parameters, an estimate of cardiac- and inspiration-induced changes in the BOLD signal based on PhysIO toolbox (Kasper et al., 2017), and the average non-grey matter signal, defined as the coordinates with grey matter tissue probability &lt; 0.02. This is the largest non-grey matter mask whose average signal is not confounded by the task manipulation (see Supplementary Table S7), and as such represents an estimate of for global sources of noise that might can be accounted for without biasing the results (Aguirre et al., 1998; Desjardins et al., 2001; Junghöfer et al., 2005).” (Methods, page 35, lines 17-24)</p></body></sub-article></article>
