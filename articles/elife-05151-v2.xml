The cerebellum plays a critical role in motor control, cognition, and social interaction, suggesting that cerebellar defects likely contribute to NF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Here we show that <italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation during early, but not late stages of cerebellar development, disrupts neuronal lamination, which is partially caused by overproduction of glia and subsequent disruption of the Bergmann glia (BG) scaffold. Specific <italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation in glutamatergic neuronal precursors causes premature differentiation of granule cell (GC) precursors and ectopic production of unipolar brush cells (UBCs), indirectly disrupting neuronal migration. Transient MEK inhibition during a neonatal window prevents cerebellar developmental defects and improves long-term motor performance of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient mice. This study reveals essential roles of Nf1 in GC/UBC migration by generating correct numbers of glia and controlling GC/UBC fate-specification/differentiation, identifying a therapeutic prevention strategy for multiple NF1-associcated developmental abnormalities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05151.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05151.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05151.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a condition characterized by the growth of tumors along the nerves of the body. It is caused by mutations in a gene called <italic>NF1</italic>, which codes for a protein that normally works to inhibit the activity of another protein called Ras. In healthy cells, Ras is needed to stimulate the cells to grow and divide. However, if the Ras protein is not turned off at the right time or if it is activated at the wrong time, it can force cells to keep growing and dividing; this leads to the growth of tumors.</p><p>Along with being prone to developing cancer, individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 also develop a range of neurodevelopmental disorders that alter their learning, motor skills and social interactions. Some also exhibit behaviors that are associated with autism. This led Kim, Wang et al. to investigate whether a region of the brain—called the cerebellum—that has recently been associated with autism is also affected in a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1.</p><p>The cerebellum is best known for its role in coordinating movement, although it also has functions in cognition, behavior and other processes. Ras is involved in the development of the cerebellum; and so Kim, Wang et al. asked whether the loss of the <italic>Nf1</italic> gene from cells in the mouse cerebellum might cause the neurodevelopmental defects associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.</p><p><italic>Loss of Nf1</italic> during early (but not in late) development of the cerebellum disrupted the normal organization of the nerve cells (or neurons) into specific cell layers. These defects were caused, in part, by the over-growth of a type of supporting cell—called glia cells—at a specific developmental stage—that would normally form a scaffold to help neurons migrate to their correct position. Nf1 also controls the generation of the correct types of neurons in the right time and at right location during the early development of the cerebellum.</p><p>Next, Kim, Wang et al. treated newborn mice with a compound that inhibits Ras signaling via their mother's milk for 3 weeks. In mice with an inactive <italic>Nf1</italic> gene, the treatment helped to prevent some defects in the cerebellum and the mice had improved motor coordination several months later. Whether this could form the basis of a preventative treatment for neurodevelopmental disorders associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 in humans remains a question for future work.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05151.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05151.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neurofibromatosis type 1</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>bergmann glial cell</kwd><kwd>granule cell</kwd><kwd>unipolar brush cell</kwd><kwd>tumor suppressor gene</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-11-1-0251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01 NS053900, 1R01 NS073762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U54 CA168512-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Yuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nf1 is required during early, but not late, cerebellar development to facilitate neuronal lamination, providing a potential therapeutic prevention strategy for NF1-associated developmental abnormalities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetically inherited disorder that afflicts 1 in 2700 newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans et al., 2010</xref>). NF1 is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>NF1</italic> tumor suppressor gene, which encodes neurofibromin, a negative regulator of proto-oncogene RAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cichowski and Jacks, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Upadhyaya and Cooper, 2012</xref>). RAS mediates multiple signaling pathways including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schubbert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mendoza et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to the development of tumors in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS), neurodevelopmental deficits are highly prevalent among children with NF1, negatively impacting cognition, motor function, and social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyman et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krab et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lorenzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lehtonen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walsh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garg et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adviento et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Champion et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plasschaert et al., 2014</xref>). While cognitive impairments associated with NF1 have been well documented, motor dysfunction, social and behavioral deficits including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have only recently been established as common features of NF1 in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krab et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lorenzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walsh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garg et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Champion et al., 2014</xref>). Approximately 50–80% of children with NF1 have impairments in fine and gross motor function, which can be identified as early as at the toddler stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krab et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lorenzo et al., 2011</xref>). One recent study has shown that impairments of gross motor skills and cognitive functioning in NF1 are often co-morbidities, suggesting the potential existence of a common pathological mechanism underlying both motor and cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Champion et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The cerebellum is traditionally known as a motor organ, which controls both motor coordination and motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>). However, it has been increasingly recognized that the cerebellum also plays a critical role in higher-order brain functions such as cognition, learning, affect and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmahmann and Caplan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basson and Wingate, 2013</xref>). About 80% of individuals with ASD exhibit anatomical abnormalities in the cerebellum, among which gliosis and Purkinje cell loss are most commonly identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Palmen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vargas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fatemi et al., 2012</xref>). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on children with ASD discovered increased white matter and reduced gray matter volumes in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Courchesne et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloss and Courchesne, 2007</xref>). In addition, T2-weighted hyperintensities in the cerebellum are one of the most consistent brain abnormalities observed in individuals with NF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feldmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Payne et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that individuals with NF1, particularly those with co-morbidity of cognitive, motor and social deficits, might have developmental abnormalities of the cerebellum.</p><p>During development, major cerebellar cell populations are derived from two germinal zones. Radial glial (RG) stem cells in the ventricular zone of the fourth ventricle (IV–VZ) give rise to all the GABAergic neuronal lineages—Purkinje cells and GABAergic interneurons including small deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), Golgi, basket, and stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buffo and Rossi, 2013</xref>). Cerebellar astrocytes including Bergmann glia (BG) are also derived from RG cells in the IV-VZ. A secondary germinal zone in the anterior portion of the rhombic lip (RL) generates glutamatergic neuronal lineages, including large DCN, unipolar brush cells (UBCs), and granule cells (GCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Englund et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buffo and Rossi, 2013</xref>). At the onset of mouse cerebellar neurogenesis, projection neurons (Purkinje cells and DCN) are first generated between embryonic day 10.5–11.5 (E10.5–11.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatten, 1999</xref>). At E12.5, Math1 (also known as Atoh1)-expressing proliferating precursors migrate out of the RL and spread across the surface of the cerebellum to form the external granule layer (EGL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatten, 1999</xref>). Around postnatal day 4–5 (P4–5), GC precursors (GCPs) in the EGL start to exit cell cycle and form a pre-migratory zone along the edge of the EGL. Post-mitotic cells then migrate along the BG scaffold, across the molecular layer (ML), and form the internal granule layer (IGL), where they become mature GCs and form synapses with Purkinje cells through mossy fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hatten, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>). Besides GCs, RL-derived Math1<sup>+</sup> precursors also generate the second type of glutamatergic excitatory interneurons, UBCs. UBCs exit the RL at perinatal stages and migrate through the white matter (WM) into the IGL of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Englund et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>). The molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating migration and lineage specification of GC/UBC precursors remain largely unknown.</p><p>It has been shown that the components of RAS/ERK and PI3K signaling pathways play diverse and critical roles in different cell types and at distinct stages during cerebellar development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fogarty et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Müller Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meier et al., 2014</xref>). However, recent studies have shown that <italic>Nf1</italic> heterozygous mice exhibit no defect in cerebellum-specific motor tests and that children with NF1 do not appear to have a general dysfunction of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krab et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Vaart et al., 2011</xref>). These observations suggest that mono-allelic <italic>NF1</italic>/<italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation is not sufficient to cause developmental and functional deficits in the cerebellum. Thus, we hypothesize that bi-allelic <italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation in neural stem and progenitor cells during development is required for producing cellular pathologies in the cerebellum. In this study, we utilize four genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models that target bi-allelic <italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation into different cell lineages or in the same lineage(s) at different stages during cerebellar development. We identify a specific time window of susceptibility of glial and neuronal precursors to <italic>Nf1</italic> mutation during early, but not late stages of cerebellar development. Accordingly, we develop a transient therapeutic strategy during a neonatal window, which prevents cerebellar developmental defects and provides long-term benefits on motor functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bi-allelic inactivation of <italic>Nf1</italic> at early developmental stages disrupts neuronal lamination in the cerebellum</title><p>We first utilized a Cre transgenic strain controlled by human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (hGFAP-cre) to inactivate <italic>Nf1</italic> in RG stem cells in the IV-VZ around E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,A′</xref>).

In the severely affected areas (e.g., folia V/VI), the patterning of Calbindin<sup>+</sup> Purkinje cells was disrupted, and failed to form the single Purkinje cell layer (PCL) observed in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since hGFAP-cre was not targeted to Purkinje cells, the disorganized Purkinje cells still expressed neurofibromin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2008</xref>).

Some of the abnormally accumulated cells in the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO ML were found on the pial surface of the cerebellum, corresponding to the EGL—a structure that transiently exists during development, but disappears after the completion of GC migration (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Ab′′</xref>). No significant difference was found in the total number of NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons in the ML and IGL (per surface area) between the control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum. Instead, the distribution of NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons was greatly altered between the control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellar cortex—the number of NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons was increased over 20-fold in the mutant ML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,D′</xref>). While no cells in the control ML expressed GABA receptor alpha 6 subunit (GABARα6), a marker for mature GCs, 60% of abnormally accumulated neurons in the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO ML were positive for GABARα6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,D′′</xref>). These observations are most consistent with a model wherein a subset of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient GCs fail to migrate inward from the EGL, across ML and PCL, to the IGL. The arrested migration of GCs leads to abnormal neuronal patterning and lamination of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum.</p><p>We next investigated the integrity of the BG scaffold—an essential glial structure for GC migration during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>). In the control cerebellum, BG cells were located either immediately below or interspersed between Purkinje cell bodies, forming a Purkinje cell and BG (PC/BG) monolayer (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buffo and Rossi, 2013</xref>).

A strong correlation was observed between the severity of neuronal patterning defects and the abnormalities in the number and position of BG cells and the integrity of the PC/BG monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Importantly, the capacity of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient BG cells to extend their processes to the pial surface was relatively uncompromised—this was even true for some of the BG cells that were located in the areas outside the PC/BG layer in the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Based on these results, we propose a model wherein inactivation of <italic>Nf1</italic> during early embryonic stages overproduces BG cells, thus impairing the formation of the PC/BG monolayer, and consequently, the alignment of the BG scaffold.

However, an increased number of both total BLBP<sup>+</sup> and proliferating BLBP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells was observed in the prospective white matter (PWM) of the E17.5 <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,A′</xref>). More importantly, mitotic index, determined by the ratio of proliferating BLBP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells to the total BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells, was significantly increased in the E17.5 <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO PWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,A′</xref>). These observations suggest that Nf1 specifically constrains the proliferation of astrocyte precursors in the PWM, but not multipotent RG cells of the IV-VZ in the E17.5 cerebellum. At P0.5, both Purkinje cells and BLBP<sup>+</sup> BG cells (except for those populating future folia IX and X) were situated into a more defined Purkinje cell plate (or rudimentary PC/BG layer); BG cells, particularly those in the anterior cerebellum, underwent differentiation extending their GFAP<sup>+</sup>BLBP<sup>+</sup> fibers to the pial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Unexpectedly, the increased mitotic index was no longer detected in the more differentiated BLBP<sup>+</sup> BG cells in the anterior folia, but only in the posterior folia (IX and X) of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum where BG cells had not formed a rudimentary PC/BG layer at P0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,B′,2C,C′</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The differentiation of BG cells was accompanied by the transition of (1) the anatomical location from the PWM to rudimentary PC/BG layer and (2) the subcellular expression of BLBP from nuclei to cytoplasm. Specifically, BLBP staining in the anterior folia of the P0.5 control cerebellum became largely cytoplasmic, while a robust nuclear BLBP staining was typically found in less differentiated BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells in both the E17.5 control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Consistently, an increase of cells with strong nuclear BLBP staining in the P0.5 <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum was identified, suggesting a persistent increase of proliferating BG cells into postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similarly, BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells in the PWM, the precursors of WM astrocytes, still exhibited an increased mitotic index in the P0.5 <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–D′′</xref>).

Together, these results suggest that Nf1 constrains the proliferation of the BG/astrocyte lineage cells specifically at an intermediate precursor stage located in the PWM, but not at an earlier RG stem cell stage or a more differentiated BG stage, thereby identifying a window of susceptibility of astrocyte precursors to <italic>Nf1</italic> mutation.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05151.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation leads to increased proliferation of intermediate glial precursors and subsequent glial/neuronal defects during perinatal development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sections of control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebella were stained for BLBP and Ki67.

These results supports a model wherein overproduction of astrocyte precursors during embryonic stages is the primary defect causing both glial and neuronal abnormalities in the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum. To rule out a role of Nf1 in late stages of glial development, we sought to more specifically inactivate <italic>Nf1</italic> in glial cell lineages during late embryonic stages by employing an inducible system. This inducible system utilized a Nestin-cre<sup>ER</sup> (NCreER) transgene, which can be activated in Nestin-expressing neural stem and progenitor cells by tamoxifen (TM) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burns et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Upon a single TM pulse at E17.5, NCreER-targeted cells analyzed at P21 were restricted to glial lineage cells in both the control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum with only one exception in folium X, where a significant number of both glia and GCs in the IGL were targeted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Given the sequential differentiation from the anterior to posterior cerebellum, this targeting strategy would inactivate <italic>Nf1</italic> in more differentiated glial cells in the anterior folia compared to those in the posterior folia. No alteration in the number of BLBP<sup>+</sup> cells or the BG scaffold was observed in any of the anterior folia (I to V) between the control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The overproduction of BLBP<sup>+</sup>β-gal<sup>+</sup> BG cells in the posterior folia of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum appeared to be caused by cell-autonomous <italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation, as the number of non-NCreER-targeted BLBP<sup>+</sup>β-gal<sup>-</sup> cells in the same areas was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>).

Double staining of β-gal and other lineage markers showed that β-gal<sup>+</sup> cells were restricted to GCs in the IGL, but not Purkinje cells or glial cells, including BG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,B′</xref>). No defect in Purkinje cells or glial cells, particularly the BG scaffold, was observed in the adult <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,B′</xref>). Consequently, unlike the severely disrupted <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum, the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum was relatively unimpaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum did exhibit one major defect observed in the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum—abnormal accumulation of cells in the ML including some on the pial surface (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B–B′′</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,A′</xref>). The number of NeuN<sup>+</sup>β-gal<sup>+</sup>, but not NeuN<sup>+</sup>β-gal<sup>−</sup> neurons, was significantly increased, suggesting that the increased neuronal density in the ML of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum was caused by abnormal accumulation of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient NeuN<sup>+</sup> neurons in a cell-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B,B′′</xref>). Despite that no defect in the BG scaffold was observed, abnormal accumulation of neurons was evident in the ML of the P8 <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum, suggesting a developmental defect during neonatal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To investigate the mechanism underlying the arrested migration of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient GCs, we performed BrdU pulse-chase experiments to determine the time course of the differentiation and migration of newly generated GCs during neonatal stages. We analyzed P8 control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebella 24, 32 and 48 hr after BrdU pulse by determining the location and differentiation status of BrdU-labeled cells. 24 hr after pulse, BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in both the control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum remained exclusively in the EGL and exhibited similar cell cycle profiles, suggesting that Nf1 is not required for proliferation and cell-cycle exit of GC precursors (GCPs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–C′′</xref>). However, 32 hr after BrdU pulse, a subset of BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the control cerebellum started departing from the EGL and entered the ML, not yet reaching the IGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). While migrating GCs in the control ML did not express MAP2, a marker for mature GCs in the IGL, and had nuclei with a spindle-shaped migrating morphology, many BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells in the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO ML already acquired MAP2 expression with rounded nuclei—typical neuronal differentiation features for mature GCs in the IGL (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,C′</xref>). After 48-hr BrdU pulse, BrdU<sup>+</sup>MAP2<sup>+</sup> cells in the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum progressively accumulated in the ML and EGL whereas control BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells did not express MAP2 until they reached the IGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D,D′</xref>). Newly generated neurons were abnormally accumulated in the ML/EGL of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum, leading to an increased number of differentiated BrdU<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>−</sup> and p27<sup>+</sup> cells in the ML/EGL with a concomitant reduction in the IGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E,E′,F,F′</xref>). These observations suggest that a subset of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient GCPs undergo accelerated and premature neuronal differentiation, thereby arresting their migration in the EGL and ML. This conclusion was further supported by in vitro studies. 2 days after being plated in culture, significantly more <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient GCPs expressed MAP2 than control cells, confirming an accelerated neuronal differentiation rate in a cell-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G,G′</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient GCs could efficiently interact with wild-type glia in a co-culture system and migrated normally in a trans-well migration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H,H′</xref>). Together, both in vivo and in vitro assays argue that instead of causing defects directly on migration, <italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation promotes premature neuronal differentiation of a subset of GCPs, leading to abnormal accumulation of differentiated neurons in the ML and EGL.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05151.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Neuron-specific <italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation leads to cell-autonomous defects in the glutamatergic interneuron lineages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) X-gal staining on P21 control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebella labeled cells that underwent Math1-cre-mediated recombination.

UBCs are the other known RL-derived glutamatergic interneurons that are enriched in folia responsible for vestibular motor function (folia IX and X) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>). While GCs arise from GCPs in the EGL and migrate across ML to IGL between P4–P21, Tbr2<sup>+</sup> UBCs exit the RL during late embryonic stages, and then migrate through the PWM into the IGL until P10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Englund et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sillitoe and Joyner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>).

Tbr2 expression was ectopically acquired in a subset of newly generated cells even before migrating out of the EGL, and over time these Tbr2<sup>+</sup>BrdU<sup>+</sup> double-positive cells progressively accumulated from the EGL, ML to IGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,F′,G,G′</xref>). These observations demonstrate that <italic>Nf1</italic> inactivation ectopically generates Tbr2<sup>+</sup> UBCs from GCPs in the EGL, which appear to migrate along the same pathway as GCs. More importantly, cells with the classic morphology of UBCs were identified in the ML of the P8 <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum, but not in the control cerebellum, indicating that these Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells not only acquire UBC-specific Tbr2 expression, but also undergo morphological differentiation of UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mugnaini and Floris, 1994</xref>).

Indeed, a dramatic increase of Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells was also observed in the ML throughout the adult <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum, which was most evident in folia V/VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–A′′</xref>). The increase of Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells in the ML (98%) and IGL (94%) of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum was almost entirely contributed by UBCs that expressed a moderate level of Tbr2 as well as NeuN (Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup>) (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,B′</xref>). Almost all UBCs in the control folium V expressed high levels of Tbr2, but no NeuN (Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup>) and were mainly distributed in the IGL (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,B′</xref>). It should be noted that the number of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> UBCs was not significantly different between the control and the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum. The distinction between Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> and Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> UBC populations was further supported by the different percentage of these two types of UBCs expressing a high level of Calretinin (CR<sup>high</sup>). CR<sup>high</sup> is a marker for a subset of UBCs due to its low expression in granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>). Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs in the ML and IGL of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum expressed CR<sup>high</sup> at a significantly lower percentage (36% and 38%) than Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> UBCs (67%) typically observed in the IGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,A′</xref>). Importantly, the absolute number of Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs was similar in the ML of folium V between the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum, further supporting the notion that ectopic generation of these UBCs results from loss of cell-autonomous Nf1 function in the glutamatergic neuronal lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I′</xref>). Similar to the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum, ectopic Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs were continuously generated in the ML and IGL of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum during postnatal stages (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,B′,C,C′</xref>), well beyond the developmental window of the generation of control Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> UBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J,J′</xref>). Together, these observations demonstrate that the Tbr2<sup>+</sup> UBCs ectopically generated in both the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum are different from those previously described in the normal cerebellum in 6 critical aspects: (1) the marker expression, Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> vs Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup>, (2) the low vs high percentage expressing CR<sup>high</sup>, (3) the location, ML and IGL vs IGL, (4) the developmental origin, precursors in the EGL vs RL, (5) the timing of birth, neonatal vs embryonic stages, and (6) the migratory pathway, EGL-ML-IGL vs RL-PWM-IGL. Thus, we suggest the existence of two UBC sublineages.

Consistent with the specificity of Math1-cre transgene, cell cultures with enriched P6 GCPs showed almost a complete loss of neurofibromin expression with a robust increase of Erk activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A′</xref>). A high level of phosphorylated Erk (p-Erk) expression was observed in a subset of IGL cells, while a low level in the ML and a complete absence of p-Erk in the EGL was found in the control cerebellum at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The pattern of p-Erk expression is consistent with a possible role of a high level of Erk signaling in neuronal differentiation. A robust increase of p-Erk expression was observed in the P8 <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum including the inner edge of the EGL (pre-migratory zone), the ML, and IGL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

These results demonstrate that Nf1 is a major regulator that suppresses Erk signaling in migrating GCs in the pre-migratory EGL and migratory zone (ML) of the developing cerebellum. To test whether hyperactive Erk signaling is responsible for <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient GCPs to undergo premature differentiation and ectopically adopt a UBC fate, we treated newborn control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO pups with a MEK inhibitor (PD0325901) or vehicle from P0.5 to P21 for 3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sebolt-Leopold and Herrera, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). This 3-week treatment protocol exhibited no adverse effect on normal cerebellar development, but reduced p-Erk expression in both MEKi-treated control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebella (data not shown). Strikingly, MEK inhibition completely eliminated ectopic Tbr2 expression in the ML of MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). MEK inhibition consistently reduced over 60% of abnormally accumulated neurons in the ML of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,C′</xref>). Since an increase of p-S6 staining was also identified in purified GCPs from the P6 <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A′</xref>), we treated control and <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO mice with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guertin and Sabatini, 2009</xref>).

Mechanistically, Nf1 is required for the formation of the BG monolayer and scaffold by controlling astrocyte precursor proliferation at a specific precursor stage, but dispensable for BG cells during late stages of cerebellar development and adulthood. Similarly, Nf1 indirectly regulates glutamatergic neuronal migration by controlling the timely differentiation and suppressing ectopic UBC differentiation of GCPs during postnatal cerebellar development. The timely requirement of Nf1 during cerebellar development allows us to develop a therapeutic prevention strategy for treating these developmental disorders with long-term behavioral benefits.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Nf1 regulates astrocyte proliferation at a specific precursor stage</title><p>Astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the brain, play diverse roles in both the developing and mature brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barres, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Molofsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman and Rowitch, 2013</xref>). Compared to the other two major CNS cell types, neurons and oligodendrocytes, the identity of astrocyte precursors remains poorly understood. This is largely due to a lack of known markers that can reliably define astrocytes at distinct developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Molofsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman and Rowitch, 2013</xref>). BG cells have a unique and well-defined migratory pathway coupled with differentiation that allows us to define the role of Nf1 in this particular astrocyte lineage at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buffo and Rossi, 2013</xref>). Before becoming terminally differentiated in the PC/BG monolayer, BG precursors proliferate at three distinct stages of differentiation that can be distinguished by different anatomical locations during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). These three stages include: Stage I, RG/early-precursor stage in the IV-VZ; Stage II, BG intermediate-precursor stage in the PWM; Stage III, BG late-precursor stage in the rudimentary PC/BG layer. In the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum, increased proliferation was not observed in E17.5 IV-VZ RG cells (Stage I), or in BG late-precursors following migration into the rudimentary PC/BG layer in P0.5 anterior folia, or throughout P8 folia (Stage III). In contrast, a significant increase of proliferation index was specifically identified in <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient BG intermediate-precursors in the E17.5 PWM and P0.5 posterior folia (Stage II), leading to an increased number of both total BLBP<sup>+</sup> and proliferating BLBP<sup>+</sup>Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells. These observations suggest that Nf1 plays a robust role in constraining BG proliferation specifically at an intermediate precursor stage (Stage II), but not during earlier or later stages (Stage I or Stage III). This conclusion is further confirmed by acute inactivation of <italic>Nf1</italic> in the E17.5 developing cerebellum using an inducible <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO model. Thus, the temporal and regional phenotypic differences upon <italic>Nf1</italic> loss observed in the BG lineage can be strictly attributed to differences in the differentiation status of this particular astrocyte lineage. Moreover, <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient astrocytes in the developing WM also exhibited increased proliferation. Since gliogenesis occurs at different time points in different regions of the developing brain, this ‘differentiation-based’ model might provide an explanation for conflicting results on the role of Nf1 in neural stem and progenitor cells among previously published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dasgupta and Gutmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hegedus et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becher and Holland, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee da et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee da et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). It should be noted that region-specific mechanisms underlying glial pathologies induced by <italic>Nf1</italic> loss do exist within the dorsal brain. While increased proliferation in <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient astrocyte precursors appears to be responsible for the increase of glial cells in the dorsal hindbrain (e.g., cerebellum), altered fate-specification of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient neural stem and progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle causes the increase of glial cells in the corpus callosum by promoting gliogenesis at the expense of neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>It is not entirely clear why Nf1 plays a critical role in suppressing astrocyte proliferation at a specific precursor stage. Loss of function studies in mice have shown that receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling, particularly fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling, is essential for the transition from RG to BG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muller Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meier et al., 2014</xref>). Most strikingly, loss of Shp2, also known as Ptpn11 (Protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 11), completely blocks the transition from RG to BG cells, which can be rescued by constitutively active MEK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2014</xref>). These studies suggest that activation of Shp2-dependent FGF/MEK/Erk signaling is essential for the transition from RG to BG cells during cerebellar development (from Stage I to II). Accordingly, our study suggests that Erk signaling must be constrained by pathway inhibitors such as Nf1 to ensure the generation of the correct number of BG cells. Consistently, the most robust Erk/MAPK activation upon Nf1 loss was observed in astrocyte precursors at Stage II and early Stage III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Glia-dependent and –independent Nf1 functions in glutamatergic interneurons</title><p>Our study provides several lines of evidence supporting the notion that the correct number of astrocytes is essential for the formation of the PC/BG monolayer and the BG scaffold, and subsequently glutamatergic interneuronal migration. First, in the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum, the severity of glial and neuronal defects is not uniform, but highly correlated with the excess number of BG cells in the affected areas. Indeed, the capacity of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient BG cells to extend their radial fibers appeared relatively uncompromised even for those projected from the areas outside of the PC/BG layer. Second, considering the time required for TM induced, Cre-mediated <italic>Nf1</italic> deletion at E17.5 and the half-life of neurofibromin protein, we expect that a complete loss of Nf1 would be fully achieved in targeted cells around P0.5 when BG cells in the anterior folia (I–V) are at Stage III, while BG cells in the posterior folia (IX and X) are still proliferating in the PWM at Stage II. Consistently, a significant increase of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient BG cells was observed in the posterior folia (IX, X), but not in the anterior folia of the same <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum. Moreover, failed formation of the PC/BG monolayer, misalignment of the BG scaffold, and abnormal accumulation of both <italic>Nf1</italic>-intact and <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient neurons in the ML were only observed in the posterior folia of the E17.5 TM-induced <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum. It should be noted that glial and neuronal defects in the posterior folia of the E17.5 TM-induced <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum are significantly less severe than those observed in the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum. This is likely due to a relatively greater window for the expansion of <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient glial precursors in the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum (from E12.5 on) than E17.5 TM-induced <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum. Third, transient treatment of MEKi exhibited a robust long-term rescue of glial and neuronal defects in the cerebella of G-responders in which neurons and glia were still deficient for <italic>Nf1</italic> after the treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that as long as the excess number of glia is therapeutically fixed during a specific window of cerebellar development, a long-term rescue could be achieved, as Nf1 is relatively dispensable for glial cell proliferation during late stages of development and adulthood.</p><p>Our study also shows that the correct number of astrocytes in the developing WM of the cerebellum is essential for the migration of UBCs from the PWM to the IGL. This neuronal migratory defect appears to result from loss of a non-cell-autonomous Nf1 function in glial cells. This conclusion is based on the observations that (1) neuron-specific <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum exhibited no such defect in the WM, and (2) <italic>Nf1</italic>-intact UBCs were arrested in the WM of the E17.5 TM-induced <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>NCreER</sup>CKO cerebellum where excess astrocytes were present. Furthermore, the migratory defect of UBCs was completely rescued in the transiently MEKi-treated cerebella of G-responders, which contained a relatively normal number of glial cells. Together, our study demonstrates that Nf1 not only plays a critical role in suppressing neoplastic transformation of glial cells, but also is essential for controlling the generation of the correct number of normal astrocytes—which is required for the migration of both types of glutamatergic interneurons (GCs and UBCs) during cerebellar development.</p><p>Analysis of the neuron-specific <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum supports the existence of two UBC sublineages. One UBC sublineage characterized by Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> is relatively well studied, which exit cell cycles during perinatal stages and migrate from the RL via the PWM to the IGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Englund et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>). Although Nf1-regulated glial number is essential for the migration of this UBC sublineage through the PWM, Nf1 is not required for the generation and migration of the Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> UBC sublineage. In contrast, the other rare Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBC sublineage appears to be suppressed by Nf1-regulated Erk signaling in GCPs in a cell-autonomous mechanism. Thus, our study demonstrates that Nf1 is indirectly required for GC migration by suppressing GCPs to undergo premature terminal differentiation and ectopic differentiation to Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs in the EGL and ML. It is still possible that <italic>Nf1</italic> loss causes abnormal migration of the Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> sublineage from the RL to the EGL, and then switches them to the Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBC sublineage in the EGL. However, no Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells were found in the EGL of the mutant cerebellum at E17.5 or P0.5, when Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> UBCs migrate out of the RL into the PWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C,C′</xref>). This observation argues against the possibility of abnormal migration of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> UBCs into the EGL. Indeed, <italic>Nf1</italic> loss has little or no impact on the generation, migration and total number of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> UBCs in the mutant cerebellum. Furthermore, in contrast to the precursors of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>−</sup> UBCs that exit cell cycles during perinatal stages, <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient precursors of Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs continue proliferating in the EGL at least until P8 at the peak of GCP proliferation. Together, these observations suggest that Nf1 plays a specific role in the Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBC sublineage by controlling the fate-specification of GCPs in differentiating into GCs vs Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs. The involvement of UBCs in cerebellar vestibular functions raises the possibility that the UBC defects in these <italic>Nf1</italic> GEM models could contribute to the impairments of motor and balance observed in individuals with NF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mugnaini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Champion et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Our previous study showed that MEKi could be delivered to neonatal pups through milk from MEKi-treated lactating females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). This ‘MEKi in milk’ treatment protocol allows a low dose of MEKi to get into pups without introducing any physical distress. When lactating females received MEKi at 5 mg/kg (body weight), a mild 30–40% of Erk inhibition was observed in the brains of <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO pups (MB, EJ and YZ, unpublished observations). Strikingly, this mild Erk inhibition robustly and consistently rescued developmental defects in the cerebella of 100% of MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO mice, as well as over 60% of the MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice (G-responders). It should be noted that the remaining P-responders are not ‘non-responders’, as these MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice still exhibited a complete rescue of ectopic Tbr2 expression in their cerebella, and consistent rescues in the defects in the corpus callosum and SVZ, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The inconsistent rescue in the glia-dependent defects observed in the cerebella of MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice is likely due to the extremely high levels of Erk activation in <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient glial cells in the developing cerebellum compared to other cells. Indeed, when the dose of MEKi was increased to 20 mg/kg, a more consistent rescue in cerebellar defects was observed in the cerebella of the MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). More importantly, this ‘MEKi in milk’ treatment protocol provides robust long-term rescues on cerebellar developmental defects and motor performance. It should be emphasized that this transient MEKi treatment protocol also rescued structural defects in the other regions of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO brain including the enlarged corpus callosum, a brain structural defect associated with severe cognitive impairments in a subset of NF1 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, motor performance improvement by this protocol is a collective reflection of rescues of multiple NF1-associated brain structural defects including those in the cerebellum and corpus callosum. Given that cognitive and motor impairments are often co-morbidities in children with NF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Champion et al., 2014</xref>), our findings suggest that this transient ‘MEKi in milk’ protocol can serve as a common prevention strategy for multiple NF1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Control and mutant mice</title><p>Three independent Cre transgenic strains under the control of hGFAP, Math1 and L7 promoters were utilized to target an <italic>Nf1</italic> mutation into different cell lineages during cerebellar development.

Mice were tested for 4 consecutive days at P21–P24 and P45–P49. The speed of the rotarod was constantly accelerated from 4 to 34 rpm over a 5-min period. The latency to fall from the rod was recorded. The test was stopped at 12 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Anatomically comparable sections from control and mutant brains were visualized under an Olympus BX51 microscope. Images were captured and subjected to analysis. Lengths, areas and the number of cells were quantified using the ImageJ software package. Statistical analysis was carried out using unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test. Comparisons across more than two groups were based on Anova test. At least three animals from each group were used for quantification. Data were presented as mean ± Standard Error Mean (SEM). p &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p><p>When quantifying cells in specific folia, we used the following criteria to define the areas to quantify. ‘Folia V/IV’ refers to the junction between folia V and IV at 20× magnification (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> middle panels) and the quantification covered this entire area. Similarly, ‘Folia IX/X’ refers to the junction between folia IX and X at 20× magnification (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). ‘Folium V’ or ‘Folium X’ refers to 40× images in these folia close to the center of the cerebellum that were imaged at comparable positions in controls and mutants.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr L Parada for support during the early phase of the study; G Tomasek for technical assistance; members of the Zhu lab for support; Drs A Messing for providing hGFAP-cre mice, D Rowitch for Math1-cre mice, L Chang for Nestin-creER mice, N Heintz for BLBP antibody, B Novitch for Olig2 antibody; Drs R Packer, C Wang, and J Guan for critically reading the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 2 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this study, the authors conducted genetic analyses to identify the cell types and molecular events that underlie a subset of behavioral deficits associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1. Significantly, the authors show that transient MEK inhibition during a neonatal window prevents cerebellar developmental defects and improves long-term motor performance of Nf1- deficient mice. While the reviewers find the study to be overall nicely conducted and potentially important for the development of Nf1 therapeutics they also identified several points that should be addressed prior to publication. In particular, mechanistic insights into the differential response of the Nf1-GFAP animals to MEK inhibitor (responders vs. non-responders) should be provided. Otherwise, this data is better removed from the study. In addition, the authors should discuss the specificity of the Cre drivers used in the study and its potential effect on the observed phenotypes, as well as improve the presentation of figures to non-experts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 comments:</italic></p><p>1) Define the genotype of Nf1 CKO mice: NF1flox/− and/or NF1flox/flox?

For example, the hGFAP-Cre driver line generates strong recombination astrocytes in many brain structures, including the hippocampus, and corpus callosum. Math-1 mediated Cre recombination has not been extensively characterized, but Math1 is known to be required for development of a range of brainstem neurons involved in proprioception, interoception, hearing and arounsal Rose et al, 2009). The authors have made little effort to make the reader aware of these facts, and how they may affect the interpretation of their data. While this point is unlikely to be important for evaluation of anatomical defects in cerebellar development, the behavioral data they have provided must be considered in the light of this knowledge. The authors should substantively revise the manuscript to educate the reader with regard to these points, the potential impact they have on our interpretation of this work, and their considerations regarding the potential therapeutic effects of MEKi.</p><p>2) It is unclear to this reviewer that the observation of Tbr+ cells in the EGL and ML of Nf1/Math1 CKO mice proves that loss of NF1 causes altered fate-specification. Of course, these cells might represent GCs that are mis-specified, as the authors have suggested. Alternatively, they could represent ectopic UBCs that were correctly specified in the rhombic lip, but followed an abnormal migratory path to arrive in the EGL and ML. The fact that they are labeled in the EGL by BrDU does not distinguish between these two possibilities. In my opinion, much more precise and detailed characterization of these ectopic cells would have to be done to conclude that they are mis-specified.</p><p>3) The figures presented are exceedingly complex! Although the data are very nicely presented, I believe the density of the data presented in these figures will cause all but the most dedicated scientists to disengage from the study before they have finished reading it. Although I would not reject the study on such superficial grounds, a careful culling of the data so that only the essential points are presented in the primary figures would significantly improve the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05151.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>In this study, the authors conducted genetic analyses to identify the cell types and molecular events that underlie a subset of behavioral deficits associated with Neurofibromatosis type 1.

Otherwise, this data is better removed from the study</italic>.</p><p>We believe that these results are important parts of the study and should be included in the manuscript. Accordingly, we have included additional data to support our conclusion that the extremely high levels of Erk activation in <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient glial cells (compared to other cell types) in the developing cerebellum is the major mechanism underlying differential responses in the cerebella of MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice (Good-responders or G-responders versus Poor-responders or P-responders). Furthermore, we have included a new section subtitled by “Clinical Implication” in the Discussion to address this important issue.</p><p>It should be emphasized that we employed a “MEKi in milk” strategy to deliver MEKi to neonatal pups through milk from lactating females treated with MEKi at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. While this delivery strategy causes minimal physical distress to pups, it also leads to inconsistent uptake of MEKi from milk due to physical weakness of some of <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO pups. Western blot analysis showed that this “MEKi in milk” strategy achieved a mild 30% to 50% of Erk inhibition in the developing cerebella of MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO pups.</p><p>Strikingly, mild Erk inhibition with this protocol robustly and consistently rescued developmental defects in <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebella, and over 60% of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebella (G-responders). It should be noted that the remaining P-responders are not “non-responders”, as these MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice still exhibited a complete rescue of ectopic Tbr2 expression in their cerebella, as well as consistent rescues in the defects in the corpus callosum and SVZ, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The only observed variation is the inconsistent rescue in the glial defects observed in the cerebella of MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice, which is likely due to the extremely high levels of Erk activation in <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient glial cells in the developing cerebellum compared to other cells. Indeed, when the dose of MEKi was increased to 20 mg/kg to lactating females, a more consistent rescue in cerebellar defects was observed in the cerebella of <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice.

In brief, the control and mutant mice analyzed in this study were maintained in the mixed background of C57Bl, 129 Svj and FVB backgrounds. To minimize the effect of genetic background, we analyzed control and mutant mice among littermates. As discussed above, control and mutant littermates used in this study received MEKi through milk from the same lactating females. Based on Western blot analysis, a mild 30% to 50% of Erk inhibition was observed among MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice. This mild inhibition consistently rescued cell-autonomous defects in neurons in the cerebella of MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO mice, but exhibited differential responses in glial-dependent cerebellar defects. The inconsistent rescue in the glial defects observed in the cerebella of MEKi-treated <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO mice is likely due to the extremely high levels of Erk activation in <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient glial cells in the developing cerebellum compared to other cells.

Indeed, this is one of the major strengths of this transient MEKi treatment protocol that could potentially exert therapeutic benefits on multiple NF1-associated brain structural defects including both defects in the cerebellum and other brain regions (which are targeted by hGFAP-cre, as this reviewer pointed out). This discussion has been included in the last paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><p>Detailed discussion about the potential therapeutic effects of MEKi has been included in “Response to General Comments #1” and “Response to Reviewer 1 Comments #4”.</p><p><italic>2) It is unclear to this reviewer that the observation of Tbr+ cells in the EGL and ML of Nf1/Math1 CKO mice proves that loss of NF1 causes altered fate-specification. Of course, these cells might represent GCs that are mis-specified, as the authors have suggested. Alternatively, they could represent ectopic UBCs that were correctly specified in the rhombic lip, but followed an abnormal migratory path to arrive in the EGL and ML. The fact that they are labeled in the EGL by BrDU does not distinguish between these two possibilities. In my opinion, much more precise and detailed characterization of these ectopic cells would have to be done to conclude that they are mis-specified</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this reviewer that ectopic presence of Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells in the EGL and ML of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum could be caused by abnormal migration of Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells from the RL. However, we regret that we did not make it clear in the initial submission that ectopic presence of Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells in the EGL and ML of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>Math1</sup>CKO cerebellum are distinct from those relatively well characterized RL-derived Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>-</sup> UBCs in the literature. These two Tbr2<sup>+</sup> UBC sublineages can be distinguished at least in six aspects: (1) the marker expression, Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> vs. Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>-</sup>, (2) the low vs. high percentage expressing CR<sup>high</sup>, (3) the location, ML and IGL vs. IGL, (4) the developmental origin, precursors in the EGL vs. RL, (5) the timing of birth, postnatal vs. embryonic stages, and (6) the migratory pathway, EGL-ML-IGL vs. RL-PWM-IGL (see the revised Results section).</p><p>It is still possible that <italic>Nf1</italic> loss causes abnormal migration of the Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>-</sup> sublineage from the RL to the EGL, and then switches them to the Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBC sublineage in the EGL. However, no Tbr2<sup>+</sup> cells were found in the EGL of the mutant cerebellum at E17.5 or P0.5, when Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>-</sup> UBCs migrate out of the RL into the PWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2C, C’</xref>). This observation argues against the possibility of abnormal migration of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>-</sup> UBCs into the EGL. Indeed, <italic>Nf1</italic> loss has little or no impact on the generation, migration and total number of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>-</sup> UBCs in the mutant cerebellum. Furthermore, in contrast to the precursors of Tbr2<sup>high</sup>NeuN<sup>-</sup> UBCs that exit cell cycles during perinatal stages, <italic>Nf1</italic>-deficient precursors of Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs continue proliferating in the EGL at least until P8 at the peak of GCP proliferation. Together, these observations suggest that Nf1 plays a specific role in the Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBC sublineage by controlling the fate-specification of GCPs in differentiating into GCs versus Tbr2<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> UBCs. This discussion has been included in the revised Discussion section.</p><p><italic>3) The figures presented are exceedingly complex! Although the data are very nicely presented, I believe the density of the data presented in these figures will cause all but the most dedicated scientists to disengage from the study before they have finished reading it. Although I would not reject the study on such superficial grounds, a careful culling of the data so that only the essential points are presented in the primary figures would significantly improve the paper</italic>.</p><p>We have carefully reviewed the data and revised 6 of 7 figures in the original submission. In the revised manuscript, each figure was simplified and only included the necessary data to support the main conclusion of the particular figure.

Specifically:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> only includes the data that describe the neuronal and glial phenotypes of the <italic>Nf1</italic><sup>hGFAP</sup>CKO cerebellum.

The remaining supporting data were moved to a figure supplement.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was simplified by moving 48-hour BrdU pulse-chase data and in vitro data to a figure supplement.
