defense. During herpesvirus infection, PML-NBs induce epigenetic silencing of viral genomes, however, this defense is antagonized by viral regulatory proteins such as IE1 of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). Here, we show that PML-NBs undergo a drastic rearrangement into highly enlarged PML cages upon infection with IE1-deficient HCMV. Importantly, our results demonstrate that dual signaling by interferon and DNA damage response is required to elicit giant PML-NBs. DNA labeling revealed that invading HCMV genomes are entrapped inside PML-NBs and remain stably associated with PML cages in a transcriptionally repressed state. Intriguingly, by correlative light and transmission electron microscopy (EM), we observed that PML cages also entrap newly assembled viral capsids demonstrating a second defense layer in cells with incomplete first-line response. Further characterization by 3D EM showed that hundreds of viral capsids are tightly packed into several layers of fibrous PML. Overall, our data indicate that giant PML-NBs arise via combined interferon and DNA damage signaling which triggers entrapment of both nucleic acids and proteinaceous components. This represents a multilayered defense strategy to act in a cytoprotective manner and to combat viral infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytomegalovirus</kwd><kwd>PML protein</kwd><kwd>nuclear bodies</kwd><kwd>herpesvirus</kwd><kwd>intrinsic immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STA357/7-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stamminger</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STA357/8-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stamminger</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Characterization of PML subnuclear structures during human cytomegalovirus infection demonstrates that prolonged interferon and DNA damage signaling can induce giant PML nuclear bodies which sequentially entrap both nucleic acids and viral proteins as a cytoprotective mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In order to establish a successful infection, viruses have to overcome intrinsic, innate, and adaptive host defenses which act in a cooperative manner to block viral replication and spread. The first line of intracellular defense is provided by intrinsic immune effectors that, in contrast to classical innate responses like the interferon system, are constitutively expressed and do not require pathogen-induced activation. Studies over the last 25 years have identified promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), also known as nuclear domain 10, as key mediators of intrinsic immunity against viruses from different families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tavalai and Stamminger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Everett and Chelbi-Alix, 2007</xref>). These highly dynamic protein complexes are located in the interchromosomal space of the cell nucleus and appear as discrete foci with a size of 0.2–1.0 µm in diameter and a number of 1–30 PML-NBs per nucleus, depending on cell type and condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007</xref>). PML, the structure-defining component of PML-NBs, belongs to the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family and is expressed in at least seven isoforms whose common N-terminal region consists of a RING domain, one or two B-boxes, and a coiled-coil (CC) domain. All PML isoforms are subject to covalent modification with small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins, which enables the recruitment of further components and is therefore essential for PML-NB biogenesis. Due to the high number of permanently or transiently recruited proteins, PML-NBs have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including transcriptional regulation, control of apoptosis and cellular senescence as well as DNA damage response. Furthermore, the early observation that PML-NBs target invading genomes of several DNA viruses, including the herpesviruses herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), papillomaviruses and adenoviruses, raised the concept that PML-NBs act as sites for deposition of viral DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishov and Maul, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Day et al., 2004</xref>). More recent research on HSV-1 has confirmed the nuclear association with parental viral genomes and has shown that HSV-1 DNA is enveloped by PML-NBs, which thereby contribute to the control of latency in infected neurons and to intrinsic restriction of lytic HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Everett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alandijany et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, a study on the interplay of PML-NBs with adenoviral genomes has found a viral DNA replication factor but not genome complexes colocalizing with PML-NBs, thus arguing against a general role as deposition site for viral genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Komatsu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Characterization of the intrinsic immune function of PML-NBs during herpesvirus infection has identified the major components PML, Sp100, Daxx, and ATRX as independent restriction factors that induce epigenetic silencing of viral DNA by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tavalai and Stamminger, 2009</xref>). This restrictive activity enables PML-NBs to block one of the first steps in the herpesviral life cycle. However, it is saturable and can be overcome by high doses of virus. A different antiviral mechanism, acting on a later stage of infection, has been shown to affect the herpesvirus varicella-zoster virus (VZV). During VZV infection, PML-NBs target and enclose viral nucleocapsids, mediated through a specific interaction of PML isoform IV with the ORF23 capsid protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reichelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reichelt et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to their role in intrinsic immunity, accumulating evidence implicates PML-NBs in the innate immune defense. An interplay between PML-NBs and innate immunity has been discovered with the observation that interferon (IFN) treatment induces the expression of specific PML-NB factors, such as PML and Sp100, and leads to an increased size and number of foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chelbi-Alix et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lavau et al., 1995</xref>). In line with this, PML-NBs participate in the establishment of an IFN-induced antiviral state and depletion of PML reduces the capacity of IFNs to protect from viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Regad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chee et al., 2003</xref>). Recent evidence has found that PML itself acts as a co-regulatory factor for the induction of IFN-stimulated genes, suggesting an even closer cross talk between intrinsic and innate immune mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ulbricht et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim and Ahn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">El Asmi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scherer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In light of the broad antiviral activity of PML-NBs, it is not surprising that viruses encode antagonistic effector proteins that employ diverse strategies to inactivate single PML-NB proteins or disrupt the integrity of the whole structure. HCMV, a ubiquitous beta-herpesvirus causing serious disease in immunocompromised individuals, encodes at least two effector proteins that act in a sequential manner to efficiently antagonize PML-NB-based repression. Upon infection, the tegument-delivered protein pp71 is imported into the nucleus where it leads to dissociation of ATRX from PML-NBs, followed by proteasomal degradation of Daxx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lukashchuk et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saffert and Kalejta, 2006</xref>). As this facilitates initiation of viral immediate-early gene expression, the immediate-early protein 1 (IE1) can be expressed and induces a complete dispersal of PML-NBs within the first hours of infection. Mechanistic studies have revealed that IE1 directly interacts with PML through its all alpha-helical core domain and blocks de novo SUMOylation of PML, thus disrupting PML-NB integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schilling et al., 2017</xref>). While the PML-antagonistic protein ICP0 of HSV-1 has been shown to induce a widespread degradation of SUMO-modified proteins, IE1 uses a more specific, but yet not fully elucidated mechanism to inhibit PML SUMOylation and thereby promote viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boutell et al., 2011</xref>). Due to such rapid and effective countermeasures, recombinant viruses that lack antagonistic proteins provide a valuable tool to study antiviral activities of cellular restriction factors, which would otherwise not be detectable.</p><p>Here, we report an interferon- and DNA damage signaling-induced formation of huge PML spheres, referred to as PML cages, which occurs during infection with IE1-deleted HCMV. Visualization of viral DNA with clickable fluorescent azides revealed that input HCMV genomes are entrapped by PML-NBs and remain stably encased by PML cages, leading to repression of viral gene expression as a first layer of antiviral defense. Moreover, we identify a second layer of PML-based protection for cells escaping the gene silencing-driven defense: we demonstrate that PML cages entrap newly assembled HCMV capsids in late infected cells by using correlative light and transmission electron microcopy (CLEM). 3D reconstruction of PML cages after focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) tomography illustrates hundreds of HCMV capsids sequestered by fibrous PML structures. Overall, these data indicate a dual, PML-based inhibition of HCMV infection and suggest entrapment of viral material as a general restriction mechanism used by PML-NBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PML forms large, spherical structures after infection with IE1-deleted HCMV</title><p>PML-NBs are known to associate with HCMV genomes that enter the nucleus in order to silence viral gene expression. The antiviral structures, however, are destroyed by the immediate-early protein IE1 within the first hours of infection. To characterize the repressive effects of PML-NBs further, we analyzed their role during HCMV infection in absence of the antagonistic activity of IE1. To this end, primary human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells were infected with wild-type HCMV, strain AD169, or previously described recombinant cytomegaloviruses harboring either a deletion of IE1 (AD169∆IE1) or a leucine-to-proline mutation at position 174 of IE1 that affects its structural integrity and abolishes its interaction with PML (AD169/IE1-L174P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scherer et al., 2016</xref>). In subsequent immunofluorescence analysis we observed that PML, which usually shows a diffuse, nuclear distribution in HCMV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, panel 1), localizes to unusually large, ring-like structures after infection with recombinant cytomegaloviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, panel 2 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Orthogonal views and maximum intensity projection of confocal z-series images suggested that these structures are in fact spherical with PML being present at the outer layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Since deletion and mutation of IE1 resulted in the same reorganization of PML-NBs during infection, both recombinant viruses were utilized for the following experiments and exemplary results are shown. To further investigate the formation of PML spheres, we performed time-course analysis in cells infected with IE1-defective HCMV and examined the subcellular localization of PML and UL44, which is a marker for viral replication centers. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, PML-NBs were slightly enlarged at 8 hr post-infection (hpi), when compared to non-infected cells. During progression of infection, several PML foci developed into ring-like structures that were often juxtaposed to viral replication centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, panel 4 and 5). In summary, these data show that PML-NBs, when not disrupted by IE1, undergo a drastic redistribution during HCMV infection. These newly formed structures will be referred to as PML cages, since they resemble enlarged PML-NBs that have been observed in patients with immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial dysmorphy (ICF) syndrome or in varicella zoster virus-infected cells and have been shown to encase cellular or viral components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reichelt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luciani et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Formation of PML cages during infection with IE1-deficient HCMV.</title><p>(<bold>a–e</bold>) HFF were infected with HCMV strain AD169, IE1-deleted AD169 (HCMVΔIE1) or AD169 encoding IE1 mutant L174P (HCMV/IE1-L174P) at a MOI of 5 IEU/cell.

For this purpose, HFF were infected with IE1-deficient HCMV, followed by co-staining of PML and proteins that are known to permanently reside at PML-NBs. Except for ATRX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, panel 3), all main NB components, namely Sp100, Daxx, SUMO-1, and SUMO-2/3, were detected at the rim of PML cages indicating a similar composition to that of PML-NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, panels 1, 2, 4, and 5). This was further supported by the finding that PML is required for induction of PML cages, since other PML-NB proteins, like Sp100 or Daxx, did not localize to ring-like structures in PML-depleted HFF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, panel 1 and 2). Knockdown of Sp100, Daxx or ATRX, in contrast, did not abolish formation of PML cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, panel 3–5). To investigate whether PML cages are built by a specific isoform, PML-depleted fibroblasts were subjected to lentiviral transduction in order to reintroduce individual FLAG-tagged PML isoforms. While overexpression of PML isoforms resulted in unspecific aggregates in non-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), infection with IE1-deficient HCMV induced a re-organization of all PML isoforms into ring-shaped structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We conclude that PML cages are not formed by isoform-specific interactions but require the common N-terminal domain, which contains the TRIM motif and SUMO sites mediating PML oligomerization and binding partner recruitment, respectively.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Protein composition of PML cages.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Recruitment of nuclear body proteins to PML cages.

In order to evaluate whether formation of PML cages is also induced in a MOI-dependent manner, we performed a series of infection experiments with increasing amounts of IE1-deficient HCMV (MOI of 0.1–10 IEU/cell). Immunofluorescence analysis at 72 hpi revealed that size and signal intensity of PML structures increase at higher MOIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). As individual cells showed considerable variation in number and size of PML foci, we performed ImageJ-based quantification of PML foci and divided them into three groups containing normal sized (perimeter &lt;3 µm), enlarged (perimeter 3–10 µm), or highly enlarged PML-NBs (perimeter &gt;10 µm). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> (MOI 0.1), the total number of PML foci per cell nucleus was increased after low multiplicity infection, resembling effects that were observed in interferon-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chelbi-Alix et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lavau et al., 1995</xref>).

Since strongly enlarged PML foci were found particularly after infection with MOIs greater than 1, which allow lytic replication and viral early/late gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), the question arose whether viral DNA replication is required for their formation. To analyze this, HFF were treated with viral DNA polymerase inhibitor foscarnet (PFA) or were mock treated at 1.5 hr after infection with IE1-deleted HCMV, before being subjected to immunofluorescence staining of PML and UL44 as a marker for replication centers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). Subsequent quantification of PML foci size revealed a slight but significant reduction of highly enlarged PML structures in the presence of PFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).

Since expression of several PML-NB proteins, including Sp100 and PML itself, can be upregulated by IFN treatment, we hypothesized that PML cages may arise due to IFN-mediated increase of PML-NB protein levels during infection with IE1-deleted virus. To assess the role of IFN signaling for formation of PML cages, HFF were incubated with IE1-defective HCMV alone, or treated with an anti-IFNα/β receptor antibody (mAb-IFNAR) prior to virus inoculation. Western blot analysis at 72 hpi revealed considerably higher abundances of all PML and Sp100 variants in comparison to mock infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, lane 1 and 2). Block of IFN signaling by mAb-IFNAR-antibody treatment, which was verified by lack of STAT2 phosphorylation, largely reverted this effect and facilitated virus infection, as reflected by higher levels of viral early and late proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, lane 3). These data correlated with the observation that mAb-IFNAR-antibody treatment resulted in a clear reduction of enlarged PML structures in infected cells, as assessed by immunofluorescence staining and quantification of PML foci size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b and c</xref>). Having observed that IFN signaling plays an important role for the formation of PML cages during infection, we next analyzed whether IFN treatment alone can induce such effects in HFF cells. Treatment of HFF with IFN-β for 3 d or even 6 d resulted in a strong upregulation of all PML and Sp100 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), similar as in cells infected with IE1-deficient HCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In immunofluorescence analysis, we detected an enhanced signal intensity and number of PML-NBs after IFN treatment. However, only few ring-like structures and no strongly enlarged PML cages were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>), suggesting that IFN-based upregulation of PML-NB proteins is not sufficient to induce these structures but that a further stimulus is required which is provided by the virus. Since rearrangements of PML-NBs have recently been linked to cellular DNA damage, we speculated that DNA damage signaling, induced by incoming HCMV DNA, is required in addition to IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imrichova et al., 2019</xref>). To test this, HFF were treated with IFN or were mock treated, and DNA damage was induced by addition of topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) or topoisomerase II inhibitor doxorubicin (Doxo). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>, different PML structures were observed, including small and large PML cages as well as structures termed caps and forks. Intriguingly, while CPT treatment alone for 2d or 4d resulted in small PML structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>, panels 3 and 5) in few cells, co-treatment with IFN evoked also large versions of these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>, panels 4 and 6) with PML cages being present in the majority of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). HFF cells treated with Doxo displayed all types of PML structures without IFN addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>, panel 7). Co-treatment of HFF with Doxo and IFN, however, resulted in a rearrangement of PML-NBs to large cages in &gt;80% of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>, panel 8), similar to the effect observed in HCMVΔIE1-infected cells. Induction of DNA damage in this experimental setup was confirmed by immunostaining of the DNA damage marker γH2AX. While γH2AX foci formed shortly after treatment with CPT and Doxo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>), large PML structures were observed only several days after DNA damage induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>), suggesting that the rearrangement of PML may be a response to long-term DNA damage. In order to investigate whether PML cages form in the proximity of DNA damage sites, HFF cells were treated with Doxo and IFN followed by immunostaining of PML and γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). Quantification of γH2AX-positive PML cages revealed that γH2AX can be detected at approximately 80% of all PML cages indicating a strong association between DNA damage sites and enlarged PML structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). To corroborate this finding, we analyzed whether inhibition of DNA damage signaling affects the formation of PML cages in the context of HCMV infection. For this, HFF cells infected at either low or high MOI with HCMVhIE1, were treated with ATM inhibitor Ku-55933. Quantification of PML foci size at 72 hpi revealed a significant reduction of large PML cages in ATM inhibitor treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k, l</xref>). Importantly, this was also observed under low MOI conditions, where HCMVΔIE1 is not able to initiate viral DNA replication, suggesting that incoming viral genomes are sufficient to trigger DNA damage signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4l</xref>). In summary, this evidence implies that IFN and DNA damage signaling act in a cooperative manner to drive the formation of PML cages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Role of IFN and DNA damage signaling for induction of PML cages.</title><p>(<bold>a–c</bold>) Reduced formation of PML cages in infected cells upon inhibition of the IFN pathway.

To visualize HCMV DNA, we made use of alkyne-modified nucleosides that, after incorporation into viral DNA, can be detected with fluorescent azides by click chemistry in combination with antibody staining. Comparison of the incorporation efficiency of EdC (ethynyl-deoxycytidine), EdU (ethynyl-deoxyuridine), and F-ara-Edu (deoxy-fluoro-ethynyluridine) at different concentrations demonstrated that EdC was slightly more sensitive for detection of HCMV replication centers than EdU and significantly more efficient than F-ara-Edu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The lowest dose of 0.1 µM, which was sufficient to stain viral replication centers, was chosen to generate labeled virus stocks as it had a smaller effect on virus yields compared to higher doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>) and did neither affect viral entry into fibroblasts nor the onset of HCMV gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Since EdC had a lower impact on virus growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>) and resulted in a higher labeling efficiency compared to EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c</xref>, d), subsequent infection of HFF cells was performed with an EdC-labeled IE1-deletion virus termed HCMV∆IE1<sub>Edc</sub>. At 8 hpi, signals of viral DNA (vDNA) were detectable inside cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, panel 1–3), but not observed in cells infected with unlabeled virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, panel 4). Closer investigation of vDNA localization revealed that these signals are frequently associated with slightly enlarged PML foci, which appeared to form a shell around HCMV genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, panels 1 and 2, arrows). These data implied an entrapment of HCMV genomes by PML-NBs that was confirmed by deconvolution and 3D reconstruction of z-series images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Intriguingly, entrapment of HCMV genomes upon low MOI infection was found to be highly efficient when only one genome was present in the cell nucleus but was significantly reduced with increasing number of genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). This was in line with a limited entrapment of viral genomes under higher MOI conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), which indicates saturation of PML-NB-based intrinsic defense and provides an explanation for the MOI-dependent restriction of HCMV IE gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tavalai et al., 2006</xref>). In accordance, nuclear entry of only one genome did not allow IE2 expression in the majority of cells, while the presence of &gt;3 genomes always resulted in initiation of HCMV gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Notably, at higher MOIs, genomes frequently switched from a very condensed state to more irregular and expanded shapes that colocalized with the viral transactivator protein IE2 and are indicative for decompaction and transcriptional activation of HCMV genomes (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, panel 1 with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, panel 1). Analogous results were obtained for wild-type HCMV<sub>EdC</sub>, since low MOI infection resulted in genome entrapment as long as IE1 was not expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, panel 1). Under high MOI conditions, viral genomes were released by IE1-based disruption of PML-NBs and had a more decondensed appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>, panel 2). Finally, we examined whether the PML-NBs that have encased input viral genomes develop into PML cages at late times after infection. Interestingly, input genomes were still detectable at 72 hr after low MOI infection and were exclusively found inside large PML structures, independent of the number of genomes per nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, panel 1). At higher MOI (MOI of 1), viral genomes again displayed a more diffuse staining pattern allowing low level IE2 expression but not formation of viral replication compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, panel 2). Since vDNA signals were found in both small and large PML foci and in addition, not all of the large PML cages contained HCMV genomes, we assume that their enlargement may not be a direct consequence of the entrapment process. Finally, we wanted to know whether entrapped vDNA exhibits an association with DNA damage sites. HFF cells were infected with HCMVΔIE1<sub>EdC</sub> at low MOI followed by staining of vDNA, PML and the DNA damage marker γH2AX at either 8 hpi or 72 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). Quantification revealed that, although a slight decrease of association was observed at late times after infection, the majority of vDNA signals could be detected in the vicinity of DNA damage sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). Taken together, our data provide evidence that genome entrapment by PML-NBs has evolved as a mechanism to achieve efficient and persistent repression of HCMV. Reorganization from dot-like foci to PML cages, however, may not be directly linked to vDNA entrapment but seems to require an additional stimulus.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Entrapment of HCMV input genomes by PML cages.</title><p>HFF were infected with EdC-labeled (HCMVΔIE1<sub>EdC</sub>) and unlabeled HCMVΔIE1 or respective wild-type viruses (HCMV<sub>EdC</sub>, HCMV), which are all based on strain AD169.

In line with this, we detected the chromosomal DNA-binding protein HP1α (heterochromatin protein 1 alpha) at PML cages, which is involved in establishing a stable heterochromatic structure and is usually excluded from replication centers during wild-type HCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Since Sp100 was described to interact with HP1 proteins, we analyzed the distribution of HP1α in Sp100-depleted cells after HCMV∆IE1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seeler et al., 1998</xref>). Indeed, no colocalization with PML cages was observed in absence of Sp100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, panel 2), whereas knockdown of Daxx did not abolish HP1α recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, panel 3). To get further evidence for an antiviral function of PML cages, we tested whether disruption of PML cages can abrogate the repression of entrapped genomes and promote lytic infection. Lentiviral expression of IE1 was used to disrupt PML cages in cells that had been infected with HCMV∆IE1 for 72 hr, resulting in a nuclear diffuse distribution of PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, panel 1 and 2). Intriguingly, disruption of PML cages by IE1 led to an increase of intracellular viral DNA, thus demonstrating a positive effect on HCMV DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Since the efficiency of lentiviral transduction, as assessed by quantification of IE1-expressing cells, correlated with the expression of the HCMV early gene UL44, we conclude that IE1 induces a full relieve of PML-based transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). To exclude that this effect was based on STAT2 binding and inhibition of IFN signaling by IE1, HCMV∆IE1-infected cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing the IE1 core region (IE1 1–382), which contains the PML-binding domain but lacks the STAT-binding region. Consistent with published data, IE1 1–382 did not induce a complete disruption of PML structures, but colocalized with PML at residual foci that have no antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, panel 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scherer et al., 2014</xref>).

This was supported by the finding that major capsid protein MCP displayed a clearly altered localization in cells infected with HCMV∆IE1 in comparison to wild-type HCMV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Since MCP was enriched in PML cages during HCMV∆IE1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, panel 2), we applied correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) to investigate whether viral capsid proteins or whole nucleocapsids are sequestered by PML. For this purpose, HFF cells expressing mCherry-tagged PML were established by lentiviral transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and infected with recombinant HCMV encoding eYFP-tagged IE2, which enabled us to allocate PML-positive and infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wagenknecht et al., 2015</xref>). After light microscopy (LM) imaging, cells were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) followed by correlation of LM and TEM images. Analysis of cells with high mCherry-PML expression revealed that PML assembles to multi-layered, fibrous structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). After infection with HCMV-IE2eYFP, PML aggregates were completely dispersed and, in accordance, no fiber-like structures were detected in EM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). While these cells showed an even distribution of viral capsids throughout the cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), we observed unusual accumulations of capsids after infection with IE1-deficient HCMV (HCMV∆IE1-IE2eYFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). The capsid clusters were surrounded by several layers of PML fibers and correlated with mCherry-PML signals in LM images, clearly demonstrating an entrapment of HCMV capsids by PML cages. Similar capsid accumulations were detected in non-transduced HFF after infection with IE1-deficient viruses based on strain TB40E or AD169, suggesting a virus strain-independent entrapment by endogenous PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). To characterize the capsid packing in more detail, we performed 3D imaging of mCherry-PML- and IE2-eYFP-positive cells by focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) with TEM-like resolution. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, we analyzed three consecutive areas within a cell nucleus by FIB-SEM tomography, containing four PML cages in total (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Similar to the TEM analysis, PML cages appeared as spherical, fibrous structures encasing tightly packed nuclear capsids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, panels A and C) and, in some cases, additional electron-dense material likely composed of viral DNA or protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>, panel B). 3D reconstruction of a PML cage containing exclusively capsids identified 366 capsids in an inner cage volume of 0.31 µm<sup>3</sup>, so that a high packing density of about 1,180 nuclear capsids/µm<sup>3</sup> can be estimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

The general interest in PML-NBs originated from the tight link between PML-NB integrity and several pathological conditions such as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), neurodegenerative diseases as well as viral infections, and resulted in a large number of publications implicating PML-NBs in diverse cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tavalai and Stamminger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grimwade and Solomon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yasuda et al., 1999</xref>). These different biochemical activities likely arise from the high number of PML-associated proteins as well as the dynamic nature of PML-NBs, which differ in composition, number, size, and position depending on the cellular state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eskiw et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weidtkamp-Peters et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we describe unusually large PML-NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), referred to as PML cages, which have the capacity to entrap both parental viral genomes and newly assembled viral capsids thus contributing to the restriction of human cytomegalovirus infection. Concerning biogenesis and composition, PML cages are similar to normal PML-NBs, as the PML protein functions as a key regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) that recruits all other main components with the only exception of ATRX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Under physiological conditions, ATRX is recruited to PML-NBs via an interaction with the Daxx protein in order to form a chromatin remodeling complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). Upon HCMV infection, Daxx is initially targeted for degradation by the viral tegument protein pp71; however, it re-accumulates at later stages of infection and can be detected at PML cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saffert and Kalejta, 2006</xref>). Since several interaction partners of Daxx, including ATRX, have been shown to bind in a mutually exclusive manner, the absence of ATRX from PML cages may indicate an altered regulation of Daxx during HCMV infection that leads to a switch of interaction partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the main PML-NB components, we found heterochromatin protein HP1α localizing to PML cages and being recruited by Sp100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>), which is in line with a previously described interaction between these two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seeler et al., 1998</xref>). The presence of HP1α has also been observed for giant PML bodies in lymphocytes of patients suffering from the ICF syndrome. This PML structure contains a core of cellular satellite DNA, which is present in a hypomethylated and decondensed state in ICF, and therefore suggests a role of PML-NBs in the establishment of condensed heterochomatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luciani et al., 2006</xref>). However, while HP1 proteins localize to the center of the PML body and are surrounded by concentric layers of other PML-NB components, all proteins detected at HCMV-induced PML cages colocalize at the rim thus suggesting subtle differences in the architecture of giant PML-NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6a</xref>). Several further reports on the formation of enlarged PML-NBs can be found in literature, for instance as alternative lengthening of telomers (ALT)-associated PML-NBs in telomerase-negative tumor cells, in cells quiescently infected with HSV-1, and during infection with BK virus or Merkel cell polyomavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Everett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yeager et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neumann et al., 2016</xref>). The molecular basis for their formation, however, is far from being understood. Since during HCMV infection, the immediate-early protein IE1 functions as inhibitor of interferon (IFN) signaling, we hypothesized that the drastic enlargement of PML-NBs after infection with IE1-deficient HCMV results from IFN-mediated upregulation of PML-NB proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paulus et al., 2006</xref>). This would also fit to the observation that PML cages preferentially appear after infection with high doses of IE1-deficient HCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c</xref>). Indeed, block of the IFN pathway reduces the formation of PML cages suggesting an important role of IFN in the development of these structures and corroborating the previous finding that IFN signaling enhances the antiviral activity of restriction factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakuma et al., 2007</xref>). However, this effect is not just due to increased protein amounts, as overexpression of PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) or stimulation of PML-NB protein expression by IFN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–f</xref>) is not sufficient to induce PML cages. Our data reveal that induction of a DNA damage response is required as an additional stimulus in HFF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g and h</xref>). While most studies that implicate PML-NBs in the DNA damage response have focused on acute cellular DNA damage, very recent data postulate a role in the repair of persistent DNA damage and even show an association of circular PML structures with such DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imrichova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vancurova et al., 2019</xref>). These PML structures occur after prolonged treatment with DNA damage-inducing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Imrichova et al., 2019</xref>), which fits to our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>) and also to the slow kinetics of PML cages biogenesis in HCMVΔIE1-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Therefore, it appears likely that PML cages form as a response to continuous interferon and DNA damage signaling during HCMVΔIE1 infection, initiated by incoming viral DNA and enhanced by viral DNA replication, leading to a further enlargement of PML spheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). The requirement of DNA damage signaling for formation of PML cages is supported by our observations that PML cages exhibit a strong association with markers of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i, j</xref>) and treatment of HCMVΔIE1 infected cells with an ATM inhibitor significantly reduces the number of giant PML-NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k, l</xref>). Of note, IFN signaling was also found to be upregulated in an animal model of ICF syndrome suggesting that dual signaling via the interferon and DNA damage response may constitute a common mechanism whereby entrapment by giant PML nuclear bodies is triggered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajshekar et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>As a major finding, our data provide evidence that PML can enclose both input viral genomes and newly assembled nuclear capsids, which are distinguishable activities occurring at different times of HCMV infection. To study the association of PML cages with incoming HCMV genomes, we made use of alkyne-modified deoxynucleosides that allow DNA visualization without denaturation and have been successfully utilized to detect adenovirus, vaccinia virus, and herpesvirus DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Concerning sensitivity and impact on virus growth, we found that EdC is most suitable for generation of labeled HCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2a</xref>), although EdU and F-ara-EdU have been reported to be incorporated with higher efficiency in short-pulse experiments or being more sensitive for detection of cellular DNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manska et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neef and Luedtke, 2011</xref>). EdC labeling efficiency of HCMV DNA was determined by costaining of vDNA with tegument protein pp150, serving as a proxy for viral capsids, and was calculated to reach at least 70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c, d</xref>). Visualization of invading HCMV and HCMVΔIE1 genomes at immediate-early times of infection revealed an entrapment of viral DNA (vDNA) in slightly enlarged PML-NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–e</xref>), which is highly efficient in cell nuclei containing only one HCMV genome but significantly reduced with increasing number of viral genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a, c</xref>). Thus, our data provide an explanation for the fact that PML-NB-based restriction of HCMV gene expression can only be observed under low MOI conditions and underline the importance of IE1 for initiation of lytic replication at low MOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tavalai et al., 2006</xref>). A similar MOI-dependent envelopment of viral genomes has recently been described for HSV-1 DNA upon nuclear entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alandijany et al., 2018</xref>). Compared to our data on HCMVΔIE1, there appears to be a higher degree of PML-vDNA colocalization indicating a more efficient genome entrapment. However, in contrast to HSV-1, genome entrapment by PML-NBs may already be antagonized prior to de novo viral gene expression by the HCMV tegument protein pp71, which has been shown to disperse ATRX and induce degradation of Daxx. In fact, this scenario is supported by a reduced frequency of PML colocalization with HSV-1 genomes in ATRX-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alandijany et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, HCMVΔIE1 input genomes remain associated with PML-NBs and can still be detected in a condensed state at the inner rim of PML cages at 3 days after low multiplicity infection (MOI = 0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Although PML cages cannot completely silence HCMV transcription at higher MOIs (MOI = 1), as suggested by genome decondensation and IE2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), our data demonstrate a repressive activity because PML disruption under these conditions results in full transcriptional recovery and promotes viral genome replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c–e</xref>).</p><p>As an independent antiviral activity, PML cages are positioned next to viral replication centers and entrap newly assembled viral capsids. By correlative light and electron microscopy (TEM and FIB-SEM tomography), we identify PML cages as circular clusters of viral capsids that are enveloped by PML fibers and occur after high MOI infection with HCMVΔIE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c–e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>), but not wild-type HCMV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2S</xref>). This gives ground to assume that, after initial disruption of PML-NBs, IE1 remains bound to PML in order to antagonize capsid entrapment at late stages of HCMV infection and may explain the metabolic stability of the immediate-early protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scherer et al., 2016</xref>). The question remains of how HCMV genomes and capsids are sensed and entrapped by PML cages. The fact that PML cages form in absence of viral DNA replication implies a formation or incorporation of viral capsids in pre-assembled PML structures rather than an active envelopment of nuclear capsids by PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e, f</xref>). A similar sequestration of viral capsids by PML cages has been found in cells infected with varicella-zoster virus (VZV) by immuno-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reichelt et al., 2011</xref>). However, a unique C-terminal domain in PML isoform IV is required for both VZV capsid binding and antiviral activity, whereas our data show an isoform-independent formation of PML cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This suggests a requirement of the common N-terminal TRIM region for HCMV restriction and correlates with a previously demonstrated anti-HCMV activity of the shortest, nuclear PML isoform VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tavalai et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we show a multilayered antiviral role of PML-NBs during HCMV infection, which is based on an entrapment mechanism likely leading to a more efficient inhibition or immobilization of viral components. Since the restriction activity of PML at immediate-early times is overcome by high virus doses, entrapment of nuclear capsids may have evolved as an additional line of defense in late infected cells, however, both antiviral strategies are efficiently antagonized by IE1 during wild-type HCMV infection. With regard to previous reports of sequestration events during HSV-1 and VZV infection, we conclude that entrapment of viral components by PML-NBs serves as general mechanism to inhibit herpesviral infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Human cytomegalovirus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AD169</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hobom et al., J.

HFF expressing FLAG-tagged PML isoforms or mCherry-tagged PML were cultured in the presence of 500 μg/ml geneticin (InvivoGen) and 10% FCS, which induced sufficient expression of mCherry-PML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To determine titers of AD169 and TB40E-IE2eYFP, HFF were infected with serial dilutions of virus supernatants and, after 24 hr of incubation, cells were fixed and stained for IE1. Subsequently, the number of IE1-positive cells was determined, and viral titers were calculated (IE units/ml). IE1-deleted/mutated viruses were titrated via determination of genome equivalents in infected cells. For this, HFF cells were infected with various dilutions of wild-type and recombinant viruses. Sixteen hr later, viral and cellular DNA was extracted from infected cells using the DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to quantitative real-time PCR of HCMV gB and cellular albumin as described below. Since infection of HFF cells with equivalent genome copy numbers of wild-type and IE1-deficient HCMV resulted in comparable levels of IE protein IE2p86, MOIs are indicated in IE units per cell (IEU/cell) for all viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scherer et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>For infection experiments, HFF were seeded into six-well dishes at a density of 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marina Lusic (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that your work is highly interesting, but also agreed on the necessity to address the question of DNA damage involvement in the formation of PML cages in the context of HCMV infection. In addition, they all noted that quantifications are necessary for proper interpretation of the data, specifically quantitation of input genomes and statistical population analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The formation of giant PML bodies in response to IE1 deficient HCMV infection is well supported by the compelling microscopy data showing the entrapment of viral genomes within these structures. The aspects related to the importance of viral titer are very interesting, as it seems that these structures are efficiently entrapping viral genomes (as well as viral capsids at different time points) only at the lower MOIs.</p><p>However, judging from the title, the authors might have aimed at showing that IFN signaling and DNA damage play an important role in formation of these cages, as they can be created in cells even in the absence of viral infection. Although their data do suggest that IFN signaling together with DNA damage response plays a perhaps more important role in the initiation of PML accumulation, these observations were not further exploited and some additional controls could allow for a better understanding of the underlying mechanism.</p><p>The authors treat HFF with campthotecin or doxyrubicin (inhibitor of TopoI), but do not show any proof of DNA damage. A staining with γH2AX (or TP53BP1) would be helpful to understand if these bodies are formed in the proximity of DNA damage sites.</p><p>Another point that I found would be very interesting to address is the turnover of PML within the CAGE like structures. Are these giant PML bodies susceptible to arsenic trioxide degradation? Arsenic has a well documented role in PML turnover and degradation, and is also used as therapeutic agent in treatment of APL. Moreover, it has also been used in clinical trials for the treatment of HTLV, as well as of HIV-1. It would therefore be very interesting to see if the PML can be degraded by arsenic withing these CAGE like structures, and if this has a relevance for viral reactivation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This reviewer recognises the strength of this submission and its contribution to the field. The points below aim to strengthen the study further to provide greater clarity and context to a non-specialist reader.</p><p>1. The authors should demonstrate the percentage of viral genomes labelled in their HCMV.EdC virion stock. Based on analogous data derived from HSV-1 (Alandijani et al., 2018), EdC genome labelling efficiency within any given stock of particles can vary. Thus, there may be a significant population of unlabelled HCMV genomes within infected cells that are undetectable by click chemistry. This population should be quantified and presented as supplemental data, as this population of unlabelled genomes may significantly influence the impact and interpretation of data and statements presented in the manuscript. For example lines 271 to 276, 'However, by far not all PML cages contained HCMV genomes suggesting that their enlargement is not a direct consequence of the entrapment process. Taken together, out data provide evidence that genome entrapment by PML-NBs has evolved as a mechanism to achieve efficient and persistent repression of HCMV. Reorganization from dot-like foci to PML cages, however, cannot be directly linked to vDNA entrapment but seems to result from a more general stimulus'.</p><p>This statement holds true if 90-100% of genomes delivered to the nucleus are detectable by click chemistry. However, if the percentage of genomes labelled is {less than or equal to} 90%, then the authors cannot make this conclusion, as vDNA undetectable by click chemistry may contribute to the phenotypes they observe. Similarly, the authors should make attempts to quantify the precise genome load delivered to cells at the indicated multiplicities of infection used (currently derived from FFU titration). HCMV virus preparations are well established to have a high genome to PFU ratios. Accurate quantitation will provide greater context to non-specialists as to what low or high MOI means by providing absolute numbers for the indicated MOI.</p><p>2. One of the driving conclusions presented by the authors is the requirement for the DDR pathway to be activated to form PML-cages. While the authors present compelling data for this in the context of drug induced DNA damage on uninfected cells (Figure 4g), the authors fail to make the same connection during HCMV infection. The authors should examine the localization of PML-cages induced during deltaIE1-HCMV infection to that of γ-H2Ax, a marker of DNA damage. If their hypothesis holds true, PML-cages should localize in proximity to sites of cellular chromatin damage, thereby providing supporting evidence to one of the papers major conclusions. Alternatively, the authors should investigate the influence of DDR inhibitors (e.g. ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs inhibitors) on the frequency PML-cage formation to provide the supporting evidence required to make this conclusion stand during HCMV infection. Correspondingly, if vDNA replication is not required for PML-cage assembly, when is the DDR pathway activated during HCMV infection to promote PML-cage assembly?</p><p>3. The manuscript lacks detailed quantitation in its image analysis. While some experiments are quantified, many of the figures (e.g. figures 1 and 2) only show representative images. This makes it hard for the reader to determine the relative population of cells that induce the assembly of PML-cages within any given population of infected cells. Is this phenotype rare or frequent within infected cells? It is recommended that all immunostaining experiments are quantified for readership clarity over a minimum of three independent biological replicates (see below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A. Major items to be addressed</p><p>General:</p><p>– The reviewer would suggest, to strengthen the physiological relevance of the formation of the PML cages around HCMV genomes and capsids, to perform, if possible, some of the experiments in bone marrow CD34+ cells and/or THP1 cells (already used by the team as HCMV model of latency in previous studies). This, to reviewer's view, could improve significantly, and beyond the molecular aspects, the understanding of the role of the PML NBs in the control of HCMV infection and their role in the establishment of latency and abortive productive infection through the formation of PML cages.</p><p>– l446-448: In the discussion the authors state: &quot;The fact that PML cages form in absence of viral DNA replication implies a formation or incorporation of viral capsids in pre-assembled PML structures rather than an active envelopment of nuclear capsids by PML (Figure 3e, f). » This sentence mingles two aspects of the study: (1) The formation of PML cages around incoming viral genomes; and (2) the formation of PML cages containing viral capsids. To reviewer's opinion the statement, as written, does not consider the phase separation properties of the PML protein (Banani et al., 2016), and for reviews see (Lallemand-Breitenbach and Thé, 2018; Corpet et al., 2020), and the fact that 90% of PML protein is not associated with PML NBs, and has a diffuse nuclear localization (see Lallemand-Breitenbach and Thé, 2010) and/or participating to chromatin dynamics (for a review see Delbarre and Janicki, 2021). The reviewer would suggest to clarify this statement, which is, to reviewer's opinion, misleading on the real capacity of PML NBs to form de novo around genome loci (see Everett and Murray. ND10 Components Relocate to Sites Associated with Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Nucleoprotein Complexes during Virus Infection, JVI, 2005, 10.1128/jvi.79.8.5078-5089.2005), and/or viral capsids. May be the authors should consider the most likely possibility that it could exist different mechanisms for the formation of PML cages entrapping incoming viral genomes, and PML cages entrapping capsids.</p><p>References</p><p>Banani SF, Rice AM, Peeples WB, Lin Y, Jain S, Parker R and Rosen MK (2016) Compositional Control of Phase-Separated Cellular Bodies.

The requirement of IFN signaling for the formation of PML cages in HCMV-infected cells is clearly shown. However, it is not clear in reviewer's mind how DNA damage provoked by the injection of viral genomes in the nucleus is required to lead to the formation of PML cages specifically around the viral genomes. Does the authors infer that viral genomes themselves would sustain damage that would lead to aggregation of PML around those viral genomes? To reviewer's view the requirement of DNA damage for the formation of PML cages specifically around HCMV genome is not definitively proven. The reviewer would suggest to the authors to perform a γ-H2A.X and PML staining together with click chemistry for the visualization of the genomes at different times post infection to see if PML cages-entrapped viral genomes could at a particular stage of the entry in the nucleus be associated with DNA damage. This could then strengthen the discussion about that aspect.</p><p>B. Other</p><p>Specific</p><p>– What is the fate of the capsids that are entrapped in the PML cages? Are they degraded? Do their remain as an abortive, latency-prone, productive infection? Although the reviewer acknowledges the fact that performing such experiments is beyond the scoop of this study, the reviewer would be grateful to the authors to have their feedback on that question. May be this thought could be part of the discussion.</p><p>– During infection of cells supporting HCMV latency what is the status of IE1 expression? In other words, does it exist a physiological situation of infection by HCMV where IE1 cannot be produced, and consequently cannot induce the dispersal of PML NBs? This should be discussed.</p><p>– Figure 4g: Could the caps and/or forks in non-infected cells be associated to nucleoli or specific chromosome loci?</p><p>- Figure 6c,d,e: The impact of IE1 expression on the abrogation of HCMV repression leads to the increase of viral genomes and to the expression of at least UL44. IF data to visualize UL44 as a marker of the viral replication compartments and/or MCP for capsids in IE1 expressing cells should be provided in addition to the quantification data.</p><p>– Figure 6 f and g – The low resolution of the pdf combined to the size of the images make it difficult to conclude anything on the disruption of the APB by IE1. TRF1 is hardly visible in figure 6f. In addition the reviewer would recommend to provide a TRF1 and IE1 staining in figure 6g in addition to the PML/IE1. Indeed, APB are formed by the grouping of several telomeres in the APBs visualized by IF by larger spots of TRF1 (Jiang et al., 2007). It would be interesting to see if those larger spots disappear in IE1-expressing cells.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Jiang W-Q, Zhong Z-H, Henson JD and Reddel RR (2007) Identification of candidate alternative lengthening of telomeres genes by methionine restriction and RNA interference.

The presence of HP1 in the PML cages could suggest an interaction of HP1 with viral chromatin with nucleosomes containing histone H3 modified on lysine K9 by tri-methylation, for which HP1 is a reader. Could the authors comment on that aspect? Specifically regarding the de novo formation of PML cages around viral genomes by opposition to the relocation of pre-existing PML NBs on incoming viral genomes.</p><p>– Although the entrapment of capsids in PML cages is well investigated the question remains to know if the capsids could contain viral genomes or not.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73006.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The formation of giant PML bodies in response to IE1 deficient HCMV infection is well supported by the compelling microscopy data showing the entrapment of viral genomes within these structures.

We tried several times to quantify the labeling efficiency of HCMV genomes as described by <italic>Alandijany et al., 2018,</italic> for herpes simplex virus. However, it turned out that, most probably due to differences in the stability between HCMV and HSV-1 capsids, partial denaturation with 2 M GuHCl does not lead to an ordered release of HCMV vDNA. Thus, we were not able to use this technique for the assessment of vDNA labelling efficiency. Alternatively, we used a method as developed by Christian Sinzger and colleagues (Sinzger et al., J.Gen.Virol. 2007): this method uses pp150 staining as a proxy for capsid localization at the nuclear rim correlating to capsids that have released viral DNA into the nucleus. Pp150 signals located at cell nuclei as well as viral DNA signals in the same nuclei were counted in order to calculate the EdU/EdC labelling efficiency (see Figure 5—figure supplement 2 c, d). From this, we conclude that the EdC labelling efficiency of HCMV DNA is at least 70% (Figure 5—figure supplement 2 d). Although we agree with reviewer #1 that this may lead to a slight underestimation of the number of PML cages associated with vDNA, we still think that our assumption that enlargement is not a direct consequence of the entrapment process holds true due to the facts that vDNA signals were found in both small and large PML foci and, in addition, not all of the large PML cages contained HCMV genomes (see lines 283 – 285).</p><p>Furthermore, we agree with reviewer #1 that HCMV virus preparations have a high genome to PFU ratio. This is even aggravated in nucleoside labelling experiments of viral genomes due the necessary purification procedure. Figure 5—figure supplement 2, panel b, shows the quantification of viral genomes in supernatants and infected cells (nuclei and cytoplasm) in relation to immediate-early units (IEUs). According to this quantification, the ratio between intracellular genome equivalents and IEUs was 55. However, the exact quantification of genomes delivered to nuclei is difficult since many genomes as detected by qPCR in infected cells (see Figure 5—figure supplement 2) do not reach the nucleus. By counting vDNA signals of cells infected at an MOI of 0.1 we calculated that this results, on average, in 1.2 viral genomes/cell (Figure 5—figure supplement 2, panel c). However, we anticipate that this value may not only depend on the used virus stock but also on cellular factors (for instance, on the passage number of primary fibroblasts; e.g. HFFs stably expressing individual PML isoforms may vary in their passage number due to the necessary selection procedure). For this reason, we think that accurate quantification is only valid if done for a specific experimental condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The authors should examine the localization of PML-cages induced during deltaIE1-HCMV infection to that of γ-H2Ax, a marker of DNA damage. If their hypothesis holds true, PML-cages should localize in proximity to sites of cellular chromatin damage, thereby providing supporting evidence to one of the papers major conclusions. Alternatively, the authors should investigate the influence of DDR inhibitors (e.g. ATM, ATR, and DNA-PKcs inhibitors) on the frequency PML-cage formation to provide the supporting evidence required to make this conclusion stand during HCMV infection. Correspondingly, if vDNA replication is not required for PML-cage assembly, when is the DDR pathway activated during HCMV infection to promote PML-cage assembly?</p></disp-quote><p>Our response:</p><p>We have performed the suggested experiments:</p><p>– Figures 4i and j show that PML cages co-localize with γH2AX in IFN/Dox-treated non-infected HFFs;</p><p>– Figures 5g and h demonstrate an association of entrapped vDNA with DNA damage sites after infection with HCMVΔhIE1;</p><p>– Figures 4k and l show that treatment of HCMVΔhIE1-infected cells with the ATM inhibitor Ku55933 results in a statistically significant reduction of enlarged PML cages. Since this could be detected both after high (viral DNA replication is initiated) and low MOI infection (no viral DNA replication occurs), we conclude that incoming viral genomes are sufficient to trigger DNA damage signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The manuscript lacks detailed quantitation in its image analysis. While some experiments are quantified, many of the figures (e.g. figures 1 and 2) only show representative images. This makes it hard for the reader to determine the relative population of cells that induce the assembly of PML-cages within any given population of infected cells. Is this phenotype rare or frequent within infected cells? It is recommended that all immunostaining experiments are quantified for readership clarity over a minimum of three independent biological replicates (see below).</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed detailed quantifications over at least three independent biological replicates for the experiments of Figures: 1 (see panel b); 3 (see panels b and f); 4 (see panels f, h, j, k and l); 5 (see panels a, d and h); 6 (see panels d and e), Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A. Major items to be addressed</p><p>General:</p><p>– The reviewer would suggest, to strengthen the physiological relevance of the formation of the PML cages around HCMV genomes and capsids, to perform, if possible, some of the experiments in bone marrow CD34+ cells and/or THP1 cells (already used by the team as HCMV model of latency in previous studies). This, to reviewer's view, could improve significantly, and beyond the molecular aspects, the understanding of the role of the PML NBs in the control of HCMV infection and their role in the establishment of latency and abortive productive infection through the formation of PML cages.</p></disp-quote><p>As already stated above, we have previously shown that THP1 cells with an shRNA instituted knockdown of PML do not exhibit a defect concerning the establishment of HCMV latency (Wagenknecht et al., Viruses 2015). Thus, we assume that cellular repressors different from PML-NBs are decisive for HCMV latency establishment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– l446-448: In the discussion the authors state: &quot;The fact that PML cages form in absence of viral DNA replication implies a formation or incorporation of viral capsids in pre-assembled PML structures rather than an active envelopment of nuclear capsids by PML (Figure 3e, f). » This sentence mingles two aspects of the study : (1) The formation of PML cages around incoming viral genomes; and (2) the formation of PML cages containing viral capsids. To reviewer's opinion the statement, as written, does not consider the phase separation properties of the PML protein (Banani et al., 2016), and for reviews see (Lallemand-Breitenbach and Thé, 2018; Corpet et al., 2020), and the fact that 90% of PML protein is not associated with PML NBs, and has a diffuse nuclear localization (see Lallemand-Breitenbach and Thé, 2010) and/or participating to chromatin dynamics (for a review see Delbarre and Janicki, 2021). The reviewer would suggest to clarify this statement, which is, to reviewer's opinion, misleading on the real capacity of PML NBs to form de novo around genome loci (see Everett and Murray. ND10 Components Relocate to Sites Associated with Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Nucleoprotein Complexes during Virus Infection, JVI, 2005, 10.1128/jvi.79.8.5078-5089.2005), and/or viral capsids. May be the authors should consider the most likely possibility that it could exist different mechanisms for the formation of PML cages entrapping incoming viral genomes, and PML cages entrapping capsids.</p><p>References</p><p>Banani SF, Rice AM, Peeples WB, Lin Y, Jain S, Parker R and Rosen MK (2016) Compositional Control of Phase-Separated Cellular Bodies.

We do not intend to mingle “formation of PML cages around incoming viral genomes” and “formation of PML cages containing viral capsids”. As defined on page 6 of the manuscript the term PML cages is exclusively reserved for enlarged, ring-like PML structures that develop during the late phase of infection. However, we noticed that in some sentences the term PML cages was used, however, instead, PML-NBs were meant. This has been corrected in the revised manuscript. Entrapment of incoming viral genomes as described by Everett and Murray is due to PML-NBs and not due to PML cages. The statement of the Discussion &quot;The fact that PML cages form in absence of viral DNA replication implies a formation or incorporation of viral capsids in pre-assembled PML structures rather than an active envelopment of nuclear capsids by PML” only refers to enlarged PML ring structures surrounding viral capsids. The statement should indicate that PML cages form in the absence of viral capsids. One potential interpretation is that ring-like PML cages are present in a pre-assembled form and subsequently associate with capsids. The statement does not exclude other mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific</p><p>– The reviewer acknowledges the importance of IFN signaling and DNA damage for the formation of PML cages, caps or forks in non-infected cells. The requirement of IFN signaling for the formation of PML cages in HCMV-infected cells is clearly shown. However, it is not clear in reviewer's mind how DNA damage provoked by the injection of viral genomes in the nucleus is required to lead to the formation of PML cages specifically around the viral genomes. Does the authors infer that viral genomes themselves would sustain damage that would lead to aggregation of PML around those viral genomes? To reviewer's view the requirement of DNA damage for the formation of PML cages specifically around HCMV genome is not definitively proven. The reviewer would suggest to the authors to perform a γ-H2A.X and PML staining together with click chemistry for the visualization of the genomes at different times post infection to see if PML cages-entrapped viral genomes could at a particular stage of the entry in the nucleus be associated with DNA damage. This could then strengthen the discussion about that aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>As already stated in our response to issues raised by reviewers #1 and #2, we have performed co-staining of vDNA with γH2AX at 8 and 72 hpi (see Figure 5g and h of revised manuscript).

Other</p><p>Specific</p><p>– What is the fate of the capsids that are entrapped in the PML cages? Are they degraded? Do their remain as an abortive, latency-prone, productive infection? Although the reviewer acknowledges the fact that performing such experiments is beyond the scoop of this study, the reviewer would be grateful to the authors to have their feedback on that question. May be this thought could be part of the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer #3 that a final answer to this question will require further experimentation. However, since we observed that IE1 expression disrupts PML cages and this correlates with an increase of viral genomes and gene expression, we would assume that PML cage disruption might also result in a release of entrapped capsids (see Figure 6d and e).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– During infection of cells supporting HCMV latency what is the status of IE1 expression? In other words, does it exist a physiological situation of infection by HCMV where IE1 cannot be produced, and consequently cannot induce the dispersal of PML NBs? This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Many authors define HCMV latency as a status of transcriptional silencing of the HCMV MIE locus (e.g. reviewed in Dooley and O’Connor, Pathogens 2020). Consequently, IE1 is not expressed during latency. However, since our paper does not address the role of PML-NBs during latency, we do not want to include this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4g: Could the caps and/or forks in non-infected cells be associated to nucleoli or specific chromosome loci?</p></disp-quote><p>Since previous publications reported on PML protein nucleolar associations upon DNA damage induced senescence it is possible that at least some of the enlarged PML structures could be located at nucleoli (Imrichova et al., Aging 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 6c,d,e: The impact of IE1 expression on the abrogation of HCMV repression leads to the increase of viral genomes and to the expression of at least UL44.

Indeed, APB are formed by the grouping of several telomeres in the APBs visualized by IF by larger spots of TRF1 (Jiang et al., 2007). It would be interesting to see if those larger spots disappear in IE1-expressing cells.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Jiang W-Q, Zhong Z-H, Henson JD and Reddel RR (2007) Identification of candidate alternative lengthening of telomeres genes by methionine restriction and RNA interference.

The presence of HP1 in the PML cages could suggest an interaction of HP1 with viral chromatin with nucleosomes containing histone H3 modified on lysine K9 by tri-methylation, for which HP1 is a reader. Could the authors comment on that aspect? Specifically regarding the de novo formation of PML cages around viral genomes by opposition to the relocation of pre-existing PML NBs on incoming viral genomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We would assume that HP1 contributes to HCMV genome repression.

Concerning the question of de novo formation of PML cages versus relocation of pre-exisiting PML-NBs on incoming viral genomes: we already clarified above that Everett and Murray convincingly demonstrated the de novo formation of PML-NBs on incoming viral genomes. PML cages, however, only form late during infection and may represent pre-existing structures to associate with viral capsids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Although the entrapment of capsids in PML cages is well investigated the question remains to know if the capsids could contain viral genomes or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer #3 that this is an open question that we plan to address in future experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
