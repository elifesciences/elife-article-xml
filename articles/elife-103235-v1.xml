during classroom learning. However, traditional paradigms used to evaluate attention do not capture the complexity and dynamic nature of real-life classrooms. Using a novel virtual reality platform, coupled with measurement of neural activity, eye-gaze, and skin conductance, here we studied the neurophysiological manifestations of attention and distractibility, under realistic learning conditions. Individuals with AD(H)D exhibited higher neural responses to irrelevant sounds and reduced speech tracking of the teacher, relative to controls. Additional neurophysiological measures, such the power of alpha-oscillations and frequency of gaze-shifts away from the teacher, contributed to explaining variance in self-reported AD(H)D symptoms across the sample. These ecologically valid findings provide critical insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying individual differences in the capacity for sustained attention and the proneness to distraction and mind-wandering, experienced in real-life situations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>virtual reality</kwd><kwd>eye tracking</kwd><kwd>speech processing</kwd><kwd>ADHD</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006221</institution-id><institution>United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schweitzer</surname><given-names>Julie B</given-names></name><name><surname>Zion Golumbic</surname><given-names>Elana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2339/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zion Golumbic</surname><given-names>Elana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH135266-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schweitzer</surname><given-names>Julie B</given-names></name><name><surname>Zion Golumbic</surname><given-names>Elana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R33MH110043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schweitzer</surname><given-names>Julie B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neural and gaze-based metrics provide novel insights into individual differences in attention and distractability in a simulated classroom.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many people find it difficult to maintain attention to a frontal classroom lecture. Doing so requires listening, processing, and comprehending the teacher’s speech over a prolonged period of time, while avoiding distraction from both irrelevant background sounds and internal mind-wandering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Smallwood et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Szpunar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Thomson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Esterman and Rothlein, 2019</xref>). This task is supposedly even more difficult for individuals diagnosed with attention-deficit disorder or attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (referred to jointly as AD(H)D), which is often characterized by increase proneness to distraction and mind-wandering and poorer sustained attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Avisar and Shalev, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berger and Cassuto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Merrill et al., 2022</xref>). Unsurprisingly perhaps, individuals are most likely to seek clinical help as a result of attentional difficulties experienced in school contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Litner, 2003</xref>), and there is a tight link between attention performance and learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Loe and Feldman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gray et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>However, current clinical and scientific tools used for evaluating and quantifying the constructs of ‘distractibility’ and ‘inattention’ are greatly removed from the real-life experience in organic classrooms and other ecological contexts. Commonly used approaches either rely on subjective self-report (e.g., rating scales), or are based on highly artificial computerized tests, such as Continuous Performance Tests (CPT). Unfortunately, in recent years, there is a growing understanding that these tools lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably capture the type and severity of real-life attention challenges that people face outside the lab or the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rabiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Narad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Murray et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mulraney et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hobbiss and Lavie, 2024</xref>).</p><p>In attempt to create laboratory-based tasks that are more ecologically valid, and better capture the type of attentional challenges faced in real-life, recent years have seen increased use of virtual reality (VR) in cognitive research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Parsons, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Seesjärvi et al., 2022</xref>). In particular, VR classrooms have been used to test different aspects of cognitive performance and distraction by ecologically valid stimuli. For example, it has been suggested that CPT tasks administered in VR classroom environments show greater sensitivity for AD(H)D classification relative to standard evaluations and can provide more refined measures of attention and distractibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Rizzo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Neguț et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Coleman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Parsons et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stokes et al., 2022</xref>). However, to date, most VR classroom studies still use relatively non-ecological tasks, and rely primarily on indirect behavioral outcomes to assess aspects of attentional performance. To improve the utility of VR classrooms for understanding attention and distraction in real-life classroom learning, these platforms need to use genuine academic tasks and stimuli, to more faithfully simulate the classroom experience. Moreover, there is need to incorporate more objective metrics related to attention, such as measurements of neural activity and physiological responses, in order to obtain a more comprehensive picture of how listeners actually respond to stimuli and process the content of a lesson in a VR classroom. Here, we address this challenge by introducing a highly realistic multimodal VR classroom platform, that simulates participating in a frontal lesson by an avatar-teacher with occasional disturbances from different types of ecological sound-events (non-verbal human sounds such as coughs and throat clearings; and artificial sounds such as phone ringtones) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Levy et al., 2025</xref>). Our novel platform also integrates measurements of neurophysiological responses, including neural activity (using electroencephalography; EEG), eye-gaze, and arousal levels, as reflected in changes in skin conductance (SC). These multi-level recordings allow us to investigate which neurophysiological metrics distinguish between students with and without a diagnosis of AD(H)D when they engage in realistic classroom learning, and which metrics reliably predict the severity of AD(H)D symptoms.</p><p>We focus on several specific neural and physiological metrics, that have been associated with aspects of attention, distraction, and information processing in more traditional attention research, and test their generalizability to this ecological context. These include: (1) Neural speech tracking of the teacher’s lesson, which captures aspects of its sensory and linguistic processing, and is known to be reduced under conditions of inattention or distraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding and Simon, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zion Golumbic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Huang and Elhilali, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Holtze et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kaufman and Zion‐Golumbic, 2023</xref>). Accordingly, this metric might be expected to be reduced in individuals with AD(H)D and/or in conditions that contain external disturbances; (2) Neural event-related potentials (ERPs), transient changes in SC, and overt gaze-shifts following unexpected sound-events in the background of the classroom. These metrics are thought to reflect exogenous capture of attention, increases in arousal and potentially distraction by salient irrelevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Posner, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bidet-Caulet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Masson and Bidet-Caulet, 2019</xref>); (3) The frequency of gaze-shifts away from the teacher, and time spent looking around the classroom, metrics associated with attention-shifts and distractibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grosbras et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schomaker et al., 2017</xref>), and are often heightened in individuals with AD(H)D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mauriello et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stokes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Selaskowski et al., 2023</xref>); (4) The power of alpha- and beta-oscillations, which are often associated with increased mind-wandering or boredom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clarke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boudewyn and Carter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jin et al., 2019</xref>), and some have suggested may be altered in individuals with AD(H)D (although use of spectral signatures as biomarkers for AD(H)D is highly controversial; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gloss et al., 2016</xref>); (5) Continuous levels of arousal, as measured by SC, which some propose are either heightened or reduced in individuals with AD(H)D relative to their control peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sergeant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bellato et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>This novel ecological approach and the rich repertoire of neurophysiological metrics measured here, afford unique insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of paying attention in class and the disruptive effects of background sounds, in both the neurotypical and AD(H)D population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The current dataset is extremely rich, consisting of many different behavioral, neural, and physiological responses.

These results indicate that including a regressor that captures the time-course of the sound-events in addition to a regressor capturing the speech stimulus allowed the model to more faithfully capture the neural representation of the entire virtual reality (VR) classroom soundscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Crosse et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, this approach is preferable when analyzing neural response to stimuli embedded in realistically noisy contexts.

We offer a new approach for advancing attention research, by utilizing VR to simulate real-life experiences together with comprehensive measurement of different neurophysiological responses. This combination affords a more objective and well-rounded description of how individuals deal with the plethora of stimuli and task demands of their environments. Here, we focused on VR classroom learning, since this is the context where many individuals, and particularly those with AD(H)D, experience difficulties in sustaining attention and avoiding distraction. Specifically, we evaluated neurophysiological measures related to focusing attention on the teacher and responses to irrelevant background sound-events alongside metrics associated more generally with levels of attention/engagement. We found that individuals diagnosed with AD(H)D exhibited significantly larger N1 response to background sound-events and somewhat reduced neural tracking of the teacher’s speech. These were also the two most dominant factors contributing to a multivariate classifier that could significantly predict whether an individual was diagnosed with AD(H)D. When considering the severity of AD(H)D symptoms as a continuous variable, variance across individuals was best explained by the combined contribution of the N1 and P2 response to sound-events, amplitude of alpha-power oscillations and the frequency of gaze-shifts away from the teacher. Together, these findings emphasize the variety of attentional challenges that individuals with AD(H)D may experience in realistic scenarios and provide novel insights into the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neurophysiological responses in the VR classroom associated with symptoms of AD(H)D</title><p>The finding with the largest effect size in this study was larger N1 response to background sound-events in individuals with AD(H)D.

Enhanced N1 responses are often associated with heightened sensory sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heil, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lütkenhöner and Klein, 2007</xref>), perceptual predictability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chennu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lange, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schwartze and Kotz, 2015</xref>), and may reflect a transient detector mechanism of surprising events that can potentially (though not necessarily) trigger an attention shift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Näätänen and Picton, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Escera et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Escera et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berti, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, most studies comparing auditory ERPs in individuals with and without AD(H)D, using more traditional paradigms (e.g., oddball), typically <italic>have not reported</italic> differences in early-sensory components such as the N1, but rather sometimes find group differences for later ERP responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gumenyuk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kaiser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Peisch et al., 2021</xref>). As discussed below, we attribute these discrepancies to the non-ecological nature of most traditional paradigm. The current result is in line with increased sensory sensitivity to background events, which might be especially pertinent under ecological condition. In addition, we found that neural tracking of the teacher’s speech was reduced in the AD(H)D group, and this metric also emerged as a dominant predictor of AD(H)D diagnosis in multivariate between-group classification. Neural speech tracking of continuous speech is known to be modulated by attention, and is reduced when speech is not attended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ding and Simon, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mesgarani and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zion Golumbic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Petersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Vanthornhout et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kaufman and Zion‐Golumbic, 2023</xref>). We are not aware of previous studies that directly investigated neural speech tracking in AD(H)D, however these results are consistent with reduced levels of sustained attention toward the teacher in this group.</p><p>Reduced sustained attention and higher proneness to distraction are, of course, considered key characteristics of AD(H)D, however are rarely demonstrated under realistic conditions, using ecological tasks and materials. The current results demonstrate how, by coupling the ecological validity and flexibility of VR with recordings of neural activity, we can substantially advance our mechanistic understanding of attention and distractibility and obtain objective metrics of stimulus processing in realistic scenarios. Interestingly, since the magnitude of the N1 to sound-events and speech tracking of the teacher were not correlated with each other, these results do not support the notion of an inherent ‘tradeoff’ between paying attention to the teacher and responding to irrelevant stimuli. Rather, they may represent two independent ways in which individuals with AD(H)D differ from their peers in the manner they respond to and process stimuli in dynamic environments.</p><p>However, adopting a binary perspective of AD(H)D can be misleading, as it does not capture the vast variability within groups, as emphasized by the RDoC framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Morris et al., 2022</xref>). This is evident from inspecting the distribution of ASRS scores in the current sample, which shows that although the two groups are clearly separable from each other, they are far from uniform in the severity of symptoms experienced. For this reason, we conducted a continuous multiple regression analysis, to identify which neurophysiological measured explained variance in self-reported AD(H)D symptoms. This analysis confirmed the link between the magnitude of the N1 response to sound-events to AD(H)D symptoms, but also identified several additional factors that contribute to explaining variance in ASRS scores across individuals, primarily: the level of alpha-power and the frequency of gaze-shifts away from the teacher. This finding is consistent with the hypothesized role of these metrics in attention. Higher alpha-power is associated with reduced levels of attention/arousal, and is consistently found to increase in conditions of boredom, tiredness or prolonged time on tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Clarke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dockree et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Palva and Palva, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wöstmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boudewyn and Carter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Haro et al., 2022</xref>). Several studies have also found higher baseline alpha-power in individuals with AD(H)D versus controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Johnstone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bozhilova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Michelini et al., 2022</xref>), although results are not always consistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Loo and Makeig, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Johnstone et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, gaze-shifts are often used as a proxy for distraction, particularly under naturalistic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Marius ’t Hart et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Foulsham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Risko and Kingstone, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Risko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Hoppe et al., 2018</xref>), and recent VR and real-life eye-tracking studies have found increased frequency and prolonged duration of gaze-shifts toward irrelevant locations in individuals with AD(H)D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Braga et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Türkan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vakil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mauriello et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stokes et al., 2022</xref>). The current results extend these findings to more ecological contexts and indicate that individuals who exhibited higher alpha-power, performed more frequent gaze-shifts and had larger N1 response to background sound-events in our VR classroom were more likely to report experiencing attentional difficulties in real life.</p><p>It is important to note that although the current results had significant explanatory power of variance in AD(H)D symptoms, they are far from exhaustive with substantial variance still unexplained by these neurophysiological measures. In this regard it is important to bear in mind that the measures of AD(H)D themselves (diagnosis and ASRS scores) are also not entirely reliable, given the diversity diagnostic practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barkley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mulraney et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arrondo et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schweitzer and Zion Golumbic, 2024</xref>) and the subjective nature of self-reports which are prone to bias (e.g., recency, salience, and generalization effects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rabiner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Toplak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brevik et al., 2020</xref>). What is clear, though, is that no single neurophysiological measure alone is sufficient for explaining differences between the individuals – whether through the lens of clinical diagnosis or through report of symptoms. These data emphasize the complex nature of attentional functioning, especially under realistic conditions, and that fact that ‘attentional challenges’ may manifest in a variety of different ways, indexed though different neurophysiological responses. Moving forward, we believe that by measuring multiple aspects of neural and physiological responses, and studying these in diverse and ecologically valid conditions, will ultimately lead to distilling specific neurophysiological patterns that can reliably generalize across contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What about the P300?</title><p>Notably, the current results diverge from previous studies of distractibility in AD(H)D in several ways. In traditional ERP studies, distractibility by irrelevant stimuli is often associated with a family of late-latency positive neural responses (the P300 family), and specifically the P3a ERP component, which is typically observed at a latency of ~250–400 ms after hearing novel or surprising sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">SanMiguel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wetzel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Masson and Bidet-Caulet, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barry et al., 2020</xref>). Given this vast literature, we had assumed that background sound-events in our VR classroom would also elicit this response. Moreover, past studies have shown reduced P3a responses in individuals with AD(H)D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gumenyuk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kaiser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Peisch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kwasa et al., 2023</xref>), leading us to expect a similar pattern here. However, here the early N1 response to sound-events was larger in the ADHD group but no differences were found for any of later responses. Moreover, visual inspection of the ERPs to Artificial and Non-verbal human sound-events illustrates that not all ecological sounds elicit the same time-course of responses in mid- to late time-windows.</p><p>When comparing the current results from the VR classroom with more traditional ERP studies of distractibility, we must consider the vast differences in context and task requirements and the ‘functional status’ of background sound-events in these studies. The P3a is typically observed in tasks that require high levels of perceptual vigilance to discriminate between specific stimulus features, such as the pitch, duration or intensity of sounds presented in an oddball paradigm. In these tasks, so-called ‘novel’ or ‘distractor’ sounds/stimuli are presented as part of the sequence of stimuli that need to be discriminated, and these stimuli elicit a P3a (whereas target sounds elicit a somewhat similar P3b response; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barry et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, although these ‘distractor’ stimuli do not require an explicit response, they are in fact within the focus of participants’ endogenous attention, rather than truly ‘background’ stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Makov et al., 2023</xref>). This differs substantially from the role of the novel sounds-events in the VR classroom task used here, where sound-events are clearly in the background– both spatially and semantically – and occur in parallel to an ongoing speech stimulus (the lecture) that participants are primarily paying attention to. In addition, the perceptual and cognitive demands of the VR Classroom – where participants are instructed to listen and understand the speech as they would in a real-life classroom – differ substantially from the highly vigilant demands of speeded-response tasks. These important differences in task and stimulus characteristic ultimately lead to a different treatment of novel sound-events by the brain, emphasizing the importance of considering context when comparing results across experimental designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Makov et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mandal et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Null results – insufficient sensitivity or true lack of differences?</title><p>Besides the lack of a reliable P300-like effect here, several additional measures that were evaluated here did not show any group-wise effects and did not contribute to explaining ASRS scores, despite previous literature suggesting that they might. Although null results are difficult to interpret fully, we find it worthwhile to note these here and briefly discuss potential reasons for the lack of group-related effects. Perhaps the most surprising null effect was the lack of differences in behavioral performance. Participants in both groups achieved similar behavioral performance in the Quiet and Events condition, suggesting that the presence of occasional sound-events ultimately did not ultimately impair their ability to understand the content of the mini-lectures (at least at the level probed by our comprehension questions). These results should be interpreted bearing in mind the details of the current task design – we deliberately chose a task that would mimic the level of information processing required in real-life learning contexts as opposed to speeded-response tasks used in traditional attention research that encourage failures of performance by creating perceptually ‘extreme’ conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barkley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arrondo et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, the presence of occasional sound-events – while noticeable, was not design to be extremely adverse. Under these conditions, individuals with and without AD(H)D were able to maintain good performance despite the occasional acoustic disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mandal et al., 2024</xref>), indicating that neurophysiological indication of somewhat reduced attention do not necessarily translate to poorer behavioral outcomes. It is of course possible that larger behavioral effects would have emerged if task demands or the severity of acoustic disturbances were more challenging.</p><p>Besides neural evoked responses, background sound-events also elicited a transient increase in SC that is associated with an ‘orienting reflex’, reflecting transient changes in arousal/alertness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frith and Allen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zimmer and Richter, 2023</xref>). This response is considered obligatory and automatic, and does not require allocation of attention as it can be observed during sleep and other unconscious states (albeit the magnitude of these responses can vary as a function of attention). Although we had hypothesized that this response might be heightened in individuals with AD(H)D, as has been reported in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sergeant, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bellato et al., 2020</xref>) (similar to the effect on the N1 response), the current results do not support this. Indeed, there has been much debate regarding the relationship between the SC orienting reflex and early neural responses, with conflicting results reported across studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lim et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">MacDonald and Barry, 2020</xref>). Additional research is likely required to better characterize the relationship between neural and physiological responses to surprising events in the environment.</p><p>Last, another interesting null result was the lack of overt-gaze-shifts following sound-events. Gaze-shifts are often considered a proxy for distractibility and capture of attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Parkhurst et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Geisler and Cormack, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nissens et al., 2017</xref>), particularly in individuals with AD(H)D. Accordingly, we had expected to find that sound-event elicited overt shifts toward the spatial location from which they were emitted. However, this was not the case, and individuals (in both groups) did not perform more gaze-shifts following sound-events relative to their baseline tendencies. A similar result was recently reported by our group in a VR café scenario, where that hearing semantically salient words in background speech (e.g., your name or semantic violations) did elicited neural and SC responses, but was not accompanied by gaze-shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brown et al., 2023</xref>). These results might indicate that peripheral auditory stimuli are, generally, less effective than visual stimuli at capturing overt attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Turoman and Vergauwe, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mandal et al., 2024</xref>), or that in ecological audiovisual settings individuals are less prone to move their eyes to search for the source of auditory disturbances, despite noticing them. These possibilities will be further investigated in follow-up VR studies, comparing the effects of irrelevant auditory and visual events.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>General considerations</title><p>Before concluding, we note several important caveats, pertaining to the specific sample tested here. First, as noted, classification of the AD(H)D group was based on their prior clinical diagnosis, which likely varied across participants in terms of diagnosis approach and age of diagnosis. Although the two groups were distinguishable in their self-reported ASRS scores, a more reliable assessment of the severity of current AD(H)D symptoms might have been achieved if we had conducted a full clinical assessment of all participants, as per the acceptable clinical guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">American Psychiatric Association, 2022</xref>). Second, this study was conducted on adults, whereas the majority of AD(H)D research – and particularly all VR classroom studies – have focused on children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pollak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Neguț et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schweitzer and Rizzo, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Seesjärvi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stokes et al., 2022</xref>). AD(H)D is primarily defined as a childhood condition and although it often persists into adulthood, with profound implications on professional and academics outcomes, how the nature of the deficit changes with age is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barkley et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, the adult cohort tested here included primarily university students, who do not represent all adults but rather are a subgroup with relatively high cognitive and learning abilities, who are accustomed to sitting in lectures for long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Henrich et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, it is possible that the lack of group differences in some metrics in the current dataset (and particularly in their behavioral outcomes) is because these individuals have learned to deal with distraction and have developed appropriate strategies, which allow them to thrive in academic settings. This caveat highlights the importance of considering sampling techniques in group-comparison studies, which sometimes limits their interpretation to more circumscribed sub-samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rad et al., 2018</xref>). At the same time, even if the current findings pertain only to this highly functioning academic subgroup of individuals with AD(H)D, they imply an impressive ability to adapt and cope with the naturally occurring distractions of realistic classrooms. Specifically, they suggest that withstanding distraction in real-life contexts may be improved through training and good habit-forming, even in individuals with AD(H)D. We hope to follow up on this research in the future, to deepen our understanding of the diversity within the AD(H)D and typical population and to better characterize attention and distractibility across different types of real-life scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Paying attention in class requires both investing cognitive resources in processing the lesson itself (e.g., the teacher’s speech), and trying to minimize intrusions from background events. Here, we found that both of these operations are less effective in individuals who are diagnosed with AD(H)D or who report more severe symptoms of difficulties in everyday attention. Specifically, these individuals exhibit heightened sensory response to irrelevant sounds, reduced speech tracking of the teacher, a tendency toward more frequent gaze-shifts away from the teacher, and somewhat increased alpha-power. Interestingly, since these metrics were not correlated with each other, they likely represent different ways through which inattention or distraction may manifest, rather than a general ‘biomarker’ of inattention. Counter to some prevalent notions, these data suggest that AD(H)D may not be characterized by a specific ‘neural marker’ indicating attentional deficits, particularly when tested under ecological circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barkley, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faraone et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sonuga-Barke et al., 2023</xref>). Rather, they resonate with recent calls to revisit the parameters used for defining ‘attention-disorders’ and the need to adopt more nuanced and dimensional approach, as well as designing more ecologically valid means of testing, in order to better characterize and understand the complex nature of real-life attentional challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Marcus and Barry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heidbreder, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Morris et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elahi et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-four participants initially participated in the study; however, the data from five participants were excluded due to technical issues or their voluntary request to discontinue participation.

Of these participants, 24 had a prior clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (AD(H)D group), and 25 participants did not (control group). The two groups were matched for age, which ranged between 20 and 38 years (mean age of all participants: 26.9 ± 3.0; AD(H)D participants: 26.7 ± 3.7; control participants: 25.7 ± 4.4). The majority of participants were university students. Participants in the AD(H)D group were questioned about their medication intake regimen, and the experiment was scheduled at least 12 hr after their last dose of medication. None of the participants (in either group) reported taking any other medications on a regular basis. The experimental protocol was approved by the ethics committee at Bar-Ilan University (protocol # ISU202112002), and all participants provided written informed consent prior to their involvement in the study and data collection procedures.

The sound-events were played at a loudness level of 50% relative to the teacher’s voice (–3 dB SPL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Experimental procedure</title><p>The experiment was conducted in a sound attenuated room. After comfortably fitting the VR headset on the participant, the eye-tracker was calibrated and validated using a standard 9-point calibration procedure. Participants were then familiarized with the VR classroom scene, and performed two training trials – one without events-sounds and one with – for training and calibration purposes.</p><p>The experiment consisted of 30 trials. In each trial, the avatar-teacher delivered a different mini-lesson and participants were instructed to pay attention to its content. They were not given any specific instructions regarding the other sounds or stimuli in the classroom. After each mini-lesson, participants answered four multiple-choice questions about its content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Most trials (22) contained occasional background event-sound (Events condition; with 5 of both types sound-events per trial, separated by 3–7 s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), whereas 8 trials did not, serving as a Quiet baseline condition. In total, 104 sound-events were presented throughout the experiment (52 of each type). The order of mini-lecture presentation and their allocation to the Events or Quiet condition was randomized across participants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>EEG, GSR, and eye-gaze recordings</title><p>Neural activity was recorded using 64 active ag-agCl EEG electrodes (BioSemi) and was sampled at 1024 Hz. Electrooculographic (EOG) signals were also included in this recording, measured by three additional electrodes located above the right eye and on the external side of both eyes.</p><p>The SC response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akash et al., 2018</xref>) was recorded using two passive Ni hon Kohden electrodes placed on the fingertips of the index and middle fingers of participants’ non-dominant hand. These signals were also sampled by the BioSemi system, and thus synchronized to EEG data.</p><p>Eye-gaze data were recorded using the eye tracker embedded in the VR headset, which provides information about the <italic>x–y–z</italic> coordinate of the gaze in 3D space at each time-point, as well as automatic blink-detection. We defined several a priori regions of interest (ROIs) in the 3D classroom space, which included: ‘Teacher’, ‘Left Board’, ‘Right Board’, ‘Ceiling’, ‘Floor’, ‘Middle Window’, ‘Left Student’, ‘Right Student’. Note that the sound-events were emitted from the ROI labeled ‘Right Student’. Using a combined calculation of the participants’ head position and direction of the gaze vector, gaze data could be automatically classified to describe which ROI the participant looked at, at each point in time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral data analysis</title><p>To evaluate participants’ comprehension and memory retention, we calculated their accuracy on four multiple-choice questions following each trial (average correct responses). Between-group differences were assessed using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests, separately for the Quiet and Events conditions. These were evaluated separately (here and in all other analyses), given the imbalanced number of trials in each condition. The BF<sub>10</sub> was also calculated for each pairwise comparison, to test the level of confidence for embracing or rejecting the null hypothesis (H0; BF<sub>10</sub> thresholds used throughout: BF<sub>10</sub> &lt;1 indicates weak support of H0 and BF<sub>10</sub> &lt;0.25 indicates moderate/strong support of H0; BF<sub>10</sub> &gt;1 indicates weak support for rejecting H0 and BF<sub>10</sub> &gt;2.5 indicates moderate/strong support for rejecting H0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>EEG data analysis</title><p>The EEG data were preprocessed using MATLAB with the FieldTrip toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org">https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org</ext-link>, version 20220729). The raw EEG data was referenced to linked right and left mastoids, then band-pass filtered between 0.5 and 40 Hz (fourth-order zero-phase Butterworth IIR filter), detrended and demeaned. Visual inspection was performed to identify and remove gross artifacts (excluding eye movements). Independent component analysis was then used to further remove components associated with horizontal or vertical eye movements and heartbeats, which were selected manually based on their characteristic time-course patterns and topographical distributions, consistent with known artifact signatures. Remaining noisy electrodes, containing extensive high-frequency activity or DC drifts, were interpolated using adjacent electrodes, either on the entire dataset or on a per-trial basis, as needed.</p><p>Three types of analyses were applied to the clean EEG data: (1) Speech tracking analysis of the neural response to teacher’s speech, (2) ERPs analysis capturing the time-locked neural response to the Sound-events, and (3) Spectral analysis, looking specifically at ongoing power in two canonical frequency bands previously associated with attention: the alpha (6–15 Hz) and beta (13–30 Hz) ranges.</p><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Speech tracking response (TRF)</title><p>The clean EEG data were segmented into trials from the onset the teacher’s speech until the end of the trial. For this analysis, EEG data were further bandpass filtered between 0.8 and 20 Hz (fourth-order zero-phase Butterworth IIR filter), and downsampled to 100 Hz for computational efficiency. To ensure comparability across participants and conditions, the EEG data were normalized using <italic>z</italic>-score transformation. To estimate the neural response to the speech we performed speech-tracking analysis which estimates a linear TRF that best describes the relationship between features of the stimulus (S) and the neural response (R) in a given trial. Speech tracking analysis was conducted using the mTRF MATLAB toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Crosse et al., 2016</xref>), using both an encoding and decoding approach. Speech-tracking analysis was limited only to the Events condition, since the Quiet condition contained substantially less data (eight trials; ~5 min of data in total), which was insufficient for obtaining a reliable speech-tracking response (predictive power non-significant vs. permutations of shuffled data, p = 0.43). For speech tracking in the Events condition we used a multivariate approach, and included the temporal envelopes of both the teacher’s speech and the sound-events as separate regressors (S) when modeling the neural response, so as to represent the entire soundscape they heard. For both regressors, we derived a broadband temporal envelope by filtering the audio through a narrow-band cochlear filterbank, extracting the narrowband envelopes using a Hilbert transform, and averaging across bands. The regressors were then downsampled to 100 Hz to match the EEG data and normalized using <italic>z</italic>-score.</p><p>In the <bold>encoding</bold> approach, TRFs are estimated for each EEG channel, with lags between the S and the R ranging from –150 ms (baseline) to 450 ms. The mTRF toolbox uses a ridge-regression approach for L2 regularization of the model to ensure better generalization to new data. We tested a range of ridge parameter values (<italic>λ</italic>’s; between 10<sup>–2</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup>) and used a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to assess the model’s predictive power, whereby in each iteration, all but one trials are used to train the model, and it is then applied to the left-out trial. The predictive power of the model (for each <italic>λ</italic>) is estimated as the Pearson’s correlation between the predicted neural responses and the actual neural responses, separately for each electrode, averages across all iterations. We report results of the model with the <italic>λ</italic> the yielded the highest predictive power at the group-level (rather than selecting a different <italic>λ</italic> for each participant which can lead to incomparable TRF models across participants; see discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kaufman and Zion‐Golumbic, 2023</xref>).</p><p>The statistical reliability of the model’s predictive power at each electrode is evaluated using a permutation test where the same procedure is repeated 100 times on shuffled data where the S from each trial is randomly paired with the R from a different trial. From each permutation, we extract the highest predictive power across all electrodes, yielding a null distribution of the maximal predictive power that could be obtained by chance. The predictive power in the real data is compared to this distribution, and electrodes with values falling in the top 5%<sup>tile</sup> of the null distribution are considered to have a significant speech tracking response. Note that by choosing the maximal value across electrodes in each permutation, this procedure also corrects for multiple comparisons.</p><p>A complementary way to examine the neural representation of continuous speech is the <bold>decoding</bold> approach. In the decoding model, a multidimensional transfer function is estimated using the neural data (R) from all electrodes as input in attempt to reconstruct the stimulus feature (S).</p><p>For the decoding analysis we used time lags between S and R ranging from −400 to 0 ms (negative lags imply that the S precedes the R; here including a baseline would be detrimental to decoding). Here too, we used a ridge-regression regularization approach and used a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to assess the quality of the reconstruction. We tested a range of ridge parameter values (<italic>λ</italic>’s; between 10<sup>–2</sup> and 10<sup>4</sup>) and used a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to assess the model’s predictive power, whereby in each iteration, all but one trials are used to train the model, and it is then applied to the left-out trial. The quality of the model (for each <italic>λ</italic>) is estimated as the Pearson’s correlation between the reconstructed S of a left-out-trial vs, the actual S (reconstruction correlation). We report results of the model with the <italic>λ</italic> the yielded the highest predictive power at the group-level. The statistical significance of the reconstruction correlation was assessed using a permutation test in which the same procedure is repeated 100 times on shuffled data where the S from each trial is randomly paired with the R from a different trial. This yields a null distribution of predictive power values that could be obtained by chance, and the real model is considered reliable if its predictive power falls within the top 5%<sup>tile</sup> of the null distribution.</p><p>Speech tracking analysis – using both encoding and decoding approaches – was performed separately for each Group (AD(H)D and Control). To test for between-group differences, we compared the models’ predictive power, using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests. We additionally calculated the BF<sub>10</sub> for each comparison, to test the level of confidence for embracing or rejecting the null hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Event-related response</title><p>To quantify neural responses to the sound-events, we estimated the time-locked ERPs. For this analysis, the clean EEG data were segmented into epochs ranging from –100 to 500 ms around each event. The data were further low-passed filtered at 12 Hz, as is common in ERP analysis (fourth-order zero-phase Butterworth IIR filter), and baseline corrected to the pre-stimulus period (−100 to 0 ms). ERPs were derived separately for each group (AD(H)D vs. Control) and Event-type (Artificial vs. Non-verbal human sounds). Visual inspection of the ERPs showed that they were dominated by two early components: the N1-component (75–200 ms) and later P2-component (210–260 ms), which primarily reflect auditory sensory responses, but are sometimes modulated by attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hillyard et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Woldorff and Hillyard, 1991</xref>).</p><p>Statistical analysis of the ERPs focused on the two simple effects, using a Monte-Carlo spatio-temporal cluster-based permutation test, across all electrodes and time-points. To test for difference in the ERPs between Groups, we used unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests on the ERPs, averaged across Event-types. For this analysis, we had to set the cluster alpha-level to a very low level of p = 10<sup>–5</sup>, in order to obtain separate clusters for the N1 and P2 responses. To test for difference in the ERPs generated for the two Event-types, we use paired <italic>t</italic>-tests on the ERPs of all participant, irrespective of their group. For this analysis, the cluster alpha-level was set to p = 0.05. Last, to verify the main effects and in order to test for potential interactions between Group and Event-type, we extracted the peak amplitudes of the N1 and P2 component from each participant, and performed a mixed ANOVA with repeated measures, with the factors Group (AD(H)D vs. Control; between) and Event-Type (Artificial vs. Human non-verbal; within).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Spectral analysis</title><p>The third analysis performed on the EEG data was a spectral analysis. This analysis was performed on the clean EEG data, segmented into full trials (same segmentation used for the speech-tracking analysis). We calculated the EEG spectral power density (PSD) of individual trials using multitaper fast-fourier transform (FFT) with Hanning tapers (method ‘mtmfft’ in the fieldtrip toolbox). The PSDs were averaged across trials for each participant, separately for each electrode and condition (Quiet and Events). We used the FOOOF algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>) to decompose the PSD into periodic (oscillatory) and aperiodic components. The periodic portion of the PSD showed clear peaks in the alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (15–25 Hz) ranges, suggesting reliable oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Since the peaks of alpha and beta activity can vary substantially across individuals, for each participant, we identified the frequency with the largest amplitude within each range, focusing on a cluster of occipital–parietal electrodes (for alpha) or frontal–central electrodes (for beta), where these responses were largest. These were used for statistical analyses of between-group differences. assessed using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests, separately for the Quiet and Events conditions, in each frequency band, and the BF<sub>10</sub> was calculated for each pairwise comparison to test the level of confidence for embracing or rejecting the null hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>SC data analysis</title><p>The SC signal was analyzed using the Ledalab MATLAB toolbox (version 3.4.9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Benedek and Kaernbach, 2010</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ledalab.de/">http://www.ledalab.de/</ext-link>). The raw data were downsampled to 16 Hz using FieldTrip’s ft_resampledata function, which applies a built-in anti-aliasing low-pass filter to prevent aliasing artifacts. Data were inspected manually for any noticeable artifacts (large ‘jumps’), and if present were corrected using linear interpolation in Ledalab. A continuous decomposition analysis (CDA) was employed to separate the tonic and phasic SC responses for each participant. The CDA was conducted using the ‘sdeco’ mode (signal decomposition), which iteratively optimizes the separation of tonic and phasic components using the default regularization settings. We tested for between-group differences in <italic>global SC levels</italic> (tonic and phasic responses separately, averaged across full trials) using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests, separately for the Quiet and Events conditions and the BF<sub>10</sub> was calculated for each pairwise comparison.</p><p>In addition, we analyzed <italic>event-related changes in SC</italic> following Sound-events. This analysis focused on a time-window between 0 and 5 s after the onset of Sound-events. Since changes in SC are relatively slow and peak between 2 and 3 s after a stimulus, the mean response between 0 and 1 s was used as a baseline and was subtracted from the signal. Statistical analysis focused the time-window surrounding the mean response between 2 and 3 s, extracted for each participant. A mixed ANOVA with repeated measures was used to test for main effects of Group (AD(H)D vs. Control; between factor), and Event-Type (Artificial vs. Non-verbal human; within factor) and the interaction between them.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Eye tracking data analysis</title><p>Eye-tracking data were used to study participants' spontaneous gaze-dynamics in the VR classroom throughout the entire trial and also to examine whether background Sound-events elicited overt gaze-shifts. Gaze-data preprocessing involved removing measurements around blinks (from –100 to 200 ms after) and any other data points marked as ‘missing data’ by the eye-tracker. Gaze-data were analyzed using Python, closely following recommended procedures for analysis of gaze-data in VR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2023</xref>). To assess gaze-patterns and detect gaze-shift, we calculated the Euclidean distance between adjacent data points, using the <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>z</italic> coordinates in 3D space provided by the eye-tracker. ‘Fixations’ were defined as clusters of adjacent time-points within a radius of less than 0.01 distance from each other, lasting at least 80 ms. Each fixation was associated with a specific ROI in the VR classroom, indicating the object in the virtual space that the participant looked at. ‘Gaze-shifts’ were defined as transitions between two stable fixations.</p><p>To analyze spontaneous gaze-dynamics throughout an entire trial, we quantified the percent of each trial that participants spent looking at the teacher (target) versus all other ROIs, as well as the number of gaze-shifts away from the teacher per trial. Between-group differences in these measures of spontaneous gaze-patterns were assessed using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests, separately for the Quiet and Events conditions. The BF<sub>10</sub> was calculated for each pairwise comparison to test the level of confidence for embracing or rejecting the null hypothesis.</p><p>To determine whether background Sound-events elicited overt gaze-shifts, we segmented the gaze-data into 2-s long epochs around each Event-sound. As a control, we randomly chose a similar number of 2-s long epochs from the Quiet-condition. We then counted how many epochs included at least one gaze-shift away from the teacher, and used a paired <italic>t</italic>-test to determine whether the frequency of gaze-shifts was higher following Sound-events relative to the Control epochs (regardless of Group). We also used a mixed ANOVA to test for potential differences in the likelihood of gaze-shifts following the different event-types (Artificial vs. Human non-verbal), and for the two Groups (AD(H)D vs. Control). For this analysis, the proportion of gaze-shifts was normalized for each participant by subtracting the number of gaze-shifts following Sound-events relative to the control epochs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Multivariate analyses</title><p>Besides testing for effects of Group in each metric individually, we also performed multivariate analyses to examine the relationship between the various metrics collected here and their ability to predict ADHD diagnosis (binary) and/or the severity of AD(H)D symptoms.</p><p>This analysis focused on 10 key measures, based on the results of the univariate analyses (averaged across conditions, when relevant): 5 measures related to the response to the teacher’s speech: behavioral performance, neural speech tracking decoding (reconstruction correlation), the N1- and P2 peaks of the speech tracking response (TRF-N1; TRF-P2), and the average number of gaze-shifts away from the teacher; 3 measures related to responses to the sound-events: amplitude of the N1- and P2-responses to sound-events (ERP-N1; ERP-P2), phasic SC response to sound-events (event-related SC); and 2 global measures associated with the listeners’ ‘state’: alpha- and beta-power.</p><p>First, we calculated Spearman’s correlation between all pairs of measures (fdr correction for multiple comparisons was applied). Next, we entered all factors into a multiple regression model and performed a dominance analysis to determine the relative importance of each measure for predicting whether an individual was in the ADHD or control group (logistic regression) or the severity of ADHD symptoms, as reflected by their ASRS scores (linear regression). Dominance analysis was performed as follows: For each of the 10 measures, we computed the difference in a model-fit index (AUC for logistic regression; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> for linear regression) between a full model containing all 10 predictors, and a model where the measure under consideration was held-out, as a means for assessing the unique contribution of each measure to overall model performance (dominance). We then sorted the measures based on their dominance and report the multiple regression model that explains the most amount of variance using the least number of variables. These analyses were conducted using the statistical software JASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Team, 2024</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The experimental protocol was approved by the ethics committee at Bar-Ilan University (protocol # ISU202112002), and all participants provided written informed consent prior to their involvement in the study and data collection procedures.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-103235-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Video examples of the VR classroom and the entire dataset are publicly available on OSF: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/svjqg">https://osf.io/svjqg</ext-link>.

The authors combine a variety of neural and physiological metrics to study attention in a VR classroom setting. The manuscript is well written and the results are interesting, ranging from an effect of group (AD(H)D vs. control) on metrics such as envelope tracking, to multivariate regression analyses considering alpha-power, gaze, TRF, ERPs, and behaviour simultaneously. I find the first part of the results clear and strong. The multivariate analyses in Tables 1 and 2 are good ideas, but I think they would benefit from additional clarifications. Overall, I think that the methodological approach is useful in itself. The rest is interesting in that it informs us on which metrics are sensitive to group-effects and correlated with each other. I think this might be one interesting way forward. Indeed, much more work is needed to clarify how these results change with different stimuli and tasks. So, I see this as an interesting first step into more naturalistic measurement of speech attention.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>I praise the authors for this interesting attempt to tackle a challenging topic with naturalistic experiment and metrics. I think the results broadly make sense and they contribute to a complex literature that is far from being linear and cohesive.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors have successfully addressed most of my concerns during the review process. Some weaknesses remain in this resubmission, but they do not make the results invalid. For example:</p><p>- The EEG data was filtered twice, which is not recommended as that can introduce additional filtering artifacts. So, while I definitely do not recommend doing that, I do not expect that issue to have an impact on this specific result.</p><p>- The authors did not check whether participants were somewhat familiar with the topics in the speech material. The authors agreed that this point might be beneficial for future research.</p><p>- The hyperparameter tuning is consistent with previous work from the authors, and it involves selecting the optimal lambda value of the regularized regression based on the group average, thus choosing a single lambda value for all participants. In my opinion, that is not the optimal way to run those models, and I do not generally recommend using this approach. The reason is that the lambda can change depending on the magnitude of the signals and the SNR, leading to different optimal lambdas for distinct participants. On the other hand, finding those optimal lambda values for individual participants can be difficult depending on the amount of data and amount of noise, so it is sometimes necessary to apply strategies that ensure an appropriate choice of lambda. Using the group average as a metric for hyperparameter tuning produces a more stable metric and lambda value selection, which might be preferrable (even though this choice should not be taken lightly). In this specific case, I think the authors had a good reason to do so.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have done a great job at addressing my comments. I don't have any further concerns. Congratulations!</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103235.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>While selective attention is a crucial ability of human beings, previous studies on selective attention are primarily conducted in a strictly controlled context, leaving a notable gap in underlying the complexity and dynamic nature of selective attention in a naturalistic context. This issue is particularly important for classroom learning in individuals with ADHD, as selecting the target and ignoring the distractions are pretty difficult for them but are the pre-requirement of effective learning. The authors of this study have addressed this challenge using a well-motivated study. I believe the findings of this study will be a nice addition to the fields both cognitive neuroscience and educational neuroscience.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>To achieve the purpose of setting up a naturalistic context, the authors have based their study on a novel Virtual Reality platform. This is clever as it is usually difficult to perform such a study in the real classroom. Moreover, various techniques such as brain imaging, eye-tracking and physiological measurement are combined to collect multi-level data. They found that, different from the controls, individuals with ADHD had higher neural responses to the irrelevant rather than the target sounds, reduced speech tracking of the teacher. Additionally, the power of alpha-oscillations and frequency of gaze-shifts away from the teacher are found to be associated with the ADHD symptoms. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of selective attention among ADHD populations.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It is worth noting that nowadays there has been some studies trying to do so in the real classroom, and thus the authors should acknowledge the difference between the virtual and real classroom context and foresee the potential future changes.</p><p>The approach of combining multi-level data owns advantage to obtain reliable results, but also raises significant difficult for the readers to understand the main results.</p><p>- An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions.</p><p>As expected, individuals with ADHD showed anomalous pattern of neural responses, and eye-tracking pattern, compared to the controls. But there are also some similarities between groups such as amount of time paying attention to teachers, etc. In general, their conclusions are supported.</p><p>- A discussion of the likely impact of the work on the field, and the utility of the methods and data to the community.</p><p>The findings are an extension of previous efforts in understanding selective attention in the naturalistic context. The findings of this study are particularly helpful in inspiring teacher's practice and advancing the research of educational neuroscience. This study demonstrates, again, that it is important to understand the complexity of cognitive process in the naturalistic context.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have appropriately responded to my concerns. I do not have other comments. I do hope to see more data and results from the authors in future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103235.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors conducted a well-designed experiment, incorporating VR classroom scenes and background sound events, with both control and ADHD participants.

If I understand correctly, the data was filtered a second time. If that's the case, please do not do that, as that will introduce additional and unnecessary filtering artifacts. Instead, the authors should replace the original filter with this one (so, filtering the data only once). Please see de Cheveigne and Nelkn, Neuron, 2019 for an explanation. Also, please provide an explanation of the rationale for further restricting the cut-off bands in the methods section. Finally, further details on the filters should be included (filter type and order, for example).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the data was indeed filtered twice. The first filter is done as part of the preprocessing procedure, in order to remove extremely high- and low- frequency noise but retain most activity within the range of “neural” activity. This broad range is mostly important for the ICA procedure, so as to adequately separate between ocular and neural contribution to the recorded signal.</p><p>However, since both the speech tracking responses and ERPs are typically less broadband and are comprised mostly of lower frequencies (e.g., those that make up the speech-envelope), a second narrower filter was applied to improve TRF model-fit and make ERPs more interpretable.</p><p>In both cases we used a fourth order zero-phase Butterworth IIR filter with 1-seconds of padding, as implemented in the Fieldtrip toolbox. We have added these details to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) &quot;(~ 5 minutes of data in total), which is insufficient for deriving reliable TRFs&quot;. That is a bit pessimistic and vague. What does &quot;reliable&quot; mean? I would tend to agree when talking about individual subject TRFs, which 5 min per participant can be enough at the group level. Also, this depends on the specific speech material. If the features are univariate or multivariate. Etc. Please narrow down and clarify this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>We determined that the data in the Quiet condition (~5 min) was insufficient for performing reliable TRF analysis, by assessing whether its predictive-power was significantly better than chance. As shown in Author response image 2 below, the predictive power achieved using this data was not higher than values obtained in permuted data (p = 0.43). Therefore, we did not feel that it was appropriate to include TRF analysis of the Quiet condition in this manuscript. We have now clarified this in the manuscript (p. 10)</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103235-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) &quot;Based on previous research in by our group (Kaufman &amp; Zion Golumbic 2023), we chose to use a constant regularization ridge parameter (λ = 100) for all participants and conditions&quot;. This is an insufficient explanation. I understand that there is a previous paper involved. However, such an unconventional choice that goes against the original definition and typical use of these methods should be clearly reported in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not clarifying this point sufficiently, and have added an explanation of this methodological choice (p.11):</p><p>“The mTRF toolbox uses a ridge-regression approach for L2 regularization of the model to ensure better generalization to new data. We tested a range of ridge parameter values (λ's) and used a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to assess the model’s predictive power, whereby in each iteration, all but one trials are used to train the model, and it is then applied to the left-out trial. The predictive power of the model (for each λ) is estimated as the Pearson’s correlation between the predicted neural responses and the actual neural responses, separately for each electrode, averages across all iterations. We report results of the model with the λ the yielded the highest predictive power at the group-level (rather than selecting a different λ for each participant which can lead to incomparable TRF models across participants; see discussion in Kaufman &amp; Zion Golumbic 2023).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Assuming that the explanation will be sufficiently convincing, which is not a trivial case to make, the next issue that I will bring up is that the lambda value depends on the magnitude of input and output vectors. While the input features are normalised, I don't see that described for the EEG signals. So I assume they are not normalized. In that case, the lambda would have at least to be adapted between subjects to account for their different magnitude.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for omitting this detail – yes, the EEG signals were normalized prior to conducting the TRF analysis. We have updated the methods section to explicitly state this pre-processing step (p.10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another clarification, is that value (i.e., 100) would not be comparable either across subjects or across studies. But maybe the authors have a simple explanation for that choice? (note that this point is very important as this could lead others to use TRF methods in an inappropriate way - but I understand that the authors might have specific reasons to do so here). Note that, if the issue is finding a reliable lambda per subject, a more reasonable choice would be to use a fixed lambda selected on a generic (i.e., group-level) model. However selecting an arbitrary lambda could be problematic (e.g., would the results replicate with another lambda; and similarly, what if a different EEG system was used, with different overall magnitude, hence the different impact of the regularisation).</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that selecting an arbitrary lambda is problematic (esp across studies). As clarified above, the group-level lambda chosen here for the encoding more was data-driven, optimized based on group-level predictive power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) &quot;L2 regularization of the model, to reduce its complexity&quot;. Could the authors explain what &quot;reduce its complexity&quot; refers to?</p></disp-quote><p>Our intension here was to state that the L2 regularization constrains the model’s weights so that it can better generalize between to left-out data. However, for clarity we have now removed this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) The same lambda value was used for the decoding model. From personal experience, that is very unlikely to be the optimal selection. Decoding models typically require a different (usually larger) lambda than forward models, which can be due to different reasons (different SNR of &quot;input&quot; of the model and, crucially, very different dimensionality).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that treatment of regularization parameters might not be identical for encoding and decoding models. Our initial search of lambda parameters was limited to λ = 0.01 - 100, with λ = 100 showing the best reconstruction correlations. However, following the reviewer’s suggestion we have now broadened the range and found that, in fact reconstruction correlations are further improved and the best lambda is λ = 1000 (see Author response image 3 below, left panel). Importantly, the difference in decoding reconstruction correlations between the groups is maintained regardless of the choice of lambda (although the effect-size varies; see Author response image 3, right panel). We have now updated the text to reflect results of the model with λ = 1000.</p><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103235-sa4-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Skin conductance analysis. Additional details are required. For example, how was the linear interpolation done exactly? The raw data was downsampled, sure. But was an anti-aliasing filter applied? What filter exactly? What implementation for the CDA was run exactly?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following details to the methods section (p. 14):</p><p>“The Skin Conductance (SC) signal was analyzed using the Ledalab MATLAB toolbox (version 3.4.9; Benedek and Kaernbach, 2010; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ledalab.de/">http://www.ledalab.de/</ext-link>) and custom-written scripts. The raw data was downsampled to 16Hz using FieldTrip's ft_resampledata function, which applies a built-in anti-aliasing low-pass filter to prevent aliasing artifacts. Data were inspected manually for any noticeable artifacts (large ‘jumps’), and if present were corrected using linear interpolation in Ledalab. A continuous decomposition analysis (CDA) was employed to separate the tonic and phasic SC responses for each participant. The CDA was conducted using the 'sdeco' mode (signal decomposition), which iteratively optimizes the separation of tonic and phasic components using the default regularization settings.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) &quot;N1- and P2 peaks of the speech tracking response&quot;.

Just a thought.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion, and we know that this has been used sometimes in more traditional ERP literature. In this case, since neither peak was modulated across groups, we did not think this would yield different results. However, it is a good point to keep in mind for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Figure 4B. The ticks are missing. From what I can see (but it's hard without the ticks), the N1 seems later than in other speech-EEG tracking experiments (where is closer to ~80ms). Could the authors comment on that? Or maybe this looks similar to some of the authors' previous work?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this and have added ticks to the figure.</p><p>In terms of time-course, a N1 peak at around 100ms is compatible with many of our previous studies, as well as those from other groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Figure 4C. Strange thin vertical grey bar to remove.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) Figure 4B: What about the topographies for the TRF weights? Could the authors show that for the main components?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. The topographies of the main TRF components are similar to those of the predictive power and are compatible with auditory responses. We have added them to Figure 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Figure 4B: I just noticed that this is a grand average TRF. That is ok (but not ideal) only because the referencing is to the mastoids. The more appropriate way of doing this is to look at the GFP, instead, which estimates the presence of dipoles. And then look at topographies of the components. Averaging across channels makes the plotted TRF weaker and noisier. I suggest adding the GFP to the plot. Also, the colour scale in Figure 4A is deceiving, as blue is usually used for +/- in plots of the weights. While that is a heatmap, where using a single colour or even yellow to red would be less deceiving at first look. Only cosmetics, indeed. The result is interesting nonetheless!</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this, and agree with the reviewer that it is better not to average across EEG channels. In the revised Figure, we now show the TRFs based on the average of electrodes FC1, FC2, and FCz, which exhibited the strongest activity for the two main components.</p><p>Following the previous comment, we have also included the topographical representation of the TRF main components, to give readers a whole-head perspective of the TRF.</p><p>We have also fixed the color-scales.</p><p>We are glad that the reviewer finds this result interesting!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) Figure 4C. This looks like a missed opportunity. That metric shows a significant difference overall. But is that underpinned but a generally lower envelope reconstruction correlation, or by a larger deviation in those correlations (so, that metric is as for the control in some moments, but it drops more frequently due to distractibility)?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s point here, and ideally would like to be able to address this in a more fine-grained analysis, for example on a trial-by-trial basis. However, the design of the current experiment was not optimized for this, in terms of (for example) number of trials, the distribution of sound-events and behavioral outcomes. We hope to be able to address this issue in our future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(18) I am not a fan of the term &quot;accuracy&quot; for indicating envelope reconstruction correlations. Accuracy is a term typically associated with classification. Regression models are typically measured through errors, loss, and sometimes correlations. 'Accuracy' is inaccurate (no joke intended).</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this comment and now used the term “reconstruction correlation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) Discussion. &quot;The most robust finding in&quot;. I suggest using more precise terminology. For example, &quot;largest effect-size&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the terminology (p. 31).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(20) &quot;individuals who exhibited higher alpha-power [...]&quot;. I probably missed this. But could the authors clarify this result? From what I can see, alpha did not show an effect on the group. Is this referring to Table 2? Could the authors elaborate on that? How does that reconcile with the non-significant effect of the group? In that same sentence, do you mean &quot;and were more likely&quot;? If that's the case, and they were more likely to report attentional difficulties, how is it that there is no group-effect when studying alpha?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this sentence refers to the linear regression models described in Figure 10 and in Table 2. As the reviewer correctly points out, this is one place where there is a discrepancy between the results of the between-group analysis (ADHD diagnosis yes/no) and the regression analysis, which treats ADHD symptoms as a continuum, across both groups. The same is true for the gaze-shift data, which also did not show a significance between-group effect but was identified in the regression analysis as contributing to explaining the variance in ADHD symptoms.</p><p>We discuss this point on pages 30-31, noting that “although the two groups are clearly separable from each other, they are far from uniform in the severity of symptoms experienced”, which motivated the inclusion of both analyses in this paper.</p><p>At the bottom of p. 31 we specifically address the similarities and differences between the between-group and regression-based results. In our opinion, this pattern emphasizes that while neither approach is ‘conclusive’, looking at the data through both lenses contributes to an overall better understanding of the contributing factors, as well as highlighting that “no single neurophysiological measure alone is sufficient for explaining differences between the individuals – whether through the lens of clinical diagnosis or through report of symptoms”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(21) &quot;why in the latter case the neural speech-decoding accuracy did not contribute to explaining ASRS scores [...]&quot;. My previous point 1 on separating overall envelope decoding from its deviation could help there. The envelope decoding correlation might go up and down due to SNR, while you might be more interested in the dynamics over time (i.e., looking at the reconstructions over time).</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we appreciate this comment, but believe that this additional analysis is outside the scope of what would be reliably-feasible with the current dataset. However, since the data will be made publicly available, perhaps other researchers will have better ideas as to how to do this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(22) Data and code sharing should be discussed. Also, specific links/names and version numbers should be included for the various libraries used.</p></disp-quote><p>We are currently working on organizing the data to make it publicly available on the Open Science Project.</p><p>We have updated links and version numbers for the various toolboxes/software used, throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>(1) While it is highly appreciated to study selective attention in a naturalistic context, the readers would expect to see whether there are any potential similarities or differences in the cognitive and neural mechanisms between contexts. Whether the classic findings about selective attention would be challenged, rebutted, or confirmed? Whether we should expect any novel findings in such a novel context? Moreover, there are some studies on selective attention in the naturalistic context though not in the classroom, it would be better to formulate specific hypotheses based on previous findings both in the strictly controlled and naturalistic contexts.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we fully agree that comparing results across different contexts would be extremely beneficial and important.</p><p>The current paper serves as an important proof-first-concept demonstrating the plausibility and scientific potential of using combined EEG-VR-eyetracking to study neurophysiological aspects of attention and distractibility, but is also the basis for formulating specific hypothesis that will be tested in follow-up studies.</p><p>If fact, a follow up study is already ongoing in our lab, where we are looking into this point, by testing users in different VR scenarios (e.g., classroom, café, office etc.), and assessing whether similar neurophysiological patterns are observed across contexts and to what degree they are replicable within and across individuals. We hope to share these data with the community in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Previous studies suggest handedness and hemispheric dominance might impact the processing of information in each hemisphere. Whether these issues have been taken into consideration and appropriately addressed?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. In this study we did not specifically control for handedness/hemispheric dominance, since most of the neurophysiological measured used here are sensory/auditory in their nature, and therefore potentially invariant to handedness. Moreover, the EEG signal is typically not very sensitive to hemispheric dominance, at least for the measures used here. However, this might be something to consider more explicitly in future studies. Nonetheless, we have added handedness information to the Methods section (p. 5): “46 right-handed, 3 left-handed”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It would be interesting to know how students felt about the Virtual Classroom context, whether it is indeed close to the real classroom or to some extent different.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree. Obviously, the VR classroom differs in many ways from a real classroom, in terms of the perceptual experience, social aspects and interactive possibilities. We did ask participants about their VR experience after the experiment, and most reported feeling highly immersed in the VR environment and engaged in the task, with a strong sense of presence in the virtual-classroom.</p><p>We note that, in parallel to the VR studies in our lab, we are also conducting experiments in real classrooms, and we hope that the cross-study comparison will be able to shed more light on these similarities/differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) One intriguing issue is whether neural tracking of the teacher's speech can index students' attention, as the tracking of speech may be relevant to various factors such as sound processing without semantic access.</p></disp-quote><p>Another excellent point. While separating the ‘acoustic’ and ‘semantic’ contributions to the speech tracking response is non-trivial, we are currently working on methodological approaches to do this (again, in future studies) following, for example, the hierarchical TRF approach used by Brodbeck et al. and others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) There are many results associated with various metrics, and many results did not show a significant difference between the ADHD group and the control group. It is difficult to find the crucial information that supports the conclusion. I suggest the authors reorganize the results section and report the significant results first, and to which comparison(s) the readers should pay attention.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the organization of the results section was difficult to follow. This is indeed a challenge when collecting so many different neurophysiological metrics.</p><p>To facilitate this, we have now added a paragraph at the beginning of the result section, clarifying its structure (p.16):</p><p>The current dataset is extremely rich, consisting of many different behavioral, neural and physiological responses. In reporting these results, we have separated between metrics that are associated with paying attention to the teacher (behavioral performance, neural tracking of the teacher’s speech, and looking at the teacher), those capturing responses to the irrelevant sound-events (ERPs and event-related changes in SC and gaze); as well as more global neurophysiological measures that may be associated with the listeners’ overall ‘state’ of attention or arousal (alpha- and beta-power and tonic SC).</p><p>Moreover, within each section we have ordered the analysis such that the ones with significant effects are first. We hope that this contributes to the clarity of the results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The difference between artificial and non-verbal humans should be introduced earlier in the introduction and let the readers know what should be expected and why.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this to the Introduction (p. 4)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) It would be better to discuss the results against a theoretical background rather than majorly focusing on technical aspects.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. In our opinion, the discussion does contain a substantial theoretical component, both regarding theories of attention and attention-deficits, and also regarding their potential neural correlates. However, we agree that there is always room for more in depth discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Major:</p><p>(1) While the study introduced a well-designed experiment with comprehensive physiological measures and thorough analyses, the key insights derived from the experiment are unclear. For example, does the high ecological validity provide a more sensitive biomarker or a new physiological measure of attention deficit compared to previous studies? Or does the study shed light on new mechanisms of attention deficit, such as the simultaneous presence of inattention and distraction (as mentioned in the Conclusion)? The authors should clearly articulate their contributions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment.</p><p>We would not say that this paper is able to provide a ‘more sensitive biomarker’ or a ‘new physiological measure of attention’ – in order to make those type of grand statements we would need to have much more converging evidence from multiple studies and using both replication and generalization approaches.</p><p>Rather, from our perspective, the key contribution of this work is in broadening the scope of research regarding the neurophysiological mechanisms involved in attention and distraction.</p><p>Specifically, this work:</p><p>(1) Offers a significant methodological advancement of the field – demonstrating the plausibility and scientific potential of using combined EEG-VR-eyetracking to study neurophysiological aspects of attention and distractibility in contexts that ‘mimic’ real-life situations (rather than highly controlled computerized tasks).</p><p>(2) Provides a solid basis formulating specific mechanistic hypothesis regarding the neurophysiological metrics associated with attention and distraction, the interplay between them, and their potential relation to ADHD-symptoms. Rather than being an end-point, we see these results as a start-point for future studies that emphasize ecological validity and generalizability across contexts, that will hopefully lead to improved mechanisms understanding and potential biomarkers of real-life attentional capabilities (see also response to Rev #2 comment #1 above).</p><p>(3) Highlights differences and similarities between the current results and those obtained in traditional ‘highly controlled’ studies of attention (e.g., in the way ERPs to sound-events differ between ADHD and controls; variability in gaze and alpha-power; and more broadly about whether ADHD symptoms do or don’t map onto specific neurophysiological metrics). Again, we do not claim to give a definitive ’answer’ to these issues, but rather to provide a new type of data that can expands the conversation and address the ecological validity gap in attention research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Based on the multivariate analyses, ASRS scores correlate better with the physiological measures rather than the binary deficit category. It may be worthwhile to report the correlation between physiological measures and ASRS scores for the univariate analyses. Additionally, the correlation between physiological measures and behavioral accuracy might also be interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this. The beta-values reported for the regression analysis reflect the correlations between the different physiological measures and the ASRS scores (p. 30). From a statistical perspective, it is better to report these values rather than the univariate correlation-coefficients, since these represent the ‘unique’ relationship with each factor, after controlling for all the others.</p><p>The univariate correlations between the physiological measures themselves, as well as with behavioral accuracy, are reported in Figure 10</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For the TRF and decoding analysis, the authors used a constant regularization parameter per a previous study. However, the optimal regularization parameter is data-dependent and may differ between encoding and decoding analyses. Furthermore, the authors did not conduct TRF analysis for the quiet condition due to the limited ~5 minutes of data. However, such a data duration is generally sufficient to derive a stable TRF with significant predictive power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mesik and Wojtczak, 2022</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises two important points, also raised by Rev #1 (see above).</p><p>Regarding the choice of regularization parameters, we have now clarified that although we used a common lambda value for all participants, it was selected in a data-driven manner, so as to achieve an optimal predictive power at the group-level.</p><p>See revised methods section:</p><p>“The mTRF toolbox uses a ridge-regression approach for L2 regularization of the model to ensure better generalization to new data. We tested a range of ridge parameter values (λ's) and used a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure to assess the model’s predictive power, whereby in each iteration, all but one trials are used to train the model, and it is then applied to the left-out trial. The predictive power of the model (for each λ) is estimated as the Pearson’s correlation between the predicted neural responses and the actual neural responses, separately for each electrode, averages across all iterations. We report results of the model with the λ the yielded the highest predictive power at the group-level (rather than selecting a different λ for each participant which can lead to incomparable TRF models across participants; see discussion in Kaufman &amp; Zion Golumbic 2023).”</p><p>Regarding whether data was sufficient in the Quiet condition for performing TRF analysis – we are aware of the important work by Mesik &amp; Wojtczak, and had initially used this estimate when designing our study. However, when assessing the predictive-power of the TRF model trained on data from the Quiet condition, we found that it was not significantly better than chance (see Author response image 2, ‘real’ predictive power vs. permuted data). Therefore, we ultimately did not feel that it was appropriate to include TRF analysis of the Quiet condition in this manuscript. We have now clarified this in the manuscript (p. 10)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) As shown in Figure 4, for ADHD participants, decoding accuracy appears to be lower than the predictive power of TRF. This result is surprising because more data (i.e., data from all electrodes) is used in the decoding analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point – however, in our experience it is not necessarily the case that decoding accuracy (i.e., reconstruction correlation with the stimulus) is higher than encoding predictive-power. While both metrics use Pearson’s’ correlations, they quantify the similarity between two different types of signals (the EEG and the speech-envelope). Although the decoding procedure does use data from all electrodes, many of them don’t actually contain meaningful information regarding the stimulus, and thus could just as well hinder the overall performance of the decoding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Beyond the current analyses, the authors may consider analyzing inter-subject correlation, especially for the gaze signal analysis. Given that the area of interest during the lesson changes dynamically, the teacher might not always be the focal point. Therefore, the correlation of gaze locations between subjects might be better than the percentage of gaze duration on the teacher.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this suggestion. We have tried to look into this, however working with eye-gaze in a 3-D space is extremely complex and we are not able to calculate reliable correlations between participants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Some preprocessing steps relied on visual and subjective inspection. For instance, &quot; Visual inspection was performed to identify and remove gross artifacts (excluding eye movements) &quot; (P9); &quot; The raw data was downsampled to 16Hz and inspected for any noticeable artifacts &quot; (P13). Please consider using objective processes or provide standards for subjective inspections.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of the possible differences between objective methods of artifact rejection vs. use of manual visual inspection, however we still prefer the manual (subjective) approach. As noted, in this case only very large artifacts were removed, exceeding ~ 4 SD of the amplitude variability, so as to preserve as many full-length trials as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Numerous significance testing methods were employed in the manuscript. While I appreciate the detailed information provided, describing these methods in a separate section within the Methods would be more general and clearer. Additionally, the authors may consider using a linear mixed-effects model, which is more widely adopted in current neuroscience studies and can account for random subject effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, there are many statistical tests in the paper, given the diverse types of neurophysiological data collected here. We actually thought that describing the statistics per method rather than in a separate “general” section would be easier to follow, but we understand that readers might diverge in their preferences.</p><p>Regarding the use of mixed-effect models – this is indeed a great approach. However, it requires deriving reliable metrics on a per-trial basis, and while this might be plausible for some of our metrics, the EEG and GSR metrics are less reliable at this level. This is why we ultimately chose to aggregate across trials and use a regular regression model rather than mixed-effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Some participant information is missing, such as their academic majors. Given that only two lesson topics were used, the participants' majors may be a relevant factor.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify – the mini-lectures presented here actually covered a large variety of topics, broadly falling within the domains of history, science and social-science and technology. Regarding participants’ academic majors, these were relatively diverse, as can be seen in Author response table 1 and Author response image 4.</p><table-wrap id="sa4table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Academic major</th><th valign="bottom">Count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Not a student</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Neuroscience</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Middle Esstern Studies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Criminology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Psychology and Economics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Business Administration</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Veterinary Medicine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Computer Engineering</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Computer Science</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Psychology and Special Education</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Agriculture</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Communication and Political Science</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Materials Engineering</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Medicine</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Criminology and Special Education</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Music</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Arabic</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nursing</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Education</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Psychology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Electrical Engineering</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Psychology and History</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Information Systerns</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sociology and Anthropology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jewish Art</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Law</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Life Sciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="sa4fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103235-sa4-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Did the multiple regression model include cross-validation?
