asymmetric behavior of the mother versus daughter centrosomes, whereby the self-renewing stem cell selectively inherits the mother or daughter centrosome. Although the asymmetric centrosome behavior is widely conserved, its biological significance remains largely unclear. Here, we show that Alms1a, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the human ciliopathy gene Alstrom syndrome, is enriched on the mother centrosome in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs). Depletion of <italic>alms1a</italic> in GSCs, but not in differentiating germ cells, results in rapid loss of centrosomes due to a failure in daughter centriole duplication, suggesting that Alms1a has a stem-cell-specific function in centrosome duplication. Alms1a interacts with Sak/Plk4, a critical regulator of centriole duplication, more strongly at the GSC mother centrosome, further supporting Alms1a’s unique role in GSCs. Our results begin to reveal the unique regulation of stem cell centrosomes that may contribute to asymmetric stem cell divisions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>asymmetric cell division</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Yukiko M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM118308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Yukiko M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Alms1a is a centrosomal protein that exhibits asymmetric localization between mother and daughter centrosomes in asymmetrically dividing stem cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis, controlling centriole duplication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many stem cells divide asymmetrically to generate daughter cells with distinct fates: one self-renewing stem cell and one differentiating cell. Asymmetrically dividing stem cells in several systems show stereotypical inheritance of the mother vs. daughter centrosomes, where the mother or daughter centrosome is consistently inherited by stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conduit and Raff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Habib et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Januschke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>). This observation has provoked the idea that centrosome asymmetry in stem cells might play a critical role during asymmetric cell divisions and that stem cell centrosomes might be uniquely regulated. However, this question remains largely unanswered due to the lack of known stem-cell-specific centrosomal proteins.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs) divide asymmetrically by orienting their spindle perpendicular toward the hub cells, the major niche component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamashita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During male GSC divisions, the mother centrosome is always located near the hub-GSC junction, whereas the daughter centrosome migrates to the other side of the cell, leading to spindle orientation perpendicular to the hub and consistent inheritance of the mother centrosome by GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>). Previously, we reported that Klp10A, a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin of kinesin-13 family, is enriched on GSC centrosomes, but not on centrosomes of differentiating germ cells (i.e. gonialblasts (GBs) and spermatogonia (SGs)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Klp10A is the first protein reported to exhibit stem-cell-specific centrosome localization. RNAi-mediated depletion of <italic>klp10A</italic> leads to abnormal elongation of the mother centrosomes in GSCs. The abnormally elongated mother centrosome in <italic>klp10A</italic>-depleted GSCs result in mitotic spindles with an asymmetric morphology (large vs. small half spindles) and the generation of a large GSC and a small GB that often dies, likely due to an insufficient cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). These results suggested that stem cell centrosomes are indeed under unique regulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of Alms1a as a germline stem cell (GSC)-specific Klp10A interactor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Asymmetric centrosome inheritance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male GSCs.

Here, we identify Alms1a, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of the causative gene for the human ciliopathy Alstrom syndrome, as a GSC-specific Klp10A-interacting protein. Human ALMS1 is reported to localize to the centrosome/basal body in many cells and function in formation/maintenance of the cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hearn et al., 2005</xref>). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of its function remain poorly understood. We found that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Alms1a exhibits a unique asymmetric localization between mother and daughter centrosomes in GSCs, in which the GSC mother centrosomes have a higher amount of Alms1a than the GSC daughter centrosome. We found that <italic>alms1a</italic> depletion leads to a failure in centrosome replication, due to a failure to duplicate centrioles (the core of the centrosome), specifically in asymmetrically dividing GSCs. In contrast, <italic>alms1a</italic> is not required for centriole duplication in symmetrically dividing differentiating cells and GSCs induced to divide symmetrically. We show that Alms1a physically interacts with Sak, a key kinase that promotes centriole duplication, preferentially in GSCs. Taken together, our study begins to reveal the unique molecular composition and regulation of stem cell centrosome, paving the way to understand how stem cell centrosome asymmetry may contribute to asymmetric stem cell divisions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Alms1a as a GSC-specific Klp10A interactor</title><p>We previously reported that Klp10A, a microtubule-depolymerizing kinesin of kinesin-13 family, is enriched on GSC centrosomes, but not the centrosomes of differentiating germ cells (i.e. GBs and SGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). We reasoned that identifying Klp10A-interacting proteins may uncover proteins that regulate the asymmetric behavior of the mother and/or daughter centrosomes in GSCs. As Klp10A localizes to the central spindle of all germ cells in addition to its GSC-specific centrosome localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we compared the results of anti-Klp10A immunopurification-mass spectrometry analysis using GSC-enriched extract vs. SG-enriched extract. We immunopurified Klp10A from testis extract that is enriched for either (1) GSCs due to the overexpression of the self-renewal factor, Upd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kiger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tulina and Matunis, 2001</xref>) or (2) SGs due to the overexpression of Dpp, a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bunt and Hime, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schulz et al., 2004</xref>). We reasoned that GSC centrosome-specific proteins would be enriched in the Klp10A-pulldown from GSC-enriched extracts compared to the Klp10A-pulldown from SG-enriched extracts.</p><p>Using this approach, we identified 260 candidates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), including two homologs of <italic>Alstrom syndrome (Alms) 1</italic>, a causal gene for a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by childhood obesity and sensory impairment, categorized as multiorgan ciliopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>). The mammalian Alms1 protein was previously shown to localize to centrosomes and basal bodies of the primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hearn et al., 2005</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes two <italic>Alms1</italic> homologs, juxtaposed to each other on the X chromosome, which we named <italic>alms1a (CG12179</italic>) and <italic>alms1b (CG12184)</italic>. The peptide sequences identified by our mass-spectrometry analysis were identical between these two proteins. We raised specific antibodies against Alms1a and Alms1b, and found that Alms1a localized to centrosomes in all germ cells (GSCs to spermatids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereas Alms1b was not expressed until a late stage of spermatogenesis and localized to the basal body of elongating spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Therefore, Alms1a is likely the relevant Klp10A interactor in GSCs: accordingly, we focused on Alms1a in this study.</p><p>Alms1a and Klp10A co-immunoprecipitated in GSC-enriched extract but not in SG-enriched extract, confirming that Alms1a is a GSC-specific Klp10A interactor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that this physical interaction between Alms1a and Klp10A is direct, and mediated via Alms1a’s conserved C-terminal region (‘ALMS motif’), as demonstrated by pulldown of the GST-fusion protein expressed in bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>) as well as by a bacterial two hybrid method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We further assessed the interaction between Alms1a and Klp10A using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2002</xref>), which reveals protein-protein interactions in vivo via reconstitution of a functional Venus YFP from two non-fluorescent fragments (VNm9 and VC155) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Saka et al., 2007</xref>).

The lack of BiFC signals in the GB and SG serves as an internal negative control and confirms that the interaction between Alms1a and Klp10A is GSC-specific. These results imply that, although Alms1a localizes to the centrosomes of both GSCs and SGs, Alms1a might have a specific function in GSCs via its interaction with Klp10A.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Alms1a localizes asymmetrically between mother versus daughter centrosomes in male GSCs</title><p>To begin to understand the function of Alms1a, we first examined its centrosomal localization in GSCs and SGs in more detail.

Alms1a localization to the centrosome mostly did not overlap with Centrobin (Cnb), a daughter centriole marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Januschke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D–G</xref>), suggesting that Alms1a might localize to the mother centriole (see below). Detailed examination of Alms1a localization using Lightning confocal microscopy (see Materials and methods) confirmed that Alms1a is a mother centriole protein in GSCs and GBs/SGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–N</xref>). Ana1 is a core centriole protein required for centrosome assembly and is known to localize to the mother centriole in early interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goshima et al., 2007</xref>), whereas Cp110 localizes to the distal end of both mother and daughter centrioles, where it ‘caps’ the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delgehyr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). We found that Alms1a localizes to the proximal end of the mother centriole: it localizes to the Ana1-positive centriole (e.g. mother centriole) at the opposite end compared to CP110, which is at the distal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M,N</xref>). Its localization to the proximal end was clearly visible in the spermatocytes (SCs), where much longer centrioles allowed easier distinction of distal vs. proximal ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>).</p><p>In addition to this localization at the proximal end of the mother centriole, Alms1a appeared to extend toward the proximal end of the daughter centriole specifically in the GSC mother centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). This localization likely accounts for a higher amount of Alms1a at the GSC mother centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D,K</xref>). However, the Lightning microscopy did not resolve whether Alms1a at the mother and daughter centrioles are continuous or distinct entities. To achieve better resolution, we used stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution microscopy: the mother centriole was marked by Asl, which is known to surround the mother centriole in a ring shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The Asl ring observed in GSC centrosomes matches to the dimension of the Asl ring reported in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galletta et al., 2016</xref>).

Together, these results demonstrate that Alms1a localizes to the mother and daughter centrioles at the GSC mother centrosomes, but only to the mother centrioles elsewhere, generating an asymmetry between mother vs. daughter centrosomes of GSCs.</p><p>It should be noted that, although Klp10A was reported to be more concentrated at the distal end of the centriole in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delgehyr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Riparbelli et al., 2018</xref>), Klp10A exhibits pan centrosomal (broadly pericentrosomal) localization in GSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). We suggest that Klp10A-Alms1a interaction likely occurs at the proximal end of the centrioles, where Alms1a is most concentrated, although other possibilities as to the site of their functional interaction cannot be excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Depletion of <italic>alms1a</italic> leads to centrosome loss due to defective centriole duplication</title><p>To understand the function of <italic>alms1a</italic>, we examined the phenotypes arising from depletion of <italic>alms1a</italic>.

The partial rescue may be due to an insufficient level of transgene expression, as <italic>nos-gal4</italic> often causes variable expression levels among cells. Alternatively, GFP-tagging of Alms1a in the rescue transgene may partially compromise its functionality, although GFP-tagged Alms1a exhibits identical localization pattern as endogenous Alms1a detected by antibody staining. Also, the possibility of off-target effect of RNAi construct cannot be entirely excluded, although it is unlikely, given that the target sequence of <italic>alms1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> does not have any other similar sequences within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome.</p><p>Knockdown of <italic>alms1a</italic> (<italic>nos-gal4&gt;UAS-alms1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>, whereby RNAi is induced starting from embryogenesis) resulted in the complete loss of centrosomes from all germ cells, except for the mother centrosomes in GSCs, suggesting that <italic>alms1a</italic> is required for generating new centrosomes/centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Wild-type GSCs normally contain mother and daughter centrosomes, each of which contains both mother and daughter centrioles, throughout the cell cycle, due to early duplication of the centrosome right after the previous mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, many <italic>alms1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> GSCs contained only one centrosome (i.e. mother), visualized by Asl as well as γ-Tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

In control GSCs, the daughter-centriole-specific protein Cnb always marked both mother and daughter centrosomes, as expected because both centrosomes contain a daughter centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,H</xref>). However, upon knockdown of <italic>alms1a</italic>, Cnb is lost or diminished from the mother centrosome prior to centrosome loss: when GSCs still contained two γ-Tubulin-positive centrosomes, the mother centrosome lacked Cnb staining, suggesting that it does not contain the daughter centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). Based on these results, we infer that centriole duplication is compromised in GSCs upon <italic>alms1</italic> depletion: mother centriole (lacking Cnb) and daughter centriole (marked by Cnb) of the GSC mother centrosome likely split from each other, and segregate into GSC and GB, respectively, without duplicating centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). In the following cell cycle, the GSCs that are incapable of duplicating centrioles will continue to divide without passing any new centrosomes to GBs.

In contrast to control GSCs, which contain two centrosomes, each of which contains two centrioles marked by Cp110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I,K</xref>), <italic>alms1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> GSCs contained only one centrosome, which contains only one centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>alms1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> compromises centriole duplication.

Interestingly, we found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>alms1a</italic> in GSCs resulted in the excessive enrichment of both Sak and Sas-6 at the elongated mother centriole that remains after all other centrosomes are depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–K</xref>). The excess amount of Sak and Sas-6 on the remaining mother centriole in <italic>alms1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> GSCs may explain why it continues to elongate. In parallel, the accumulation of Sak and Sas-6 on the mother centriole may deplete Sak and Sas-6 from the site of the daughter centriole production, leading to the failure in daughter centriole duplication. Therefore, the GSC-specific function of Alms1a may be to promote daughter centriole duplication by recruiting Sak to the ‘seeding site’ for daughter centriole duplication (see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Asymmetric behaviors between mother and daughter centrosomes have been observed in asymmetrically dividing stem cells in several systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conduit and Raff, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Habib et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Januschke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>), provoking the idea that these centrosome asymmetries may contribute to asymmetric cell fates. Here, we identified a centrosomal protein Alms1a, a homolog of a causative gene of human ciliopathy Alstrom syndrome, that exhibits asymmetric localization between mother and daughter centrosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> male GSCs. Alms1a is required for centriole duplication specifically in GSCs, but not in differentiating cells, demonstrating the unique regulation of centrosomes in asymmetrically dividing stem cells.</p><p>Although the exact molecular mechanism of Alms1a function remains elusive, a few lines of observations imply its possible function. Alms1a localizes to the mother centriole in all centrosomes, but in GSCs it also localizes to the daughter centriole specifically in the mother centrosome, where it interacts with Sak and Sas-6. Importantly, Alms1a’s function is required in GSCs but not SGs, thus this GSC-specific localization at daughter centriole of the mother centrosome is likely what is required for centriole duplication in GSCs. Therefore, we postulate that Alms1a may promote daughter centriole duplication by recruiting Sak (and Sas-6), to the daughter centriole of the GSC mother centrosome.</p><p>Why is Alms1a only required in asymmetrically dividing GSCs for centriole duplication? Given that <italic>alms1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> leads to excessive overgrowth of mother centriole of the GSC mother centrosome at the expense of the daughter centriole duplication, it is tempting to speculate that Alms1a is required to ‘discourage’ mother centriole’s growth and ‘encourage’ daughter centrioles generation/growth. Indeed, upon <italic>alms1a</italic> depletion, the mother centriole gradually elongates and accumulates excessive amounts of Sak and Sas-6, while failing at daughter centriole duplication. Perhaps to ensure correct centrosome positioning, the mother centriole of the mother centrosome in GSCs may have a stronger microtubule nucleation activity, which may interfere with production of new centrioles. This imbalance between mother strength and daughter duplication may be achieved by Alms1a. Such a scenario would explain why Alms1a is required specifically in asymmetrically dividing GSCs, although the underlying molecular mechanisms on how Alms1a may achieve this remains elusive.</p><p>A recent study identified Ninein as a protein that specifically localizes to the daughter centrosome when overexpressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts and male GSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>), although no phenotypic consequences were detected upon its depletion, leaving the role of its asymmetric localization unknown. Our Klp10A pull down did not identify Ninein, it will be of interest to study how Klp10A and Alms1a may be functionally related to Ninein.</p><p>In summary, our study identified Alms1a as a protein that exhibits asymmetric localization between mother and daughter centrosomes of GSCs. We demonstrate that <italic>alms1a</italic> is uniquely required for centriole duplication in asymmetrically dividing stem cells. This specific requirement of <italic>alms1a</italic> only in a subset of cell types (e.g. asymmetrically dividing adult stem cells) may partly explain the reported late-onset nature of Alstrom syndrome, which exhibits symptoms progressively during childhood, as opposed to many other ciliopathies that are associated with disease symptoms at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braun and Hildebrandt, 2017</xref>). Our study revealed that GSC centrosomes are indeed under unique regulation, involving GSC centrosome-specific proteins Klp10A and Alms1a. The identification of these proteins (Alms1a, Klp10A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2016</xref>] and Ninein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>]) paves the way to understand how asymmetric behavior of centrosomes contributes to asymmetric stem cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Transgenic flies were generated using PhiC31 integrase-mediated transgenesis at the P{CarryP}attP40 (FBti0114379) or P{CarryP}attP2 (FBst0008622) integration sites (BestGene).</p><p>Recombinant protein expression and GST pull-down assays cDNAs for <italic>alms1a</italic>, <italic>klp10A</italic>, <italic>sak</italic> and <italic>sas-6</italic> were purchased from Drosophila Genomics Resource center as described above. Full-length or fragments of these genes were generated by PCR amplification of the cDNAs. For the construction of <italic>pGEX-alms1a-C</italic>, the <italic>alms1a-C</italic> fragment was PCR-amplified from cDNA, and subcloned into BamHI/NotI sites of pGEX-4T-LP (Addgene). Glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-tagged Alms1a-C (1115-1322aa) or GST alone as a control were expressed in Rosetta (DE3) competent cells (Novagen). For the construction of pMCSG7-<italic>klp10A</italic>, pMCSG7-<italic>sak</italic> and pMCSG7-<italic>sas-6</italic>, full-length genes were amplified from cDNAs, and subcloned into KpnI/EcoRI, KpnI/NotI and KpnI/BamHI sites of pMCSG7 (Addgene), respectively. N-terminal 6xHis-tagged <italic>klp10A, sak</italic> and <italic>sas-6</italic> were expressed in Rosetta competent cells as described above. Cells were grown at 37°C in Terrific Broth (TB) (Millipore) in the presence of ampicillin (100 μg/mL). After optical density (OD) values reaches to 0.6, protein expression was induced by isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.3 mM for an additional 20 hr at 16°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min, and lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40 and 5% glycerol) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1 mM phenylmethyl sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF). The immunoprecipitations between Alms1a-C and Klp10A/Sak/Sas-6 were performed by in vitro GST pull-down assay using Pierce GST Protein Interaction Pull-Down kit (Thermo Scientific). The cell lysates were incubated for 30 min at 4°C followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. GST and GST-Alms1a-C lysates with equal total protein level were incubated with glutathione agarose beads for 1 hr at 4°C, and washed three times in lysis buffer. Then, His-Klp10A, His-Sak and His-Sas-6 lysates with equal total protein level were incubated with washed beads for 2 hr at 4°C, and washed five times in lysis buffer. Before the last wash, the beads were moved to a fresh tube, and eluted with 2xLaemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and Western blot were then conducted to examine the protein interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Bacterial two-hybrid analysis</title><p>The bacterial two-hybrid analysis was performed to detect direct protein-protein interactions using bacterial adenylate cyclase-based two-hybrid, BACTH systems (Euromedex). For the construction of <italic>pKNT-alms1a</italic>, the <italic>alms1a</italic> full-length was PCR-amplified from cDNA, and subcloned into HindIII/SmaI sites of <italic>pKNT</italic>25. For the construction of <italic>pUT-klp10A</italic>, <italic>pUT-sak</italic> and <italic>pUT-sas-6</italic>, full-length genes were amplified from cDNAs, and subcloned into KpnI/EcoRI, PstI/KpnI and KpnI/EcoRI sites of <italic>pUT18C</italic>, respectively. Two recombinant plasmids encoding <italic>alms1a-T25</italic> and <italic>T18-klp10A</italic>/<italic>T18-sak/T18-sas-6</italic> are co-transformed into BTH101 competent cells. Transformants are plated on MacConkey selective plate in the presence of maltose, ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and kanamycin (50 μg/mL), and incubated at 30°C for 24 hr. Complementation can be detected as red colonies on the MacConkey-maltose (Sigma) plates, while colonies will be colorless if no interaction occurs. Co-transformation of pKT25-zip and pUT18C-zip with BTH101 competent cells was used as a positive control. Co-transformation of pKNT25 or pUT18C with one of the recombinant plasmids served as negative controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> testes were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), transferred to 4% formaldehyde in PBS and fixed for 30 min. The testes were then washed in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100) for at least 30 min, followed by incubation with primary antibody in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST at 4°C overnight. Samples were washed for 60 min (three 20 min washes) in PBST, incubated with secondary antibody in 3% BSA in PBST at 4°C overnight, washed as above, and mounted in VECTASHIELD with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Labs).</p><p>The primary antibodies used were as follows: rat anti-Vasa (1:20; developed by A. Spradling and D.

Gatti); chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Aves Labs). Anti-Alms1a and Alms1b antibody were generated by injecting peptides (QEMEVEPKKQLEKEQHQNDMQQGEPKGREC) and (CNISQRGNHLEKIE) into guinea pigs (Covance). Affinity purification was used to purify the antibodies. Specificity of the antibodies was validated by the lack of staining in <italic>alms1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Anti-Centrobin antibody was generated by injecting a peptide (GRPSRELHGMVHSTPKSGSVEPLRHRPLDDNIC) into rabbits (Covance). Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies) were used with a dilution of 1:200. Images were taken using an upright Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with a 63 × oil immersion objective (NA = 1.4) and processed using Adobe Photoshop software. As necessary, better resolution was obtained with HyVolution/Lightning on TCS SP8 confocal microscopy or STED imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting</title><p>For immunoprecipitation using <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis lysate, testes enriched with GSCs due to ectopic Upd expression (100 pairs/sample) were dissected into PBS at room temperature within 30 min.

Using a biochemical approach, they identify Alms1a as an interactor of Klp10A, a protein they previously showed to be enriched on centrosomes of male germline stem cells (GSC). They show that Alms1a exhibits asymmetric localization between mother and daughter centrosomes in GSCs, with enrichment on the mother centrosome compared to the daughter centrosome. Using super-resolution imaging, they show that Alms1a localizes to the proximal region of the mother centriole and extends toward the proximal end of the daughter centriole specifically in the GSC mother centrosome. Depletion of Alms1a in vivo during stem cell proliferation resulted in centriole duplication defects, which was specifically associated with asymmetrically dividing GSCs, resulting in loss of centrosomes over time/cell division. Finally, using a combination of biochemical and fluorescence microscopy methods (e.g. BiFC), they demonstrate that Alms1a interacts with key components of the centriole duplication pathway, including Sak and Sas6, to regulate centriole assembly in these stem cells.</p><p>The manuscript contains a lot of interesting data and valid points. The discovery of a potential cell type specific centriole duplication factor is very interesting, of broad interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic> and thus well worth reporting. The story is consistent with prior results from this lab (and others) that highlight asymmetric behaviors between mother and daughter centrosomes in asymmetrically-dividing stem cells across several systems. On the other hand, mechanistic insights and their interpretation as to how Alms1 would execute this function are as is not straightforward. The proposed model that Alsm1a is a male GSC specific factor that specifically regulates daughter centriole duplication by being present on the daughter centriole within the mother centrosome needs additional support and could benefit, if possible, from more super-resolution data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main observation is based on one RNAi line causing the phenotype. It would be important to add additional controls, a rescue or perhaps the use of a different RNAi line, or a mutant. In addition to the rescue with full-length protein, the authors can attempt the rescue experiment using the C-terminal fragment of the gene, since they suggest this is the key motif sufficient for interactions with both Klp10 at GSC centrosome, and for &quot;recruiting&quot; Sak during centriole duplication. Both points could be addressed with this one approach.</p><p>2) Furthermore, while the central observation is remarkable, the study is somewhat preliminary in terms of the molecular mechanism. Refining the localization of Alms1a (and its C-terminal fragment) using a quantitative approach (potentially via STED or another superresolution imaging modality) would also strengthen the conclusion about the relative localization at mother vs daughter centrioles. At the same time, they can use this method to check the status of mother vs daughter centrioles in Alms1a-depleted cells.</p><p>3) Figure 6, the overexpression of Alms1 and Sak give rise to extra centrosomes even if Sak alone only results in a milder effect. This is very interesting as Sak over-expression is normally sufficient to generate extra centrosomes. However, the centrosomes in the panel Sak, Alms1 (Figure 6D) have different sizes and Asl intensities. Are the authors sure that they all represent extra bona fide centrosomes? Maybe using other centriole markers, such as Sas4, would be useful.</p><p>4) Finally, additional quantifications and controls (e.g. for the bipartide system to detect protein interactions) indicated in specific comments of the reviewers below would be important.</p><p>We include below specific comments of individual reviewers for more background.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) The authors say &quot;RNAi-mediated depletion of klp10A leads to abnormal elongation of the mother centrosomes in GSCs&quot;. Do they mean mother centriole? Or are both mother and daughter centrioles of the mother centrosome elongated? This also applies to Figure 3C-D, where the authors suggest &quot;elongated mother centrosomes&quot; upon Alms1 depletion. Based on the centriole duplication defect, I imagine they are referring to the existing mother centriole as being elongated.</p><p>2) Figure 1E-F: The authors demonstrate interaction between Alms1a C-terminal motif with Klp10a, indicating this domain is sufficient. Did they test whether the N-terminus plays a role in this too? There are a number of centrosomal proteins that can interact via multiple domains.</p><p>3) Figure 2: Is the C-terminal domain of Alms1a, if expressed in the GSC, still show asymmetric association between mother and daughter centrosomes?</p><p>4) Figure 2—figure supplement 1A: The authors show that klp10A-RNAi did not affect Alms1a localization to the SG centrosomes. Did they quantify the relative signal intensity between mother and daughter (since depletion of Klp10A does not cause mislocalization of Alms1a from centrosomes in GSCs completely either)?</p><p>5) Figure 5: Similar to Figure 1, they show interaction between Alms1a C-terminal motif with Sak, but not with Sas6. Did they identify interaction with Sas6 via the N-terminal half of Alms1a?</p><p>6) Figure 6: The authors say &quot;These results suggest that Alms1a promotes centrosome duplication together with Sak, possibly by recruiting Sak to the site of centriole duplication in GSCs&quot;. Do the authors know whether Alm1a is phosphorylated, and if so, is this Sak-dependent (since Sak's role in centriole duplication is typically mediated via phosphorylation)?</p><p>7) Figure 6: Importantly, if Alms1a's role in duplication is merely to recruit Sak, then one experiment to test that would be to express the C-terminal domain of Alms1a (which they show to be sufficient for interaction), to see if it can rescue the centriole duplication defect in Alms1a-depleted cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>1) In S-phase both the mother and daughter centrosomes of GSCs contain normally both a set of two centrioles. When centriole duplication is triggered again, both centrioles within the mother centrosome should be competent to duplicate. The data supporting that Alms1a regulates duplication of a specific type of centrioles are currently not strong. Cnb depletion in mother centrioles in GSCs is not quantified. Given that cnb mutant germ line cells do have centrioles despite basal body length regulation problems in spermatocytes (Reina, JCB 2018), it is not clear what depleted Cnb in the Alms1 RNAi GSCs means. While a possibility, it does not demonstrate per se that centriole duplication has not occurred. There is further no solid evidence to support that the mother centriole within the mother centrosome keeps duplicating when Alms1a is depleted, while the daughter centriole does not (appears also unlikely given the morphological changes (elongation) detected. The results point out that Alsm1a localizes to the proximal end of the mother centriole and does not overlap with Cnb, yet the discussion summarizes &quot;Importantly, Alms1a's function is required in GSCs but not SGs, thus this GSC-specific localization at daughter centriole of the mother centrosome is likely what is required for centriole duplication.&quot; I got confused here and think that the rationale here needs to be better worked out.</p><p>2) Within the GSC centrosomes, would two rings of Asl in GSCs be expected normally in S-phase? This is what Figure 2C, D suggest. However, one Asl ring seems to be detected in Figure 2F, G (SG cells) and in Figure 2O-Q (GSCs). It is possible that Asl labels the wall of only one centriole, despite two centrioles being present as at least in embryos Asl is only incorporated in the new daughter later in the centriole duplication cycle (e.g. Raff lab). Thorough quantifications of the localization of Asl signal (one or two centriole walls detected) is missing. This might be of relevance to assign centriole specific roles, especially as statements on the precise point of the cell and the centriole duplication cycle are tough to make in the system and could potentially be a confounding factor. Is there any way to control that rule that out? It is a pity that the STED analysis had not been extended to measure centrioles upon Alms1a depletion. STED on Asl, Alsm1a and Cnb in controls and upon Alms1 depletion in GSCs plus quantification might be desirable to better understand how loss of a specific pool/enrichment of Alms1 might drive a particular function at a given location.</p><p>3) Faulty centriole duplication is a likely possibility of centriole loss here, but centrioles could also be destabilized (fragmented and then lost). Can that be excluded? Especially since the gal80ts experiment revealed that after 4 days almost half of the GSCs appear to be centrosome less (Figure 3H model points at loss of centrosomes from GSCs), while in the nosGa4 driven depletion the conclusion is the GSCs specifically retain centrosomes (quantification missing). Or is mother centrosome anchoring depending on Alms1a? In my understanding the mother centrosome is &quot;immortal&quot; when properly anchored in this system.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>1) Alms1 RNAi. The authors show indeed a clear reduction by western blot. Did they rescue the depletion? Even if Alms RNAi results in lower levels, they should show that the phenotypes obtained are only due to this depletion. Using a resistant line or a mutation that can be rescued by Alms1 transgene will show this.</p><p>2) Figure 2L, not sure I agree with the interpretation of Alms1 being localized to the proximal site of the two centrioles in the mother centrosome. Maybe super resolution will help and drawing line scans to illustrate the fluorescence intensity distribution?</p><p>3) Figure 5E, I am not sure I am interpreting this western blot correctly. While I can see in the IP for Sak the pull down of GST- Alms1 (Figure 5D), in the Sas-6 lane, this is not the case.</p><p>4) The bipartide system to detect interactions- VNm9. I wonder if all the controls are included in the quantifications. Because in Figure 5L the interaction in mother GSCs is more prominent, but still is not zero in the other centrosomes. Does it mean that they do not interact or that they interact with more molecules in the mother centrosome?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Alstrom syndrome gene is a stem cell-specific regulator of centriole duplication in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

All reviewers agreed that the paper has been improved and many comments were satisfactorily addressed. However, there are some remaining points that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The rescue experiment deserves some additional attention. The experimental setup used here shows that the RNAi line targets Alms1a, but it does not seem to conclusively show that only targets this gene. Alms1a-GFP in the RNAi background only partially restores the normal centrosome number of 2 centrosomes per cell. According to the data included in Figure 1—figure supplement 3, all control cells have 2 centrosomes, and in Alms1a RNAi, the large majority has zero and around 25% contain 1 centrosome. While Alms1a-GFP does not cause a change in centrosome number, in the RNAi background, only 25% of the cells contain 2 centrosomes. It is true that there is a decrease in the percentage of cells showing zero centrosomes, but this could be due to the excess of Alms1a-GFP and therefore reduced effect of the RNAi. Therefore, there was a concern that these data are insufficient to prove specificity of the RNAi used, and that the RNAi line is depleting other genes responsible for the phenotypes. Ideally, one would like to see characterization of another RNAi line or a mutation that can be fully rescued by the GFP line. Alternatively, one could generate a GFP line that it is not targeted by the RNAi. If this is not possible, the reviewers would like to see proof that in the rescue experiments, the depletion of the endogenous Alms1a not affected by the expression of Alms1a-GFP and some detailed discussion about the quality of the rescue experiment, which should get a more prominent place in the paper.</p><p>2) The point that Alms1a RNAi leads to the loss of the diplosome configuration of the GSC centrosomes is not demonstrated with sufficient clarity (if one looks closely there is a faint CNB signal at the mother centrosome). Therefore, it appears problematic to obtain sufficiently conclusive data with CNB as a marker. The authors should provide conclusive, quantified experimental evidence about centriole numbers per centrosome in GSCs upon knock down of Alsm1a (as in Figure 3F,G and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). The reviewers suggest using STED looking for cell cycle dependent ASL signal that allows visualizing the diplosome. The authors have now done this in controls (from where it appears that anaphase is suitable), but not in the relevant experimental conditions. These data should be included.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59368.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main observation is based on one RNAi line causing the phenotype.

Full-length Alms1a protein is able to rescue the RNAi phenotype partially (possibly because of variable expression levels, whereby the expression level does not reach to a sufficient level in some cells/tissues). ALMS motif alone failed to rescue the RNAi phenotype. Even if this motif may be an essential domain to interact with Klp10A and Sak, it does not mean that this motif would be sufficient for Alms1a function(s) as the remaining region might mediate other essential functions such as linking Klp10A/Sak to something else.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Furthermore, while the central observation is remarkable, the study is somewhat preliminary in terms of the molecular mechanism.

Alms1a localizes to both mother and daughter centriole specifically in GSC mother centrosome as we stated. At the daughter centriole of the mother centrosome, it completely colocalizes with Cnb. We also included spermatocytes’ centrosome (Figure 2O) to show that Alms1a indeed localizes to the proximal side of the centriole.</p><p>The status of mother vs daughter centrioles in wild type and alms1RNAi GSCs has been examined with centrosome markers Cp110 and Asl using Lightning microscopy (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Cp110 marks both mother and daughter centrioles in interphase wild type GSCs, consistent with previous studies that in GSCs centriole duplication occurs immediately after centrioles disengage. (Note that, this is in contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblast, where mother and daughter centrioles each organize centrosome without duplicating centrioles for quite some time during the cell cycle.) In contrast to wild type centrosomes, where two Cp110 dots were always observed, there is only one Cp110 spot on the elongated mother centrosome upon Alms1a depletion, suggesting that elongated centrosome is made of a single, elongated mother centriole, and there is no daughter centriole. Accordingly, many core centriole proteins and PCM proteins including Sak, Sas6, Ana1, Asl and g-Tub observed on “elongated mother centrosome” reflects their localization to the mother centriole (Figure 3 and 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 6, the overexpression of Alms1 and Sak give rise to extra centrosomes even if Sak alone only results in a milder effect.

It is possible that Asl labels the wall of only one centriole, despite two centrioles being present as at least in embryos Asl is only incorporated in the new daughter later in the centriole duplication cycle (e.g. Raff lab). Thorough quantifications of the localization of Asl signal (one or two centriole walls detected) is missing. This might be of relevance to assign centriole specific roles, especially as statements on the precise point of the cell and the centriole duplication cycle are tough to make in the system and could potentially be a confounding factor. Is there any way to control that rule that out? It is a pity that the STED analysis had not been extended to measure centrioles upon Alms1a depletion. STED on Asl, Alsm1a and Cnb in controls and upon Alms1 depletion in GSCs plus quantification might be desirable to better understand how loss of a specific pool/enrichment of Alms1 might drive a particular function at a given location.</p></disp-quote><p>In GSC centrosomes, Asl labels only the wall of mother centriole at interphase. Also the above-mentioned centrosome composition/centriole duplication timing in GSCs may now clarify some of confusions, and we hope that most of issues are clarified for this reviewer. In addition, STED analysis of the Asl localization has been performed and the results are shown as Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Faulty centriole duplication is a likely possibility of centriole loss here, but centrioles could also be destabilized (fragmented and then lost). Can that be excluded? Especially since the gal80ts experiment revealed that after 4 days almost half of the GSCs appear to be centrosome less (Figure 3H model points at loss of centrosomes from GSCs), while in the nosGa4 driven depletion the conclusion is the GSCs specifically retain centrosomes (quantification missing). Or is mother centrosome anchoring depending on Alms1a? In my understanding the mother centrosome is &quot;immortal&quot; when properly anchored in this system.</p></disp-quote><p>The mother centrosome show ~95% of anchoring near the niche even in wild type, which means that the mother centrosome can be lost to differentiating cells at some frequency (not 100% “immortal”). After 4 days, which is 6-8 cell cycles, it is not surprising that significant population of GSCs have lost the centrosomes. Although the possibility of centriole destabilization may not be entirely excluded, given that the mother centrioles are stable enough (such that they can elongate so long) rather seems to favor the possibility of centriole loss. Also, we hope that the added revision experiments and explanations above clarify this reviewer’s concern on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>1) Alms1 RNAi. The authors show indeed a clear reduction by western blot. Did they rescue the depletion? Even if Alms RNAi results in lower levels, they should show that the phenotypes obtained are only due to this depletion. Using a resistant line or a mutation that can be rescued by Alms1 transgene will show this.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue was addressed in the Essential revision point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2L, not sure I agree with the interpretation of Alms1 being localized to the proximal site of the two centrioles in the mother centrosome. Maybe super resolution will help and drawing line scans to illustrate the fluorescence intensity distribution?</p></disp-quote><p>The added revision experiments hopefully address this concern. Also, we added Alms1a localization in the spermatocytes, where much longer centrioles help visualize proximal vs. distal sides of centrioles (new Figure 2O). This clearly showed that Alms1a localizes at the proximal end of the centrioles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5E, I am not sure I am interpreting this western blot correctly. While I can see in the IP for Sak the pull down of GST- Alms1 (Figure 5D), in the Sas-6 lane, this is not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Correct. Sas-6 doesn’t interact with Alms1a C-ter, which is our conclusion (Sas-6 and Alms1a interacts in the GSC extract, but not via GST-pulldown using bacterial extract. Based on this, we concluded that Sas-6-Alms1a interaction is indirect).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The bipartide system to detect interactions- VNm9. I wonder if all the controls are included in the quantifications. Because in Figure 5 L the interaction in mother GSCs is more prominent, but still is not zero in the other centrosomes. Does it mean that they do not interact or that they interact with more molecules in the mother centrosome?</p></disp-quote><p>Quantifications of controls have been added in Figure 5L. There is no detectable BiFC signals in controls (both nos&gt;alms1a-VNm9 and nos&gt;Vc155-sak).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The rescue experiment deserves some additional attention. The experimental setup used here shows that the RNAi line targets Alms1a, but it does not seem to conclusively show that only targets this gene. Alms1a-GFP in the RNAi background only partially restores the normal centrosome number of 2 centrosomes per cell. According to the data included in Figure 1—figure supplement 3, all control cells have 2 centrosomes, and in Alms1a RNAi, the large majority has zero and around 25% contain 1 centrosome. While Alms1a-GFP does not cause a change in centrosome number, in the RNAi background, only 25% of the cells contain 2 centrosomes. It is true that there is a decrease in the percentage of cells showing zero centrosomes, but this could be due to the excess of Alms1a-GFP and therefore reduced effect of the RNAi. Therefore, there was a concern that these data are insufficient to prove specificity of the RNAi used, and that the RNAi line is depleting other genes responsible for the phenotypes. Ideally, one would like to see characterization of another RNAi line or a mutation that can be fully rescued by the GFP line. Alternatively, one could generate a GFP line that it is not targeted by the RNAi. If this is not possible, the reviewers would like to see proof that in the rescue experiments, the depletion of the endogenous Alms1a not affected by the expression of Alms1a-GFP and some detailed discussion about the quality of the rescue experiment, which should get a more prominent place in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We should have been clearer, but as was explained in the Materials and methods section, our rescue transgene is already RNAi-resistant. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the introduction of transgene is weakening the RNAi effect, as the reviewers were concerned. Also, please note that the RNAi line that we used is from the “TRiP line” series that were designed and generated by Nobert Perrimon’s group, where the target sequence was designed computationally to avoid similarity to any other location of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. The target sequence for this construct is TCGGAAGTAACTCAGACGAAA and upon BLAST search against <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, we do not find any matching sequences except for Alms1a and Alms1b genes. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the RNAi construct we used have unknown off-target effect (expect for targeting Alms1b additionally, because these two genes are almost identical).</p><p>Also, as explained in the manuscript, our attempts to generate any additional RNAi lines (only target Alms1a without targeting Alms1b) have been unsuccessful (we generated 2 lines but none of them efficiently targeted Alms1a).</p><p>Based on these information (in particular, the unlikeliness of off-target effects), our best explanation for partial rescue is the expression level of the transgene. It is widely known that nos-gal4 (the driver that we use for transgene expression) varies in expression level among cells. As necessary, we can add additional discussions in the main text to add caveats of our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional Editor comment for Essential revision 1</p><p>Rescue: please make sure to explain in the main text how the rescue was done and include all the data pertaining to the rescue in the main figures. Please discuss all the various potential reasons explaining why the rescue is not complete (insufficient expression levels of the rescue construct, problems with the GFP fusion, etc). Since the rescue is incomplete, potential off-target effects of the RNAi remain a distinct possibility and must be included in the discussion - please soften your conclusions accordingly, and make sure that this possibility is very explicitly mentioned and will be obvious to the readers of the manuscript. With other words, you must clearly state in the manuscript that you cannot be sure that the phenotypes described are unambiguously linked to the lack of Alms1a function.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the explanation in the main text in the Result section about these possibilities. With this addition of the text clearly describing caveats etc., we wish to keep the rescue data in the supplementary figures, simply because the data are too bulky to be included in the main figures. With a clear explanation in the text, this information (only partial rescue) is not hidden, and we believe that it is sufficient for transparency. On the contrary, we are concerned that the insertion of the bulky data into the main figure disrupts the flow of logic: there are many published papers whose entire organization had become very confusing and fragmented as a result of many revision processes, preventing the understanding by general readers. We believe that dissemination of scientific results must be mindful of broad scientific community (current and future), not just for authors and reviewers. By “flow” we do not mean the one that is convenient for us/authors, but the one better for the understanding by readers. If the editor/reviewers feel that the text dealing with experimental caveat is insufficient, we will further edit the text, but we hope that they agree that our treatment of this rescue data by the text provides sufficient transparency.</p><p>We also think that the question pertaining whether ALMS motif only might rescue the phenotype (which is included in this rescue figure) is rather too specific, and inclusion of such data into main figure does not benefit general readers. We added this experiment per reviewers’ request: if the result were to be positive, i.e. ALMS motif was sufficient to rescue the phenotype, it would have added an important knowledge, so we agreed with the reviewers’ point on the potential value of such an experiment. But now that we obtained the completely negative data, addition of such data in the main figure is not warranted. Again, inclusion of such data rather confuses readers, instead of providing better understanding and transparency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The point that Alms1a RNAi leads to the loss of the diplosome configuration of the GSC centrosomes is not demonstrated with sufficient clarity (if one looks closely there is a faint CNB signal at the mother centrosome). Therefore, it appears problematic to obtain sufficiently conclusive data with CNB as a marker. The authors should provide conclusive, quantified experimental evidence about centriole numbers per centrosome in GSCs upon knock down of Alsm1a (as in Figure 3F,G and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). The reviewers suggest using STED looking for cell cycle dependent ASL signal that allows visualizing the diplosome. The authors have now done this in controls (from where it appears that anaphase is suitable), but not in the relevant experimental conditions. These data should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the potential concerns of reviewers on this point. However, we would like to bring their attention to the terminal phenotype of Alms1a-RNAi, as shown in Figure 3C, D, which is clear loss of daughter centrosomes. At this point, as is shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, the already-elongated mother centrosome contains only one Cp110 signal, as opposed to 2 dots/centrosome in the control (if deemed necessary, we can provide the quantification of Cp110 number per centrosome in control vs. Alms1a-RNAi GSCs). This clearly demonstrates that the final phenotype of Alms1a-RNAi is the loss of diplosome configuration. We believe that this is already sufficient to draw our conclusion that Alms1a is required for centriole duplication.</p><p>In this regard, Figure 3 F, G, H are only additional confirmation to our conclusion by capturing the moment of centrosome loss: when the mutant GSCs still contain 2 centrosomes = 2 g-tubulin dots (i.e. before GSCs exhibit the terminal phenotype of having elongated mother centrosome only), the mother centrosome already has a diminished amount (almost none) of Cnb---that’s the only point that we’re trying to convey, and these panels are not the only evidence to support our conclusion (because in the end, clearly the elongated mother centrosome does not have the diplosome configuration). We agree that one can see a tiny amount of Cnb still left on the mother centrosome, but this is clearly much less than the control situation (which has equal amount of Cnb on two centrosomes), and the fact that a tiny amount of Cnb is left on the mother centrosome does not negate our conclusion that the Alms1a-RNAi leads to “compromised daughter centriole generation”.</p><p>Moreover, as the data shown in Figure 3F-H represent “transitional phenotype” (instead of terminal phenotype), when the GSC is “about to lose the daughter centrosome”, capturing the right moment is extremely challenging. Anaphase cells are quite infrequent: Anaphase is &lt;10% of entire mitotic cells, and GSCs’ overall mitotic index is only 2% (of total GSCs), this means that anaphase GSC is only less than 0.2% of entire GSCs. This is still feasible when we’re imaging wild type (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), but when combined with the need to capture the moment of centriole loss (specific time point when RNAi becomes effective), it becomes essentially impossible. Of course, lack of feasibility is not the reason for not needing the result, if the entire conclusion relies on that specific result, but as we outlined above, we believe that our overall conclusion (centriole duplication defect) is already sufficiently supported by Alms1a RNAi’s terminal phenotype (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><p>We can certainly rephrase our main text to convey these points. We sincerely ask reviewers to consider these issues and hope they agree that we do not need additional experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional Editor comment for Essential revision 2</p><p>Conclusive, quantified experimental evidence about centriole numbers per centrosome in GSCs: indeed, please provide the quantification of Cp110 number per centrosome in control vs. Alms1a-RNAi GSCs. Overall, the reviewers have already raised the question about insufficient quantification in the first round of review and were somewhat disappointed by this aspect of the revised paper. Since CNB marker raises concerns, perhaps quantification would be appropriate as well? Again, please make sure that none of this information is &quot;hidden&quot; in the supplements.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the addition of quantification data was not clear enough to reviewers in the first round of the revision. We had added the quantification of Cnb intensity (Figure 3H) per reviewers’ request during the first round of the revision, which shows a very low intensity of Cnb on the mother centrosome in Alms1-RNAi GSCs. In this revised version, we added more emphasis in the text on this aspect. Also Cp110 data was moved to the main Figure as new Figure 3I, J, with additional quantification as new Figure 3K.</p><p>In addition, as explained in our response letter that accompanied the first round of the revision, data quantification had been added to multiple places, addressing all of reviewers’ request during the first round of revision (Figure 5L, Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Therefore, we are somewhat confused by the reviewers’ remarks that they were disappointed by the lack of quantification.</p></body></sub-article></article>
