nucleation and anchorage in animal cells. The subdistal appendage (SDA) is a centriolar structure located at the mother centriole’s subdistal region, and it functions in microtubule anchorage. However, the molecular composition and detailed structure of the SDA remain largely unknown. Here, we identified α-taxilin and γ-taxilin as new SDA components that form a complex via their coiled-coil domains and that serve as a new subgroup during SDA hierarchical assembly. The taxilins’ SDA localization is dependent on ODF2, and α-taxilin recruits CEP170 to the SDA. Functional analyses suggest that α- and γ-taxilin are responsible for SDA structural integrity and centrosomal microtubule anchorage during interphase and for proper spindle orientation during metaphase. Our results shed light on the molecular components and functional understanding of the SDA hierarchical assembly and microtubule organization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>microtubule</kwd><kwd>super-high resolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31630096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jianguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31830110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jianguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31801133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Dandan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0100501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jianguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Super-resolution microscopy, biochemical and functional analyses reveal how α-taxilin and γ-taxilin are assembled at the subdistal appendages and their roles in microtubule organization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The centrosome, the main microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in many eukaryotic cells, participates in microtubule-related activities that include cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cabral et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), cell polarity maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burute et al., 2017</xref>), cell signaling transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barvitenko et al., 2018</xref>), and ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pitaval et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tu et al., 2018</xref>). The centrosome is a non-membrane-bound organelle composed of a pair of orthogonally arranged centrioles and surrounded by pericentriolar material (PCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Delattre and Gönczy, 2004</xref>). The two centrioles, mother and daughter, are distinguished from each other by the decorations at the distal and subdistal ends of the mother centriole, called the distal/subdistal appendages (DAs/SDAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tischer et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Accumulated data have revealed the structural characteristics and functions of DAs and SDAs. DA proteins (i.e. CEP83, CEP89, FBF1, SCLT1, and CEP164) are essential for centriole-to-membrane docking and TTBK2 recruitment that promote ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tanos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Super-resolution microscopy has enabled researchers to identify the precise localization of centrosomal components, including those of the DA and SDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), and it has revealed that SDAs differ from DAs in both molecular composition and intracellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Uzbekov and Alieva, 2018</xref>). Located beneath the DAs, SDAs are composed of ODF2, CEP128, centriolin, NdelI, CCDC68, CCDC120, ninein, and CEP170, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kashihara et al., 2019</xref>), and they are classified into two groups according to their specific localizations. The ODF group (ODF2, CEP128, and centriolin) is localized on SDAs only, whereas the ninein group (ninein, Kif2a, p150glued, CCDC68, CCDC120, and CEP170) are localized on both SDAs and the proximal ends of centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). Of them, ODF2 occupies the bases of both the DAs and SDAs via different domains and thus participates in the hierarchical assembly of both DAs and SDAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tateishi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chong et al., 2020</xref>). Also, ODF2 ensures that microtubules focus properly at the centrosome, which then controls microtubule organization and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hung et al., 2016a</xref>), and centriolin, ninein, CCDC68, and CCDC120 are all required for microtubule stabilization and anchorage at the centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gromley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). The SDA proteins cooperate to form a microtubule anchoring complex that maintains the microtubule array. Although this complex has been well described, most likely other unidentified SDA proteins still exist.</p><p>The taxilin family (i.e. α-taxilin, β-taxilin, and γ-taxilin) have been reported to interact with syntaxin family members and to participate in intracellular vesicle transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nogami et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we have identified α- and γ-taxilin as new SDA structural components. After they are recruited to SDA via ODF2, they form ring-like structures between CCDC120 and ninein, and participate in CEP170 assembly. Like other colleagues in the SDAs, α- and γ-taxilin are involved in microtubule anchorage at the centrosome and are also indispensable for spindle orientation during metaphase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening of α-taxilin and γ-taxilin as new SDA components</title><p>APEX2-mediated proximal labeling is an approach that uses hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) as an oxidant to catalyze biotin-phenol (BP), a small molecular substrate, to produce the reactive BP radical that conjugates to the endogenous proteins that are proximal to APEX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hung et al., 2016b</xref>). To search for new SDA components, we labeled two previously identified SDA components CCDC68 and CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) by infusing them with V5-tagged APEX2. When overexpressed in HeLa cells, the V5 immunostained CCDC68 and CCDC120 fusion proteins showed a ring (top view) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or three dots (side view) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) at the centrosome, results that were consistent with their SDA locations when they had been stained by their specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). After treatment with BP and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the biotinylated endogenous proteins co-localized and encircled V5-tagged CCDC120 or V5-tagged CCDC68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>), thus indicating that APEX2-mediated biotinylation had successfully marked the endogenous proteins around CCDC68 or CCDC120 at the centrosomes. As a negative control, samples without BP or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed no biotinylation signal. Furthermore, immunoblotting results also confirmed the endogenous biotinylated proteins mediated by CCDC68 and CCDC120 proximal labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Finally, the biotinylated proteins were enriched by Streptavidin-coated beads and sent for mass spectrographic (MS) analysis to search for CCDC68 and CCDC120 proximal candidates.</p><p>Among those candidates for CCDC68 and CCDC120 proximal labeling, a series of previously identified centriolar proteins (marked in green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>) were found, and thus verified the efficiency of our centrosomal proteomics approach. Since several centrosomal proteins possess the coiled-coil domain that is the basis for the protein-protein interactions essential for centrosome configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2003</xref>), we focused on proteins containing one or more coiled-coil domains. To determine their sub-cellular localizations, each protein candidate was tagged (e.g. V5, mNeonGreen, or pmEmerald) and expressed in U2OS cells. Other than the already known centrosome proteins, five new proteins, including α-taxilin, DACT1, DRG2, NCAPH2, and SMAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), were found co-localized with centrosome markers CP110 or γ-tubulin, thus proving that they resided on centrosomes. Among them, DRG2 was found in both CCDC68 and CCDC120 proximal candidates; α-taxilin, NCAPH2, and SMAP2 were found in CCDC68 proximal candidates; and DACT1 was found in CCDC120 proximal candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>). A previous study had shown γ-taxilin co-localized with Nek2A at the centrosome during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Makiyama et al., 2018</xref>). The immunofluorescence assay showed it co-localized with γ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), thus confirming its centrosomal localization.</p><p>Among the proteins that showed centrosomal localization, α- and γ-taxilin are similar in that their middle regions each has a long coiled-coil domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Makiyama et al., 2018</xref>). Both the anti-α-taxilin antibody and anti-γ-taxilin antibody, which were designed to recognize the C-terminus of each of those proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>), were chosen to detect their specificities. Immunoblotting results showed that the two proteins’ molecular weights (above 72 kDa for α-taxilin and about 70 kDa for γ-taxilin) were slightly higher than predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). Immunoblotting also detected significant decreases in the amount of those proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>). The immunofluorescence assay showed that α-taxilin and γ-taxilin stained by their antibodies focused prominently at the centrosome, as indicated by their co-localizations with γ-tubulin in human RPE-1 cells. Also, the fluorescence intensities of both taxilins decreased at the centrosome after siRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Those results show both the antibodies’ specialties and the effectiveness of siRNAs.</p><p>Detailed α- and γ-taxilin localization at the centrosome was determined using super-resolution microscopy with a 3D-structured illumination system (SIM). In the G1 phase, the top views of α- and γ-taxilin showed their ring-like patterns encompassing one centrin-3 dot that resides in the distal lumen of centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Middendorp et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The α- and γ-taxilin side views showed three dots occupying two levels with one level (two dots) beside ODF2 and thus at the SDA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), and the other level (one dot) assumed to be at the proximal end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>). Those patterns resembled those of the ninein group, such as ninein and CEP170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, α-taxilin clearly co-localized with the ninein and CEP170 rings in the top view, and with the three ninein and/or CEP170 dots in the side view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>). Corresponding γ-taxilin patterns resembled those of α-taxilin by containing a smaller ring that resided inside the ninein and CEP170 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) images and characterizations of α-taxilin and γ-taxilin at the centrosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunostained α-taxilin (green) and centrin-3 (magenta) in RPE-1 cells transfected with ODF2-Scarlet (red).

So, we investigated whether α-taxilin is involved in recruiting ninein and CEP170 to the SDAs. An endogenous immunoprecipitation assay showed that α-taxilin interacted with CEP170 but not with ninein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

To identify which segment of α-taxilin was responsible for that association, we overexpressed truncated mutants of HA-tagged α-taxilin in HEK-293T cells and mapped the mutants’ interactions with CEP170.

The centrosomal microtubule aster in normal RPE-1 cells was visible 5 min after rewarming; and at 10 min, an extensive array of microtubules centering on the centrosome had formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref><italic>, B and D</italic>). However, the microtubule asters were significantly impaired in the <italic>α-taxilin</italic> and <italic>γ-taxilin</italic> KO RPE-1 cells and the microtubule array densities were obviously less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref><italic>, B and D</italic>).

They play important roles in microtubule organization and spindle arrangement and participate in various biological processes such as cell division and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hall and Hehnly, 2021</xref>). Here, we applied APEX2-mediated proximity-labeling to centrosome proteomics by using CCDC68 and CCDC120 as baits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hung et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). The results show a variety of possible proteins, some of which are known centrosomal proteins like γ-tubulin and γ-taxilin, and several new centrosome-localized proteins are also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>), such as α-taxilin, DACT1, NCAPH2, DRG2, and SMAP2. Among these proteins, α-taxilin and γ-taxilin are both located at the SDA and the proximal end of mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). However, other already known SDA proteins, such as ODF2, ninein and CEP170, are not included in the datasets, probably because of their relatively low levels in the cells (for ODF2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>) or their relatively longer distances from CCDC68 and CCDC120 (for ninein and CEP170, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The SDA is a comprehensive structure that consists of a spreading radial distribution of concentric proteins, and SDA assembly follows a hierarchical relationship based on protein distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chong et al., 2020</xref>). Comparing SDA protein diameters, those of α- and γ-taxilin are larger than those of CCDC68 and CCDC120, but smaller than those of ninein and CEP170. In the longitudinal position, γ-taxilin is relatively higher while α-taxilin is relatively lower than the other SDA proteins. Associated with their relative localization with other SDA proteins, they are supposed to reside in the middle SDA zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Models showing α-taxilin and γ-taxilin localization and assembly in the subdistal appendage (SDA).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A 3D model of a mother centriole, illustrating the localization of various SDA proteins, including ODF2, CCDC68, CCDC120, γ-taxilin, α-taxilin, ninein, and CEP170 in order of increasing diameter size.

DA, distal appendage.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73252-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Among the currently known SDA components, ODF2 is the most closely located to the centriolar microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) and it likely recruits TCHP to assist ninein assembly at the SDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ibi et al., 2011</xref>). The ODF2 1–60 aa N-terminus sequence is responsible for its association with CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). However, this association may not be direct, as a yeast two-hybrid assay indicated. Besides, CCDC68 lies between ODF2 and CEP170, and how CCDC68 is recruited to the SDA is yet unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). Our data suggest that ODF2 recruits α- and γ-taxilin, similarly to how it recruits CCDC120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). Since the ODF2 ring is much smaller than those of both α- and γ-taxilin, most likely the interactions between ODF2 and the taxilins are indirect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). Although TCHP, CCDC68, and CCDC120 lie between ODF2 and the taxilins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>), no interactions among taxilins with those SDA proteins, except for ODF2, are detected by immunoprecipitation assays. Therefore, ODF2 recruits α-taxilin and γ-taxilin through a new pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><p>The functions of SDA components are critical for understanding this structure. Ninein is responsible not only for microtubule nucleation by docking the γ-TuRC at the centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>), but also for forming a microtubule-anchoring complex with CEP170 at the SDA periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pizon et al., 2020</xref>). CCDC68 and CCDC120 also participate in microtubule anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, compromised microtubule reformation following ice-depolymerization was observed in both α-taxilin and γ-taxilin depleted cells, likely because of depressed microtubule anchoring ability, as γ-tubulin intensity at the centrosome is not influenced by either α-taxilin or γ-taxilin siRNA knockdown. Therefore, our data suggest that α-taxilin and γ-taxilin serve as microtubule anchoring regulators at the centrosomes, functioning via a new pathway that is independent of CCDC68, CCDC120, and ninein.</p><p>In addition to acting as microtubule anchoring centers during interphase, SDAs also function as spindle regulators during mitosis. CEP170 interacts with centrosome-associated kinesins such as KIF2A, KIF2C, KIFC3, and spindle microtubule-associated KIF2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Welburn and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maliga et al., 2013</xref>), which regulates spindle assembly and cell morphology. In our study, both α-taxilin and γ-taxilin depletion result in decreased astral microtubule length and increased spindle misorientation. As the hierarchical assembly of γ-taxilin, α-taxilin, and CEP170 is established, we speculate that α-taxilin and γ-taxilin regulate spindle orientation mainly by controlling CEP170’s centrosomal localization. In addition to CEP170, the most upstream SDA protein, ODF2, is shown to regulate spindle orientation via microtubule organization and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hung et al., 2016a</xref>). Spindle disorganization has been extensively correlated with cell differentiation, cancer and neurological diseases such as microcephaly and lissencephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Noatynska et al., 2012</xref>), as well as with tubular organ diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhong and Zhou, 2017</xref>). Whether α- and γ-taxilin are involved in development and diseases needs further investigation.</p><p>Our study mainly investigate the manner of assembly and functions of α-taxilin and γ-taxilin at the SDA, but the specific localization of those proteins, as revealed by super resolution microscopy, also shows proximal signals at centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>) that resembled ninein group patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>). Previously, γ-taxilin is shown, by interacting with mitosis A-related kinase 2 A (Nek2A), to temporally mediate centrosome disjunction before the onset of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Makiyama et al., 2018</xref>). This is consistent with our finding that γ-taxilin knockout also resulted in centrosomal disjunction in RPE-1 and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). Similarly, α-taxilin depletion in RPE-1 and HeLa cells also result in centrosomal disjunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>) that resembles the γ-taxilin phenotype. Therefore, the proximal presence of α-taxilin and γ-taxilin at centrioles may work as centrosome linkers regulating centrosome cohesion, and their proximal end assembly rules need further study.</p><p>In conclusion, our results both show α-taxilin and γ-taxilin to be new SDA proteins and shed new light on how SDAs are assembled. However, other yet unknown components exist at the SDA upper zone and participate in SDA assembly, and they and their functions need to be identified. Additionally, how α-taxilin and γ-taxilin function in development and diseases warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

I am wondering whether the authors found the same phenomenon. From the figures, I could not see this phenotype. The authors should discuss this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors describe a novel pathway of SDA formation from ODF2 to CEP170 via g-Taxillin and a-Taxillin. These Taxillin proteins associate with each other through coiled-coiled domains and are critical for recruiting CEP170 but not Ninein. Importantly, their deficiency is shown to be defective in anchoring MTs, which is very well consistent with their specific localization to SDAs.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have used powerful imaging techniques to analyze the function of g-Taxillin and a -Taxillin and the data presented in the manuscript were well organized and clear-cut to understand.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>However, all the data presented in the manuscript are focused on the immortalized cell lines such as RPE-1 and Hela cells. For example, it is important to reveal the expression pattern of Taxillin genes and their in vivo role in animals. At least, their functional roles should be analyzed in primary cells isolated from appropriate tissues. In addition, it will be great to show the overall morphology of SDAs using TEM to see whether Taxillin ablation results in decreasing the size of each SDA. Based on these major issues, it is very difficult to assess the biological significance of the claims.</p><p>1. Does CEP170 ablation or knock-down recapitulate the phenotype of Taxillin knock-out in MT anchoring?</p><p>2. The authors claim that a-Taxillin does not interact with Ninein in Figure 4A. However, there is a faint band corresponding to endogenous Ninein (lane 3).</p><p>3. The data on EB-1 staining presented in Figure 7F is not sufficiently convincing. Better data would have helped to substantiate the authors' conclusions.</p><p>4. What happens to Hela or RPE-1 cells upon Taxillin ablation? Authors claim that Taxillins are critical for MT anchoring and spindle orientation. So what? How does they affect the cell behavior?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Ma et al. identified α- and γ-taxilin as new subdistal appendage components, reported their role in SDA assembly, organization and examined functional consequences of their cellular loss. They generated proximity maps for known SDA components CCDC68 and CCDC120 using APEX2-based labeling and chose α- and γ-taxilin for further investigation. Using superresolution microscopy, they defined their precise localization at the centriole relative to known SDA components and centriole proximal marker C-Nap1. They then performed depletion or deletion experiments to determine their position in the SDA assembly pathway and found that α- and γ-taxilin localization at the SDA depends on ODF2 and that they are required for centriolar recruitment of CEP170. Finally, they performed loss-of-function experiments and demonstrated that α- and γ-taxilins are required for microtubule anchoring in interphase and mitotic spindle positioning. These findings contribute to our understanding of SDA assembly, organization and function by throughly characterizing two new SDA components. However, these findings do not sufficiently advance our mechanistic understanding of cellular functions and mechanisms of SDAs.</p><p>One major weakness of the manuscript is the lack of mechanistic understanding on how α- and γ-taxilin mediate their functions during microtubule organization and spindle positioning. In particular, the presented data do not distinguish whether these functions are specific to the proximal and/or SDA pools of these proteins. Another weakness of the manuscript is the presentation, analysis and discussion of the APEX2-based proximity labeling data. High confidence proximity interactors of taxilins and their comparative analysis with each other and published datasets have to be presented so the resulting datasets provide a resource for the field in the future.</p><p>Data in manuscript are high quality, rigorous and well-presented. The paper is well-written with a good logical flow. In particular, the authors used multiple approaches to characterize α- and γ-taxilin as SDA components and to define their precise spatial localization and relationship to other SDA proteins. Despite these attributes, however, I am not convinced the results represent sufficient conceptual advance on our understanding of SDA biogenesis and functions. Loss-of-function experiments showed that α- and γ-taxilin are required for microtubule anchoring and spindle positioning, which were phenotypes previously reported for a number of other SDA proteins. The mechanisms that underlie these functions remain elusive. For example, do proximal or SDA pools of these proteins mediate these functions? How do taxilins regulate astral microtubule length? It might be due to potential functions in microtubule nucleation/polymerization, which have not been investigated.</p><p>1 – APEX2-based proximity mapping of CCDC68 and CCDC120 is not covered in the manuscript with sufficient detail (results, methods, discussion).

Do they cooperate during SDA biogenesis, microtuble anchoring and/or spindle positioning or do they function independently? For example, can they restore each other's function in loss-of-function experiments.</p><p>6 – In addition to spindle mispositoning defects, does depletion of α- or γ-taxilin cause other mitotic phenotypes (i.e. mitotic duration, chromosome segregation etc..).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73252.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This work aims to study the subdistal appendage (SA) of the mother centriole.

Previously, γ-taxilin was shown, by interacting with mitosis A-related kinase 2A (Nek2A), to temporally mediate centrosome disjunction before the onset of mitosis (<italic>Makiyama et al., 2018</italic>). This is consistent with our finding that γ-taxilin knockout also resulted in centrosomal disjunction in RPE-1 and HeLa cells (<italic>Figure 4<bold>—</bold>figure supplement 1C-D</italic>; <italic>Figure 7<bold>—</bold>figure supplement 1C-D</italic>). Similarly, α-taxilin depletion in RPE-1 and HeLa cells also resulted in centrosomal disjunction (<italic>Figure 4<bold>—</bold>figure supplement 1E-F</italic>; <italic>Figure 7<bold>—</bold>figure supplement 1E-F</italic>) that resembled the γ-taxilin phenotype.

Since this approach led to identification of taxilins as SDA components in this manuscript and could be used as a resource in future studies, a more comprehensive analysis of the datasets and their validation is required. (1) IF data for representing localization of V5-APEX fusions of CCDC68 and CCDC120 to the SDAs and localized biotinylation at these structures, (2) Western blotting data confirming induced biotinylation, (3) methodology used to analyze the mass spectrometry data, (4) presentation of high confidence proximity interactors of CCDC68 and CCDC120 and their comparative analysis, (5) validation of the datasets- They explained this by identification of γ-tubulin and STIL, how about identification of other SDA components, are they enriched in the datasets?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable suggestion. We added several details in the results, methods and discussion part as follows:</p><p>1. IF data showing localization of the V5-APEX fusions of CCDC68 or CCDC120 to the SDAs and the biotinylated proteins at those areas (revised <italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</italic>).</p><p>2. Western blotting data confirming endogenous biotinylated proteins mediated by CCDC68 or CCDC120 proximal labeling were added (revised <italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D</italic>).</p><p>3. We added detailed methodology that was used to analyze the mass spectrometry data (Page 25):</p><p>“Proteome Discoverer 2.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to align the mass spectrometry data with Uniprot <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (Human). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin, with a maximum of 2 missed trypsin cleavage sites. Precursor mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and the fragment ion mass tolerance to 0.02 Da. Also, carbamidomethylation of cysteine was the fixed modification, while oxidation of methionine and protein N-terminal acetylation were variable modifications. Percolator algorithm was used to calculate a 1% false discovery rate at the peptide and protein levels.”</p><p>4. We have presented CCDC68 and CCDC120 proximity interactors and their comparative analyses. Please see “Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 2. CCDC68 and CCDC120 proximity spectrometry data” in revised source data.</p><p>5. In the MS datasets, we identified a series of centrosomal proteins, including γ-tubulin, CC2D1A, CCDC78, CCDC138, etc<italic>.</italic> α-Taxilin and γ-taxilin, which were localized at the SDA, were also included. However, other already known SDA proteins, such as ODF2, ninein, and CEP170 were not included in the datasets because of their low protein levels in the cells (for ODF2, see <italic>Figure 3A-B</italic>) or their relatively longer distance from CCDC68 and CCDC120 (for ninein and CEP170, <italic>Figure 2</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – α- and -taxilin antibody specificity for immunofluorescence experiments should be confirmed with cells depleted with specific siRNAs as well as with CRISPR KO lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable suggestion. To validate α-taxilin and γ-taxilin antibody specificities, we added immunofluorescence experiments using cells with specific siRNAs as well as CRISPR KO lines. Results summary:</p><p>1. The antibody-stained α-taxilin and γ-taxilin were prominently focused at the centrosome, as demonstrated by their co-localizations with γ-tubulin in human RPE-1 cells. The fluorescence intensity of α-taxilin and γ-taxilin at the centrosome decreased after siRNA knockdown (<italic>Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</italic>). Those results indicated both the specificities of antibodies and the efficiency of siRNAs.</p><p>2. In the <italic>α-taxilin</italic> and <italic>γ-taxilin</italic> knockout RPE-1 and HeLa cells, α-taxilin and γ-taxilin fluorescence signals at the centrosome disappeared (<italic>Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and E</italic>; <italic>Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and E</italic> in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – How to they distinguish between defects in microtubule nucleation and anchoring? Rescue experiments for microtubule nucleation experiments with both mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the consideration. The SDA is well known for its roles in microtubule anchoring (<italic>Chong et al., 2020</italic>). During the microtubule regrowth assay, the microtubules nucleate at the centrosome first (in less than 5 minutes), and then some of them anchor at the SDA (after 5 minutes). We focused mainly on the microtubule regrowth process during the 5 to 10 minutes, during which time the microtubules became anchored at the centrosome.</p><p>Our result showed that γ-tubulin fluorescence intensity at the interphase centrosome remained unchanged following both α-taxilin and γ-taxilin siRNA-induced depletion, thus suggesting that microtubule nucleation may not be affected (revised <italic>Figure 6—figure supplement 1F-G</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 – Given that authors generated α- and γ-taxilin mutants that only localize to SDAs or proximal ends of centrioles, they have great tools for asking the specific functions of these pools in taxilin-associated phenotypes. In addition to rescue experiments with full length taxilins, rescue experiments with these mutants for microtubule anchoring/nucleation and spindle positioning experiments would provide insight into the mechanisms by which taxilins mediate these functions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the valuable suggestion. We added rescue experiments with full-length taxilins, as well as with the mutants for microtubule anchoring and spindle orientation (pages 13 and 14). Results summary:</p><p>1. The compromised microtubule regrowth, triggered by depletion of α-taxilin or γ-taxilin, could be partly rescued by overexpression of α- or γ-taxilin full-length, but not by the M2 region deletion mutants of either taxilin, which we previously showed to lose their SDA localization. This suggests that the SDA localization of both α-taxilin and γ-taxilin have indispensable roles in controlling microtubule anchoring at the interphase centrosome (<italic>Figure 6B-E</italic> in revised manuscript).</p><p>2. The average spindle angle was significantly increased in <italic>α-taxilin</italic> or <italic>γ-taxilin</italic> KO cells. This was rescued by overexpression of either full-length α-taxilin or γ-taxilin, as well as by the α-taxilin M3 deletion mutant or the γ-taxilin M1 deletion mutant, but not by the M2 deletion mutant for each taxilin. These results confirm α- and γ-taxilin roles in maintaining proper spindle orientation during metaphase (<italic>Figure 7D-E</italic> in revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5 – The authors show that α-taxilin and γ-taxilin interact. Do they cooperate during SDA biogenesis, microtuble anchoring and/or spindle positioning or do they function independently? For example, can they restore each other's function in loss-of-function experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for that thoughtful query. We discussed this from three perspectives:</p><p>(1) Since the two taxilins interact with each other in a direct manner via their coiled-coil domains, it is likely that they cooperate during SDA biogenesis (<italic>Figure 4E-I</italic> in the revised manuscript).</p><p>(2) TEM images revealed that SDA structural damage was worse in <italic>γ-taxilin</italic> KO RPE-1 cells than in <italic>α-taxilin</italic> KO RPE-1 cells, thus suggesting that γ-taxilin was likely upstream of α-taxilin at the SDA (<italic>Figure 6A</italic> in the revised manuscript).</p><p>(3) Since γ-taxilin depletion affected α-taxilin centrosomal localization (<italic>Figure 4D</italic> in the revised manuscript), overexpressed α-taxilin was thought unable to localize at the centrosome, let alone to rescue γ-taxilin-related functions. Conversely, α-taxilin depletion did not affect γ-taxilin centrosomal localization (<italic>Figure 4D</italic> in the revised manuscript), so the overexpressed γ-taxilin was most likely unable to rescue the α-taxilin-related functions.</p><p>Overall, we think the taxilins cooperate during SDA biogenesis and their functions are dependent on each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6 – In addition to spindle mispositoning defects, does depletion of α- or γ-taxilin cause other mitotic phenotypes (i.e. mitotic duration, chromosome segregation etc..).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the question. To assay for cell cycle progression defects (via Spin Disc, Ultra View Vox, PerkinElmer), we performed live imaging of WT HeLa cells and <italic>α-taxilin</italic> and γ-taxilin knockout HeLa cells that stably expressed mNeonGreen-H2B. Both the WT and the taxilin KO cells had similar mitotic times, suggesting that neither α-taxilin nor γ-taxilin knockout had any effect on mitotic duration or chromosome segregation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
