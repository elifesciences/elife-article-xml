directed differentiation approach to generate these distinct cartilage tissues from human embryonic stem cells. The resulting transcriptomic profiles of hESC-derived articular and growth plate chondrocytes were similar to fetal epiphyseal and growth plate chondrocytes, with respect to genes both known and previously unknown to cartilage biology. With the goal to characterize the regulatory landscapes accompanying these respective transcriptomes, we mapped chromatin accessibility in hESC-derived chondrocyte lineages, and mouse embryonic chondrocytes, using ATAC-sequencing. Integration of the expression dataset with the differentially accessible genomic regions revealed lineage-specific gene regulatory networks. We validated functional interactions of two transcription factors (TFs) (RUNX2 in growth plate chondrocytes and RELA in articular chondrocytes) with their predicted genomic targets. The maps we provide thus represent a framework for probing regulatory interactions governing chondrocyte differentiation. This work constitutes a substantial step towards comprehensive and comparative molecular characterizations of distinct chondrogenic lineages and sheds new light on human cartilage development and biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>articular cartilage</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>growth plate cartilage</kwd><kwd>embryonic stem cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR073821</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Craft</surname><given-names>April M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AR070139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Capellini</surname><given-names>Terence D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcriptomic and epigenetic landscapes of developing human articular and growth plate cartilage reveal putative gene regulatory networks governing lineage commitment and tissue homeostasis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cartilage is a crucial component of the musculoskeletal system, providing structure and functioning in various capacities to support the pain-free movement. Chondrocytes are the cells that produce and maintain the collagen- and proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) of cartilage tissues throughout the body. In the appendicular skeleton, chondrocytes give rise to growth plate cartilage, a transient tissue that provides a template for the elongation of endochondral bones, and articular cartilage, a permanent tissue that covers joint surfaces to allow for frictionless joint movement. Articular cartilage arises from the epiphyseal cartilage at the ends of the developing bones. Abnormal development of growth plate or articular chondrocytes can result in chondro- or skeletal dysplasias, while injury to and aging of chondrocytes can contribute to the development of joint degeneration (i.e. osteoarthritis). Pharmaceutical or gene-based treatments for the majority of these skeletal ailments are inadequate or simply do not exist due to the vast gaps in our knowledge regarding molecular mechanisms that govern the differentiation of chondrocytes into these two distinct lineages, especially in humans.</p><p>Much pioneering work focused on understanding the molecular regulation of chondrogenesis was performed in vivo using the mouse as a model system. A typical framework for these experiments involved genetic manipulation of a gene, either in the germline or conditionally, followed by careful phenotyping and gene expression readouts (e.g. in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, or quantitative polymerase chain reaction) to assess the effect on chondrocyte development. This paradigm led to the identification of signaling pathways such as TGFB/BMP (reviewed here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), IHH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Long et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">St-Jacques et al., 1999</xref>), and PTHrP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karaplis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lanske et al., 1996</xref>), as well as TFs such as Sox5/6/9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2002</xref>), Runx2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Inada et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>), MEF2C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2007</xref>), HIF2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schipani et al., 2001</xref>), and FOXA2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ionescu et al., 2012</xref>) that are important for development growth plate and/or articular chondrocytes. Mouse models have indeed substantially contributed to our evolving understanding of gene functions and related diseases, as human mutations often recapitulate murine phenotypes and vice versa.</p><p>A growing number of studies within the past several decades have attempted to build on these seminal findings by exploring gene expression and gene regulatory mechanisms in chondrocytes on a broader scale. A significant number of these studies have focused on the Sox family, especially Sox9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ohba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Liu and Lefebvre, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Oh et al., 2010</xref>). Early studies employed then-emerging technologies such as ChIP-chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Oh et al., 2010</xref>) and expression microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yamane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">James et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cameron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">James et al., 2010</xref>), while later studies incorporated ChIP-seq and/or RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ohba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Liu and Lefebvre, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Vail et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) as well as ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Chondrocytes used for these experiments were derived from a variety of sources including rib or epiphyseal cartilage from embryonic, neonatal, or juvenile rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yamane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">James et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cameron et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">James et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo et al., 2017</xref>), as well as a rat chondrosarcoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Liu and Lefebvre, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Oh et al., 2010</xref>). These cells all serve as generally good models of growth plate development, but not necessarily articular chondrocyte development. Modeling articular chondrocyte development using rodent-derived cells is inherently challenging due to the limited availability of the source tissue and the failure of the cells to retain their phenotype during expansion in culture. Chondrocytes from neonatal bovine articular cartilage are more plentiful and have been used in at least one gene-regulatory study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). A handful of studies have used chondrocytes derived from human sources, including fetal epiphyseal cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Vail et al., 2020</xref>) and mesenchymal stromal cell-derived cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Vail et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheung et al., 2020</xref>). While helpful for illuminating nuances of human growth plate chondrocyte development, and albeit understandably less so for articular chondrogenesis, it is clear that we still lack a complete understanding of how distinct chondrogenic lineages are specified and maintained in humans.</p><p>Using a directed differentiation approach inspired by embryonic chondrogenesis, we differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (i.e. hESCs/iPSCs) into growth plates and articular chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Craft et al., 2015</xref>). Following the induction of appropriate mesoderm and mesenchymal-like progenitors, chondrogenesis is induced in a high-density micromass format, eventually producing disks of cartilage tissues approximately 1 cm in diameter and 1–3 mm thick. Long-term culture of the micromasses with TGFβ3 results in the generation of articular-like cartilage tissue, while a transition to long-term treatment with BMP4 results in the growth of plate-like cartilage tissue. We previously defined 12 weeks as the end-stage of this micromass protocol, where the cells and tissues exhibit key characteristics of their in vivo counterparts, including the morphology and size of the cells, tissue/zonal organization, proteoglycan content, and expression of candidate cell-type specific markers such as lubricin (encoded by <italic>PRG4</italic>) and type X collagen (encoded by <italic>COL10A1</italic>). Lubricin, produced by superficial zone chondrocytes in articular cartilage, provides boundary lubrication and reduces friction between articulating cartilage surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Type X collagen is specifically expressed by hypertrophic chondrocytes in growth plate cartilage. This directed differentiation platform thus provides an opportunity to investigate human chondrogenesis and cartilage development in vitro.</p><p>We used our established in vitro hPSC-based model of developing human cartilage to address the critical gaps in our knowledge of human cartilage development, with an important goal of providing a comprehensive guide of gene regulatory mechanisms governing articular versus growth plate chondrocyte cell fate. In this present study, we performed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) in hESC-derived articular and growth plate cartilage to identify lineage-specific gene expression, and compared them to developing fetal cartilage. We also performed ATAC-sequencing (ATAC-seq) to define the accompanying regulatory landscapes in hESC-derived chondrogenic lineages and in mouse chondrocytes isolated by cell sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Richard et al., 2020</xref>). Integrating the transcriptomic and epigenetic datasets suggests gene regulatory networks specific to the growth plate or articular chondrocyte lineages. For two such networks, RUNX2 and RELA, we provide evidence of transcription factor interaction with predicted target gene regulatory elements, validating the predictive gene regulatory networks uncovered by our analyses of these two distinct human chondrogenic lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptomic profiles of hESC-derived chondrocytes recapitulate those of human fetal chondrocytes</title><p>Having differentiated hESCs to produce articular chondrocytes and growth cartilage chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we performed bulk RNA-seq on these cartilage tissues after 12 weeks in culture. To serve as in vivo references for the in vitro cartilage tissues, we performed bulk RNA-seq on human distal femur articular and growth plate chondrocytes isolated from embryonic day (E)67 fetal donor tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a-b</xref>). Principal component analysis indicated the four different chondrocyte sources (hESC-derived growth plate cartilage, hESC-derived articular cartilage, fetal growth plate cartilage, and fetal articular) clustered separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Reassuringly, even though hESC differentiation and RNA-seq were performed on more than one occasion (4 independent differentiations and 3 sequencing batches), transcriptome clustering was primarily dependent on cell type. That is, hESC-derived articular (orange icons) or growth plate tissues (light blue icons) from different experiments and batches cluster together, indicating reproducibility within the hESC model system. Principle component 1 (PC1) generally represents differences observed between the in vitro and in vivo samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, circles/triangles vs. squares), including minor contributions from sex-linked genes (hESC-derived samples are female and the fetal donor tissue was male). The top genes contributing to PC1 are enriched in GO biological processes that, with the exceptions of extracellular matrix/structure organization and immune responses, are detecting cellular responses to ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting differences associated with culturing cells in media not identical to the milieu in vivo. PC2 represents differences between articular/epiphyseal and growth plate cartilages, which were more pronounced for hESC-derived chondrocytes than for their in vivo counterparts, as indicated by the greater distance in separation along the PC2 axis. The top genes contributing to PC2 are enriched in GO biological processes that are consistent with cartilage and skeletal system development and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>hESC-derived articular and growth plate chondrocytes have distinct transcriptional profiles that are similar to their respective fetal cartilage counterparts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Brief methods to generate hESC-derived cartilage accompanied by toluidine-blue staining sections of hESC-derived articular (TGFB) and growth plate-like (BMP) cartilage tissues and the epiphyseal and growth plate cartilage of a developing fetal cartilage (E59 proximal tibia) show distinct chondrocyte morphology and proteoglycan-rich matrix.

For example, mature articular cartilage has a superficial, intermediate, deep zone, and calcified chondrocytes, but fetal epiphyseal cartilage is less mature and contains surface chondrocytes that will give rise to the future articular cartilage as well as chondrocytes that will contribute to the secondary ossification center (future growth plate chondrocyte) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chau et al., 2014</xref>). Growth plate cartilage has resting, proliferating, pre-hypertrophic, and hypertrophic chondrocytes. But as the developing cartilage is a continuous unit in vivo, the fetal epiphyseal chondrocytes and fetal growth plate both contain a portion of resting and proliferating chondrocytes, indicated by the approximate dissection point and dashed circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Therefore, we used in situ hybridization to localize sites of differential gene expression in hESC-derived and fetal cartilages and to estimate the fraction of cells expressing those transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Type II collagen, encoded by the gene <italic>COL2A1</italic>, is a major structural component of both articular and growth plate cartilage, and as such, expression is observed in the cartilaginous structures both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). <italic>PRG4</italic> is expressed in the superficial layer of the hESC-derived TGFB-treated articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and absent in the BMP4-treated growth plate cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, in vivo, <italic>PRG4</italic> is expressed in the superficial zone of fetal articular cartilage, as well as the intra-articular ligaments and meniscus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and is absent in the growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Tenomodulin (<italic>TNMD</italic>), a well-known marker of tendon fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Docheva et al., 2005</xref>), was a top DEG in hESC and fetal articular chondrocytes, where it is found in cells at the most superficial layers of the hESC-derived articular cartilage and the fetal knee cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>, white arrows). <italic>TNMD</italic> is also expressed in the intra-articular ligaments in vivo, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> double arrow). <italic>COL10A1</italic> mRNA is detected in the hESC-derived growth plate cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), but not hESC-derived articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), consistent with expression patterns found in the fetal knee, where <italic>COL10A1</italic> is expressed in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) but not in the epiphyseal chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

The highest level of type XV collagen protein was localized in the matrix of the superficial zone of hESC-derived articular cartilage, and we detected intracellular staining in the deeper zone of the articular cartilage and in some cells within the growth plate cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). We also localized Type XV collagen in developing human phalangeal (E70) and knee joints (E59), where we found it to be in the matrix of the epiphysis of the metacarpophalangeal joint, and at the surface of the knee joint cartilages, but absent in the matrix surrounding hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plates.

The top 40 DEGs at each timepoint are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> (all DEGs are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a-c</xref>). Despite batch differences associated with library preparation, time of sample acquisition, and smaller sample size, we found continuity between the transcriptomic profiles of the 12-week-old cartilage tissues in the timecourse and those acquired in our original analyses. We identified 1985 significant DEGs between the 12-week-old hESC-derived articular and growth plate tissues in the timecourse. Of those that were up-regulated in hESC-derived articular cartilage, 73.7% were also detected as significantly up-regulated in the same lineage in the original dataset. Similarly, 80.3% of the DEGs up-regulated in 12-week-old hESC-derived growth plate cartilage in the timecourse were also significantly up-regulated in the same lineage analyzed previously. When considering the top 200 most significant DEGs in the articular and growth plate cartilages in the timecourse, 91% and 96% of these were also significant in the corresponding lineage in the original dataset, respectively. As expected, the GO biological process associated with lineage-specific gene expression in the timecourse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2d and e</xref>.g., extracellular matrix organization, cartilage development) is consistent with those enriched in the original tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>).

A relatively smaller number of DEGs (841) were found to be significant after 4 weeks of differentiation towards the articular or growth plate lineage, 498 genes being more highly expressed in hESC-derived articular cartilage progenitors, and 383 being more highly expressed in hESC-derived growth plate cartilage progenitors (383). On the other hand, after 8 weeks of culture, 2268 DEGs were found to be significant, 1136 were up-regulated in the articular cartilage lineage and 1132 were up-regulated in the growth plate cartilage lineage. DEGs from both lineages at all timepoints (including the corresponding 12 weeks old tissues) were enriched in expected GO biological processes such as cartilage development/chondrocyte differentiation and skeletal system development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2d</xref>). At 8 weeks, GO biological processes such as ossification and endochondral bone morphogenesis were enriched in the hESC-derived growth plate cartilage, while hESC-derived articular cartilage became enriched in an extracellular matrix organization and response to TGFβ. As mentioned above, after 12 weeks, hESC-derived growth plate cartilage DEGs remained enriched in previous terms, and became enriched for replacement ossification, biomineralization, and bone morphogenesis, while the top processes in the articular cartilage lineage remained similar to earlier timepoints and the previous dataset.</p><p>The reproducible identification of known lineage-specific expression in the distinct cartilage tissues we generated from hESCs validates the utility of our established in vitro differentiation methods and further illustrates the strength of our transcriptomic datasets in identifying novel markers and potential regulators of articular and growth plate cartilage development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chromatin accessibility differences between hESC-derived articular chondrocytes and hESC-derived growth plate chondrocytes</title><p>As cell fate decisions are guided by transcriptional regulation, we next sought to more deeply investigate the expression of TFs and potential gene regulatory elements within the hESC-derived cartilage tissues.

To refine this list of potential chondrogenic lineage regulators, we performed ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>), a method used to characterize chromatin accessibility on a genome-wide basis, on a subset of terminally differentiated hESC-derived chondrocytes that were used for transcriptomic analysis (i.e. the three biological replicate tissues per treatment sequenced in batch two, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a and f-g</xref>).

For this latter approach, we confirmed that motif enrichment is not substantially correlated with sequence complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). When we considered sets of lineage-specific DARs nearby genes exhibiting lineage-specific expression, we observed similar enrichments for motif occurrences of several of these TFs in both region (lineage) sets, despite conditioning on the lineage-specific expression of these factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, right). For example, motifs for the top DE TFs, <italic>POU2F2</italic> (a TGFB-specific DE TF), and <italic>MEF2C</italic> (a BMP-specific DE TF) were significantly enriched in both TGFB-DARs and BMP-DARS when compared to randomly-sampled sequence sets (red lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, right). Motifs for only two of these DE TFs, <italic>RUNX2,</italic> and <italic>RUNX3</italic> were significantly enriched in the corresponding BMP lineage, and significantly depleted or not significant in the TGFB-DARs. This suggests that a simplistic model of gene expression, wherein upregulation of a given TF is associated with increased accessibility of elements to which it may bind, and subsequently increased expression of its putative targets, is not sufficient to explain the gene regulatory network information captured by our ATAC-seq/RNA-seq strategy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Defining hypothetical gene regulatory networks via cataloging gene expression and chromatin accessibility differences between hESC-derived articular chondrocytes and hESC-derived growth plate chondrocytes</title><p>We sought to integrate our ATAC- and RNA-seq datasets in a way that better captured the regulatory behavior described in our sequencing datasets. Our approach defined three metrics of expression and accessibility at a given locus: (1) gene expression, (2) proximal (promoter) accessibility, and (3) distal (enhancer) activity, defined as a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory score (see Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4a</xref>). Based on the simplistic model of gene expression described above, we would have expected absolute correspondence between these three metrics for all DEGs, however, there were clear deviations from this result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). We reasoned that multiple regulatory principles may be at play and, inspired by recent work describing the <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory behavior of immunological genes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yoshida et al., 2019</xref>), we classified genes into four different regulatory behaviors based on the proportion of variance in expression explained by chromatin accessibility within their respective loci. Briefly, these consist of genes whose expression variance is best explained by: variance does not clearly associate with chromatin accessibility (‘unexplained,’ cluster 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4b</xref>), a combination of promoter accessibility and distal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory accessibility (‘combo-centric, cluster 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4c</xref>), promoter accessibility alone (‘promoter-centric,’ cluster 3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4d</xref>), or distal <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory accessibility alone (‘enhancer-centric,’ cluster 4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In general, genes falling into clusters 2–4 exhibited larger fold-changes in expression between articular and growth plate chondrocytes compared to genes falling into the ‘unexplained variance’ category (cluster 1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Likewise, a greater proportion of genes from clusters 2–4 (genes whose variance in expression can be attributed to promoter or enhancer accessibility or both) were differentially expressed, compared to those from cluster 1 (whose variance cannot be attributed to differential accessibility in any putative regulatory elements, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Further, we confirmed that sets of genes segregated with this method show increased sharing of direction (i.e. lineage bias) for the expected parameters (e.g. ‘combo-centric’ gene expression had a greater correspondence with our <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory bias metric than did ‘promoter-centric’ gene expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Variance in the expression of differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) can be attributed to different classes of regulatory elements (gene regulatory behavior).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression (left), gene-promoter accessibility (middle), and cis-regulatory metric (right) of all genes with expression logFC &gt;1 across lineages.

For each motif demonstrating enrichment according to these criteria, we then validated whether enrichment could not be significantly detected in the set of DARs/promoters for which the direction of accessibility was opposite to the direction of expression.

Specifically, we found strong correlations between hESC-derived articular cartilage and fetal epiphyseal samples, and likewise between hESC-derived growth plate cartilage and fetal growth plate samples.</p><p>We performed extensive experimental validation of DEGs, confirming lineage-specific patterns across multiple independent hESC differentiation experiments and primary cell datasets.

We found these expression patterns, and those of other known markers, to hold true in both the hESC-derived and fetal chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><p>In addition to known markers, we identified novel genes that mark distinct cartilage lineages, such as <italic>MEOX1</italic> and <italic>CHI3L1</italic> in the articular cartilage lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>), and <italic>EFHD1</italic> in the growth plate cartilage lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>). <italic>MEOX1</italic> and <italic>CHI3L1</italic>, whose expression has been reported in the axial skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Martin, 2016</xref>) and in osteoarthritic cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Knorr et al., 2003</xref>), respectively, had not yet been identified in developing articular cartilage. EFHD1 was strongly localized to hypertrophic cells in hESC-derived and fetal growth plate chondrocytes. Previously studied in its role as a calcium sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hou et al., 2016</xref>), EFHD1 could play a role in the mediating cellular response to calcium in hypertrophic chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). We also surprisingly found <italic>tenomodulin</italic> (<italic>TNMD</italic>) to be expressed in the superficial zone of articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>), co-expressed with <italic>PRG4. TNMD</italic>, closely related to <italic>chondromodulin 1</italic> (<italic>CNMD</italic>), is known as a functional marker for tenocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Docheva et al., 2005</xref>). While there is conflicting evidence of <italic>TNMD</italic> expression in resting and proliferating chondrocytes of the growth plate cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shukunami et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandau et al., 2001</xref>), <italic>TNMD</italic> expression in the superficial zone of articular cartilage has not been previously described. Although this result was seemingly unexpected, both cartilage and tendons/ligaments rely on TGFB signaling, and they can arise from a common developmental progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrade et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pryce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Koyama et al., 2008</xref>). This interesting finding warrants further exploration of the developmental relationship between cartilage and the adjacent connective tissues in the joint. Furthermore, these data uncover several other novel genes as yet unstudied in chondrocyte biology, underscoring the potential utility of tissue- or zone-specific markers, and the opportunity to investigate their function(s) in cartilage development or maintenance in human cells and other models.</p><p>Despite a strong overall transcriptomic and epigenetic correspondence between hESC-derived and primary cartilages, there are some limitations to our comparative analyses. One notable observation is the existence of genes whose expression patterns in hESC-derived cartilage lineages were opposite those seen in vivo fetal epiphyseal and growth plate cartilage tissues. This was an expected result, as the cartilage dissected from fetal samples is more heterogeneous than the hESC-derived tissues, contains fewer terminally differentiated specialized chondrocytes, and also likely has significant overlap in the composition of resting and proliferative chondrocytes. For example, the dissected epiphyseal cartilage includes perichondrium, resting zone chondrocytes, proliferative chondrocytes, in addition to chondrocytes that will participate in events related to the secondary ossification center and, perhaps in less abundance, those that will eventually give rise to the neonatal and adult articular cartilage. Likewise, the growth plate cartilage includes proliferative, pre-hypertrophic, and hypertrophic chondrocytes, in addition to perichondrium cells (our micro-dissection approach aimed to omit osteoblasts and hematopoietic cells). We also found differences when we compared the epigenetic profiles of mouse embryonic chondrocytes, expressing either <italic>Col2a1</italic> or <italic>Col10a1</italic> to those of hESC-derived chondrocytes, which to some extent were anticipated due to species specificity of genomic regulatory elements. However, Col2a1+ sorted chondrocytes encompass all types of chondrocytes, including both articular and growth plate chondrocytes. As such, the mouse epigenetic profiles reported herein do not accurately reflect a clear distinction between articular and growth plate cartilage lineages. The peaks we found to be conserved between the human and mouse chondrocytes, therefore, likely represent biologically relevant regulatory elements driving chondrogenesis. Finally, while our transcriptomic and epigenetic investigation of developing hESC-derived articular and growth plate cartilage effectively identified known regulators of and genomic regulatory elements important for chondrogenesis, additional mechanistic studies, such as the use of transgenic mouse models, are required to demonstrate function and necessity of novel targets.</p><p>It remains unclear where hESC-derived articular and growth plate cartilage lies in developmental time relative to fetal cartilage. Some obvious differences are the detection of latestage growth plate marker gene expression such as Integrin Binding Sialoprotein (IBSP) in eight week and 12-week-old hESC-derived growth plate chondrocytes, which was lacking in the fetal growth plate chondrocytes and the 4-week-old hESC-derived growth plate chondrocytes. We also demonstrated the presence of a distinct superficial zone of cartilage in the hESC-derived articular cartilage, which is less developed and also less abundant in the fetal tissue used in this study (i.e. we indicated that the surface of the epiphysis corresponded to the site of the future superficial zone of articular cartilage). The potentially more developed/mature superficial zone in the hESC-derived articular cartilage may explain why superficial-zone-specific genes, such as <italic>COL15A1</italic>, a non-fibrillar basement membrane-associated collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clementz and Harris, 2013</xref>), were identified as differentially expressed in the hESC-derived articular cartilage but not in the fetal epiphyseal cartilage, despite protein localization being lineage-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Future studies focused on transcriptomic profiling of chondrocytes at the single-cell level, from in vitro-derived tissues and primary tissues, will address some of these standing questions.</p><p>Given our confidence in the divergent properties of the hESC-derived chondrogenic lineages, and that they reflect in vivo lineage properties, we also sought to use this system to define putative gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) which may govern lineage specification and gene expression patterns in developing chondrocytes. As TFs typically have key roles in governing lineage-specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nutt and Kee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ludwig et al., 2019</xref>), we identified a number of factors that demonstrate biases in expression across lineages, and for which motif occurrence is enriched in putative lineage-biased regulatory elements. Finding that a simple model of a GRN was insufficient to explain the behaviors observed in our epigenetic and expression datasets, we applied a per-locus approach to integrating our ATAC- and RNA-seq genes, defining sets of genes with different putative regulatory behaviors. We found that these groups exhibited different patterns of differential gene expression, associations with chromatin accessibility data, and, importantly, the enriched occurrence of lineage-biased TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Notably, our finding that grouped genes differed in their degree of differential expression is consistent with a previous study that stratified immune genes on the basis of regulatory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yoshida et al., 2019</xref>). We leveraged these findings to identify TFs exhibiting enrichments for DARs around DEGs we defined as either ‘enhancer-centric’ or ‘combo-centric’ enrichments exclusive to a particular lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This approach pinpointed a subset of TFs whose binding motifs are significantly enriched in the corresponding chondrogenic lineage (discussed below), of which we functionally tested <italic>RELA</italic> and <italic>RUNX2. RELA</italic>, also known as p65, belongs to the NF-κB family of TFs that share a REL homology domain and can form transcriptionally active dimers with other family members. It is a transcriptional activator of <italic>SOX9</italic>, a master regulator of chondrocyte differentiation, as well as early differentiation and anabolic factors such as <italic>SOX6</italic> and <italic>COL2A1</italic>, late-stage factor <italic>HIF-2ɑ</italic>, and the catabolic gene <italic>ADAMTS5</italic>. It also plays a role in cartilage homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Yu et al., 2020</xref>) and degradation in osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Olivotto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Saito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kobayashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Ushita et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>RUNX2</italic>, also known as <italic>CBFA1</italic>, <italic>PEBP2</italic>, or <italic>AML3</italic>, belongs to a class of TFs containing a Runt-homology domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ogawa et al., 1993</xref>). <italic>RUNX2</italic> has long been recognized as a ‘master’ skeletogenic factor, sitting atop a regulatory cascade governing osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Komori et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ducy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Otto et al., 1997</xref>). Since its initial discovery, the role of <italic>RUNX2</italic> in skeletogenesis has expanded to include the regulation of chondrocyte hypertrophy in growth plate cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Inada et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>). It also has a similar, though pathogenic, role in articular chondrocytes, which acquire hallmarks of hypertrophy in joint diseases such as osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catheline et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liao et al., 2017</xref>). Remarkably, when we performed ChIP-qPCR against candidate regulatory regions with RELA or RUNX2 binding sites, we found that a majority (16 of the 17 tested) did in fact bind the predicted TF in the expected lineage. These findings emphasize the co-use of the epigenetic and expression datasets generated in this study in defining putative gene regulatory networks which may be active in developing chondrocyte populations, and in identifying key regulatory factors controlling these networks.</p><p>Our transcriptomic profiling approach uncovered additional lineage-specific TFs in both hESC-derived cartilages, including those that were identified as differentially expressed in the larger group of samples and in the developmental in vitro timecourse, but not in the smaller subset of samples (batch 2) in which we also performed ATAC-seq. Many of these TFs and their associated family members exhibited similar expression patterns in the fetal cartilage specimens, and many have been previously identified in the context of cartilage and joint biology, once again validating the hESC-model system we’ve established. Such TF families identified in the TGFB-induced hESC-derived articular cartilage include the ETS factors, containing a conserved ETS DNA-binding domain, including the polyomavirus enhancer activator 3 (<italic>PEA3</italic>) family members (<italic>ETV1, ETV4, ETV5</italic>), and the ETS-related gene (<italic>ERG</italic>) family members (<italic>ERG, FLI1, FEV</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Findlay et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we specifically pinpointed <italic>ETV1</italic> and <italic>FLI1</italic> as regulators of enhancer- and combo-centric genes in the hESC-derived articular cartilage lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). <italic>PEA3</italic> family members are significantly differentially expressed in both hESC-derived articular cartilage and in fetal epiphyseal chondrocytes. They are FGF-responsive genes and there is some evidence that loss of these proteins results in reduced and disorganized brachial cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Herriges et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>ERG</italic> and <italic>FLI1</italic> are differentially expressed in hESC-derived articular cartilage (but not significant in fetal data), while <italic>FEV</italic> is differentially expressed in growth plate cartilage (not in fetal). <italic>ERG</italic> has a role in the long-term maintenance of articular cartilage, and, along with <italic>FLI1</italic>, regulates articular cartilage genes such as <italic>PTHLH</italic> and <italic>PRG4 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Iwamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Larmour et al., 2013</xref>). The CREB family of TFs includes <italic>CREB5</italic> and <italic>CREB3L1</italic>, both of which are differentially expressed in hESC-derived articular cartilage (CREB5 is also differentially expressed in fetal epiphyseal cartilage). <italic>CREB5</italic> is a known regulator of <italic>PRG4</italic> expression in articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), and shares sequence homology with the ATF family of TFs, such as <italic>ATF7</italic> which we highlight as a regulator of combo-centric genes in the hESC-derived articular cartilage lineage and which has near-identical DNA binding motif compared to <italic>CREB5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) family members <italic>NFATC2</italic> and <italic>NFATC4</italic> are both differentially expressed in hESC-derived articular cartilage (<italic>NFATC4</italic> is also differentially expressed in the fetal epiphysis). <italic>NFATC2</italic> is also more highly expressed in superficial zone chondrocytes compared to deep zone chondrocytes in bovine cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), and NFAT family members play a role in chondrocyte gene expression and articular cartilage maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Tomita et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greenblatt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tardif et al., 2013</xref>). The homeobox proteins <italic>MEOX1</italic> and <italic>MEOX2</italic> and the LIM-homeobox protein <italic>LHX9</italic> were also DEGs in both hESC-derived articular cartilage and fetal epiphyseal chondrocytes. <italic>MEOX1</italic> and <italic>MEOX2</italic> are essential for the development of all somite compartments and for the normal development of the craniocervical joint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Skuntz et al., 2009</xref>). LHX9 is induced by FGF-signaling and has been previously studied for its role in the progression of osteosarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Li et al., 2019</xref>). These TFs and TF families, among others we identified in these studies, warrant further exploration of their individual and joint roles in articular cartilage development and stability.</p><p>In the growth plate lineage, members of the DLX family of TFs, <italic>DLX2, DLX5, and DLX6</italic> were highly expressed in growth plate cartilage (<italic>DLX5</italic> and <italic>DLX6</italic> were also differentially expressed in the fetal growth plate), and are known to be critical regulators of cartilage differentiation during endochondral ossification. In particular, <italic>DLX5</italic> has been shown to regulate the differentiation of immature proliferating chondrocytes into hypertrophic chondrocytes, and in osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferrari and Kosher, 2002</xref>). Similarly, two <italic>RUNX</italic> family members, <italic>RUNX2</italic> and <italic>RUNX3</italic> are differentially expressed in both hESC-derived and fetal growth plate cartilage. <italic>RUNX2</italic>, as discussed above, is a critical TF for chondrogenic maturation and osteoblast differentiation, and can cooperate with <italic>DLX5</italic> and <italic>SP7</italic> for the proper skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Komori, 2015</xref>). <italic>RUNX3</italic> works redundantly with <italic>RUNX2</italic> in chondrocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yoshida et al., 2004</xref>). The forkhead box (FOX) proteins are a superfamily of TFs, of which several members are differentially expressed in either articular cartilage or growth plate lineages. Of this large family, <italic>FOXA2</italic>, expressed in the hESC-derived growth plate cartilage, is a critical regulator of hypertrophic differentiation in chondrocytes and has been implicated in cartilage degradation and OA progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ho et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Myocyte enhancer factor 2</italic> C (<italic>MEF2C</italic>) is differentially expressed in both hESC-derived and fetal growth plate cartilage and activates the genetic program for hypertrophy during endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2007</xref>). These TFs, and others identified in the studies herein, can now be investigated for their biological role in growth plate biology and chondrocyte function.</p><p>The molecular data provided herein have, for the first time, unlocked key findings regarding human articular and growth plate cartilage development. We established and validated our in vitro human pluripotent stem cell cartilage differentiation system as a predictive tool in investigating articular and growth plate cartilage lineages. This is particularly important for understanding how to specify and maintain articular cartilage, since diseased and sometimes even regenerating tissue following cartilage damage display hypertrophy-like changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">van der Kraan and van den Berg, 2012</xref>). Novel genes that are expressed differentially between the two different tissues were also identified, some of which exhibit zone-specific expression patterns within developing cartilage. Continued efforts to identify genes and networks that regulate cartilage development will undoubtedly be propelled by these comprehensive comparative analyses of transcriptomic and epigenetic signatures of human articular and growth plate cartilage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

H9 hESCs (Wicell, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_9773">CVCL_9773</ext-link>) were maintained on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in hESC media containing DMEM/F12 (Corning) supplemented with 20% knockout serum replacement (Gibco), nonessential amino acids (Gibco), L-glutamine (Gibco), Pen/Strep (Gibco), b-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), and human bFGF (10 ng/mL) in six-well tissue culture plates. Cells were passaged when they reached ~80% confluency onto new feeders as cell clusters of about 3–10 cells, following dissociation with TrypLE (Gibco).

All paired ranks are assigned a pointwise score based on this curve, subsequently sorted, and all peaks falling below an ‘irreproducible discovery rate’ (IDR) threshold of 0.05 are taken as our final reproducible peak set.</p><p>For calculating differential accessibility of regions between treatments, all IDR-filtered peaks from both sets of treated tissue fragments (BMP and TGF) were padded to a fixed size of 1000 bp (from called peak centres) and pooled using bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) version 2.29.1. For each pooled peak, a 1000 bp window was defined (500 bp up/downstream of peak centre); along this window, a 250 bp sliding window (chosen based on the averaged called peak size across individual IDR-filtered peaks from each set) was slid in 50 bp increments to generate a set of overlapping regions (using the R language version 3.6.1). ATAC-seq read coverage within these regions was calculated using the ‘bedcov’ function of samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Li et al., 2009</xref>) version 1.5 for each mapped.bam file corresponding to individual ATAC-seq samples. This sliding-window approach is used to identify the area of strongest cross-sample signal (i.e. ATAC-seq read coverage) around a pooled ATAC-seq peak, improving our confidence in defining differential-accessibility (i.e. avoiding regions around an ATAC-seq peak with lower read coverage, which may make our analysis more sensitive to noise). For sets of overlapping windows corresponding to a single ATAC-seq peak, we applied a smoothening algorithm to eliminate extreme values occurring in overlapping windows for individual samples. Windows whose read coverage fell outside one standard deviation of the set (of sliding windows for a single peak) were assigned the average read coverage of the two windows adjacent. This adjustment does not impact the later differential-accessibility analysis, for which we take the original read coverage values calculated for a given window using the mapped bam file. Rather, this will impact the choice of sliding window assigned to represent this given peak, and is done to avoid consistently using the most-extreme windows to define differential accessibility (which may otherwise bias our results).</p><p>Following this smoothening, for each window, we calculated the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile read coverage value across all pelvic elements and samples (this was found to be more robust than mean read coverages, even after smoothening adjustment) using the dplyr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">CRAN, 2022</xref>) package version 1.0.7. The window with the greatest 75<sup>th</sup>-percentile coverage was then selected as the representative region for that pooled ATAC-seq peak. Subsequently, raw read coverages for all optimized windows across all ATAC-seq samples were imported as a matrix into DESEQ2 version 1.26.0 using the ‘DESeqDataSetFromMatrix’ function, with differential-accessibility calculated using the ‘DESeq’ function with treatment-type as the main variable. Differentially accessible (DA) peaks were generated using the ‘results’ function from DESeq2 using the BMP-TGF contrast, with significance assessed as a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of &lt;0.05. To visualize accessibility in these DA peaks, read coverages were normalized using the ‘estimateSizeFactors’ function in DESeq2 using the default TMM normalization. Subsequently, the normalized read-counts matrix was z-score transformed using the ‘scale’ function in base R and plotted using the ‘ComplexHeatmap’ package version 2.4.3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>De-novo motif enrichments</title><p>Sequence sets for the sets of differentially-accessible regions (as defined above) were generated using reference sequences from hg19. HOMER (version 4.11) de novo motif analysis was performed on each sequence set using a 10 x random shuffling as a background set. De novo motifs were compared to a vertebrate motif library included with HOMER, which incorporates the JASPAR database (2022 version); matches are scored using Pearson’s correlation coefficient of vectorized motif matrices (PWMs), with neutral frequencies (0.25) substituted for non-overlapping (e.g. gapped) positions. Best-matching motif PWMs for TGF- and BMP-biased region sets are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3d-e</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Targeted motif enrichments</title><p>We took our set of differentially-expressed transcription factors up-regulated in articular and growth-plate chondrocytes, defined using expression from Batch 2 samples, and obtained the PWMs for all factors. In instances where a factor had more than one defined PWM (e.g. due to overlap between JASPAR and HOMER databases), the information content (IC) of each matrix was calculated, with the matrix having the highest IC retained. To define the background nucleotide frequencies of our ATAC-seq region sets, we took the pooled set of fixed-size peaks used in the DA analysis (n=37780) and generated a Markov background model using the ‘fasta-get-markov’ function from the MEME suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>; version 5.4.1). Next, we took the sets of nucleotide sequences corresponding to DA peaks and scanned them for instances of particular TF motifs using the FIMO program from MEME, defining a p-value threshold for motif hits as 2e−4 (calculated as 0.1/ (2 × 250 bp of sequence)). To define a background expectation of motif hits for sequence sets equivalent to our target sets, we used the ‘shuffle’ command from bedtools, randomly shuffling our sequence set across the hg19 genome (exclusive of the true set of regions). For each randomly-shuffled set, we then scanned for motif hits with FIMO, performing this random shuffling and scanning for n=100 randomized sets. This was used to establish a random background distribution of expected motif hits for a given TF motif. Motif hit values were standardized and statistical significance was assessed using a CDF of the standard normal distribution as implemented in the ‘pnorm’ function in base R. For each DA sequence set, P-values for significant deviations from the background distribution were corrected for the number of TFss tested (n=194) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3e</xref>). As further confirmation, for the top 10 most strongly-DE TFs in each lineage, we increased the number of randomly-shuffled background sets to n=1000,, finding that our enrichments were robust to the size of the background distribution.</p><p>We next checked to confirm whether these motif enrichments are reflective of the complexity of PWMs, i.e., that TFs with lower sequence binding specificity result in more promiscuous motif hits. For a given TF, we compared the fraction of all sequences in a given DA set that had at least one motif hit to the IC of the factor’s PWM. These values were plotted across all TFs tested using the ‘ggscatter’ function from ggpubr version 0.4.0, with Pearson correlation calculated with this function (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>GREAT analysis</title><p>GREAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McLean et al., 2010</xref>) takes an input set of genomic regions along with a defined ontology of gene annotations; first, it defines regulatory domains for all genes genome-wide, then measures the fraction of the genome covered by the regulatory domains of genes associated with a particular annotation (e.g. ‘cartilage development’). These fractions are used as the expectation in a binomial test counting the number of input genomic regions falling within a given set of regulatory domains, which results in the reported significance of association between an input region set and a particular gene ontology term. GREAT also performs a more traditional gene-based hypergeometric test to test for the significance of region set-ontology association.

For each promoter, 2 kb windows were slid along this region in 50 bp increments, with per-window ATAC-seq read coverage for all samples calculated using the ‘bedcov’ function of samtools (version 1.5) for each mapped.bam file. A similar smoothening method as that described above for per-peak windowed accessibility was also performed here using sliding promoter window accessibility. As above, this smoothening method does not impact the later differential-accessibility analysis, for which we take the original read coverage values calculated for a given window using the mapped bam file. Following smoothing, the window with the greatest 75<sup>th</sup>-percentile coverage was selected as the representative read coverage metric for a given promoter. Following per-promoter window selection, the final matrix of read coverages for all promoter windows across all samples was loaded into DESeq2 version 1.26.0 using the resulting in a final matrix of read coverages for all promoters across all samples. This matrix was subsequently loaded into DESeq2 version 1.26.0 using the ‘DESeqDataSetFromMatrix’ function, with differential accessibility calculated using the ‘DESeq’ function with treatment type as the main variable. DA promoters were generated using the ‘results’ function from DESeq2 using the BMP-TGF contrast, with significance assessed as a Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value of &lt;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Defining cis-regulatory scores</title><p>We defined a ‘cis-regulatory score’ which seeks to capture information on accessibility patterns within putative regulatory elements around a given gene locus, a concept inspired by methods of integrating RNA-seq and ChIP-seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). For a given gene, we collected all accessibility regions (i.e. the optimized windows described above) within 100 kb up/downstream of the TSS. Given that we also, separately, considered promotor accessibility in describing the regulatory behavior of genes (see above, and below), we explicitly excluded any regions which fell within the optimized promoter regions defined above. For each captured accessibility region, we took the calculated fold-accessibility change (BMP-TGF contrast) and scaled it by the distance to the gene TSS using the following formula:</p><p>Per-region score = (differential-accessibility logFC) * (e<sup>-(0.5 + 4 * (distance / 100kb))</sup>).</p><p>Where the second distance-scaling term is taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tang et al., 2011</xref>. These per-region scores were summed across all captured regions across the locus to give a single, signed lineage-specific (i.e. BMP or TGF-treated) <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory score. These scores were visualized per gene as an additional feature in the ‘ComplexHeatmap’ visualizations of expression (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); blue/red scale was defined based on max/min values (respectively) for this score (positive being TGF-biased, negative being BMP-biased); points outside two standard deviations of the mean score were capped at 2*SD +/−the mean.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Defining gene regulatory behaviors</title><p>For a given gene, all accessible elements within a 100 kb (up/downstream of the gene TSS) were collected, exclusive of the optimized promoter window (as described above). For each element, the normalized accessibility counts data (via DESeq2 using the default TMM normalization, as described above) was retrieved for all hESC samples (BMP and TGF treated). These normalized counts were subsequently scaled by distance to the TSS using the above distance-scaling term. Similarly, the normalized accessibility counts data for promoter regions (as described above) was also retrieved across all samples. Finally, RNA-seq expression data for the given gene was retrieved and normalized using the ‘vst’ function in varistran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Francis Harrison, 2017</xref>) version 1.0.4 to obtain normalized expression counts across all samples.</p><p>For this gene, three different linear regression models for RNA-seq expression were generated using the ‘lm’ function in base R. (1) RNA ~Promoter accessibility +Enhancer Accessibility +Promoter x Enhancer Interaction. (2) RNA ~Promoter accessibility. (3) RNA ~Enhancer accessibility. The proportion of total variance in RNA expression explained by each model was calculated by feeding individual model objects into the ‘anova’ function in base R and summing the individual sum-of-squares values for all model coefficients, then dividing by the total sum of squares. We took the differences between the total variance explained by the full model (1) and that explained by individual-component models (2) and (3) as an approximate measurement of the contributions of either enhancer or promoter accessibility. Additionally, we defined a metric for the additive effects of combining promoter and enhancer accessibility as the difference between the variance explained by the full model and that explained by the two models individually, while accounting for instances in which this difference is negative (i.e. when the two single-component models share overlapping information). Finally, the proportion of variance that could not be explained by the full model was also included as an additional metric.</p><p>These four per-gene metrics (contribution of enhancer information, promoter information, the combination of enhancer and promoter, and unexplained variance) were defined across all genes captured in our RNA-seq analysis. The resulting matrix of genes was subsequently visualized and clustered using the ‘Heatmap’ function from ComplexHeatmap version 2.8.0 using a ‘k’ of four (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Clustered genes were defined as being either ‘unexplained,’ ‘combo-centric,’ ‘promoter-centric,’ or ‘enhancer-centric’ based on the distribution of variance explained in the heatmap shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. The percentage of clustered genes exhibiting significant DE between BMP and TGF-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom) was calculated using the results of the differential-expression analysis above. For all genes in each cluster (regardless of significance) the absolute log2FC values were compared across clusters using the ‘aov’ function in base R, followed by Tukey Post-hoc correction using the TukeyHSD function in base R. Differences in absolute log2FC values were plotted using the ‘plotmeans’ function from gplots version 3.1.1 with default settings.</p><p>To test whether the directionality of accessibility and expression was shared in different clusters of genes we used the following approach. For each gene, the distance-scaled enhancer accessibility, promoter accessibility, and gene expression values were binarized into either ‘biased towards TGF samples’ or ‘biased towards BMP samples.’ Across all genes in a given cluster, the number of genes sharing direction in either (a) enhancer accessibility and RNA expression, or (b) promoter accessibility and RNA expression was compared to those switching direction using a chi-square test in base R. Finally, for each clustered set of genes, the RNA-seq expression, promoter accessibility, and cis-regulatory score values were visualized using ComplexHeatmap, sorting first on RNA-seq expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Motif analyses with regulatory behaviors</title><p>For motif analyses in the context of our defined regulatory behaviors, we considered motif enrichments at putative regulatory regions (enhancers) around genes and gene promoter regions separately. We first took the groups of genes falling into ‘enhancer-centric’ and ‘combo-centric’ clusters, separated them into those up-regulated in articular/growth-plate chondrocytes, then defined 200 kb windows centered on the TSS of each gene. Subsequently, all DA peaks sharing directionality (i.e. articular chondrocyte DA peaks around articular chondrocyte DEGs) within these windows were collected and aggregated into a final set of sequences. For ‘promoter-centric’ genes, we took the set of optimized promoter regions for DEGs and aggregated them. These sequence sets were then used with the AME webserver (part of the MEME suite) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>), along with the sets of differentially-expressed TF motif matrices, matching the sequence sets (i.e. articular chondrocyte-biased sequence sets were scanned with articular chondrocyte-biased TFs), using default settings. The resulting enrichments were filtered with a p-value threshold of &lt;0.05 and summarized (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4f</xref>).</p><p>To test the specificity of these enrichments for sequences biased towards a particular lineage, we performed an additional level of motif analysis. We collected the sets of motifs enriched for genes falling in particular regulatory groups, and differentially expressed in particular lineages, and utilized the same sequence sets pertaining to enhancers or promoters of genes. To define the background nucleotide frequencies of our ATAC-seq region sets, we took the pooled set of fixed-size peaks used in the DA analysis (n=37780) and generated a Markov background model using the ‘fasta-get-markov’ function from the MEME suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>). We similarly took the set of optimized promoter regions (based on the analysis described above) (n=27739) and defined a Markov background nucleotide frequency model. We then took the regulatory elements of a particular set (e.g. DA peaks biased towards articular chondrocytes, around articular chondrocyte DEGs) and scanned for instances of a given motif using the FIMO program from MEME, defining a p-value threshold for motif hits as 2e−4 (calculated as 0.1/ (2 × 250 bp of sequence)). Similar to above, we defined a background expectation of motif hits for sequence sets equivalent to our target sets using the ‘shuffle’ command from bedtools version 2.29.1, randomly shuffling our sequence set across the hg19 genome (exclusive of the true set of regions). For scanning promoter sequences, we randomly shuffled the true set of promoters across all promoters used in the differential-promoter-accessibility analysis (n=27739), to account for background biases in the occurrence of motifs within promoter regions generally.</p><p>For each randomly-shuffled set, we then scanned for motif hits with FIMO, performing this random shuffling and scanning for n=2000 randomized sets. This was used to establish a random background distribution of expected motif hits for a given TF motif. Motif hit values were standardized and statistical significance was assessed using a CDF of the standard normal distribution as implemented in the ‘pnorm’ function in base R. As we sought to test the specificity of motif enrichments, all motifs which were enriched for a given regulatory set (e.g. enriched in enhancer sequences) were tested, regardless of any existing lineage bias detected in our AME analyses. This resulted in our testing n=96 TF motifs against all enhancer sequences, and n=109 TF motifs against all optimized promoter regions. For each lineage-biased sequence set (i.e. sequences associated with DEGs in articular chondrocytes or growth-plate chondrocytes), p-values for significant deviations from the background distribution were BH corrected for the number of TFs tested (either 96 or 109, based on the regulatory group of genes considered) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4g-i</xref>).</p><p>As a more stringent analysis, we also re-ran these enrichment tests using a constrained set of randomized regions. For scanning enhancer sequences, we randomly shuffled the true target set of regions across the entire set of peaks used in the DA analysis (n=37780), to account for background biases in the occurrence of motifs across ATAC-seq peaks generally. We refer to this analysis as the ‘ATAC-BACK’ set. As above, 1000 randomly-generated sets were used to assess statistical significance along with BH corrections.</p><p>To visualize the differences in motif enrichments across sets of lineage-biased genes and regions, we took the sets of motifs enriched in either growth-plate (BMP) or articular (TGF) chondrocyte lineages and sorted them by the absolute difference in log<sub>10</sub> adjusted p-values (i.e. selecting those motifs with the largest change in motif enrichments across lineages). The top five motifs from each analysis were then plotted using ggplot2 (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B, D and E</xref>).

We broadly selected all ChIP-seq tracks available for our factors, retaining all peaks at a significance threshold of 0.05. Tracks were sorted and merged with bedtools. To test for overlap with our region sets we performed hypergeometric tests using the ‘phyper’ function in base R. Given our interest in the lineage-specificity of transcription factor motifs, we used as a background the pooled set of DA peaks biased in either lineage (n=4720). BH correction was applied for the number of sequence sets tested (n=4) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5a</xref>).

Col2a1-ECFP/Col10a1-mCherry male and female mice were used to establish timed matings, and at E15.5 pregnant females were euthanized to acquire embryos. At this time point, chondrocytes are easily extracted from the surrounding extracellular matrix for ATAC-seq with negligible effects on the epigenome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Guo et al., 2017</xref>). Embryos were dissected under a microscope in 1 X PBS on ice and the proximal and distal portions of the right and left femur and tibia of the hind limb were stripped clear of soft tissues. Each proximal or distal cartilaginous end comprising of the articular chondrocytes, epiphyseal chondrocytes, and metaphyseal chondrocytes was then micro-dissected from the bony diaphysis and separately pooled from a single litter, consisting on average of eight animals. All samples were collected in micro-centrifuge Eppendorf tubes containing 200 mL 5% FBS/DMEM. To generate a single-cell chondrocyte suspension, each pooled sample was then subjected to 1% Collagenase II (Worthington Biochemical, LS004176) digestion for 2 hrs at 37 °C rocking, mixing every 30 min. After placing on ice, samples were next filtered using a micro-centrifuge filter set-up by gently mashing the residual tissues through the filter followed by rinsing with 5% FBS/DMEM. Samples were then spun down at 500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Col2a1-ECFP or Col10a1-mCherry positive chondrocytes were collected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using BD FACS Aria Cell Sorters at Harvard University Bauer Core Facility (HUBCF). All chondrocyte counting methods were performed using trypan blue and a hemocytometer and subsequent ATAC-seq steps were performed on collected chondrocyte samples that had cell death rates well below 10%. On average we acquired 150,000–200,000 living cells for Col2a1-ECFP positive chondrocytes per harvest; and acquired 2500–5000 living cells for Col10a1-mCherry positive chondrocytes per harvest. Next, cells were re-suspended in concentrations of 50,000 cells in 1 x PBS for CFP-positive chondrocytes; and entire mCherry-positive chondrocytes were resuspended in PBS for the next step of ATAC-seq process.

Because of the low cell number for Col10a1-mCherry positive chondrocytes, additional PCR cycles of PCR amplification are needed to generate enough PCR fragments for the next steps of ATAC-seq. To determine the optimal number of cycles to amplify the library with minimal artifacts associated with saturation PCR of complex libraries, the appropriate number of PCR cycles is determined using qPCR to stop amplification prior to saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>).

Prior to sequencing, sample concentrations were determined using the KAPA Library Quantification Complete Kit (KK4824).

However, the Col10a1 datasets, for which we noted elevated levels of cell death prior to ATAC-seq (possibly attributable to the hypertrophic nature of these cells) had substantially greater variability across samples compared to our Col2a1 datasets. Thus, for Col10a1 called peaks (peak calls are available through GEO datasets), we used a less stringent approach to replicate consolidation – requiring that a called peak is overlapped in at least two different samples (using bedtools intersect) in order to be considered for subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation – quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR)</title><p>Chromatin preparation, ChIP, and qPCR were performed at Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Based on the discussion by two reviewers, it seems that works presented in this manuscript in general is interesting.</p><p>1) The authors need to add more time points, especially the early time point, for their studies.</p><p>2) Using single cell RNA sequencing technique will add additional value, but it would be interesting to publish current works (with more time points), even without single cell RNA sequencing approach. The authors may discuss this point as prospective studies.</p><p>In addition, the authors should consider addressing several other concerns raised by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the current study, the authors aim to apply their in vitro differentiation approach to address the large gap in understanding articular and cartilage development mechanisms in humans. Based on their previous study, hESC were cultured under specified conditions and directed into terminal differentiated cartilage tissue with a similar organization as fetal cartilage. Bulk RNA sequencing and ATAC-sequencing analysis were performed for hESC-derived cartilage tissue and fetal cartilage. Comprehensive bioinformatic analyses were performed to identify new lineage-specific genes and new potential regulation networks. New lineage-specific genes were verified using RNA Scope or immunohistochemical staining. A putative new target of transcription regulation for cartilage development was validated using Chip-qPCR.

The late stage cartilage tissues showed similar gene expression differences to those we identified in the initial transcriptomic dataset (Results, Page 6). We present the biological processes associated with DEGs identified at early and mid-stages of differentiation, with an additional focus on the transcription factors both unique to each developmental stage, and those that are shared at all stages during articular or growth plate cartilage differentiation in vitro. These new data can be found in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This work was initiated by a senior fellow in the Craft laboratory. However, we must respectfully disagree on the bulk RNA sequencing providing less information, particularly for our goal of defining differential transcription factor expression. Single cell RNA sequencing is less powered to detect statistically significant differences in low copy number transcripts, notably including transcription factors, due to significantly lower read depth than that which can be obtained by bulk RNA sequencing. Methods for integrating bulk RNA-seq and ATAC-seq were available when the present work was performed, while methodology to obtain matched RNA- and ATAC-seq from individual cells, especially those that must be isolated from dense extra-cellular matrix environments, is currently being optimized. We think the bulk data are interesting, important, and appropriate to publish now. However, we agree with this Reviewer about the importance of adding single cell data when we are confident those data are as robust and reproducible as our bulk data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We have referred to published studies for several of the transcription factors we found in our analyses. Our discovery of known chondrogenic factors in our analyses suggests that the new targets we identified may also have biological functions in chondrocyte biology. We strongly believe that the resource we are providing to the community will lead to such investigations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
