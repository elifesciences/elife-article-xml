However, deciphering their individual impact on stress-induced molecular changes remains a major challenge. Here, we combine RNA sequencing with selective pharmacological, chemogenetic, and optogenetic manipulations to isolate the contribution of the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system to the acute stress response in mice. We reveal that NA release during stress exposure regulates a large and reproducible set of genes in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus via β-adrenergic receptors. For a smaller subset of these genes, we show that NA release triggered by LC stimulation is sufficient to mimic the stress-induced transcriptional response. We observe these effects in both sexes, and independent of the pattern and frequency of LC activation. Using a retrograde optogenetic approach, we demonstrate that hippocampus-projecting LC neurons directly regulate hippocampal gene expression. Overall, a highly selective set of astrocyte-enriched genes emerges as key targets of LC-NA activation, most prominently several subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (<italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3d</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3g</italic>) and type II iodothyronine deiodinase (<italic>Dio2</italic>). These results highlight the importance of astrocytic energy metabolism and thyroid hormone signaling in LC-mediated hippocampal function and offer new molecular targets for understanding how NA impacts brain function in health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>noradrenaline</kwd><kwd>locus

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>When an organism faces an acutely stressful situation, a set of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms are triggered to re-route all available resources to body functions that enhance performance and increase the chance of survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Floriou-Servou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joëls and Baram, 2009</xref>). In the brain, stress exposure immediately activates the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system. Although the LC is a heterogeneous structure with modular organization, it appears that in stressful situations, broad activation of the LC - and subsequent widespread NA release throughout the brain - serves as a broadcast signal to orchestrate re-routing of computational resources to meet situational demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Likhtik and Johansen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Poe et al., 2020</xref>). On the network level, for example, NA release from the LC is sufficient to trigger a rapid reconfiguration of large-scale networks that shift processing capacity toward salience processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zerbi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Oyarzabal et al., 2022</xref>). On a circuit level, forebrain regions seem to be particularly important targets of the LC-NA system to influence cognitive processes and ultimately behavior. This involves the engagement of anxiety and memory circuits including the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, which leads to an increase in avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hirschberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zerbi et al., 2019</xref>) and supports memory formation of salient events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Uematsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sara, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwabe et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>While the insights into network and circuit dynamics of the LC have been galvanized by recent advances in circuit neuroscience tools, our understanding of the molecular impact of NA release has remained largely unexplored. However, we know that the stress response triggers multifaceted molecular cascades that profoundly change brain function and behavior in response to stressful events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Floriou-Servou et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joëls and Baram, 2009</xref>). These molecular changes are mediated by a large number of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and hormones, which operate on different time scales, to allow rapid activation, sustained activity, and successful termination of the stress response. Many of the rapid molecular changes induced by stress exposure seem to be driven by NA. For example, several of the genes that are induced by an acute stress challenge can be blocked by β-adrenergic receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roszkowski et al., 2016</xref>). However, a similar analysis on the genome-wide level has not been conducted. Further, it remains unknown whether NA release alone is sufficient to trigger transcriptomic changes in the first place. Here, we profile the molecular fingerprint of stress-induced NA release by combining pharmacological, chemogenetic, and optogenetic manipulation of the LC-NA system with genome-wide transcriptomic analyses. We focus on the hippocampus, as it receives its sole NA supply from the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loy et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robertson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oleskevich et al., 1989</xref>), and because the molecular response to acute stress has been characterized in great detail in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">von Ziegler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mifsud et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Floriou-Servou et al., 2018</xref>). As the dorsal hippocampus (dHC) and ventral hippocampus (vHC) are involved in different circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Strange et al., 2014</xref>) and are transcriptionally very distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Floriou-Servou et al., 2018</xref>), we analyze these regions separately.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A recent multi-omic characterization of the acute stress response in the mouse hippocampus revealed that stress-induced transcriptional changes peak between 45 and 90 min after stress exposure, before gradually returning to baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">von Ziegler et al., 2022</xref>). To determine how NA might contribute to these effects, we first measured the dynamics of NA turnover in response to a cold swim stress exposure in the brain. Using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (uHPLC), we determined concentrations of NA and its main metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) at various time points over 3 hr after swim stress exposure in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). NA turnover (as measured by the MHPG/NA ratio) peaked at 45 min and returned to baseline within 90 min after stress onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Therefore, we chose the 45 min time point to assess the contribution of NA signaling to stress-induced transcriptomic changes. To this end, we blocked adrenergic receptors using either the α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin or the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol prior to stress exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In line with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">von Ziegler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Floriou-Servou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roszkowski et al., 2016</xref>), acute swim stress induced a robust transcriptional response 45 min after stress exposure in both dHC and vHC (see Veh-C vs Veh-S in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Prazosin only mildly impacted stress-dependent transcriptional changes in the dHC and vHC (see Veh-S vs Pra-S in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Surprisingly, in stress-exposed animals prazosin seemed to slightly amplify - rather than prevent - some stress effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In contrast, propranolol had a profound impact, preventing many of the stress-induced changes in the dHC and vHC (see Veh-S vs Pro-S in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Indeed, a direct comparison between the stress group and the stress+propranolol group found many genes that were significantly altered by propranolol administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

Additionally, all tests had thus far been conducted in male mice, raising the question about potential sex differences in NA-mediated transcriptomic responses. To address these two issues, we repeated the experiment in both sexes and included a group that received a propranolol injection but was not exposed to stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Combining the data from both experiments, we repeated the analysis for each region, to identify genes whose response to stress was inhibited by propranolol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). As in the previous experiment, we found that many of the stress-induced gene expression changes were blocked by propranolol injection in both dHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, left panel) and vHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, right panel). Importantly, propranolol did not change the expression level of these genes in the absence of stress. We then directly compared the genes sensitive to stress and propranolol treatment in both dHC and vHC. To this end, we plotted the union of genes showing a significant stress:propranolol interaction in either region in one heatmap across both dHC and vHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). This showed again that the stress-induced changes were very similar in dHC and vHC, and that propranolol similarly blocked many of them. Finally, we asked whether the response differs between males and females. Despite clear sex differences in gene expression at baseline (data not shown), we found no significant sex differences in response to stress or propranolol between male and female mice (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). To more directly visualize this, we compared females and males by plotting the log2-fold-changes of the stress:propranolol interaction across all stress-induced genes that were blocked by propranolol. We find very similar regulation patterns in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). Although none of these sex differences are significant, some genes seem to show quantitative differences, so we plotted the expression patterns of the five genes showing the largest difference in interaction term as boxplots, which suggest that these spurious differences are likely due to noisy coefficient estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>). To address concerns that our analysis of sex differences might not have been sufficiently powered, we performed a meta-analysis of the experiments shown here along with previously published datasets from our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Floriou-Servou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">von Ziegler et al., 2022</xref>). In all these experiments, the vHC of male and female mice was profiled 45 min after exposure to an acute swim stress challenge. This resulted in a sample size of 51 males and 20 females. Despite this high number of independent samples, we could not identify any statistically significant interaction between sex and the stress response. To identify candidates that might not reach significance while discounting differences due to noise in fold-change estimates, we reproduced the same analysis using DESeq2 with approximate posterior estimation for generalized linear model (apeglm) logFC shrinkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). This analysis also did not reveal any sex differences in the stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1f</xref>). We then tailored the meta-analysis specifically to the set of stress-responsive genes that were blocked by propranolol, and also for these genes the response to stress was strikingly similar in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>). Altogether, we conclude that there are no major sex differences in the rapid transcriptomic stress response in the hippocampus, and that blocking β-receptors prevents a large set of stress-induced genes in both females and males.</p><p>We then tested whether direct activation of hippocampal β-adrenergic receptors is sufficient to induce gene expression changes. To this end, we infused animals with the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol into the dHC (because it is easier to target than the vHC). We then manually selected a few genes whose stress-induced induction was blocked by propranolol pre-treatment either partially (<italic>Apold1</italic>) or completely (<italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Sik1,</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>), and assessed the expression of these genes by targeted qRT-PCR assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>).

In summary, the results presented here show that for a large number of genes, NA signaling via β-adrenergic receptors is required to regulate the stress-induced transcriptional response.</p><p>An acute stress exposure triggers the release of a plenitude of stress mediators - neurotransmitters, peptides, and hormones - that interact to regulate molecular changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joëls and Baram, 2009</xref>). As it is unclear how NA interacts with other stress mediators, we asked whether we could isolate the molecular changes for which NA release is not only required, but sufficient, by triggering NA release in the hippocampus. Because hippocampal NA supply is provided exclusively by long-range projections from the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loy et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robertson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oleskevich et al., 1989</xref>), we first pharmacologically activated NA release using the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine, which strongly disinhibits noradrenergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). As expected, systemic administration of yohimbine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) led to a strong increase in cFos expression within the LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and increased NA turnover in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Because NA mediates the stress-induced increase in anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zerbi et al., 2019</xref>), we also evaluated behavioral changes in the open field test. We had shown previously that acute stress increases anxiety in the open field test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sturman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">von Ziegler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>), and very similarly yohimbine also suppressed locomotion and exploratory behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). To directly compare the impact of stress and yohimbine injection on the transcriptomic response in the hippocampus, we then exposed mice to acute swim stress, or to yohimbine injection without stress exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Yohimbine induced a clear and consistent transcriptional response in the dHC and vHC. Direct comparison between stress and yohimbine revealed no significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), suggesting that yohimbine administration alone can mimic a large fraction of the stress-induced transcriptional response. To more specifically probe whether selective activation of the LC-NA system alone is sufficient to trigger the observed changes in gene expression, we turned to direct activation of the LC. First, we used the chemogenetic actuator hM3Dq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>) to trigger a strong and prolonged activation of the LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). In support of previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zerbi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Privitera et al., 2020</xref>), injection of an ultra-low dose of the potent hM3Dq-actuator clozapine (0.03 mg/kg) led to a strong cFos increase in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive LC neurons in hM3Dq+, but not in hM3Dq- animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Further, we used fiber photometry combined with genetically encoded NA sensors to measure NA release in real time directly in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kagiampaki et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grimm et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2019</xref>). We found that chemogenetic LC activation leads to a rapid and sustained increase in hippocampal NA in both females and males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>). Behaviorally, chemogenetic LC activation induced an anxiety-like phenotype in the open field test, similar to the response to yohimbine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that chemogenetic LC activation induced significant transcriptomic changes that were similar in the dHC and vHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). Overall, these transcriptional changes affected fewer genes than those observed after systemic noradrenergic activation by yohimbine administration.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Locus coeruleus (LC)-mediated transcriptomic changes in the hippocampus.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimental design for assessing LC activation and cortical noradrenaline (NA) release induced by injection of yohimbine (3 mg/kg, i.p.).

Thus, we repeated the experiment using optogenetic LC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). To demonstrate that optogenetic LC activation directly triggers NA release in the hippocampus, we combined it with fiber photometry recordings using NA sensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>). We found that short (10 s) activation with 5 Hz triggered an almost instantaneous, sharp increase in hippocampal NA release in both females and males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1g–h</xref>). To mimic stress-induced LC activity, LC neurons were unilaterally stimulated with 5 Hz in a 3 min off/on paradigm for 21 min, which has previously been shown to phenocopy stress-induced effects on behavior in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCall et al., 2017</xref>). Again, tissue was collected 45 min after the start of stimulation, and in a separate cohort also 90 min afterward, to study how LC-mediated transcriptomic responses evolve over time. Optogenetic LC activation led to a significant cFos increase only in the stimulated LC hemisphere of ChR2+ animals, and these changes were significant at both time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>). Stimulated ChR2+ animals also showed a significant increase in the MHPG/NA ratio 45 and 90 min after stimulation onset compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>). Additionally, we found that tonic 5 Hz activation of the LC led to immediate pupil dilation in ChR2+, but not in ChR2- animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Privitera et al., 2020</xref>). Unilateral 5 Hz stimulation also reduced exploratory rearing behaviors in ChR2+ animals in the open field test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>). Similar to the effects of acute stress and chemogenetic LC activation, unilateral 5 Hz stimulation of the LC induced significant transcriptomic changes at the 45 min time point in the ipsilateral vHC of ChR2+ mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2m</xref>). Notably, most of these changes disappeared again 90 min after stimulation onset, indicating that the LC-NA system mainly induces an early wave of transcriptomic changes in the hippocampus, which are not maintained over longer periods of time.</p><p>Next, we leveraged the extensive transcriptional data presented thus far to test which genes were consistently responsive to the various manipulations of the LC-NA system across experiments. First, we compared gene expression changes induced by yohimbine, chemogenetic, and optogenetic LC activation in the vHC. This allowed us to identify a small set of genes that are very consistently regulated across all modes of LC activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2n</xref>). Second, we ranked genes across all the transcriptomic experiments according to their responsiveness to NA manipulations (based on p-value). This analysis includes acute stress exposure with pharmacological inhibition of NA receptors, as well as yohimbine treatment, chemogenetic and optogenetic LC activation. We then calculated the cumulative rank for each gene across all experiments to find genes with the most consistent response to NA manipulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This analysis reproduced most of the genes identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2n</xref>, and additionally revealed more genes with particularly robust changes in response to LC-NA manipulations across experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2o</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The top 10 genes were <italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3g</italic>, <italic>Sik1</italic>, <italic>Tsc22d3</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3d</italic>, <italic>F3</italic>, <italic>Sertad1</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1,</italic> and <italic>Timp3</italic>.

Going forward, we use these 10 transcripts as a bona fide list of LC-NA-responsive genes.</p><p>Our optogenetic data have demonstrated that LC neurons engage transcriptomic responses when firing at 5 Hz. Recent work has suggested that the effects of LC stimulation on brain processes, from behavior to brain network activity, depend on the firing pattern and frequency of the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harley and Yuan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghosh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grimm et al., 2022</xref>). To investigate if the molecular responses would differ between these stimulation conditions, we optogenetically activated the LC using two tonic paradigms (3 and 5 Hz), and one phasic paradigm (15 Hz, see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Stimulation was again conducted unilaterally in a 3 min off/on paradigm for 21 min for each of the stimulation groups, and tissue was collected for RNA sequencing 45 min after stimulation onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). To increase statistical power in the face of higher variability due to the relatively small sample sizes (n=5–6 mice per group), we restricted our analysis to the 10 most LC-NA-responsive genes identified earlier. Surprisingly, we found that expression of these genes was similarly affected by tonic 3 Hz, 5 Hz and phasic 15 Hz LC stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). These findings suggest that in contrast to circuit-wide changes, the molecular consequences to NA release are independent of the firing intensity and activity pattern of the LC neurons. While these transcriptomic changes seem to depend on LC-NA activity, our approach so far was not able to resolve whether NA mediates gene expression via direct effects within the hippocampus. Specifically, due to the widespread projections of the LC, it is possible that activation of other brain regions or other neurotransmitter systems might have led to indirect regulation of gene expression in the hippocampus. Thus, we selectively targeted only a subpopulation of LC neurons projecting to the hippocampus (LC<sub>HC</sub>) using a unilateral, retrograde optogenetic approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Retrograde virus expression was restricted to dorsomedially located LC neurons ipsilateral to the injection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robertson et al., 2013</xref>). To confirm successful LC<sub>HC</sub> stimulation, we directly assessed NA turnover in the cortex and dHC. Indeed, 5 Hz stimulation of LC<sub>HC</sub> neurons led to an increased MHPG/NA ratio 45 min after stimulation onset in the ipsilateral dHC but not in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). In addition, 5 Hz stimulation of LC<sub>HC</sub> neurons did not impact pupil size, emphasizing the modular organization of the LC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Within the vHC of the same animals we then assessed the transcriptional impact of targeted LC<sub>HC</sub> 5 Hz activation on the top 10 NA-sensitive genes in the vHC at the 45 min time point.

To date, the contribution of corticosteroid signaling to stress-induced transcriptional changes has been well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mifsud et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meijer et al., 2023</xref>), yet the contribution of other stress mediators remains unexplored. Here, we extensively characterize the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to the transcriptomic response in the hippocampus during stress. By combining transcriptomics with circuit-specific manipulation of the LC-NA system, our unbiased approach reveals a small, but highly reproducible set of genes that are regulated directly by NA release from the LC. This gene set identifies astrocytes as a key target for NA-induced transcriptional changes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Complex interactions between stress mediators</title><p>Our results indicate that the transcriptomic response to a natural stressor is more complex than the gene expression changes induced solely by NA. This is well in line with the notion that multiple stress mediators contribute to the molecular response, and that these systems can also interact with each other. The response to LC-NA activation we observe in our experiments is short in duration. Following temporally precise optogenetic LC activation, gene expression changes did resolve within 90 min. This is noticeably different from an actual stress response, where gene expression evolves over a 4 hr period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">von Ziegler et al., 2022</xref>). Specifically, LC-NA-regulated genes like <italic>Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3g,</italic> and <italic>Dio2</italic> were elevated for several hours after stress exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). This suggests that other stress-induced signals can also regulate these genes more slowly or with a greater delay. Indeed, a recent study reported that activation of the glucocorticoid receptor by dexamethasone can induce strong transcriptomic changes 4 hr after injection across multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerstner et al., 2022</xref>). Analyzing their data we found that <italic>Dio2</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3c,</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3g</italic> were all upregulated 4 hr after dexamethasone injection. This supports the concept that NA can act as a rapid molecular regulator, whereas glucocorticoid signaling can extend these stress-induced changes over longer time periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hermans et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the small set of genes triggered by isolated LC-NA activation, blocking β-receptors prevents the induction of a large fraction of genes normally activated by natural stressors. This suggests that even if NA release alone is not sufficient to activate large numbers of genes, it is required to enable or enhance gene expression triggered via other mechanisms. A powerful regulator of transcription is neuronal activity linked to enhanced glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandez-Albert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>). The notion that NA release could enhance glutamate-dependent transcriptional cascades is in line with physiological evidence that NA can increase the excitability of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bouret and Sara, 2002</xref>), and with the ‘glutamate amplifies noradrenergic effects’ model, which posits that NA can amplify local glutamate release to create hotspots of activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mather et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our observation that systemic administration of the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine very closely recapitulates the transcriptional response to stress stands in contrast to the much more selective transcriptional changes observed after chemogenetic or optogenetic LC-NA activation. This difference could be due to various factors. First, it remains unclear how strong the LC gets activated by yohimbine versus hM3Dq-DREADDs. However, given the potent LC activation observed after DREADD activation, it seems unlikely that yohimbine would lead to a more pronounced LC activation, thus explaining the stronger transcriptional effects. Second, contrary to LC-specific DREADD activation, systemic yohimbine injection will also antagonize postsynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors throughout the brain (and periphery). More research is needed to determine whether this could have a more widespread impact on the hippocampus (and other brain regions) than isolated LC-NA activation, further enhancing excitability by preventing α2-mediated inhibition of cAMP production. Finally, systemic yohimbine administration and noradrenergic activity have been shown to induce corticosterone release into the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnston et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leibowitz et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fink, 2016</xref>). Thus, yohimbine injection could have broader transcriptional consequences, including corticosteroid-mediated effects on gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Transcriptomic fingerprinting of NA effects using LC circuit manipulation</title><p>While systemic pharmacological treatments have been a common approach in studying the effects of different stress mediators and their receptors, they lack specificity and do not provide causal evidence that the release of a given stress mediator is sufficient to trigger molecular changes. By directly combining selective chemogenetic activation of the LC with transcriptomic analyses in the hippocampus, we were able to identify a subset of stress-responsive genes that depend on β-adrenergic signaling, and which can be triggered by NA alone in the absence of a physiological stress response. Using optogenetics we were able to validate these findings and further demonstrate that the strongest NA-mediated changes are similarly affected by tonic (3 and 5 Hz) and phasic (15 Hz) LC stimulation. Interestingly, this is in contrast with our previous findings that these stimulation patterns differentially affect brain network connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grimm et al., 2022</xref>). This suggests that engagement of a transcriptomic response via β-adrenergic receptors seems common across these LC activity patterns, while changes on a network level might rely more on α1-mediated effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zerbi et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We found that direct activation of hippocampus-projecting LC neurons (LC<sub>HC</sub>) was sufficient to increase the expression of the top NA-sensitive target genes, suggesting that local NA release in the hippocampus is directly contributing to these changes during stress. While we did not extensively characterize LC<sub>HC</sub> neurons, our data further show that in contrast to whole LC activation with 5 Hz, LC<sub>HC</sub> neurons do not seem to project to the cortex, nor do they affect pupil size.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A uniform molecular response to stress and NA release in females and males</title><p>Our results, based on a meta-analysis of large sets of transcriptomic analyses across females and males, suggest that stress triggers a transcriptomic response in the hippocampus that is independent of sex. Extensive analyses of male and female hippocampi in response to stress and propranolol also suggest that stress- and propranolol-sensitive genes show similar response profiles in both sexes. However, due to the multivariate design and our genome-wide approach, subtle changes might not have survived multiple testing correction, particularly given that our study was not designed to track hormonal fluctuations across the estrous cycle, which is known to interact with NA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bangasser et al., 2019</xref>). An example is Ctla2b, which has previously been shown to be dependent on β-adrenergic signaling and to be selectively increased in females after stress exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roszkowski et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, targeted interrogation of our dataset confirms that Ctla2b is increased by stress only in females but not males, yet this effect fails to pass multiple testing correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ctla2b is also not included in the meta-analysis, as it did not pass the filtering step in our analysis pipeline due to very low baseline expression levels (see Methods).

Although these changes must be treated with caution, our data allow targeted hypothesis testing of individual genes to generate leads for follow-up work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Genes regulated by the LC-NA system</title><p>Across experiments, our transcriptomic screening revealed a conserved set of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2o</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) that are selectively regulated by NA from LC projections in the hippocampus following acute stress exposure. Cross-referencing our data with publicly available single-cell databases suggests that - among the top 10 LC-NA sensitive genes - most are enriched in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">von Ziegler et al., 2022</xref>).

Taken together, our findings further add to accumulating evidence highlighting astrocytes as a direct and major cellular target of the LC-NA system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zenger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O’Donnell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dienel, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Within the hippocampus, astrocytic pathways are emerging as important players for learning and memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gibbs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohmbach et al., 2022</xref>). In fact, it is well known that NA enhances memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwabe et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McGaugh and Roozendaal, 2002</xref>), and recent work suggests that these effects are mediated by astrocytic β-adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iqbal et al., 2023</xref>). Our transcriptomic screens revealed <italic>Dio2</italic> as the most prominent target influenced by LC activity. <italic>Dio2</italic> is selectively expressed in astrocytes and encodes for the intracellular type II iodothyronine deiodinase, which converts thyroxine (T4) to the bioactive thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) and therefore regulates the local availability of T3 in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>). Enzymatic activity of DIO2 has further been shown to be increased by prolonged noradrenergic transmission through desipramine treatment in LC projection areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campos-Barros et al., 1994</xref>). This suggests that the LC-NA system and its widespread projections could act as a major regulator of brain-derived T3. Notably, T3 signaling plays a role in hippocampal memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rivas and Naranjo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sui et al., 2006</xref>), raising the possibility that NA-induced <italic>Dio2</italic> activity in astrocytes might mediate some of these effects. Our molecular screening approach also revealed that three subunits of the astrocytic protein phosphatase 1 (<italic>Ppp1r3d</italic>, <italic>Ppp1r3g,</italic> and <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic>) respond strongly to LC-NA activity. All three subunits enhance protein phosphatase 1-mediated glycogen synthesis. Especially <italic>Ppp1r3c</italic> expression has been found to be a master regulator of astrocytic glycogen synthesis and has previously been linked to NA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allaman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Petit et al., 2021</xref>). Another important mechanism might include regulating sodium homeostasis via the widely expressed salt-inducible kinase 1 (<italic>Sik1</italic>). SIK1 has been shown to respond to neuronal activity and regulate Na+/K+-ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jaitovich and Bertorello, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertorello and Zhu, 2009</xref>). It was also found to detect low glucose availability and initiate gluconeogenesis in liver cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), a process which could also be important for noradrenergic activity in the brain. Our findings support the idea of the LC-NA system as a major regulator of brain-wide energy metabolism, stimulating astrocytic glycogen breakdown and consequently increasing energy supply to target areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coggan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dienel, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Another interesting molecular target is the nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 (Nr4a1), a widely expressed transcription factor that could trigger broader downstream changes. Within astrocytes, Nr4a1 activity was found to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Popichak et al., 2018</xref>) and might further regulate blood-brain barrier integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paillasse and de Medina, 2015</xref>).

All experiments were conducted during the animals’ active (dark) phase. For all experiments, mice were single-housed 24 hr before exposure to stress or LC activation, which reduces corticosterone levels in both sexes, and avoids confounding gene expression effects from social stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roszkowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohacek et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stereotactic surgeries</title><p>For experiments involving hippocampal infusions, female C57BL/6-Tg(Dbh-icre)1Gsc mice at the age of 2–3 months were subjected to stereotactic surgery.

For differential gene expression (DGE) analysis we aggregated reads of protein coding transcripts and used R (v. 4.0.3) with the package ‘edgeR’ (v 3.32.1) for analysis. A filter was used to remove genes with low expression prior to DGE analysis. EdgeR was then used to calculate the normalization factors (TMM method) and estimate the dispersion (by weighted likelihood empirical Bayes). For two group comparisons the genewise exact test was used, for more complex designs we used a generalized linear model (GLM) with empirical Bayes quasi-likelihood F-tests.

We then fit an additive GLM with the newly defined response variable and the surrogate variables from the SVA correction and tested it for the response variable coefficient.</p><p>For the cumulative rank analysis, statistical results were used from multiple analyses (stress group vs propranolol group in vHC of the first injection experiment; stress group vs propranolol group in dHC of the first injection experiment; stress:propranolol interaction in second injection experiment; effect of chemogenetic LC activation in vHC; effect of chemogenetic LC activation in dHC; effect of optogenetic LC activation after 45 min). Then, in each analysis the gene with the lowest p-value was set to rank 1, the one with the highest to rank N. These ranks were then summed up across all analyses to generate the cumulative rank.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction</title><p>Reactions were conducted using SYBR green (Roche) on a CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) and normalized against Tubulin delta 1 (Tubd1).

Animals and samples were split into multiple blocks, containing one replicate of each condition. Experimental and processing order within these blocks was randomized. Investigators were blinded during behavior and sample processing, but not during the analysis process. However, the same algorithmic analysis methods were used for all samples within each sequencing experiment. Analysis was performed in R or GraphPad Prism 9.2.0. For statistical analyses of behavior, pupillometry, immunohistochemistry, and uHPLC data, we used independent sample t-tests when comparing two independent groups. When comparing more than two groups, we used one-way ANOVAs if there was a single independent variable, or two-way ANOVAs for two-factorial designs (e.g. injection × group). Significant main effects and interactions were analyzed using Tukey’s post hoc tests. For linear model analysis we used the function lm() from the ‘stats’ package in R and F-statistics for significance testing. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Code availability</title><p>Code for all analyses (independent scripts) presented here is available on GitHub under <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/Privitera-et.-al.-2023">https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/Privitera-et.-al.-2023</ext-link>; (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Privitera et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Swiss federal guidelines for the use of animals in research and under licenses ZH161/17, ZH106/20 and ZH067/2022 approved by the Zurich Cantonal Veterinary Office.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of reproducible gene expression changes across various manipulations of the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline (LC-NA) system.</title><p>This table displays the logarithmic cumulative rank of genes across all experiments from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in terms of their responsiveness to manipulations of the LC-NA system.

Authors have revealed that stress-induced release of noradrenaline from locus coeruleus plays a modulatory role in the expression of a large scale of genes in both ventral and dorsal hippocampus through activation of β-adrenoreceptors. Similar transcriptional responses were observed after optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of locus coeruleus. Among all the genes analysed, authors identified the most affected ones in response to locus coeruleus-noradrenaline stimulation as being Dio2, Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3g, Sik1, and Nr4a1. By comparing their transcriptomic data with publicly available datasets, authors revealed that these genes were upregulated upon exposure to different stressors. Additionally, authors found that upregulation of Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3g, and Dio2 genes following swim stress was sustained from 90 min up to 2-4 hours after stress and that it was predominantly restricted to hippocampal astrocytes, while Sik1 and Nr4a1 genes showed a broader cellular expression and a sharp rise and fall in expression, within 90 min of stress onset.</p><p>The paper is well written and provides a useful inventory of dorsal and ventral hippocampal gene expression upregulated by activation of LC-NA system, which can be used as starting point for more functional studies related to the effects of stress-induced physiological and pathological changes. Sex-differences were also explored which represents a strength of the study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This manuscript provides novel and important findings regarding the impact of noradrenergic signaling from the locus coeruleus on hippocampal gene expression. The locus coeruleus is the sole source of noradrenaline to the hippocampus and many rapid molecular changes induced by stress are regulated by noradrenaline. This manuscript provides a rigorous investigation into hippocampal genes uniquely regulated by noradrenaline in the presence or absence of stress. Data were collected and analyses were performed using solid methodology, and the results mostly convincingly support the conclusion made with few weaknesses. The study would benefit from a more comprehensive analyses of sex differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewers and the editors for the positive evaluation of our work and for the constructive feedback. To address some of the key criticisms, we have performed several new experiments and analyses. Importantly, we now provide a much more rigorous comparison of males and females, which strongly suggests that there are no major sex differences in the transcriptomic response to stress and noradrenaline in the hippocampus. We think that these - and other additions discussed below - significantly strengthen the manuscript. We provide detailed responses to all the reviewers comments. We have added numbers to the reviewers’ comments for easier referencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Comment 1: Privitera et al., provide a comprehensive and rigorous assessment of how noradrenaline (NA) inputs from the locus coeruleus (LC) to the hippocampus regulate stress-induced acute changes in gene expression. They utilize RNA-sequencing with selective activation/inhibition of LC-NA activity using pharmacological, chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations to identify a great number of reproducible sets of genes impacted by LC activation. It is noteworthy that this study compares transcriptomic changes in the hippocampus induced by stress alone, as compared with selective circuit activation/inhibition. This reveals a small set of genes that were found to be highly reproducible. Further, the publicly available data will be highly useful to the scientific community.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We are very grateful for this positive evaluation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: A major strength of the study is the inclusion of both males and females. However, with this aspect of the study also lies the biggest weakness. While the experiments tested males and females, they were not powered for identifying sex differences. There are vast amounts of literature documenting the inherent sex differences, both under resting and stress-evoked conditions, in the LC-NA system and this is a major missed opportunity to better understand if there is an impact of these sex-specific differences at the genetic level in a major LC projection region. There are many instances whereby sex effects are apparent, but do not pass multiple testing correction due to low n's. The authors highlight one of them (Ctla2b) in supplemental figure 6. This gene is only upregulated by stress in females. It is appreciated that the manuscript provides an incredible amount of novel data, making the investigation of sex differences ambitious. Data are publicly available for others to conduct follow up work, and therefore it may be useful if a list of those genes that were different based on targeted interrogation of the dataset be provided with a clear statement that multiple testing corrections failed. This will aid further investigations that are powered to evaluate sex effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The assessment of the reviewers and the editorial feedback encouraged us to look more thoroughly into potential sex differences, because we believe it would indeed be a major additional strength if our manuscript could make a firm statement on this important issue. To this end, we have expanded the manuscript in two major ways:</p><p>(1) To expand the analysis of sex effects also to the dorsal hippocampus, and to increase robustness of the data, we have performed RNA-seq in 32 additional samples of male and female mice exposed to stress (or control) and propranolol (or saline) injection. Figure 1fh and Supplementary Figure 1d-f have been updated to reflect this new addition, and the results are presented in a new section on Pages 3-4 (pasted below for ease of reviewing). In summary, the strongly support our initial observation that the effects of stress on gene expression, as well as the effects of propranolol on blocking stress-induced effects, are highly similar in both sexes.</p><p>(2) To further increase the power for detection of sex-effects, we have performed a small meta-analysis. For this, we combined several RNAseq datasets from the current manuscript and published datasets from our previous work (Floriou-Servou et al., 2018; von Ziegler et al., 2022), which also investigated transcriptomic sex-differences in the hippocampus 45 min after cold swim stress exposure in the same setup as used for the current manuscript. This approach increased our sample size to 51 males and 20 females. In summary, this well-powered approach shows no evidence for sex differences in the transcriptional response to stress, even when more lenient analyses were applied. These results are described in a new section on page 4, and summarized in Supplementary Figures 1f+g. This section is pasted below for ease of reviewing.</p><p>&quot;While blocking β-adrenergic receptors was able to block stress-induced gene expression, we did not test whether propranolol might decrease gene expression already at baseline, independent of stress. Additionally, all tests had thus far been conducted in male mice, raising the question about potential sex differences in NA-mediated transcriptomic responses. To address these two issues, we repeated the experiment in both sexes and included a group that received a propranolol injection but was not exposed to stress (Fig. 1f). Combining the data from both experiments, we repeated the analysis for each region, to identify genes whose response to stress was inhibited by propranolol (Figure 1g). As in the previous experiment, we found that many of the stress-induced gene expression changes were blocked by propranolol injection in both dHC (Figure 1g, left panel) and vHC (Figure 1g, right panel). Importantly, propranolol did not change the expression level of these genes in the absence of stress. We then directly compared the genes sensitive to stress and propranolol treatment in both dHC and vHC. To this end, we plotted the union of genes showing a significant stress:propranolol interaction in either region in one heatmap across both dHC and vHC (Supplementary Figure 1d). This showed again that the stress-induced changes were very similar in dHC and vHC, and that propranolol similarly blocked many of them. Finally, we asked whether the response differs between males and females. Despite clear sex differences in gene expression at baseline (data not shown), we found no significant sex differences in response to stress or propranolol between male and female mice (FDR&lt;0.05; Fig. 1g). To more directly visualize this, we compared females and males by plotting the log2-fold changes of the stress:propranolol interaction across all stress-induced genes that were blocked by propranolol. We find very similar regulation patterns in both sexes (Figure 1h). Although none of these sex differences are significant, some genes seem to show quantitative differences, so we plotted the expression patterns of the 5 genes showing the largest difference in interaction term as box-plots, which suggest that these spurious differences are likely due to noisy coefficient estimates (Supplementary Fig. 1e). To address concerns that our analysis of sex differences might not have been sufficiently powered, we performed a meta-analysis of the experiments shown here along with previously published datasets from our lab (Floriou-Servou et al. 2018; von Ziegler et al. 2022). In all these experiments, the vHC of male and female mice was profiled 45 min after exposure to an acute swim stress challenge. This resulted in a sample size of 51 males and 20 females. Despite this high number of independent samples, we could not identify any statistically significant interaction between sex and the stress response. To identify candidates that might not reach significance while discounting differences due to noise in fold-change estimates, we reproduced the same analysis using DESeq2 with Approximate Posterior Estimation for generalized linear model (apeglm) logFC shrinkage (A. Zhu, Ibrahim, and Love 2018). This analysis also did not reveal any sex differences in the stress response (Supplementary Fig. 1f). We then tailored the meta-analysis specifically to the set of stress-responsive genes that were blocked by propranolol, and also for these genes the response to stress was strikingly similar in both sexes (Supplementary Fig. 1g). Altogether, we conclude that there are no major sex differences in the rapid transcriptomic stress response in the hippocampus, and that blocking beta-receptors prevents a large set of stress-induced genes in both females and males.&quot;</p><p>To put these findings in context with existing literature, we agree with the reviewer that there are many studies that have reported sex differences in the LC-circuitry as summarized by Bangasser and colleagues (Bangasser et al., 2016, 2019). However, these studies primarily focus on the LC itself, suggesting that female rats have more LC neurons, denser LC-dendrites in the peri-LC region, and that LC neurons are more readily activated by stress in females because of heightened sensitivity to CRF-signaling. A recent study in mice reports, in contrast, that females have fewer TH-positive neurons in the LC, but they also find enhanced excitability of LC neurons in females (Mariscal et al., 2023). Similarly, one study has suggested molecular differences in the makeup of the LC (Mulvey et al., 2018). Our experiments, however, focus on the impact of NA release in a projection region (hippocampus). Further, we use a strong stress induction protocol (swim stress) and various potent modes of direct LC activation, so differences in &quot;LC-excitability&quot; are likely less relevant in this context. We added evidence showing that we trigger powerful NA release in both sexes (Supplementary Figure 2c-h; see response to Reviewer #2, Comment #3 for more details). In addition, we show that the intensity or pattern of LC stimulation does not appear to alter the molecular response (Figure 3a-b), and that various stressors (mild or intense) all trigger the same NA-dependent molecular changes (Figure 4a-b). Therefore, our results suggest that once NA is released (in the hippocampus), the molecular downstream effects on gene expression are very similar - independent of stimulation intensity, sex, or hippocampal subregion (dorsal/ventral). This does not mean that there are no sex differences for activation of LC, but rather that the transcriptional response to NA release in the hippocampus is robust across sexes, and that propranolol seems to block NA-dependent effects similarly in both sexes. This does not rule out quantitative differences between sexes that only emerge with targeted analyses of individual genes, or once fluctuations in ovarian hormones are taken into account. We have updated the section in the discussion to summarize these considerations in light of the new results (see pages 20-21, section: &quot;A uniform molecular response to stress and noradrenaline release in both sexes&quot;).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: A major finding of the present study is the involvement of noradrenergic transcriptomic changes occurring in astrocytic genes in the hippocampus. Given the stated importance of this finding within the discussion, it seems that some additional dialogue integrating this with current literature about the role of astrocytes in the hippocampus during stress or fear memory would be important.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for giving us an opportunity to add a more detailed discussion about the role of astrocytes and thyroid hormones in the hippocampus during learning and memory formation. We have added these statements to the discussion:</p><p>“Within the hippocampus, astrocytic pathways are emerging as important players for learning and memory processes (Gibbs, Hutchinson, and Hertz 2008; Bohmbach et al. 2022). In fact, it is well-known that NA enhances memory consolidation (Schwabe et al. 2022; McGaugh and Roozendaal 2002), and recent work suggests that these effects are mediated by astrocytic β-adrenergic receptors (Gao et al. 2016; Iqbal et al. 2023). Our transcriptomic screens revealed Dio2 as the most prominent target influenced by LC activity. Dio2 is selectively expressed in astrocytes and encodes for the intracellular type II iodothyronine deiodinase, which converts thyroxine (T4) to the bioactive thyroid hormone 3,3',5-triiodothyronine (T3) and therefore regulates the local availability of T3 in the brain (Bianco et al. 2019). Enzymatic activity of DIO2 has further been shown to be increased by prolonged noradrenergic transmission through desipramine treatment in LC projection areas (Campos-Barros et al. 1994). This suggests that the LC-NA system and its widespread projections could act as a major regulator of brain-derived T3. Notably, T3-signaling plays a role in hippocampal memory formation (Rivas and Naranjo 2007; Sui et al. 2006), raising the possibility that NA-induced Dio2 activity in astrocytes might mediate some of these effects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4: The comparison of the candidate genes activated by the LC in the present study (swim) with datasets published by Floriou-Servou et al., 2018 (Novelty, swim, restraint, and footshock) is an interesting and important comparison. Were there other stressors identified in this paper or other publications that do not regulate these candidate genes? Further, can references be added to clarify to the reader, that prior studies have identified that novelty, restraint and footshock all activate LC-NA neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>ponse: Thank you for the positive feedback. We have only tested the stressors reported in Figure 4a-b (novelty, swim, restraint, and footshock). It is known that all these stressors trigger noradrenaline release, in fact we are not aware of stressors that do not trigger NA release. This reproducible finding supports the notion that the identified set of genes is indeed highly NAresponsive. As suggested, we have now included references that show increased NA release in response to all these stressors:</p><p>“Therefore, we assessed their expression in a dataset comparing the effect of various stressors on the hippocampal transcriptome (Floriou-Servou et al., 2018). The stressors included restraint, novelty and footshock stress, which have all previously been shown to increase hippocampal NA release (HajósKorcsok et al., 2003; Lima et al., 2019; Masatoshi Tanaka et al., 1982).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: Comparisons are made between chemogenetic studies and yohimbine, stating that fewer genes were activated by chemogenetic activation of LC neurons. There is clear justification for why this may occur, but a caveat may need to be mentioned, that evidence of neuronal activation in the LC by each of these methods were conducted at 90 (yohimbine) versus 45 (hM3Dq) minutes, and therefore it cannot be ruled out that differences in LC-NA activity levels might also contribute.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: The reviewer raises an important point about some inconsistencies between the time points chosen in our study, an aspect that was also pointed out by Reviewer #2. We have chosen the 45 and 90 min time points for two different reasons. On the one hand, cFos changes on the protein level are known to peak 90 min after neuronal activation, and we wanted to capture the strongest possible cFos signal in the LC. On the other hand, we wanted to measure gene expression changes triggered by NA release, which already occur 45 min after noradrenergic activation (Roszkowski et al., 2016). Thus, when the experimental design allowed separate experiments (e.g. systemic yohimbine injection), we chose to measure gene expression after 45 min, but to validate cFos activation in the LC separately after 90min. In response to DREADD activation, however, we wanted to confirm within the same animal that LC activation was successful, and thus we collected LC and hippocampus simultaneously (Figure 2c,d). While the cFos increase is already very pronounced at the 45min time point (Figure 2g), the quality of IHC is slightly lower because the tissue cannot be perfused in this experimental design. Therefore, we do not think that the time point for cFos sampling matters in this context. However, we agree with the reviewer that it remains unclear whether yohimbine and DREADDs activate the LC with similar potency. To directly compare NA release would require a set of photometry-based experiments to measure NA release using genetically-encoded NA-sensors. While we have added such experiments for LC activation with DREADDs and optogenetics to show rapid NA release indeed occurs in the hippocampus (see Reviewer #2, Comment 3; Supplementary Figure 2c-h), yohimbine interferes with the NA-sensors as explained in detail in response to Reviewer 2, Comment 3. Thus, it was too challenging for us to directly compare the release dynamics in response to DREADDs and yohimbine, which was also not the main focus of our work. To explicitly address this caveat, we have extended the corresponding section in the discussion:</p><p>&quot;Finally, our observation that systemic administration of the α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine very closely recapitulates the transcriptional response to stress stands in contrast to the much more selective transcriptional changes observed after chemogenetic or optogenetic LC-NA activation. This difference could be due to various factors. First, it remains unclear how strong the LC gets activated by yohimbine versus hM3Dq-DREADDs. However, given the potent LC activation observed after DREADD activation, it seems unlikely that yohimbine would lead to a more pronounced LC activation, thus explaining the stronger transcriptional effects. Second, contrary to LC-specific DREADD-activation, systemic yohimbine injection will also antagonize postsynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors throughout the brain (and periphery). More research is needed to determine whether this could have a more widespread impact on the hippocampus (and other brain regions) than isolated LC-NA activation, further enhancing excitability by preventing α2-mediated inhibition of cAMP production. Finally, systemic yohimbine administration and noradrenergic activity have been shown to induce corticosterone release into the blood (Johnston, Baldwin, and File 1988; Leibowitz et al. 1988; Fink 2016). Thus, yohimbine injection could have broader transcriptional consequences, including corticosteroid-mediated effects on gene expression.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6: Please add information about how virus or cannula placement was confirmed in these studies. Were missed placements also analyzed separately?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Pupillometry recordings were performed with all animals involving optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulations of the LC, before subjecting them to stress experiments. These assessments account for both correct optic fiber placement and virus expression (Privitera et al., 2020). If an animal did not show a clear pupil response, it was not included any further in the study. To demonstrate correct cannula placement for drug infusion of isoprotenerol in the dorsal hippocampus, we added a representative image of cannula placement in Supplementary Figure 1h.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7: Time of day for tissue collection used in genetic analysis should be reported for all studies conducted or reanalyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for pointing out this omission.

Authors have revealed that stress-induced release of noradrenaline from locus coeruleus plays a modulatory role in the expression of a large scale of genes in both ventral and dorsal hippocampus through activation of β-adrenoreceptors. Similar transcriptional responses were observed after optogenetic and chemogenetic stimulation of locus coeruleus. Among all the genes analysed, authors identified the most affected ones in response to locus coeruleus-noradrenaline stimulation as being Dio2, Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3g, Sik1, and Nr4a1. By comparing their transcriptomic data with publicly available datasets, authors revealed that these genes were upregulated upon exposure to different stressors. Additionally, authors found that upregulation of Ppp1r3c, Ppp1r3g, and Dio2 genes following swim stress was sustained from 90 min up to 2-4 hours after stress and that it was predominantly restricted to hippocampal astrocytes, while Sik1 and Nr4a1 genes showed a broader cellular expression and a sharp rise and fall in expression, within 90 min of stress onset.</p><p>Overall, the paper is well written and provides a useful inventory of dorsal and ventral hippocampal gene expression upregulated by activation of LC-NA system, which can be used as starting point for more functional studies related to the effects of stress-induced physiological and pathological changes.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the careful assessment of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: However, I believe that the study would have benefited of a more comprehensive analyses of sex differences.

We refer the reviewer to our detailed response provided above to Reviewer #1, comment #2, and the updated results section on pages 3-4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3: Although, the experiments were overall sound and the results broadly support the conclusion made, I think some methodological choices should be better explained and rationalized. For instance, the study focuses on identifying transcriptional changes in the hippocampus induced by stress-mediated activation of the LC-NA system, however NA release following stress exposure and pharmacological or optogenetic manipulation was mostly measured in the cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Because the hippocampus was used for RNA-sequencing, we could not assess NA release in the hippocampus (as this would require fiber implants that would interfere with molecular measures, or different tissue processing for HPLC). Nonetheless, we wanted to assess the transcriptional changes in the hippocampus, while simultaneously measuring successful stimulation of the LC-NA system in the same animals. To achieve this, we pursued 3 routes: (1) we used pupillometry to confirm functional LC activation; (2) we measured cFOS in the LC to directly demonstrate LC activation; (3) we assessed NA release using uHPLC (which requires larger tissue samples) and we chose the cortex because both cortex and hippocampus receive NA predominantly from the LC (Samuels &amp; Szabadi, 2008). Importantly, we had previously shown that chemogenetic LC activation leads to a similar NA turnover in both the cortex and hippocampus, as measured by uHPLC (Zerbi et al., 2019). The relevant figure from that paper is inserted below to quickly show the striking similarity between hippocampus and cortex.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Levels of noradrenaline (NE) turnover (MHPG/NE ratio) in the cortex (CTX) and hippocampus (HC), measured in whole tissue with uHPLC 90min after hM3Dq-DREADD activation of the LC (copied and cropped from Zerbi et al, 2019, Neuron).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88559-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In response to the reviewers comment, we performed additional experiments to directly demonstrate that LC-activation with DREADDs as well as optogenetics causes an increase in hippocampal NA-release. We recorded NA release in the hippocampus (using fiber photometry combined with genetically encoded NA sensors). For DREADD activation, we observed a strong increase in hippocampal noradrenaline that started a few minutes after clozapine administration, and this increase was sustained throughout the duration of the 21 minute recording (see Supplementary Figure2c-e). For optogenetic LC activation, we find a rapid and immediate sharp increase in NA levels in the hippocampus (Supplementary Figure 2f-h).

Is this timing sufficient for both drugs to cross the blood brain barrier and to exert behavioral effects?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have previously shown that chemogenetic activation of the LC through clozapine elicits pupil responses within 1-2 minutes after injection (Privitera et al., 2020; Zerbi et al., 2019). This indicates that clozapine rapidly crosses the blood brain barrier and affects LC activity within a few minutes after injection. Our additional experiments using genetically encoded sensors in the hippocampus show this even more directly (Supplementary Figure 2d), see also the response to Comment 3 above.</p><p>Similarly, yohimbine also rapidly crosses the blood brain barrier within the same time frame (Hubbard et al., 1988). These observations are consistent with the rapid behavioral effects that can be detected within a few minutes after injection of clozapine for LC-DREADD activation (Zerbi et al., 2019), and for yohimbine as well (von Ziegler et al., 2023). In response to another comment of this reviewer, we have also re-analyzed the behavior presented in the current manuscript in time-bins of 3 minutes, which also shows the rapid onset of effects in response to yohimbine (within the first 3 min) and DREADDs (within 6 min), see Supplementary Fig. 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5: Finally, the study shows that activation of noradrenergic hippocampus-projecting LC neurons is sufficient to regulate the expression of several hippocampal genes, although the necessity of these projection to induce the observed transcriptional effects has been tested to some extent through systemic blockade of beta-adrenoceptor, I believe the study would have benefited of more selective (optogenetic or chemogenetic) necessity experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We understand the reviewer's point that blocking the LC during stress exposure would be an interesting experiment. However, it is very hard to completely silence the LC during intense stressors. In fact, despite intense efforts, we have not been able to silence the LC during swim stress exposure using DREADDs or other chemogenetic approaches (PSAM/PSEM). We were in fact able to silence the LC with the optogenetic inhibitor JAWS (and others have reported successful LC silencing with GtACR2), but there is a major issue involving the &quot;rebound effect&quot;, where more NA is released once the inhibition is stopped. We would thus have had to optogenetically silence the LC for 45-90 min, which would create heat artifacts, and require challenging control experiments to draw firm conclusions. Given all these issues, we reasoned that blocking adrenergic receptors is a simple and elegant solution, which provides clear evidence for the necessity of beta-adrenergic signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>Comment 6: The study focuses on the identification of transcriptional changes in the hippocampus induced by stress-mediated activation of the LC-NA system, however, noradrenaline release following stress exposure or yohimbine injection was measured in the cortex. Authors should consider measuring NA concentrations in the hippocampus after exposure to swim stress or administration of yohimbine, or at least explain their choice to analyse to cortex in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have addressed this issue in detail in Response to &quot;Reviewer 2, Comment #3&quot;, where we provided an overview of the additional data that support our approach. As mentioned before, measuring NA release after yohimbine is not compatible with our GRABNE-photometry approach, as the GRAB-sensor is based on alpha2-adrenoceptor. Here, we would like to add that measuring NA release using photometry during swim stress is also challenging. The challenge is the vigorous movement (swimming, typically in one direction), which creates pressure on the cables/implants. We felt that overcoming these experimental challenges (setup, troubleshooting and controls) would be beyond the scope of the paper, given that it is already known that this stressor leads to strong NA release in the hippocampus. We have now included references that demonstrate that all the stressors used in our work trigger NA increase in the hippocampus (see response to Reviewer 1, Comment 3): “Therefore, we assessed their expression in a dataset comparing the effect of various stressors on the hippocampal transcriptome (Floriou-Servou et al., 2018). The stressors included restraint, novelty and footshock stress, which have all previously been shown to increase hippocampal NA release (Hajós-Korcsok et al., 2003; Lima et al., 2019; Masatoshi Tanaka et al., 1982).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7: Concerning the experiment aimed at investigating sex differences in gene expression, it is not clear the reason why authors decided to restrict their analyses in females to the ventral hippocampal only. The explanation that in males they did not detect major differences between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus is not sufficient, because there could have been different effects in females. Therefore, the conclusion made by the authors that their &quot;results suggest that the transcriptomic response is independent of sex&quot; is not entirely correct, since sex differences were only evaluated in the ventral hippocampus.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewer's critique. As described above, we have now also sequenced the dorsal hippocampal tissue from the propranolol experiment (males and females, 32 samples) and additionally added an extensive meta-analysis of three large datasets (n=71) to compare transcriptional sex differences in response to stress. A detailed description of these experiments and how they have extended/supported our conclusions have been provided in response to Reviewer #1, Comment #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 8: Besides the effects on females, the same experiment examined whether propranolol by itself (in the absence of stress) would have been able to alter gene expression: such effects were not examined in the dorsal hippocampus. In contrast, in a different experiment, the effects of isoproterenol on genes expression were restricted to the dorsal hippocampus only. Furthermore, related to this latter experiment, intra-dorsal hippocampal injection of isoproterenol should presumably mimic the rise in NA observed after stress exposure, why was gene expression measured 90 min after isoproterenol central injections while in the other experiments gene expression was determined 45 min after stress, that is when authors observe the peak NA concentration?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have addressed the reviewer's critique of dorsal vs ventral hippocampus by reanalyzing 32 additional samples from dorsal hippocampus of male and female mice after propranolol (or saline) injection. Please see response to Reviewer #1, comment #2.</p><p>Regarding the time points: We have chosen the 45 and 90 min time points mainly for two reasons. First, cFos protein changes are known to be strongest 90 min after neuronal activation. Second, because we wanted to capture gene expression changes triggered by NA release, we reasoned that these effects must be fast and should thus be measured at an early transcriptional time-point (45min). However, after performing the time-course experiment after swim stress exposure (Figure 4d,c), we observed that the LC-NA-sensitive genes (e.g. Dio2 and several PP1-subunits) show the strongest changes 90 min after stress exposure. Therefore, in some of our experiments we opted to analyze gene expression changes at 90min, converging with the time-point we typically use for cFos staining. Contrary to the reviewer's statement, peak NA concentrations are not observed 45 min after the various interventions, but rather the peak in the main metabolite (MHPG) is observed then, due to the temporal dynamics of NA release and breakdown. NA release occurs immediately upon stress exposure (or direct LC activation), which we also show in the new photometry data described above. Thus, rapid NA release triggers intracellular cascades that lead to downstream transcriptional changes, which peak presumably between 4590 min later.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 9: Behavioral changes following systemic pharmacologic or chemogenetic manipulation were observed in the open field task immediately after peripheral injections of yohimbine or CNO, respectively. Is this timing sufficient for both drugs to cross the blood brain barrier and to exert behavioral effects? It is also not immediately clear the reason why the open field tasks have different durations depending on the experiments, which can also impact the results. Authors might also consider to split the open field data analyses in 2 or 3 min time-bins, to allow for a better comparison across the different results.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to plot the behavior data as time-bins. We have implemented this change for the yohimbine and DREADD experiments, and updated the corresponding figure accordingly (Supplementary Figure 3, pasted below for ease of reading). The new visualization clearly shows that yohimbine injection triggers rapid behavioral effects already in the first three minutes, whereas the LC-DREADD activation triggers behavioral changes within 3-6 minutes after injection. Thus, clear drug effects are visible in the first 10 minutes, which is comparable to the standard OFT test (10min testing) shown in response to swim stress exposure (Suppl. Figure 3a). The choice to expose mice to the OFT for 21 minutes in total was due to the fact that we based our experimental approach on the optogenetic LC-stimulation protocol first published by McCall and colleagues (McCall et al, Neuron, 2015), in which the LC is stimulated for 3 min followed by 3 min pauses (see Suppl. Figure 3d). Because of this on-off design, we decided to keep the optogenetic analysis simple and show the overall effect (Supplementary Figure 3d), particularly as we know that NA dynamics do not recover rapidly enough after 3 min continuous stimulation to justify a bin-analysis (unpublished data).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Effects of acute stress and noradrenergic stimulation on anxiety-like behaviour in the open field test.</title><p>a, Stress-induced changes in the open field test 45 min after stress onset. Stressed animals show overall reductions in distance traveled (unpaired t-test; t=3.55, df=22, p=0.0018), time in center (welch unpaired t-test; t=3.50, df=13.61, p=0.0036), supported rears (unpaired t-test; t=3.39, df=22, p=0.0026) and unsupported rears (unpaired t-test; t=5.53, df=22, p = 1.47e-05) compared to controls (Control n = 12; Stress n = 12). This data have been previously published (von Ziegler et al., 2022). b, Yohimbine (3 mg/kg, i.p.) injected animals show reduced distance traveled (unpaired t-test; t=2.39, df=10, p=0.03772), reduced supported rears (unpaired t-test; t=6.56, df=10, p=0.00006) and reduced unsupported rears (welch unpaired t-test; t=3.69, df=4.4, p = 0.01785) compared to vehicle injected animals (Vehicle n = 6; Yohimbine n = 7). c, Chemogenetic LC activation induced changes in the open field test immediately after clozapine (0.03 mg/kg, i.p.) injection. hM3Dq+ animals show reduced distance traveled (unpaired t-test; t=6.28, df=13, p=0.00003), reduced supported rears (unpaired t-test; t=4.28, df=13, p=0.0009), as well as reduced unsupported rears (welch unpaired t-test; t=4.28, df=13, p = 0.00437) compared to hM3D- animals (hM3Dq- n = 7; hM3Dq+ n = 8). d, Optogenetic 5 Hz LC activation induced changes during the open field test. ChR2+ animals show reduced supported rears (unpaired t-test; t=2.42, df=64, p=0.0185) and reduced unsupported rears (unpaired ttest; t=2.91, df=64, p = 0.00499) compared to ChR2- animals (ChR2- n = 32; ChR2+ n = 36).

I believe the study would have benefited of more selective necessity experiments. Authors might consider adding optogenetic (or chemogenetic) experiments aimed at inhibiting LC-NA hippocampal projections during stress exposure (or, alternatively, perform intrahippocampal pharmacological blockade of β-adrenoreceptors during stress exposure), and determine the effects on gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We kindly refer the reviewer to our previous response to Comment #2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor concerns:</p><p>There is a typo in the abstract.
