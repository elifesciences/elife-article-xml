primary motor cortex (M1). We hypothesized that similar state-dependent modulation occurs in prefrontal cortical areas with which M1 forms functional connections. Here, using 8- and 12-day-old rats cycling freely between sleep and wake, we record neural activity in M1, secondary motor cortex (M2), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). At both ages in all three areas, neural activity increased during active sleep (AS) compared with wake. Also, regardless of behavioral state, neural activity in all three areas increased during periods when limbs were moving. The movement-related activity in M2 and mPFC, like that in M1, is driven by sensory feedback. Our results, which diverge from those of previous studies using anesthetized pups, demonstrate that AS-dependent modulation and sensory responsivity extend to prefrontal cortex. These findings expand the range of possible factors shaping the activity-dependent development of higher-order cortical areas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>REM sleep</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>somatosensory</kwd><kwd>primary motor cortex</kwd><kwd>secondary motor cortex</kwd><kwd>medial prefrontal cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-HD081168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blumberg</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral and neurophysiological recordings in infant rats reveal that sleep and sensory experience influence neural activity in prefrontal cortex, mirroring similar findings in developing sensorimotor cortex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The functional development of cerebral cortex is a sinuous and often surprising process, even for those structures with the most transparent of adult functions. Consider primary motor cortex (M1), whose name reflects its well-established role in adult motor control: In early development, M1 does not contribute to motor control at all, but instead functions exclusively as a sensory structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bruce et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chakrabarty and Martin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Young et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tiriac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dooley and Blumberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singleton et al., 2021</xref>). The early-emerging somatosensory map in M1 provides the foundation upon which its later-emerging motor map is built (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dooley and Blumberg, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Another surprising aspect of M1 in early development is that its activity is modulated by behavioral state, in particular active sleep (AS, or REM sleep). In infant rats, this modulation reflects AS-dependent increases in neural activity that are enhanced by limb movements during AS, called twitches, that discretely and preferentially trigger sensory feedback to M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dooley and Blumberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glanz et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, AS-dependent modulation of activity is not unique to M1 but is seen in many developing sensorimotor structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blumberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blumberg et al., 2020</xref>). Given that AS predominates in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jouvet-Mounier et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gramsbergen et al., 1970</xref>), it has been posited that this sleep state plays an outsized role in typical and atypical development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Blumberg et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>That sleep so profoundly modulates neural activity in developing sensorimotor structures raises the possibility that it also modulates activity in cortical areas that are directly or indirectly influenced by sensorimotor input, including higher-order areas like prefrontal cortex. Of particular interest here are two areas with which M1 forms connections: secondary motor cortex (M2) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Van Eden et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedwell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bedwell et al., 2017</xref>). As its name implies, M2 has a particularly close functional and anatomical connection with M1: It integrates multimodal sensory cues for motor planning and modulates M1 activity during goal-directed action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Omlor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthas and Kwan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morandell and Huber, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Like M1, M2 develops a somatotopic map, further highlighting its dependence on sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kunori and Takashima, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Omlor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthas and Kwan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Singleton et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that, in infant rats, M2 is similar to M1 with respect to sensory responsiveness and modulation by behavioral state.</p><p>In contrast with M1 and M2, mPFC in adults is not closely associated with sensorimotor functions, but rather with cognitive processes such as decision-making and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tanji and Hoshi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tanji and Hoshi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbas and Zikopoulos, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Euston et al., 2012</xref>). In infant rats, it is not known whether behavioral state modulates activity in mPFC, nor is it known whether mPFC processes sensory input. In fact, it has been theorized that prefrontal cortex, including mPFC, develops its unique higher-order functions precisely because it develops independently of sensory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>What is currently known about functional development in mPFC derives primarily from neural recordings from rat pups under urethane anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brockmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bitzenhofer et al., 2015</xref>). Although urethane precludes natural sleep–wake cycles, it does not prevent expression of spindle bursts in mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brockmann et al., 2011</xref>). Spindle bursts are brief thalamocortical oscillations that, in primary sensory areas, are closely associated with the processing of sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khazipov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanganu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dooley et al., 2020</xref>). In the mPFC of urethanized pups, however, spindle bursts appear to occur spontaneously. Here, we determine if this is also the case in unanesthetized pups—as well as test the hypothesis that the infant mPFC, like M1, is modulated by behavioral state.</p><p>Using unanesthetized rats at postnatal days (P) 8 and P12, we find that M2 and mPFC exhibit state-dependent modulation such that neural firing rates are highest during AS, especially during periods of twitching. We also find that neurons in M2 and mPFC respond to sensory input arising from limb movements that are self-generated (i.e., reafference) or other-generated (i.e., exafference). Finally, to explain discrepancies between the present findings and those reported earlier, we show that urethane administration at P8 prevents expression of behavioral state and brain–behavior relations. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that previously documented effects of behavioral state and sensory experience on somatosensory activity in M1 extend to M2 and mPFC, thus pointing toward new directions for conceptualizing activity-dependent development of higher-order cortical areas.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We recorded extracellular unit activity in M1, M2, and mPFC in head-fixed rats at P8 and P12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For each pup, dual recordings were performed first in the forelimb regions of M1 and M2 (also referred to as the caudal and rostral forelimb areas, respectively) for 40 min, followed by 50 manual stimulations of the forelimb contralateral to the recording sites. Next, the M2 electrode was repositioned in mPFC and the recording and stimulation procedure was repeated but now with dual recordings in M1 and mPFC. Electrode locations in M1, M2, and mPFC were confirmed histologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At P8, we collected eight M1–M2 recordings (107 M1 units, 118 M2 units) and eight M1–mPFC recordings (117 M1 units; 103 mPFC units); at P12 we collected nine M1–M2 recordings (217 M1 units; 204 M2 units) and eight M1–mPFC recordings (222 M1 units; 179 mPFC units). Neural activity, electromyographic (EMG) activity in the nuchal and biceps muscles, and high-speed video (100 frames/s) were recorded as pups cycled between sleep and wake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>).

Also, the transition from discontinuous cortical activity at P8 to continuous activity at P12 was evident in all three areas, as described previously in primary somatosensory, motor, and visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golshani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rochefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van der Bourg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glanz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Riyahi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Representative neural activity in M1, M2, and mPFC in P8 and P12 rats.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration showing the surface locations of M1 (blue), M2 (magenta), and mPFC (gold).

Second, we find that neurons in M2 and mPFC respond to reafference arising from twitches and wake movements, and exafference arising from manual stimulation, with the proportion of responsive neurons generally being highest in M1 and decreasing across M2 and mPFC. Finally, we show that urethane thwarts accurate assessments of brain–behavior relations in developing cortex by suppressing neural activity and abolishing sleep–wake states, thus explaining discrepancies between the present and previous findings. Altogether, these results highlight the potential importance of sleep and sensory experience for the functional development of prefrontal cortex.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Prefrontal cortex is most active during sleep</title><p>In developing rats, AS modulates spiking and oscillatory activity in M1 and S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blumberg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dooley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glanz et al., 2021</xref>), findings that we now extend to M2 and mPFC. Neural activity in these two areas was highest during movement-related periods of AS, but it was also higher during AS than wake even in the absence of movement. These findings suggest that state-dependent neuromodulation is a general feature of infant cortical activity. Although neuromodulators like acetylcholine and serotonin, respectively, influence early cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanganu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janiesch et al., 2011</xref>) and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kolk and Rakic, 2022</xref>), it is not yet known whether these and other neuromodulators are released in a state-dependent fashion, as is known to occur in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones, 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Prefrontal cortex responds to sensory input</title><p>Sensory experience in early life scaffolds developing sensory and sensorimotor systems, providing information about the growing body and the world it inhabits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blumberg, 2015</xref>). Notably, recent evidence from the visual system of both rodents and primates suggests that how sensory input reaches cortex is fundamentally different in infants and adults. In adults, sensory information flows through a hierarchical network, from primary cortical areas to higher-order cortical areas. But, in the developing visual system, both primary and higher-order visual areas receive parallel sensory input directly from thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Warner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murakami et al., 2022</xref>).

This ascending sensory input to M1 and S1 may refine somatotopy and connectivity within and between these cortical areas, thus laying a foundation for their further development, including the later emergence of M1’s motor functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dooley and Blumberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gómez et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>M2 is a higher-order sensorimotor area with a somatotopic representation, though its organization is coarser than M1’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mohammed and Jain, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mohammed and Jain, 2016</xref>). Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that we found that M2 units, like those in M1, exhibit short-latency sensory responses to self- and other-generated forelimb movements. In contrast, mPFC does not exhibit somatotopic organization. Indeed, it has been theorized that the development of higher-order functions in prefrontal cortex derives in part from its relative independence from sensory input, relying instead on intrinsic (or spontaneous) neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Werchan and Amso, 2017</xref>).

However, our attempts to identify this source yielded null results. Thus, the source of M2 and mPFC’s short-latency sensory responses in early development remains unknown, and likely differs from the source for M1 and S1. Moving forward, future studies may need to combine precise stimulation of ascending pathways with recordings in M2 and mPFC.</p><p>Across M1, M2, and mPFC, we observed a declining proportion of sensory-responsive units, with the highest proportion in M1 and the lowest in mPFC. Importantly, because mPFC is not somatotopically organized, by testing only forelimb sensory input it is likely that we are underestimating the proportion of mPFC units that respond to somatosensory input.

Accordingly, we expect neurons in developing mPFC to respond to somatosensory input from other parts of the body, as well as visual, auditory, olfactory, and gustatory input.

Thus, we propose that state-dependent modulation and sensory responsiveness are general features of developing cortex. In other words, the early functional development of primary and higher-order cortical areas may be more similar than currently appreciated.</p><p>Finally, although the similarities and differences between rodent and primate PFC have been debated for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Preuss, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Uylings et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthas and Kwan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carlén, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Laubach et al., 2018</xref>), there is still no consensus regarding the extent to which non-primates have cortical areas homologous to primate PFC. When defining PFC, different researchers variously emphasize anatomical connectivity and functional criteria, resulting in terminological confusion. For example, in rodents, M2 goes by many names and may perhaps be considered part of mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barthas and Kwan, 2017</xref>). The current study does not resolve these issues and was not designed to do so, but does suggest that a developmental-comparative approach will prove useful for clarifying PFC’s evolutionary and functional history, as it has for other cortical domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krubitzer and Dooley, 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

‘P12’; body weight: 30.74 ± 2.16 g) were used. Pups were born to dams housed in standard laboratory cages (48 × 20 × 26 cm) with a 12-hr light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. The day of birth was considered P0 and litters were culled to eight pups by P3. To protect against litter effects, pups selected from the same litter were always assigned to different experimental groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbey and Howard, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lazic and Essioux, 2013</xref>).

Briefly, on the day of recording a pup of healthy weight and with a visible milk-band was removed from the litter, anesthetized with isoflurane (3.5–5%, Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA), and placed on a heating pad. Bipolar electrodes (California Fine Wire, Grover Beach, CA) were inserted into the nuchal muscle and left and right forelimb muscles (<italic>biceps brachii</italic>) and secured with collodion. An anti-inflammatory agent (Carprofen, 0.1 mg/kg SC; Putney, Portland, ME) was administered and the torso of the pup was wrapped in soft surgical tape. The scalp was sterilized with iodine and ethanol, and a portion of the scalp was removed to reveal the skull; a topical analgesic (bupivacaine, 0.25%; Pfizer, New Work, NY) was applied to the skull surface and surrounding skin, and then a veterinary adhesive (Vetbond; 3M, St. Paul, MN) was used to secure the skin to the skull. A steel head-fix (Neurotar, Helsinki, Finland) was attached to the skull using super glue (Loctite; Henkel Corporation, Westlake, OH) and dried with accelerant (INSTA-SET; Bob Smith Industries, Atascadero, CA). The pup was secured in a stereotaxic apparatus (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) and, under isoflurane anesthesia, a steel trephine (1.8 mm; Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA) was used to drill openings in the skull over forelimb M1 (all coordinates from bregma; P8: +1.0 mm rostrocaudal (RC), 1.8 mm mediolateral (ML); P12: +1.0 mm RC, 1.8–2.0 mm ML), forelimb M2 (P8 and 12: +2.0 mm RC, 1.0 mm ML), and mPFC (P8 and P12: +1.8 mm RC, 0.5 mm ML). The pup was then transported to the recording rig, where it recovered for at least 1 hr. Recording began only after regular sleep–wake cycles were observed and intracranial temperature reached 36°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-2"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>Neurophysiological and EMG data were collected using a data acquisition system (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Gainsville, FL) with sampling rates of approximately 25 and 1.5 kHz, respectively. Neural data were collected simultaneously from two cortical locations using 16-site, 3 or 5 mm silicon-iridium electrodes (A1x16-3 mm-100-177-A16 or A1x16-5 mm-100-177-A16; NeuroNexus, Ann Arbor, MI). Before insertion, electrodes were coated with a fluorescent dye (DiI; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) for later confirmation of placement. A chlorinated silver wire (0.25 mm in diameter; Medwire, Mt. Vernon, NY) was inserted into occipital cortex and used as both reference and ground. Neural data were recorded and visualized using Synapse software (Tucker-Davis Technologies). Video was collected using a BlackFly-S camera (100 fps) and SpinView software (FLIR Integrated Systems, Wilsonville, OR). To enable synchronization of the video and electrophysiological records, an LED was positioned within the camera frame and was programmed to flash once every 3 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dooley et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>We performed two sequential recordings in 10 pups at P8 (five female) and 14 pups at P12 (seven female). We first recorded activity from the forelimb regions of M1 and M2. Electrodes were inserted into the target sites and allowed to settle for at least 10 min. To confirm electrode placements in the forelimb region of both areas before recording began, the experimenter used a cotton-tipped dowel to move the contralateral forelimb while monitoring neural activity. If forelimb-related activity was not detected during the first electrode placement (a rare occurrence), the electrode was withdrawn, repositioned, and lowered again; electrodes were never repositioned more than twice. Video and neurophysiological data were recorded for 40 min as the pup cycled freely between sleep and wake. This period was followed by 50 manual stimulations of the right forelimb (as described above), delivered approximately 2–3 s apart. Upon completion of the stimulation protocol, the electrode in M2 was carefully withdrawn, coated again with DiI, and reinserted into mPFC (the M1 electrode was not disturbed). After the electrode settled in mPFC for at least 10 min, we again recorded video and neurophysiological data for 40 min, followed by 50 stimulations of the right forelimb. In total, the M1–M2 dataset consisted of eight recordings at P8 and nine at P12; the M1–mPFC dataset consisted of eight recordings at P8 and eight at P12.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Processing of neurophysiological data</title><p>Neurophysiological data were filtered for unit activity (bandpass: 300–5000 Hz) and converted into binary files. Templates for putative spikes were extracted using Kilosort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pachitariu et al., 2016</xref>) and visualized using Phy2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rossant and Harris, 2022</xref>), as previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dooley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glanz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gómez et al., 2021</xref>). Spike waveforms and autocorrelations were used to identify single units and multiunits. Preliminary analyses were performed to confirm that the activity profiles of single units and multiunits did not differ in any systematic way. Thus, all subsequent analyses were conducted using both single-unit and multiunit activity (hereafter ‘units’ or ‘unit activity’). To obtain local field potentials (LFPs), neurophysiological data were downsampled to ~1000 Hz, smoothed (0.005 s), and converted into binary files. Spike-time and LFP data were imported into MATLAB for analysis. To extract spindle bursts, LFP signals were bandpass filtered at 10–20 Hz (stopband attenuation: −−60 dB; transition gap: 1 Hz) and the phase and amplitude of the filtered signal were calculated using a Hilbert transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glanz et al., 2021</xref>). Spindle bursts were defined as events for which the waveform amplitude exceeded, for at least 100 ms, the median amplitude plus two standard deviations of the baseline amplitude. Spindle-burst onset was determined using previously described methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dooley et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Analysis of behavioral state</title><p>Motor activity and behavioral state were assessed visually using video and corroborated with EMG. We used custom-written MATLAB scripts to detect frame-by-frame changes in pixel intensity within user-defined regions of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dooley et al., 2021</xref>). We selected two regions, one encompassing the right forelimb and the other encompassing the entire body, to allow detection of movement periods. Movements were represented as changes in pixel intensity across time. We then imported movement, neurophysiological, and EMG data into Spike2 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK).</p><p>Recording data were separated into periods of AS and wake. AS was defined by the presence of myoclonic twitches occurring against a background of nuchal muscle atonia. Twitches appear as brief, jerky limb movements and as sharp spikes in the EMG record. Wake was defined by the presence of increased nuchal muscle tone relative to AS, most commonly initiated by and containing large-amplitude movements of multiple limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Del Rio-Bermudez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glanz et al., 2021</xref>). Periods of behavioral quiescence that were not defined as AS or wake were examined but not included in the present analyses. Behavioral state was always scored blind to neural activity.</p><p>To quantify differences in firing rate across AS and wake, for each unit we calculated the mean firing rate over the duration of each state; we then calculated mean firing rate across units within each brain area for each pup. At P8, we also assessed whether the occurrence of spindle bursts was state dependent. For each area in each animal, we determined the mean rate of spindle bursts during AS and wake, and then calculated the mean rates across pups. Spectrograms of oscillatory activity were generated using the sonogram function in Spike2. (This analysis was not performed at P12 because spindle bursts are not clearly discernable at this age.)</p><p>To delineate differences between state- and movement-dependent changes in firing rate in M1, M2, and mPFC, we calculated the mean firing rate in each area during periods of movement. Movement and non-movement periods were extracted using custom MATLAB scripts from whole-body movement data (derived from video as described above). The onset of a movement period occurred when movement data exceeded a threshold value of 3× greater than baseline for at least 250 ms; the offset of a movement period occurred when movement data decreased below threshold. Movement and non-movement periods were categorized as to whether they occurred during AS or wake. Mean firing rates were calculated for each unit during the following conditions: AS with movement, AS with no movement, wake with movement, and wake with no movement. We determined the mean firing rate across units within an area and then the mean rate across pups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Analysis of sensory activity</title><p>We analyzed neural activity in M1, M2, and mPFC in response to twitches, wake movements, and stimulations (hereafter referred to collectively as ‘sensory events’). First, we scored twitches of the right forelimb during AS. The onset of a twitch was defined as the first video frame showing movement. When a bout of rapid twitching was detected, the first twitch in the bout was always scored; subsequent twitches in the bout were also scored if they could be clearly distinguished from the previous twitch (e.g., by a change in movement direction). We also scored individual forelimb wake movements; because wake movements typically occur as bouts of long continuous sequences, only the first limb movement in a bout was scored. The onset time of each forelimb stimulation was scored as the first video frame in which the dowel touched the forelimb. Sensory events were also always scored blind to neural activity.</p><p>To determine whether units in M1, M2, and mPFC were responsive to sensory input, we constructed PETHs for unit activity triggered on sensory events. We calculated PETHs in spikes/s for each unit, triggered on sensory events (window = 1 s, offset = 0.5 s, bin size = 10 ms). We then defined a baseline window (BLW; −500 to −200 ms before the event) and a sensory-response window (RW; 0–200 ms after the event) and calculated the mean firing rate within each window. If the firing rate during the RW was greater than the mean baseline firing rate plus 2× the standard deviation of the baseline value (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), the unit was categorized as ‘responsive’. Using only responsive units, we again calculated average PETHs within each structure and normalized the data to the maximum value within each PETH.</p><p>To assess the reliability of neural responses to sensory events, we examined the activation rate, defined as the percentage of events to which each area responded. Again, using only responsive units, we examined the activity of each unit before and after each sensory event, using the same BLW as above but increasing the RW to 0–300 ms after the event so that the window durations were equal. For a given unit within a cortical area, if the summed unit activity within the RW exceeded a threshold defined as 1.5× the summed unit activity within the BLW (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), the unit was categorized as having an event response. When more than 30% of recorded units within a cortical area exceeded this threshold, it was determined that the area as a whole for that pup was activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glanz et al., 2021</xref>). If a pup had no responsive units in a given area, that area’s activation rate was set to zero.</p><p>Finally, to assess whether spindle bursts are associated with sensory events in M1, M2, and mPFC, we calculated the probability that a spindle burst was preceded by a sensory event for each area. First, for each spindle burst, we defined a window of time spanning 500 ms before the spindle burst onset. If a sensory event occurred within that window, we inferred that the sensory event triggered the spindle burst. We then divided the number of spindle bursts preceded by a sensory event by the total number of spindle bursts to derive a probability for that behavioral state or stimulation period. Probabilities were calculated for each area in each animal, and then averaged across animals. To establish the probability that a spindle burst was preceded by a sensory event due to chance, we performed 100 random reshuffles of sensory-event and spindle-burst onset times within a behavioral state or stimulation period. We used the mean probability of these 100 reshuffles to derive the expected (chance) probability for each type of sensory event. We then compared the expected and observed probabilities to determine whether spindle bursts were reliably preceded by sensory events. Finally, we compared spindle-event probabilities across areas to determine if the reliability of a sensory event preceding a spindle was similar across areas.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Experiment 2: Recordings in urethanized pups</title><p>In Experiment 2, we used P8 rats to assess the effects of urethane anesthesia on behavior and neural activity in M1 and mPFC.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Experimental procedure</title><sec id="s4-4-1-1"><title>Surgical preparation</title><p>Surgical preparation.

We then infused urethane (1.0 mg/g b.w.; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or an equivalent volume of sterile saline (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) through the implanted cannula. This procedure minimized disruption of the pup and allowed for uninterrupted recording of data. Also, subcutaneous infusion of urethane produces a comparable level of surgical anesthesia as intraperitoneal injection and reduces the likelihood of organ puncture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maggi and Meli, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Field and Lang, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Matsuura and Downie, 2000</xref>).

The sums of the movement data in the pre- and post-injection periods were divided by the total duration of each period.

The brain was extracted and fixed for at least 24 hr in PFA and 48 hr in phosphate-buffered sucrose. Brain tissue was sliced coronally (80 µm) using a freezing microtome (Leica Biosystems, Wetlzar, Germany) and tissue was wet-mounted to locate the electrode tracks using fluorescence microscopy (×2.5–5 magnification; Leica Microsystems). Sections were placed in well plates and stained for cytochrome oxidase (CO) to visualize cortical layers. Well plates were filled with CO solution (catalase, cytochrome C, DAB, phosphate-buffered H<sub>2</sub>O, and DiH<sub>2</sub>O) and sections were allowed to develop in solution for 3–6 hr on a heating pad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dooley et al., 2021</xref>). Sections were then rinsed with PBS, slide-mounted, and allowed to dry for 48 hr; slides were then placed in citrus clearing solution for 5 min, after which they were cover-slipped with dibutylphthalate polystyrene xylene (DPX) mounting medium. Cover-slipped slides were allowed to dry for at least 24 hr. Fluorescent and brightfield images (at ×2.5–5 magnification) were imported into Adobe Illustrator (San Jose, CA) and electrode tracks were reconstructed. CO-stained slides were used to determine the border between S1 and M1 (using layer 4 as a boundary). We demarcated mPFC and M2 based on the structure and orientation of cortical layers and with the aid of brain atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paxinos and Watson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Khazipov et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in SPSS (IBM) and MATLAB.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lukas I Schmitt (Reviewer #1); Anita Lüthi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Further analysis: Data presented are mainly descriptive and remain at an observational state rather than bringing functional insights. Further analysis are absolutely required on, for example: (1) the nature of the relationship of single unit firing with sleep states, spindle activity, sensory inputs or motor activity across different development stages, (2) correlation between single unit responses with the different types of events investigated, spike train variability, unit properties description, correlation between M1-M2 units….</p><p>(2) Further analysis must also include more statistics.</p><p>(3) The authors should consider toning down some of their claims that are not sufficiently substantiated by the actual experiments. For instance, the effects of sensory stimulation under urethane anesthesia have not been performed but could be useful to argue on the effects of urethane. If the authors choose to run new experiments, they can publish those later as a Research Advance that will be associated with this paper, should it ultimately be accepted. Alternatively, should the authors already have data available that suggests possible neural substrates of early sensory responsiveness (e.g., histological data regarding the connectivity of motor and prefrontal areas at these early stages of development), then you may want to consider adding these additional data.</p><p>(4) The term sensory feedback seems to be inappropriately used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript should be revised with additional analysis included. Additional experiments may also be needed if some analysis cannot be performed on the data already collected. Suggestions for these additional analysis and potential experiments as well as critical issues with presentation are listed below.</p><p>(1) As currently presented, analysis of the recordings made by the authors are largely descriptive and so their findings are difficult to interpret beyond the initial observation of state-related activity in the three areas examined. While it is true, as the authors state that &quot;These findings expand the range of factors shaping the activity-dependent development of higher-order cortical areas&quot;, it is not particularly clear what exactly these factors are or how the activity observed may be involved in development. To address this, the authors should further analyze recorded activity to clarify the nature of the relationship of single unit firing with active sleep as well as with spindle activity, sensory input, and movements across the developmental ages examined. For example, to link activity at the single unit level with spindles, the authors could assess spindle-associated firing rates and spike phase relationships in recorded units across areas (i.e. as in Dickey et al., Nat. Comm. 2021). PETH histograms like those used for motor and sensory events could also be useful for this purpose. More generally, assessment of the correlation between responses of single units to different types of events (i.e. in figure 5), at least for responding neurons, would help to determine whether there are connections between activity elicited.</p><p>(2) Analysis of the effects of Urethane, while informative, is incomplete in that the authors do not connect the observed effects of Urethane administration with their other observations. For instance, it does not appear that the response to sensory events is assessed. If there is another means to more directly link the observed urethane dependent changes with their other analysis, then this experiment (sensory stimulation under urethane anesthesia) should be performed. It would also be important to compare effect size across areas to support the idea that urethane obscures state-related activity specifically in higher cortical areas such as PFC.</p><p>(3) In the discussion, the authors consider differences across the areas recorded and suggest that the &quot;decreasing somatotopic homogeneity and increasing functional heterogeneity&quot; of PFC relative to M1 suggests that &quot;sensory input in early development likely serves different functional roles&quot; for these areas. While this idea is interesting and the illustration of this claim in Figure 8 suggests that the authors think it is important for their overall message, the supporting evidence included in the manuscript is relatively weak. It is not clear that the observation of different percentages of responsive neurons in different areas shows any sort of functional heterogeneity and, in any case, it is not clear what this would mean from a functional perspective. If the authors want to include this claim, which I think does add to the value of the study overall, they should include additional analysis such as correlating single unit responses to different types of events. Comparison of spike-train variability (e.g. Ruyter vavn Steveninck et al. science 1997) across areas may also be useful for this purpose.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study is very well done and the data is clearly described. One wonders whether the authors could go a step further to provide more analytic insight. Do these areas receive synaptic projections from subcortical somatosensory areas? Are these innervation patterns consistent with the decline of responsiveness from P8 to P12? And what is the role of M1-M2 or M1-mPFC projections?</p><p>The study could also go a step further in the analysis of the existing data. For example, a presentation of unit properties is missing, which leaves the reader uninformed about unit heterogeneity and distribution across layers.</p><p>The non-expert reader may wonder about the general description of twitches, wake-related movements and external sensory stimuli as &quot;sensory feedback&quot;. It is not clear what is meant with feedback during external sensory stimuli. It is also unclear what role proprioceptive stimuli, e.g. the ones from muscle spindles play here. This also raises the question could look at whether individual units share responsiveness to twitches, wake movements and stimulation.</p><p>Figure 1C intriguingly suggests that M2 units discharge in a manner that seems to be complementary to the one observed for M1 units. This seems much less to be the case for mPFC units. This would deserve some more in-depth analysis. This in particular is because the mean firing plots in Figure 2 do not seem to replicate this. How is the dataset shown in Figure 1 related to the one in Figure 2?</p><p>Even though the criteria to score active sleep and to distinguish it from wakefulness seem clear to the authors, this is not obvious in the short data stretches presented. In particular, the authors description of a nuchal atonia is not evident in Figure 1C. What were the thresholds set for this atonia?</p><p>It would also be great to have some more quantitative information about the distinct LFP activity patterns in M2 and PFC at P8 and P12. Why were they not taken into account to score states of vigilance? What are the frequencies of the rhythmic activity pattern evident at P12 but not at P8 that seems typical for active sleep? Time-frequency plots of the kinds shown in Figure 3 would be helpful to get a more quantitative insight.</p><p>I am not sure the time-frequency plot shown in Figure 3A is really helpful. Here, instead of such a plot, a dataset illustrating the presence of spindle bursts in unfiltered and band-pass filtered data would instead be helpful to recognize the individual events.</p><p>Does the LED light that was used for synchronization purposes disrupt the sleep-wake activity of these pups?</p><p>Line 133-134.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In my view, the authors have improved the manuscript and addressed some important issues with the original submission. In particular, the assessment of event-associated response characteristics in Figure 3, S1 is helpful for understanding spindle-associated activity. Nonetheless, some further revisions and clarifications would be important prior to acceptance. These suggestions are detailed below:</p><p>(1) One issue pointed out in the review of the first submission was the apparent disconnect between the investigation of sleep-associated regional dynamics that are the major focus of the study and the latter section examining the effects of Urethane. The authors' explanation as to the reason for not including an assessment of mPFC responses under anaesthesia presented in their response to review is reasonable but this point should be made more clearly in the discussion.</p><p>(2) Although the authors now include a discussion regarding links between M1, M2, and PFC, relevant to the dynamics they observe, this still does not really address the question of whether processing across these regions occurs in parallel or as part of a connected series. While it is difficult to address this point conclusively, as mentioned in the manuscript the similarity in the response profile peak timing across regions suggests that they are engaged in parallel (e.g. in Figure 5). To make this point more formally, it might be helpful to show the distribution of peak latency from threshold across the responding units in each region for the different conditions and developmental stages. This would help to more completely address the concerns raised in &quot;Essential Revisions 3&quot;. Alternatively, the authors could present the evidence against the coactivation of neurons across the recorded regions mentioned in line 185 but not currently included in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have responded to my comments and have improved the manuscript by:</p><p>- Clarifying their scoring procedure;</p><p>- Adding additional datasets on unit activity in two new figures;</p><p>- Changing an existing figure by adding more representative data.</p><p>I also like a lot the newly added discussion part that makes the significance of the present findings more clear. In fact, that PFC is responsive to sensory stimuli at early stages of development is a game changer in how one should think about cortical development. Furthermore, the comparison between anesthesia and sleep is also helpful. It should hopefully prompt future developmental studies to look at sleep as an essential component that cannot be replaced by using anesthetics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82103.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Further analysis: Data presented are mainly descriptive and remain at an observational state rather than bringing functional insights.

In particular, the assessment of event-associated response characteristics in Figure 3, S1 is helpful for understanding spindle-associated activity. Nonetheless, some further revisions and clarifications would be important prior to acceptance. These suggestions are detailed below:</p><p>(1) One issue pointed out in the review of the first submission was the apparent disconnect between the investigation of sleep-associated regional dynamics that are the major focus of the study and the latter section examining the effects of Urethane. The authors' explanation as to the reason for not including an assessment of mPFC responses under anaesthesia presented in their response to review is reasonable but this point should be made more clearly in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this comment by adding a sentence to the relevant section in the discussion (lines: 336–339).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Although the authors now include a discussion regarding links between M1, M2, and PFC, relevant to the dynamics they observe, this still does not really address the question of whether processing across these regions occurs in parallel or as part of a connected series. While it is difficult to address this point conclusively, as mentioned in the manuscript the similarity in the response profile peak timing across regions suggests that they are engaged in parallel (e.g. in Figure 5). To make this point more formally, it might be helpful to show the distribution of peak latency from threshold across the responding units in each region for the different conditions and developmental stages. This would help to more completely address the concerns raised in &quot;Essential Revisions 3&quot;. Alternatively, the authors could present the evidence against the coactivation of neurons across the recorded regions mentioned in line 185 but not currently included in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In previous studies, we used analytical methods, such as a shift predictor (Dooley and Blumberg 2018, Gómez et al. 2021), to determine whether sensory input in S1 and M1 is conveyed serially or in parallel from subcortical areas. That analysis yielded null results for the present dataset. Also, in response to the Reviewer’s comment, we evaluated the response latencies across sensory events, ages, and areas; unfortunately, this effort also did not yield interpretable results due in part to the variability of the individual data. However, to honor the Reviewer’s concern and add more clarity, we have modified language in the Results (lines: 195–203) and Discussion (lines: 300–306).</p></body></sub-article></article>
