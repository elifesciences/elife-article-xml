We find that TPL2 kinase activity modulates microglial cytokine release and is required for microglia-mediated neuron death in vitro. In acute in vivo neuroinflammation settings, TPL2 kinase activity regulates microglia activation states and brain cytokine levels. In a tauopathy model of chronic neurodegeneration, loss of TPL2 kinase activity reduces neuroinflammation and rescues synapse loss, brain volume loss, and behavioral deficits. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis indicates that protection in the tauopathy model was associated with reductions in activated microglia subpopulations as well as infiltrating peripheral immune cells. Overall, using various models, we find that TPL2 kinase activity can promote multiple harmful consequences of microglial activation in the brain including cytokine release, iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) induction, astrocyte activation, and immune cell infiltration. Consequently, inhibiting TPL2 kinase activity could represent a potential therapeutic strategy in neurodegenerative conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TPL2</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>T-cell</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Preventing activity of the kinase tumor progression locus 2 modulates microglial activation, reduces T-cell brain infiltration, and is neuroprotective in disease models.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Activation of microglia, the tissue resident macrophages of the brain, occurs in numerous neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), where microglia are activated in response to amyloid and tau pathology. While microglia activation may facilitate beneficial functions, such as clearance of amyloid plaques, in the early stages of AD, chronic microglia activation could contribute to disease progression via cytokine release and other harmful functions during later stages of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bright et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leng and Edison, 2021</xref>). A pathogenic role for inflammatory cytokines in neurodegeneration is supported by the increased risk for AD in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and other inflammatory diseases, and a significantly reduced incidence of AD for those patients that received treatment with TNF blocking agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Several aspects of neuroinflammation that have been observed in neurodegeneration patient brains have been studied in preclinical models and found to have deleterious effects. This includes studies in AD and FTD models that identify harmful effects of activated astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2019</xref>), NLRP3 inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heneka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ising et al., 2019</xref>), complement pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dejanovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), and infiltration of T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gate et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laurent et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merlini et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given such diverse mediators of the detrimental effects of neuroinflammation and microglia activation, targeting a central regulator of inflammatory function represents an attractive therapeutic approach. We therefore focused on tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2), a kinase that is expressed in both adaptive and innate immune cells in the peripheral system and plays central roles in regulating inflammatory responses. TPL2 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) downstream of TNFR, IL1R, and Toll-like receptors. It is maintained in an inactive complex with ABIN-2 (A20-binding inhibitor of NF-ÎºB 2) and p105, and is released upon activation. TPL2 activation is a critical node of the inflammatory response with activation leading to changes in inflammatory gene transcripts via ERK1/2 and p38 activation, resulting in amplification of inflammatory responses in peripheral immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Preclinical studies using genetic manipulation of TPL2 in mice have found that TPL2 deficiency provides beneficial effects in multiple inflammatory disease models, such as inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, pancreatitis, and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Senger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sriskantharajah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), and TPL2 is being pursued as a target for treating inflammatory conditions including RA and psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zarrin et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate a potential role for TPL2 kinase activity in microglia during neuroinflammation, we used TPL2 inhibitors and TPL2 kinase dead (TPL2-KD) mice (D270A mutation). TPL2-KD mice were chosen instead of TPL2 knockout (KO) mice because TPL2 is required to maintain stable expression of its interacting partner ABIN-2 and TPL2 KO mice have dramatically reduced ABIN-2 levels, which could confound interpretations regarding the role of TPL2 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sriskantharajah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Webb et al., 2019</xref>). We first examined the function of TPL2 in microglial inflammation using in vitro models, then in acute neuroinflammation settings, and finally in a tauopathy model of chronic neurodegeneration. These experiments indicate that TPL2 regulates microglia inflammatory activity and damage to neurons, and that blocking TPL2 function can be neuroprotective. Measurement of the cellular changes that occurred in the brains of the tauopathy mouse model with TPL2-KD along with reduced neurodegeneration and normalization of behavior reveal multiple potential beneficial aspects of preventing TPL2 kinase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TPL2 modulates inflammatory responses of microglia</title><p>TPL2 is expressed in both innate and adaptive immune cells in the peripheral immune system to regulate inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). To examine the expression of TPL2 in the brain under resting and disease conditions, we analyzed published datasets as well as datasets we recently generated. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of FACS-purified cells from human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srinivasan et al., 2020</xref>) and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) cortex revealed that TPL2 expression is enriched in brain myeloid cells and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). In an acute neuroinflammation study, in which mice received intraperitoneal injection of the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TPL2 expression was highly induced in both bulk brain tissue (GSE196401) and sorted microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>). We also found that TPL2 gene expression was upregulated in bulk tissue (GSE186414) and sorted microglia from the P301S tauopathy mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Friedman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Western blot analysis of TPL2 protein levels in the cortex of Alzheimerâs disease (AD) patients showed an increase compared to healthy control brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We first used mouse primary microglia cultures to investigate the TPL2 signaling cascade in this brain cell type. Upon LPS stimulation, phosphorylation of ERK and p38 was dramatically increased, and this increased phosphorylation was significantly dampened in the presence of the TPL2 small molecule inhibitors G-767 and G-432 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, as expected, LPS-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) pathway activation, as measured by elevation of phospho-p65, was not affected by TPL2 inhibition. Of note, the TPL2 inhibitors did not affect baseline phosphorylation of ERK, p38 or p65 without stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). These results are consistent with TPL2 mediating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, but not NF-ÎºB signaling, in microglia. It is well established that TPL2 plays an important role in regulating cytokine production by myeloid cells in the peripheral immune system via the MAPK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arthur and Ley, 2013</xref>). Consistently, using multiplex immunoassays to measure cytokine release by microglia, we found that LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFÎ±, IL-1Î±, IL-6, and CXCL1, was greatly reduced in the presence of TPL2 inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, when we analyzed cytokine release by microglia cultured from TPL2-KD mice, there was dramatically decreased LPS-induced cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). Overall, this data indicates that TPL2 is a key regulator of the microglial MAPK signaling pathway and proinflammatory cytokine responses, and thus could play an important role in modulating neuroinflammation in the brain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tumor progression locus 2 (TPL2) modulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and cytokine production by microglia.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative western blots of phospho-ERK, total ERK, phospho-p38, total p38, phospho-p65, total p65, and calnexin (loading control) in lysates from primary microglia cultures treated with vehicle or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without TPL2 inhibitors (2 Î¼M).

Several groups have shown that LPS + IFNÎ³ stimulation can induce dramatic increases of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in microglia and subsequent release of nitric oxide (NO), which is neurotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Papageorgiou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Straccia et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this mechanism, we found that when primary microglia cultures were stimulated with LPS + IFNÎ³, iNOS protein levels were increased and accumulated over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). TPL2 small molecule inhibition significantly reduced iNOS protein in stimulated microglia (50% reduction) and stimulated microglia isolated from TPL2-KD mice also showed a dramatic reduction of iNOS (85% reduction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâE</xref>).

Cytokines released by microglia in response to LPS stimulation can induce the transition of astrocytes from a resting state to an activated/reactive state that can be neurotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with a reduction of microglia activation of astrocytes, LPS-induced activated astrocyte gene expression (e.g. <italic>Cd44, Srgn</italic>) was also attenuated in TPL2-KD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, D, and E</xref>). In parallel to the RNA-seq measurements, we also measured brain cytokine levels and found that several cytokines such as IL-1Î±, IL-6, and CXCL1 that were elevated in LPS-treated WT mouse brains had significantly lower levels in TPL2-KD mouse brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Since astrocytes also express TPL2, especially under stimulated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), we investigated if TPL2 could directly regulate astrocyte activation state using primary astrocyte cultures. In these experiments astrocytes were stimulated by either LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) or a cytokine cocktail (TNFÎ±+IL-1Î±) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), with or without TPL2 inhibition. Upon stimulation, primary astrocytes released increased amounts of various cytokines. In contrast to the broader TPL2 dependence of cytokine release by cultured microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>), only a much more restricted set of cytokines exhibited TPL2 dependence in cultured astrocytes. Moreover, TPL2-dependent activated astrocyte genes identified in the in vivo LPS study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) exhibited much less TPL2-dependent activation in cultured astrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>). These results suggest that the TPL2-dependent astrocyte activation we observed in vivo following LPS injection was probably largely contributed to indirectly via the function of TPL2 in microglia, but there was also potentially some contribution of cell-autonomous function of TPL2 in astrocytes. Collectively, these results indicate that TPL2 plays a key role in microglia and astrocyte activation in vivo, and show that acute neuroinflammation can be reduced by ablation of TPL2 kinase activation.</p><p>We next investigated if TPL2 kinase deficiency could protect against neuronal damage in acute injury models. We first tested the mouse optic nerve crush (ONC) model. However, although we observed moderate reduction of microgliosis in TPL2-KD mice after ONC, we did not see rescue of retinal ganglion cell loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Additionally, we also investigated the role of TPL2 in another acute model, the rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model of stroke. Similarly, despite significantly reduced microgliosis, we did not see beneficial effects in TPL2-KD rats in terms of body weight loss, behavioral deficits, and lesion volume measured by MRI after tMCAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2BâH</xref>).

These transgenic mice overexpress human mutant Tau and develop pathology marked by phosphoTau accumulation, neuroinflammation, and brain atrophy as the mice age, especially in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshiyama et al., 2007</xref>). We examined astrogliosis and microgliosis by analyzing the microglia marker Iba1 and the astrocyte marker GFAP in 9-month-old male mice and 11-month-old female mice, as female mice develop the Tau pathology slower compared with the male mice in this mouse line based on our previous experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). TPL2-KD did not affect the % area of the brain covered by Iba1 or GFAP in non-transgenic mice.

Here, we focused on TPL2 which, as a master regulator of the peripheral immune system that is expressed by microglia, could have pleiotropic effects on neuroinflammation. In vitro studies show that similar to its function in the peripheral immune system, TPL2 is also key regulator of microglia in the brain. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of TPL2 reduced cytokine release and iNOS induction by stimulated microglia in culture and rescued neurodegeneration in a co-culture model. TPL2-KD mice also exhibited strongly ameliorated microglia and astrocyte activation and brain cytokine levels following acute peripheral LPS challenge in vivo.</p><p>Based on the potentially beneficial effects of reduced TPL2 kinase function in response to direct stimuli in vitro and in vivo, we tested the effects of TPL2-KD in in vivo neurodegeneration models. That TPL2-KD lessened gliosis but did not provide neuroprotection in ONC and stroke models is perhaps not surprising given the direct severe neuronal damage in these models of acute injury. In contrast, the beneficial effects in the TauP301S mice indicate that modulating immune cell function via eliminating TPL2 kinase activity can be beneficial in a context with chronic neuroinflammation where neurodegeneration gradually occurs over time. This fits with a general model of neuroinflammation in chronic neurodegenerative conditions, where an initial pathology (in this case Tau) results in glial cell activation, and over time activated glial cells contribute to neuronal damage. The partial rescue of brain volume loss in TauP301S mice with TPL2-KD likely corresponds to protection of stressed but functional brain tissue that is being destroyed by the inflammatory response to Tau pathology in the brain. Consistent with this, NfL levels are not rescued with TPL2-KD, which could reflect ongoing NfL production by the protected brain tissue. At the same time it is clear that despite ongoing stress from transgenic Tau production, the increased synapse density and brain volume represent preservation of functional neuronal circuits, as the behavioral phenotypes in P301S were rescued in P301S;TPL2-KD mice, indicating functional benefits.</p><p>The tauopathy model study reveals multiple aspects of pathophysiology that are normalized by TPL2-KD concordant with rescue of neurodegeneration and behavior. This includes reductions of the levels of various cytokines, normalization of increased T-cell and dendritic cell abundance in the brain, and reduction in the IEG and MHCII subpopulations of activated microglia. This points to future avenues of research examining which features are of particular importance in the protective effects of TPL2-KD. For example, do specific cytokines play critical roles in pathophysiology? Is an aberrant role for adaptive immunity in the brain critical to degeneration? Are changes in subpopulations of activated microglia critical? Or are the pleiotropic effects of TPL2 kinase deficiency in combination required for benefit? In this context, it is notable that a recent study found T-cell depletion resulted in a robust reduction of neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits in TauP301S mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2023</xref>), suggesting that the reduced amount of T-cells in the brains could be particularly relevant to the protective effects of eliminating TPL2 kinase activity.</p><p>While TPL2 is most highly expressed in microglia, it is also expressed at fairly high levels in endothelial cells. Interestingly, a recent study has found that endothelial TPL2 regulates blood-brain barrier permeability and immune cell infiltration in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nanou et al., 2021</xref>). In that study conditional KO of TPL2 in endothelial cells but not microglia, astrocytes, or neurons, protected against EAE disease severity. Endothelial TPL2 activation was found to allow immune cell infiltration, and this was proposed to function by promoting degradation of tight junction proteins including Cldn5, without changes in their corresponding mRNAs. This raises the possibility that the regulation of T-cell and dendritic cell infiltration into the brain of TauP301S mice could also be mediated by TPL2 function in endothelial cells. Our study utilized a very different model (TauP301S instead of EAE), a different loss-of-function allele (KD, which preserves TPL2 scaffolding function) and we analyzed only RNA and not endothelial proteins. Nevertheless, subclustering analysis of the endothelial cells in our TauP301S scRNA-seq study identified one subcluster (cluster 7) that increased in proportion in TauP301S mice but that was partially normalized in proportion by TPL2-KD in P301S mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5âfigure supplement 6A,B</xref>).

While this is consistent with TPL2-dependent regulation of the MAPK signaling pathway in endothelial cells in TauP301S mice, determining whether TPL2 signaling in endothelial cells regulates infiltration of peripheral immune cells in TauP301S mice will require further investigation. Aside from microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells in the brain, TPL2 is also expressed in both innate and adaptive immune cells in the peripheral system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Whether and how TPL2 function in various cell types contributes to the disease phenotypes in the tauopathy model or the acute LPS injection model could be investigated in the future by knocking in TPL2-KD in a cell type-specific manner.</p><p>Microglia orchestrate both protective and damaging responses during neurodegeneration in conditions such as AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohlen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). While our results support a beneficial role of reducing microglia activation by inhibiting TPL2 in a tauopathy model, other recent therapeutic approaches have focused on boosting microglia activation to accelerate clearance of disease-related protein aggregates, such enhancing TREM2-mediated, stimulation of microglia phagocytosis of AÎ² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fassler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate the role of TPL2 in a combined transgenic mouse model that has both AÎ² and Tau pathology, and evaluate the potential to combine TPL2 inhibition to reduce the harmful aspects of microglia-mediated inflammation with other approaches to boost beneficial effects of microglia activation.</p><p>Overall, our data indicate that reducing the inflammatory state of the brain with approaches such as targeting TPL2 kinase activity could be a potential therapeutic approach for diseases with chronic neuroinflammation. Our data also highlight that various TPL2-dependent features of neuroinflammation include elevated brain cytokine level peripheral immune cell infiltration, specific activation states of microglia, etc. that could be explored as other potential therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The following parameters were analyzed: spontaneous circling (max. score 4), motility (max. score 3), general condition (max. score 3), paw placement on table top (max. score 4, 1 point per paw), righting reflex when placed on back (max. score 1), grip strength (max. score 2), contralateral reflex (max. score 1), visual forepaw reaching (max. score 2, 1 for each paw).</p><p>At the end-point (D30), the rats were transcardially perfused with heparinized (2.5 IU/mL) saline in order to remove blood from the brains and tissues. After perfusion with heparinized (2.5 IU/mL) saline, mice were perfused with 4% PFA until fixed. Thereafter, whole brains were further immersion fixed in 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for another 48 hr. Brains were then transferred to 0.1 M PB and stored at 2â4Â°C until analysis.</p><p>IHC was performed at NeuroScience Associates (Knoxville, TN, USA) as described above. The slides were digitally scanned by NeuroScience Associates using the TissueScope LE120 (Huron Digital Pathology, Ontario, Canada) slide scanner at a resolution of 0.40 Âµm/pixel. Quantitative image analysis was performed with the MATLAB software package (MathWorks). Stained or immunolabeled areas were quantified in each hemisphere and normalized based on the total hemisphere tissue area. At least 27 serial sections were analyzed per stain per mouse and final scores were based on the average of those sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using either GraphPad Prism or R.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher K Glass (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Independent confirmation of the population proportions suggested by single cell analysis as suggested by both reviewers</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In Figures 2C and 2E, they should specify which inhibitor was used for the iNOS immunoblots and quantification.</p><p>2. In the introduction, it will be helpful to also describe the cell expression profile of TPL2 in the brain. In particular, they should highlight that TPL2 is highly expressed by both microglia and endothelial cells in the brains of mice and humans.</p><p>3. I do not believe that the Liddelow et al. 2017 manuscript, which they have cited throughout this paper, rigorously demonstrates the harmful effects of activated astrocytes in AD or FTD. They show that activated astrocytes are seen in human neurodegenerative diseases but they do not soundly establish a mechanistic role for activated astrocytes/A1 astrocytes in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative disorders. Perhaps there is a better citation to support their claim here.</p><p>4. Page 33, line 1075: Currently listed as (D) and (D) when it should be (C) and (D).</p><p>5. Figure 7 contains multiple tests and experiments that focused on a single sex. Histology and behavior were also completed at varied timepoints. Can the authors provide complimentary data is the opposing sex or comment as to why both sexes at consistent timepoints were not represented equally across the study?</p><p>6. While it is valuable to acknowledge the TREM2 literature and the beneficial effects of increased microglial activation in certain instances, a statement should be included about the complex relationship tauopathies have with the immune system. Harmful and beneficial aspects of microglia-mediated inflammation are very disease-specific as tau and amyloid pathologies can behave in opposing directions to immune activation. To imply TPL2 inhibition will be beneficial in diseases outside of tau pathology is outside the scope of this study. The negative data associated with the stroke and nerve injury experiments support that TPL2 inhibition is not always beneficial.</p><p>7. It would be better to provide cytokine and chemokine concentrations, as opposed to relative units, in Figure S3 and Figure 1.</p><p>In the legend for Figure 3, it would be helpful if they provided the experimental time point as well as the route and dosage of LPS injection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors use several mouse models to demonstrate the potential beneficial effects of TLP2 inhibition on microglia reactivity.</p><p>â The major point that needs to be addressed relates to the use of snRNA-seq to quantify the number of cell types in the PS31 and crossed TPL2KD mice. Figure 5c suggests that nearly half of the cells recovered from TauP301S mice at 9 months of age are microglia. This seems very unlikely to reflect the actual distribution of microglia even in this severe model of tauopathy. In addition, the number of captured T cells was increased in the PS31 mice and reduced in PS31xTPL2KD mice. Isolating nuclei from brain tissue followed by 10x snRNA-seq may bias capture towards certain cell types. To demonstrate that the number of microglia and T cells are increased in PS31 and reduced in PS31 x TPL2KD the authors need to perform immunohistochemistry studies to confirm the snRNA-seq results (e.g., using for example Iba1 for microglia and CD3, CD4, and CD8 as markers for T cells).</p><p>The authors may also wish to address the following points</p><p>â Microglia respond rapidly to LPS injection (see Kim et al., Immunity 2021; Savier et al., biorxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.04.502805). It is unclear why the authors used a 24h time point to study gene expression. Furthermore, since the authors analyzed bulk RNA-seq, many differentially expressed genes in microglia may be missed due to the low fraction of microglia in brain tissue.

While it is valuable to acknowledge the TREM2 literature and the beneficial effects of increased microglial activation in certain instances, a statement should be included about the complex relationship tauopathies have with the immune system. Harmful and beneficial aspects of microglia-mediated inflammation are very disease-specific as tau and amyloid pathologies can behave in opposing directions to immune activation. To imply TPL2 inhibition will be beneficial in diseases outside of tau pathology is outside the scope of this study. The negative data associated with the stroke and nerve injury experiments support that TPL2 inhibition is not always beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have edited the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Figure 5c suggests that nearly half of the cells recovered from TauP301S mice at 9 months of age are microglia. This seems very unlikely to reflect the actual distribution of microglia even in this severe model of tauopathy. In addition, the number of captured T cells was increased in the PS31 mice and reduced in PS31xTPL2KD mice. Isolating nuclei from brain tissue followed by 10x snRNA-seq may bias capture towards certain cell types. To demonstrate that the number of microglia and T cells are increased in PS31 and reduced in PS31 x TPL2KD the authors need to perform immunohistochemistry studies to confirm the snRNA-seq results (e.g., using for example Iba1 for microglia and CD3, CD4, and CD8 as markers for T cells).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We isolated live cells from brain tissue for scRNAseq. While this method does not capture the actual distribution of cell types (for example neurons are underrepresented compared to snRNAseq experiments), relative comparisons between genotypes can be made. Regarding T cells, we have now performed new IHC experiments quantifying T cell abundance. These new results corroborate the single cell data by empirically showing significantly increased numbers of T cells in TauP301S mice and significantly reduced numbers in the TauP301S x TPL2KD mice (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2). Regarding IHC confirmation of the microglial changes, this is shown with IBA1 staining in Figure 4A,B. Consistent with single-cell RNAseq data, IBA1 staining was significantly increased in TauP301S mice but no statistically significant effects of TPL2 genotype were observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors may also wish to address the following points</p><p>â Microglia respond rapidly to LPS injection (see Kim et al., Immunity 2021; Savier et al., biorxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.08.04.502805). It is unclear why the authors used a 24h time point to study gene expression. Furthermore, since the authors analyzed bulk RNA-seq, many differentially expressed genes in microglia may be missed due to the low fraction of microglia in brain tissue. The manuscript would be strengthened by purifying microglia and subsequently RNA-seq. The dosing of LPS (10mg/kg) is rather high.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that different microglial genes may have different time courses of response to LPS injection. We chose 24hr time point based on previous publication showing robust microglial gene expression changes (Srinivasan et al., 2016) and astrocyte gene expression changes (Liddelow <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017; Zamanian et al., 2012) at this time point. One advantage of the bulk RNAseq is that although the sensitivity in a particular cell type is reduced, we could capture changes in multiple cell types more conveniently. As shown in Figure 3, we captured many LPS- and TPL2-dependent DEGs which are expressed by microglia or astrocytes, which provided useful insight. We selected this dose based on Srinivasan et al., 2016, although we note that LPS from different vendor/lots may have different potency, so it is hard to compare doses across studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors show in vitro that phosphorylation of ERK and p38 are increased in response to stimulation with the TLR4 agonist LPS and that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of TLP2 kinase reduced phosphorylation of both pERK p38 expression levels.

Since ERK and p38 are highly expressed in neurons in the mouse brain, we suspect that the signals were most likely dominated by p-ERK and p-p38 from neurons, masking any potential changes in microglia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â In line with previous comments regarding RNA-seq from bulk tissue of LPS-treated mice, the data would have been strengthened if the authors isolated microglia from the hippocampus and performed RNA-seq to determine differentially expressed genes.

We agree that how each IEG regulates brain inflammation state remains to be elucidated, and this is probably context dependent. Based on IHC and cytokine measurements from brain lysates (Figure 4), the sum effect of reduction in the IEG and MHCII subpopulations of activated microglia was reduced inflammation in P301SxTPL2KD mouse brain. Whether changes in microglia activation state is cell autonomous, affected by T cells or both, could be addressed in the future by cell type specific KI of TPL2KD. We have added discussion of the possible roles of TPL2 in T cells and other cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors show using MRI studies that brain volume loss is reduced in PS31 crossed with TPL2KD.

In contrast, the TauP301S model is a model of chronic neurodegeneration and we only evaluated gene expression profiles at the terminal time point where there is ongoing neurodegeneration and immune cell infiltration, so one possibility is that astrocytes may be chronically activated by stimuli other than microglia cytokines. While we did observe gene expression changes in microglia comparing P301SxTPL2KD with P301S, the TPL2-dependent changes were restricted to subpopulations of microglia so itâs also likely the other populations of activated microglia are sufficient to activate astrocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The authors point out that the reduction of iNOS is an important mechanism of reduced neurotoxicity of microglia in vitro in response to LPS.

It is possible that the signal could be detected in sorted microglia from mouse brains, which will require fresh mouse brains from an active mouse colony that we no longer have.</p></body></sub-article></article>
