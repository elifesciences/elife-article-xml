As such arousals are often short, partial, or occur locally within the brain, reliable characterization in rodent models of sleep disorders and in human patients is challenging. We found that the EEG spectral composition of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) in healthy mice shows an infraslow (~50 s) interval over which microarousals appear preferentially. NREMS could hence be vulnerable to abnormal arousals on this time scale. Chronic pain is well-known to disrupt sleep. In the spared nerve injury (SNI) mouse model of chronic neuropathic pain, we found more numerous local cortical arousals accompanied by heart rate increases in hindlimb primary somatosensory, but not in prelimbic, cortices, although sleep macroarchitecture appeared unaltered. Closed-loop mechanovibrational stimulation further revealed higher sensory arousability. Chronic pain thus preserved conventional sleep measures but resulted in elevated spontaneous and evoked arousability. We develop a novel moment-to-moment probing of NREMS vulnerability and propose that chronic pain-induced sleep complaints arise from perturbed arousability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NREMS</kwd><kwd>spared-nerve-injury</kwd><kwd>arousal</kwd><kwd>insomnia</kwd><kwd>gamma power</kwd><kwd>infraslow</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_184759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lüthi</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_179169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Decosterd</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>320030-179194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fulda</surname><given-names>Stephany</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Etat de Vaud</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lüthi</surname><given-names>Anita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuropathic pain preserves mouse sleep in architecture and characteristic spectral bands but perturbs arousability in ways reminiscent of insomnia disorders, in which hyperarousal and hyperalertness to environmental stimuli are prevalent.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Arousability is the capability to wake up from sleep in response to a sensory stimulus. Arousability is a defining behavioral attribute of healthy sleep. Arousal-like events that are brief in time (≤16 s in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franken et al., 1999</xref>]; typically 3—15 s in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2018</xref>]) and that occur without an overt sensory stimulus are also part of healthy sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Halàsz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lo et al., 2004</xref>). The sleeper is often unaware of these brief arousals, although they fragment sleep into bouts of shorter duration. When sleep is excessively fragmented, as is the case in many diverse types of sleep disorders, sleep’s restorative effects are severely compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stepanski et al., 1984</xref>) and long-term health risks increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Someren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grandner, 2020</xref>). Estimating sleep’s vulnerability based on the frequency and types of spontaneous arousals is, therefore, essential to assess the severity of a sleep disruption.</p><p>The accurate quantification of spontaneous arousals is indeed a fundamental part in the diagnosis of widespread sleep disorders such as sleep apneas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malhotra and Jordan, 2016</xref>). However, this task remains challenging in cases in which arousal origins are complex, such as in insomnias resulting from chronic pain or from psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feige et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjurstrom and Irwin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Someren, 2020</xref>). Spontaneous arousals seem to occur randomly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dvir et al., 2018</xref>), and they can manifest as ‘partial’ because only some but not all of the physiological correlates of an arousal appear (cortical activation, heart rate increases, muscle tone), as observed in both human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergmann et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Parrino et al., 2009</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Franken, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Léna et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fulda, 2011</xref>). In humans, arousals additionally occur along a continuum of heart rate changes and cortical activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sforza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azarbarzin et al., 2014</xref>), although such graduation has not been described in rodents. Arousals can occur locally in restricted areas of cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nobili et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castelnovo et al., 2018</xref>). Such variations impede advances in understanding abnormal arousability as a core component of sleep disruptions in both humans and rodent models. In patients, arousals may go undetected and leave sleep fragmentation underestimated. Supporting this possibility, patients complaining about sleep while their polysomnographic measures appear normal remain a subject of intense study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjurstrom and Irwin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lecci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Someren, 2020</xref>). In rodents, the diversity of spontaneous arousals is poorly studied, which limits the usefulness of animal models of sleep disorders.</p><p>The state of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) is commonly considered a restorative state with an overall low sensory arousability, but also a dynamic state in which various global measures of neuronal excitability and functional connectivity vary on multiple time scales. Of particular interest for arousability is the infraslow time scale that relates to intervals of tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Watson, 2018</xref>). During sleep, the infraslow time scale characterizes variations of brain excitability in epileptic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vanhatalo et al., 2004</xref>), the clustering of sleep rhythms called sleep spindles in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lázár et al., 2019</xref>), the time course of the human cyclic alternating pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parrino et al., 2012</xref>), and the dynamics of resting-state networks obtained in functional resonance imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukunaga et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiltunen et al., 2014</xref>). Infraslow fluctuations in brain excitability and connectivity could render the sleeping brain vulnerable to spontaneous disruptive events, including more frequent arousals in case of sleep disorders.</p><p>This study addresses both these aspects in mice. First, we demonstrate in healthy C57Bl/6J mice that infraslow fluctuations determine when spontaneous arousals preferentially occur. Next, we evaluate the case of neuropathic pain, a clinical condition often intractable and of high sensory discomfort in which sleep disruptions are frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjurstrom and Irwin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mathias et al., 2018</xref>). Experimental models of peripheral neuropathic pain rely on surgically crushing or lesioning peripheral nerves, such as the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaggi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challa, 2015</xref>). In spite of their limitations, these models have allowed numerous breakthrough understandings on chronic pain mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuner and Kuner, 2020</xref>) and avenues for treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Finnerup et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, sleep studies on chronic pain models are scarce and have produced variable results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Tufik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kontinen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tokunaga et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardoso-Cruz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leys et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We find that the animals with spared nerve injury (SNI) in early stages of chronic pain do sleep normally in terms of sleep macrostructure, although physiological signatures of painful sensations persist in both the waking and the sleeping brain. Using infraslow measures of NREMS vulnerability, in particular the clustering of sleep spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>), we find that sleep is disrupted in two previously undescribed ways. First, there are more frequent cortico-autonomic local arousals in pain-processing cortical areas while, polysomnographically, sleep remains continuous. Moreover, animals show a higher vulnerability to wake up from NREMS in response to fine vibrational stimuli. The essence of the sleep disturbances in this experimental chronic pain model thus lies in an abnormal arousability, in both its spontaneous and evoked forms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The 0.02 Hz-fluctuation allows to probe variations in spontaneous arousability during NREMS</title><p>We first monitored undisturbed sleep in healthy C57Bl/6J mice across the light-dark phase to evaluate the timing of brief arousals in relation to the infraslow fluctuation in sleep spindles. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yüzgeç et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lázár et al., 2019</xref>), these are evident in fluctuations in the sigma frequency range (10–15 Hz) that occur over ~50 s time intervals (~0.02 Hz) and that continue throughout NREMS bouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Undisturbed NREMS was frequently interrupted by brief arousal events that are called microarousals (MAs), defined in mouse as ≤16 s awakenings accompanied by movement activity seen in the EMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To evaluate the utility of the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation in sigma power for measures of spontaneous arousability across the entire light phase, we first tested whether MAs were phase-locked to the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation in healthy mice (n = 30 mice with 9476 MAs). The onset of MAs coincided with declining or low sigma power levels that followed a pronounced sigma power peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), which is characteristic for a fragility period in which sensory arousability is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernandez and Lüthi, 2020</xref>). A spectral band typical for NREMS, such as delta (1–4 Hz) power, showed a rapid decline preceding the MAs, consistent with EEG desynchronization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The phase values of the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation, calculated via a Hilbert transform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), showed that MA onset times clustered around a mean preferred phase of 151.6° ± 1.1°, with 180° representing the sigma power trough (Rayleigh test, p&lt;1 × 10<sup>–16</sup>). The majority of MAs (89%) were clustered between 90 and 270°, which narrows the fragility period to the low values of sigma power around the trough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>). The phase locking was also observed when time points at 4, 8, and 12 s before the onset of an MA were quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This shows that the onset of the fragility period preceded the MA. Fragility periods thus constitute moments during which MAs preferentially occur.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microarousals (MAs) are time-locked to the trough of the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation corresponding to the non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) fragility period.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative mouse hypnogram, W: wakefulness; N: NREMS; R: rapid eye movement sleep (REMS); with an NREMS bout expanded below to indicate the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation in sigma power (red) and the timing of two MAs in the EMG (black).

For this, we generated spectral profiles of all cycles of the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation that were devoid of MAs and continued into NREMS. We used the data obtained from stereotaxically guided LFP recordings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) to ensure that local arousal events in pain-related cortical areas did not escape detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>). LFP recordings reliably reported on the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation in S1HL and PrL. Consistent with its predominant expression in sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>), the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation showed a higher peak in S1HL than in PrL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The cycles of successive continuity and fragility periods were extracted (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and their spectral dynamics plotted separately for the relative contribution of power in the low-frequency delta (1–4 Hz) and the beta (16–25 Hz), low- (26–40 Hz), and high- (60–80 Hz) gamma bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–F</xref> for S1HL, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–J</xref> for PrL). Average values for the infraslow phase angles between 90 and 270°, corresponding to the fragility period enriched in MAs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and for the continuity period (from 270 to 90°), were calculated. Consistent with the selection of fragility periods continuing into NREMS, delta power remained high and even increased further during fragility periods in S1HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Prior studies showed that in rodent sensory cortices local sigma and delta power dynamics run opposite to each other during NREMS, in part because thalamic mechanisms underlying these local rhythms are shared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fernandez and Lüthi, 2020</xref>). Analysis across power bands revealed that, after SNI, mice showed alterations in relative amplitude and dynamics in S1HL, but not in PrL. In particular, delta power was lower after SNI during fragility periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, mixed-model ANOVA with factors ‘treatment’ and ’period,’ p=0.001 for the interaction). While in Sham controls there was a distinct rapid upstroke of power in this frequency band that reached a peak during the fragility periods (post-hoc t-test for delta power in fragility vs. continuity period in Sham, p=0.001), there was no such elevation detectable in delta power in SNI (post-hoc t-test in SNI, p=0.44). This difference indicates that fragility periods after SNI were destabilized compared to Sham.

To address this, we compared the AI in MA-free fragility periods with the AI in an MA that is associated with EMG increase and strong cortical activation. As expected, the AI showed an intermittent phasic peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>) in most MAs (75.2% ± 4.1%), which is explained by the strong decline in delta power (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the appearance of higher frequencies associated with MAs. Therefore, we inspected individual fragility periods continuing into NREMS (without an MA) for the presence of similar phasic increases in AI. Indeed, we noticed that a subset of these did contain an intermittent peak resembling the one found during MAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) and not evident in the mean AI in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. These events could qualify as a local cortical arousal based on phasic spectral properties reminiscent of an MA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). To further support our assumption that these AI peaks constituted arousals, we looked at heart rate increases known to accompany cortical arousals in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sforza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azarbarzin et al., 2014</xref>). The heart rate was distinctly higher during the fragility period for cycles containing an AI peak as opposed to the ones without such peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>, mixed-model ANOVA with factors ‘treatment,’ ‘period,’ and ‘peak’, p=0.007 for the ‘peak’ × ‘period’ interaction). Although they are present in both groups, these events were more frequent after SNI and followed a similar time of day dependence as the classical MAs ((<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>), t-test Sham vs. SNI, p=0.02). Moreover, their increased occurrence was specific for S1HL while absent in PrL and in the contralateral EEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of a subgroup of fragility periods continuing into NREMS, yet showing a cortical arousal is noteworthy for several reasons. First, it demonstrates that rodent NREMS shows local cortical intrusion of wake-related activity in the absence of muscular activity. Second, these local cortical arousals in SNI showed intermittent peaks in AI that were close to the ones of MAs, indicating comparable cortical desynchronization at the local level. Third, they were accompanied by heart rate increases that are sensitive hallmarks of arousal in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azarbarzin et al., 2014</xref>). Fourth, nerve injury increased the relative occurrence of fragility periods with such AI peaks specifically in the S1HL area. The systematic classification of fragility periods helped unravel these novel cortico-autonomic arousals and their similarity to MAs. Still, other arousal-like events outside fragility periods could exist.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The 0.02 Hz-fluctuation allows to anticipate elevated spontaneous arousability during NREMS</title><p>We finally examined sensory arousability 3 weeks after SNI, focusing on the somatosensory modality.

For the training, we used online-calculated 0.02 Hz-fluctuation estimates for which fragility and continuity periods were labeld using peak-and-trough detection of sigma power dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

As poor sleep further aggravates pain, and sleep disturbances impact quality of life, therapeutic approaches to target the sites of interaction between sleep and pain are of particular interest. Here, in efforts to tease apart pain-sleep associations, we focused on abnormal arousability at moments when NREMS is most vulnerable. This study progresses on the sleep-pain association in four essential ways. First, we show that brain and autonomic signatures of SNI during the day intrude in a persistent manner into sleep. Second, sleep appeared nevertheless preserved in architecture, dominant spectral band power, and homeostatic regulation. Third, a previously undescribed spontaneous arousal during NREMS, showing local cortical activation with concomitant heart rate increases, appeared more frequently after SNI. Fourth, we also demonstrate that mechanovibrational stimuli of the body triggered brief wake-ups from NREMS more easily in the SNI group of mice. In summary, an experimental model of chronic pain impacts on NREMS in terms of arousability, more specifically on the probability that NREMS transits towards diverse levels of wakefulness, either spontaneously, or with external stimuli.</p><p>Accumulating evidence indicates that infraslow time scales relate to variations in sensory arousability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yüzgeç et al., 2018</xref>). We found here that spontaneous MAs without obvious sensory input occur clustered at moments when sensory arousability is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, when mouse NREMS is vulnerable to sensory stimuli, it is also vulnerable to spontaneous arousals. Sensory arousals and MAs may have common mechanistic origins, in line with evidence that both depend on activity in wake-promoting brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Léna et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dvir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mátyás et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the result suggests that infraslow time scales determine the vulnerability of NREMS for both weak (in case of spontaneous arousals) and more intense (in case of evoked arousals) levels of wake-promoting input. The increased delta power and decreased AI in S1HL in fragility periods continuing into NREMS seem at odds with this finding because they signal momentarily increased sleep depth. These dynamics are likely a consequence of an incompatibility between sigma and delta power in sensory thalamocortical loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>) that are not, however, strong enough to override the vulnerability of NREMS identified here. Intriguingly similar dynamics are also observed for CAP, in which periodic increases in delta alone are part of the arousal pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Parrino et al., 2012</xref>). This motivates studies testing the usefulness of fragility periods as time raster in the search for diverse, even subtle, arousal-like events that could be relevant to model pathological conditions of human patients.</p><p>The major portion of this study aimed to obtain a proof of concept for this possibility. The SNI model appeared particularly appropriate because it presents a specific pain hypersensitivity that could be investigated with respect to its impact on both, abnormal spontaneous and evoked arousability, during NREMS. The availability of fragility periods as time raster guided the identification of arousals that occurred locally while NREMS continued uninterrupted and that were more pronounced and more frequent in SNI. Without the raster provided by the fragility periods, the phasic differences in AI amidst the tonically elevated high-frequency power would easily have gone undetected. To further ascertain that these detected events constituted true arousals rather than accidental spectral fluctuations, we sought for independent physiological correlates. Heart rate increases were consistently higher when calculated for fragility periods with AI peak than for the ones without AI peak. Moreover, their distribution across the resting phase was similar to the one found for MAs and they were present in both S1HL and PrL. This result supports our interpretation that we have identified here a novel cortical-autonomic arousal subject to similar time-of-day-dependent regulatory mechanisms as conventional MAs. It also concurs with human NREMS in which heart rate increases occur even for very weak cortical arousals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azarbarzin et al., 2014</xref>). Still, we cannot exclude that arousal subtypes outside the fragility periods went undetected that would require further characterization. We also remark here clearly that, aside from more frequent cortico-autonomic arousals, the SNI group of mice suffered from a tonically elevated high-frequency power in S1HL that likely underlay the more elevated sensory arousability throughout continuity and fragility periods.</p><p>We found that the cortical regions in which arousals appeared coincided with sites known to be affected by neuropathic pain. The continued presence of high-frequency activity in S1HL is reminiscent of the cortical oscillatory activity present during withdrawal from acute painful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tan et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that, after SNI, nociceptive input continues to arrive in cortex during NREMS to generate excessive excitation. Indeed, it has been suggested that the SNI model does show spontaneous ectopic electrical activity in peripheral sensory neurons as a result of nerve injury that can increase nociceptive inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wall and Devor, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Devor, 2009</xref>). NREMS is thought to protect relatively weakly from nociceptive inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Claude et al., 2015</xref>), therefore possibly allowing continued processing of spontaneous nociceptive activity that could explain the cortical spectral changes we detected. Besides peripheral nociceptive activity barrages, numerous changes within pain-processing pathways could be involved. We mention that optogenetic stimulation of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) alleviates SNI-related pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LeBlanc et al., 2017</xref>). As TRN is involved in the regulation of low-frequency power during NREMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>), the attenuated delta dynamics observed in NREMS after SNI could result also from altered activity in this nucleus. Pain induces maladaptive plasticity processes with large alteration of brain circuitry, and it is clear further cellular studies will be necessary to understand the origins of elevated arousal frequency in NREMS after SNI before pointing more selectively to one or another mechanism.</p><p>The lack of major sleep disruptions after SNI was initially unexpected but seemed in line with other studies. First, we analyzed these animals at a time point when pain from the incision and associated inflammations are largely over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guida et al., 2020</xref>), both of which have been shown to disrupt sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Landis et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Silva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leys et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the animals showed a preserved time spent in REMS, suggesting that they did not suffer from chronic mild stress-inflicted sleep disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nollet et al., 2019</xref>). However, we did find alterations in a broad range of frequencies including theta power in quiet wakefulness, as reported for other animal models of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeBlanc et al., 2014</xref>) or for humans with severe neurogenic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sarnthein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stern et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ploner et al., 2017</xref>). Other studies on experimental models of neuropathic pain also report diverse moderate effects on sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kontinen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leys et al., 2013</xref>). One study on rats 2 and 10 days after SNI suggested that brain states intermediate between NREMS and wakefulness during the resting phase exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cardoso-Cruz et al., 2011</xref>), which could in part reflect our observations. Analysis of sleep disruptions at later stages will help decide whether distinct phases of sleep disruptions mark distinct phases of pain chronicity when anxiety- and depression-related behaviors appear more strongly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guida et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Do animals with SNI suffer from disturbed sleep? Our measures of NREMS’s spectral composition point to regionally restricted but tonic imbalances in the contribution of low vs. higher frequencies. Patients with insomnia show such imbalances over widespread brain regions that include sensorimotor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lecci et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, higher power in the beta frequencies has been related to the patients remaining hypervigilant or excessively ruminating at sleep onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perlis et al., 2001</xref>), preventing the deactivation of cortical processes required for the loss of consciousness. Although insomnia also needs subjective assessments that are not possible in animals, this comparison suggests that SNI might suffer from similar experiences due to the tonically enhanced high-frequency oscillations. This interpretation is supported by the elevated wake-up rates in response to mild vibrational stimuli throughout the infraslow cycles, suggesting hyperalertness to environmental disturbance. On top of these tonic changes, there were more frequent cortico-autonomic arousals. Although these do not seem to elevate daytime sleepiness based on the mostly unchanged delta power dynamics across time of day, frequent increases in heart rate during the night could augment cardiovascular risk in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Silvani, 2019</xref>). To further analyze the animal’s conditions during daytime, tests on their cognitive abilities in memory-dependent tasks while locally manipulating sleep in the affected hindlimb area could be considered. Deficits in working and declarative memories in rodents with SNI have been documented from early periods of chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guida et al., 2020</xref>). Chemogenetic manipulation of neuronal populations proposed to be responsible for the gamma activity in chronic pain, restricted to sleep periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tan et al., 2019</xref>), seems a feasible approach to specifically suppress abnormal pain-related activity during sleep while testing performance in such tasks during wakefulness.</p><p>We provide here a guideline to identify arousals in mouse NREMS for which we see the potential to move forward both, animal models of sleep disorders, and advances in the understanding of human sleep disorders. Key for this was the recognition that infraslow electrical variations in the sleeping brain serve as an index for the vulnerability of NREMS to undergo arousal. SNI in mouse qualifies as a rodent model replicating physiological correlates of sleep disorders that are hidden behind a comparatively normal sleep architecture, which is of interest in the field of insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lecci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Someren, 2020</xref>). The location of these arousals within the primary cortical sights of pain makes it obvious that the cortical pain axis is causal to sleep disruptions. It could thus be of interest to target these sites specifically to attenuate abnormal activity and to normalize sleep. Addressing the localization and the intensity of local arousals in chronic pain patients could be a first step in the definition of disease subtypes and the severity of their sleep disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babiloni et al., 2021</xref>). Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques applied locally over sensory or motor cortices have been proposed as therapeutic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lefaucheur et al., 2020</xref>). The insights gained from this rodent model of neuropathic pain could thus refine diagnosis and management strategies in the human condition, in which more frequent awakenings are amongst the most consistent effects reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal housing and experimental groups</title><p>Mice from the C57Bl/6J line were singly housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment with a 12 hr/12 hr light-dark cycle (lights on at 9:00 am, corresponding to ZT0, Zeitgeber 0), with access to food and water ad libitum.

The experiments on sensory-evoked arousals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) were done on 16 animals (8 Sham, 8 SNI) out of which some (4 sham, 6 SNI) were used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>. All experimental procedures complied with the Swiss National Institutional Guidelines on Animal Experimentation and the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zimmermann, 1983</xref>). All experiments were approved by the Swiss Cantonal Veterinary Office Committee for Animal Experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgeries</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Spared nerve injury</title><p>The Sham and SNI surgeries were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Decosterd and Woolf, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourquin et al., 2006</xref>). Briefly, mice were kept under gas anesthesia (1–2% isofluorane, mixed with O<sub>2</sub>). The left hindlimb was shaved and the skin incised. The muscles were minimally cut until the sciatic nerve was exposed. Just below the trifurcation between common peroneal, tibial, and sural branches, the common peroneal and tibial branches were tightly ligated together with a silk 6.0 suture and transected. The Sham animals, as controls, went through the same surgery without the transection. Instead, a 3-mm-long 6.0 silk suture was placed longitudinally to the sciatic nerve. The muscle and the skin were then stitched closed and the animals were monitored via a score sheet established with the Veterinarian Authorities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Electrode implantation for polysomnographic and LFP recordings</title><p>Surgeries were performed as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>). Animals were maintained under gas anesthesia (1–2% isofluorane, mixed with O<sub>2</sub>). Small craniotomies were performed in frontal and parietal areas over the right hemisphere and two gold-plated screws (1.1 mm diameter at their base) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mang and Franken, 2012</xref>) were gently inserted to serve as EEG electrodes. Careful scratching of the skull surface with a blade strengthened the attachment of the implant by the glue, so that additional stabilization screws were no longer necessary. Two gold wires were inserted into the neck muscle to serve as EMG electrodes. In the case of LFP recordings, small craniotomies (0.2–0.3 mm) were performed to implant high-impedance tungsten LFP microelectrodes (10–12 MΩ, 75 μm shaft diameter, FHC, Bowdoin, ME) at the following stereotaxic coordinates relative to Bregma in mm, for S1HL: anteroposterior –0.7, lateral –1.8, depth from surface –0.45; for PrL: + 1.8, –0.3, –1.45. For the neutral reference for the LFP recordings, a silver wire (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) was placed in contact with the bone within a small grove drilled above the cerebellum. The electrodes were then soldered to a female connector and the whole implant was covered with glue and dental cement. The animals were allowed 5 days of recovery, while being monitored via a score sheet established with the Veterinarian Authorities, with access to paracetamol (2 mg/mL, drinking water). The paracetamol was removed when the animals were tethered to the recording cable for another 5 days of habituation prior to the recording.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Polysomnographic recording</title><p>For sleep recordings, recording cables were connected to amplifier boards that were in turn connected to a RHD USB interface board (C3100) using SPI cables (RHD recording system, Intan Technologies, Los Angeles, CA). For EEG/EMG and/or LFP electrodes, signals were recorded through homemade adapters connected to RHD2216 16-channel amplifier chips with bipolar input or RHD2132 32-channel amplifier chips with unipolar inputs and common reference, respectively. Data were acquired at 1000 Hz via a homemade Matlab recording software using the Intan Matlab toolbox. Each recording was then visually scored in 4 s epochs into wake, NREMS, REMS, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>) using a homemade Matlab scoring software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Total sleep deprivation protocol</title><p>Total SD was carried out from ZT0 to ZT6 using the gentle handling method used previously in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kopp et al., 2006</xref>), while animals remained tethered in their home cage. At ZT3, the cages were changed and, from ZT5 to ZT6, new bedding material was provided. At ZT6, the animals were left undisturbed. The recordings carried out during SD were visually scored to assure the absence of NREMS from ZT0 to ZT6. There were no detected NREMS epochs during SD in the mice included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Probing sensory arousability with vibration motors</title><p>An online detection of continuity and fragility period (described below) was used in a closed-loop manner to time vibration stimuli during NREMS such that sensory arousability could be probed. Small vibrating motors (DC 3–4.2 V Button Type Vibration Motor, diameter 11 mm, thickness 3 mm) were fixed using double-sided tape, at the end of the recording cables, close to the animals’ heads. The motors were driven using a Raspberry Pi 3B+ through a 3.3 V pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal. Each motor was calibrated to find the necessary PWM duty-cycle to output the same amount of mild vibration using a homemade vibration measurer equipped with a piezo sensor. A Python script was running on the Raspberry Pi to detect the voltage change sent by the digital-out channels on the Intan RHD USB interface board. Upon detecting a change from low to high, the Python script waited for an additional 4 s and assessed the voltage again. In case the voltage was still high, it launched a 3 s vibration with 25% probability. To close the loop, the PWM signals from the Raspberry Pi driving the motors were as well fed into the analog-in channels of the Intan RHD USB interface board to detect the stimuli time-locked to the EEG/EMG signals. In the experiments, the voltage values were set to high during either continuity or fragility using online detection as described in Data analysis. Four animals could be tested in parallel for their sensory arousability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Histological verification of recording sites</title><p>After the in vivo LFP recordings, the animals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital (80 mg/kg) and electrode positions were marked through electro-coagulation (50 µA, 8–10 s). The animals were then transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (in 0.1 M phosphate buffer). After brain extraction and post-fixation for 24 hr, 100-µm-thick coronal brain sections were cut and imaged in brightfield microscopy to verify correct electrode positioning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Scoring and basic sleep measures</title><p>Scoring was done blind to the animal treatment according to standard scoring procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>). An MA was scored whenever the EEG presented a desynchronization time matched with a burst of EMG activity lasting maximally four consecutive epochs (16 s). Latency to sleep onset was defined from ZT0 to the first appearance of six consecutive NREMS epochs (24 s). The bout size binning in short, intermediate, and long bouts for NREMS and REMS was obtained from the pulled distribution of the bout sizes from all the animals. The edges of the intermediate bin were defined as: mean – ½ standard deviation to mean + 1 standard deviation.</p><p>Spectral power in wakefulness was computed for the raw EEG signal using an FFT on scored 4 s windows after offset correction through subtraction of the mean value of each epoch. The mean power spectrum for QW and AW were normalized by dividing each frequency bin by the sum of the power from 2 to 30 Hz similar to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeBlanc et al., 2014</xref>). QW and AW periods were obtained based on the distribution of the natural logarithm of the squared EMG values per 4 s epoch per animal. QW limits were set from 10 to 25 percentile to minimize inclusion of possible periods of drowsiness. Only periods with three or more consecutive epochs (&gt;12 s) were considered. AW limits were set from 50 to 99 percentile to clearly distinguish AW from QW and avoid movement artifacts.</p><p>Spectral power for sleep was computed on the raw EEG signal using a FFT on scored 4 s windows after offset correction through subtraction of the mean value of each epoch. The median power spectrum for each state was obtained for epochs non-adjacent to state transitions. The normalization was done through dividing by the average of mean power levels (from 0.75 to 47 Hz) for each vigilance state, ensuring that each state had the same weight in the averaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vassalli and Franken, 2017</xref>). This normalization was done separately for baseline and D20+ recordings. Gamma power at D20+ was extracted through calculating mean power levels between 60 and 80 Hz. Data were normalized to corresponding baseline values.</p><p>The heart rate was extracted from the EMG signal as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the EMG signal was highpass-filtered (&gt;25 Hz) and squared. The R peaks of the heartbeats were detected using the Matlab ‘Findpeaks’ function. Only animals with clearly visible R peaks present in the EMG in NREMS were included in this analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>For delta power time course, raw delta power (mean power between 1 and 4 Hz from FFT on mean-centered epochs) was extracted for each NREMS epoch non-adjacent to a state transition. Total NREMS time was divided into periods of equal amounts of NREMS (12 in light phases, 6 in dark phases) from which mean values for delta power were computed. The position in time of these periods was not different between groups. Normalization was done via mean values between ZT9 and 12 when sleep pressure is the lowest.</p><p>Wake-up and sleep-through events after vibration were scored automatically as follows. For each trial, the EEG and EMG signals were analyzed within time intervals from 5 s prior to 5 s after the vibrations. To distinguish wake-up and sleep-through events, three values were calculated: (1) the ratio theta (5–10 Hz)/delta (1–4 Hz) for the 5 s before stimulation, (2) the difference in the low-/high-frequency ratios (1–4 Hz/100–500 Hz), before and after the stimulation, and (3) the squared EMG amplitude ratio after/before stimulation.</p><p>A trial was rejected when the ratio theta/delta was &gt;1 before stimulation or the EMG amplitude was larger before than after stimulation. In this way, trials starting in REMS or wakefulness were excluded. Wake-up events were scored when the difference in low/high ratios mentioned above decreased markedly after stimulation together with EMG activity. Occasionally, some wake-ups were also scored when EEG or EMG activity was very high while the other channel showed moderate changes. Appropriate thresholds were set upon visual inspection blinded to the animal’s condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Analyses related to the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation</title><sec id="s4-7-2-1"><title>Extraction</title><p>The 0.02 Hz-fluctuation in sigma power (10–15 Hz) was extracted from EEG or LFP signals using a wavelet transform (Morlet wavelet, four cycles), calculated over 12 hr recordings in 0.5 Hz bins. The resulting signal was down-sampled to 10 Hz and smoothed using an attenuating FIR filter (cutoff frequency 0.0125 Hz, order of 100, the low order allowing for frequencies above the cutoff). The mean of the datapoints within NREMS and MA epochs was used for normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The peak and frequency of the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation were calculated through an FFT on continuous NREMS bouts as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>). FFTs from individual bouts at frequency bins from 0 to 0.5 Hz were interpolated to 201 points before averaging across bouts to obtain a single measure per mouse. The angles of the phase of the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation were obtained through the Hilbert transform (Matlab signal processing toolbox). We set the troughs of the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation at 180°, the peaks at 0° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>In several instances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), instead of calculating FFTs in the infraslow frequency range, we needed to detect individual cycles of the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation. To do this, we applied the Matlab ‘Findpeaks’ function, with the conditions that the peak values were &gt; mean and the trough values &lt; mean, each separated by &gt;20 s. With such parameters, the sequence trough-peak-trough appears only in NREMS and allows to count individual cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2-2"><title>Band-limited power dynamics during the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation</title><p>To calculate the power dynamics in different frequency bands, Morlet wavelet transforms were down-sampled to 10 Hz to match the sampling of the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation and normalized by the sum of their means in NREMS. The mean power of each band was then binned in 18 bins of 20°, and a mean across cycles (with or without MAs) of power activity per phase bin was obtained per animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2-3"><title>Analysis of activation index</title><p>AI was computed by the natural logarithm (ln) of the ratio between beta (16–25 Hz) + low gamma (26–40 Hz) over delta power (1–4 Hz), extracted as described above. Individual cycles from peak to peak were classified whether an MA was present in the fragility period or whether it continued into NREMS. To assess the presence of peaks in activation indices, the ‘Findpeaks’ function was used at phase values of 90–270°, with mean values used as a threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2-4"><title>Online detection of continuity and fragility periods</title><p>For the online detection of fragility and continuity periods during closed-loop sensory stimulation, a homemade software was generated with two layers of decision. The first one determined the likely current state of vigilance (wake, NREMS, or REMS), whereas the second one made a machine learning-based decision between a continuity or a fragility period.</p><p>(1) Determination of vigilance state. This assessment was based on power band ratios characteristic for wake, NREMS, and REMS using appropriate thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Every second, an FFT was calculated on the mean-centered last 4 s of EEG values and the power ratio between the delta (1–4 Hz) and the theta (5–10 Hz) was calculated.</p><sec id="s4-7-2-4-1"><title>Transitions out of wake</title><p>(1) Switch to NREMS if the last 3 s of EMG were below a high threshold and at least two out of the three last seconds of ratio were above a high threshold.

(2) Switch to NREMS if the ratio was above a high threshold for at least 4 out of 5 s.</p><p>(2) Continuity and fragility detection. From the previous step, the value of sigma power (10–15 Hz) was kept every second. The mean sigma value in NREMS was dynamically updated if the likely state was determined as NREMS and used to normalize the incoming sigma power values. The last 200 s of sigma power regardless of the likely state were kept in memory. We heuristically found that a ninth-order polynomial fit (Matlab ‘polyfit’ and ‘polyval’ functions) best approximated the 0.02 Hz-fluctuation. To train the network, we first generated online-estimated 0.02 Hz-fluctuation at 1 Hz for the 12 hr of the light phase. We next applied offline cycle detection in NREMS periods. For simplicity, and in agreement with previous measures of sensory arousability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lecci et al., 2017</xref>), we set the continuity periods from trough to peak and fragility from peak to trough. Then, we subdivided these recordings in chunks of 200 s (moving window of 1 s, as they would appear online) while assigning the label continuity, fragility, or none. We could thus obtain 43,000 labeled chunks per 12 hr of recording. We used 642,000 of these chunks from 13 animals to train a neural network (pattern recognition ‘nprtool’ from Matlab Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox) 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. The network was composed of 1 hidden layer with 10 neurons and 1 output layer with the 3 different outputs. We then used the generated neural network online to take the decision between continuity, fragility, or none.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>The statistics were done using Matlab R2018a and the R statistical language version 3.6.1. The normality and homogeneity of the variances (homoscedasticity) were assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk and the Bartlett tests, respectively, to decide for parametric statistics. In the cases where normality or homoscedasticity were violated, a log transformation was considered first and, finally, non-parametric post-hoc tests were used (Wilcoxon rank-sum test for unpaired and signed-rank test for paired data). The degrees of freedom and residuals for the F values are reported according to the R output. Post-hoc analyses were done only when the interaction between factors was significant (p&lt;0.05). Bonferroni’s correction for multiple comparisons was applied routinely, and the corrected α values are given in the legends. All statistical tests, factors used in the ANOVAs, and corresponding Cohen’s effect size are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for every figure panel. The factors used in the ANOVAs are mentioned in the figures once the corresponding effects were significant. The interaction is denoted as X. The factors used in the analysis were: ‘treatment’ with two levels: Sham and SNI; ‘day’ with two repeated levels: baseline and D20+; ‘size’ with three repeated levels: small, intermediate, or long bouts; ‘period’ with two repeated levels: continuity or fragility; ‘SD’ with two repeated levels: control or recovery after sleep deprivation; ‘state’ with three repeated levels: wake, NREMS, or REMS; ‘MAs’ with two levels: with or without MA in the fragility period; ‘peak’ with two repeated levels: cycles with or without a peak in AI during fragility periods.

summary:</bold></p><p>The manuscript addresses the relationship between chronic pain and the patterns and quality of sleep in mice. The study employs high quality EEG analyses to show that although mice with neuropathic pain retain general sleep architecture, they are more easily aroused in sleep and show alterations in infraslow oscillatory activity in the brain in conjunction with behavioral abnormalities. The findings provide insights into heightened arousability during sleep in pain and bad sleep quality as a comorbidity of chronic pain.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Cortico-autonomic local arousals and heightened somatosensory arousability during NREM sleep of mice in neuropathic pain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Carl Y Saab (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the study reports interesting data on alterations in sleep in chronic pain, the functional relationship between pain and sleep is not addressed. In order to enable a significant scientific advance, behavioural data on pain in conjunction with altered sleep are necessary.</p><p>2) There are a number of concerns about the analysis of the EEG data. A significant reanalysis of EEG data is necessary and it is recommended to address all points related to analysis and interpretation of data on oscillatory activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the present manuscript, the authors study the relationship of chronic pain and sleep in mice. Specifically, they first established a mouse model of neuropathic pain and show that the general sleep architecture is fully preserved in mice. Then using mechanicovibrational stimulation, they show that these mice are easier arousable in sleep. Critically, they link this phenomenon to an infraslow (approx. 0.02 Hz, every 50s) rhythm. The findings are being interpreted as heightened arousability in pain during sleep, which might constitute a promising target for future interventions.</p><p>The paper is very well written, has great illustration and nicely guides the reader from the initial hypothesis to the main findings. It provides an interesting link between sleep physiology and pain perception. While overall very convincingly written, several conceptual and methodological questions remain:</p><p>1. Why is the increased arousability only linked to mechanical stimulation? Wouldn't one expect that neuropathic pain patients suffer more constantly and are thus, more likely to experience sub-optimal night sleep with more microarousals?</p><p>2. How can the authors claim specificity for the infraslow oscillation when no alternative frequency bands or spectral phenomena were probed? The general link to the 0.02 Hz oscillations is interesting, but for the naïve reader the step from Figure 1 to Figure 2 is hard to understand: Besides that they authors first described the 0.02 Hz oscillation in the Lecci 2017 paper, there is no direct obvious link to Figure 1.</p><p>In particular, since Figure 1 indicates no differences between groups. Hence, any other spectral metric could have been investigated. Maybe the authors could elaborate on the reasoning here.</p><p>3. How do the authors interpret the fact that the observed effects (e.g. Figure 3) are not frequency specific, but seem to be present in almost every frequency band? Overall, the presentation of the results would benefit from clearly separating physiology vs. pathophysiology-based assumptions. Right now, the manuscript is difficult to follow because both a presented in an interleaved manner and one wonders which effects are truly specific to the pain model.</p><p>4. The visualization of the coupling in Figure 5 appears very cluttered. Could the authors maybe include circular representations of the data in addition to the histogram-based ones (with phase on the x-axis)? Specifically to avoid the binary contrasts between two large (270-90{degree sign} and 90-270{degree sign}) bins that were used for statistical comparisons? Why not utilize appropriate statistics that do not require rendering the data into linear format, such as Watson-Williams or Harrison-Kanji tests when testing for coupling interactions.</p><p>This seems critical, since the authors essentially present a cross-frequency coupling analysis (0.02 Hz to power or arousal coupling), which might benefit from the guidelines formulatedby Aru et al. (2015) Current Opinion in Neurobiology</p><p>5. Interpretation of oscillatory signatures is sometimes a bit unspecific. E.g. in the introduction they authors discuss 'enriched oscillations', i.e. indexing increased spectral power – but how would they disentangle that from e.g. movement artifacts, which cover multiple frequency bands after spectral transformations, which is the defining element of microarousals?</p><p>6. Overall, the manuscript is difficult to read, because lots of different analyses are being introduced and detailed, but it is difficult to extract the main gist why the specific analysis was carried out.</p><p>7. Queries per specific Figures:</p><p>Figure 1A – Why is more time spent awake in the 'dark phase'? Shouldn't this be the other way round?</p><p>Figure 1E – How were the spectra normalized?</p><p>Figure 4F-H implies a non-frequency specific effect, why not quantify and display the true comodulation to assess the spectral extent?</p><p>Figure 6 – Isn't the presented analysis circular in nature? The authors predict labels using machine learning based on already classified stages using mutually-dependent criteria.</p><p>Figure 7 – A Visualization of when stimulation is most effective in controls would help.</p><p>8. Please report t values and effect sizes and not just p-values, specifically in the first part of the manuscript.</p><p>9. When discussing their finding 1 in the main discussing: What is the early stage of the disease and to what data are the authors referring to?</p><p>Taken together, the authors present an interesting study with multitude of results using a variety of analyses. Overall, this manuscript provides a better understanding for sleep physiology by further adding evidence for the importance of the 0.02 Hz oscillation. In addition, it provides an interesting perspective on pain and sleep. However, in its present form it is difficult to extract the main findings.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting paper well within the scope of <italic>eLife</italic>, which requires several clarifications, but is a strong candidate for publication.</p><p>10. The authors should try to clearly separate hypotheses, predictions and analyses concerning physiology vs. pathophysiology. In its present form both appear interleaved, making it very difficult to follow the manuscript and reasoning.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Rigorous investigation of potential correlation between chronic pain and sleep disorder in a mouse model of spared sciatic nerve injury (SNI). Methodology includes conventional sleep analysis using EEG, EMG and a novel arousal assay within epochs referred to as 0.02 Hz fragility-continuity during light phase NREM. No difference was reported in global sleep architecture. However, mice with SNI manifest increased cortical fragility in somatosensory hindlimb (S1) contralateral to SNI, but not in ipsilateral S1 or prelimbic cortex, compared to sham. These heart changes also correlated with increased rate. Moreover, mice with SNI were hypersensitive to spontaneous arousal, as well as arousal evoked by mechano-vibration timed to fragility periods in a closed-loop manner.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The topic of chronic pain, brain abnormality, EEG and sleep is timely.</p><p>Very well written manuscript, logical flow, clear diagrams.</p><p>Methodology is robust, uses conventional techniques and develops a new assay to investigate fragility-continuity that enabled novel findings. This novel assay is potentially useful to sleep researchers.</p><p>Conclusions are conservative and warranted by the data and the statistics.</p><p>Literature is comprehensively reviewed.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. Study reads as if it is designed to explore sleep differences in SNI mice, rather than to test a hypothesis based on a clearly defined neurophysiological mechanism. There is no mechanistic evidence (other than a speculation about sustained peripheral drive from injury site, which is more stochastic than regular).</p><p>Significant findings have considerable limitations. They apply only to NREMS, during light phase, in absence of EMG, and in S1. This raises concerns about relevance and validity, especially that one animal model was used, no evidence for pain presented (and if so what pain category or correlation with pain severity), one time point at D20+, changes are minor, and other cited studies have noted local cortical arousal in humans (Nobili 2011).</p><p>2. Link between pain and sleep is bi-directional, as stated by the authors, but pain is causal to sleep disorder, so recommendations to better understand sleep to treat pain should be reworded more carefully. Also recommendations for treatment options (e.g. TMS localized to S1) should be re-considered, especially when mechanisms are still unknown.</p><p>3. Analysis of EEG data requires more clarification. Normalization of EEG is common practice, though standards differ, along with data interpretation. Due to the inherent variability in EEG, the most accurate analysis is within-subject comparison. In this study, EEG was normalized dividing by the average mean power from 0.75-47 Hz. This could lead to bias. For e.g., if absolute EEG power in the 1-45 Hz is modulated in one group, normalization will dilute this modulation and artificially enhance power in bands outside this range.</p><p>4. Movement artifact is a common source of noise in EEG. How was this dealt with? It is recommended that an automated algorithm be used to limit subjectivity and bias.</p><p>5. Authors conclude no change in theta power in awake mice with SNI. However, cited paper by Leblanc 2014 clearly showed increased theta in awake rats after CCI (another sciatic pain model). The same group has since published 7 papers replicating these findings in multiple pain models, including one study in humans. Thalamic mechanisms for theta was presented by Leblanc, as correctly discussed by the authors (however that was Leblanc 2017, not 2014, please correct). The only explanation for the discrepancy here is the fact that Leblanc recorded theta during brief (~15 min) awake resting state with no apparent movement once per day. Analysis of EEG during the entire wake period when an animal is engaged in day-time activity (potentially distracted from pain) might dilute this effect on theta power.</p><p>6. Following the same logic, it should also be noted that the increased gamma reported by Tan 2019 refers to the CFA model of acute inflammatory pain, which is different from chronic neuropathic pain.</p><p>7. The study is largely based on the premise that mice are in chronic pain at D20+ after SNI. Typically, studies using animal models include behavioral data to verify the pain state (for e.g. sensory hypersensitivity, etc.) Whereas SNI is a widely used model, verification of model reproducibility is essential. Moreover, it appears from the literature that the predominant evidence for pain in this model is sensory hypersensitivity evoked by mechanical and thermal stimuli. Do we know if rodents (particularly mice) with SNI manifest spontaneous pain? This is important because only one model is used in this study and at only one time-point. This is also relevant when making translational claims about human pain, which is multi-dimensional (reference to model mimicking human pain should be avoided).</p><p>8. Authors cite several studies showing abnormal findings in alpha, beta and low-gamma during sleep (p4). These findings seem inconsistent with this paper. Please discuss (also make sure you're making apples-to-apples comparisons, including epoch lengths, normalization, model, etc.)</p><p>9. Figure legends too crowded with statistics.</p><p>10. Some icons in legends hard to interpret (e.g. Figure 1G).</p><p>11.

We provide here two novel datasets for this outstanding issue that helps resolve it in two complementary aspects.</p><p>i. We present behavioral responses to mechanical and thermal (heat) stimulation after SNI and sham surgeries in mice. The data are from another ongoing experiment in our laboratory, and they include measurements at times points similar to the present study. In our hands, and in the hands of many other labs, all nerve-injured animals with the well performed SNI technique develop tactile and thermal allodynia/hyperalgesia-like behavior (for review, see Guida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; doi:10.3390/ijms21093396).These data are included in the rebuttal to the concerns of Reviewer 2.</p><p>ii. We re-analyze the data from the mice included in this study regarding the presence of elevated theta and high-frequency power. Such elevations have been repeatedly linked to pain hypersensitivity in experimental models and described as an “electroencephalographic signatures of pain” by LeBlanc et al. (2017). They are found in acute and chronic experimental models and respond to analgesics. When suppressed by optogenetic manipulation of thalamic activity in mice, or via thalamic lesions in humans, pain relief has been observed (Sarnthein et al., 2006) (LeBlanc et al., 2016) (LeBlanc et al., 2017). We do find changes in the power spectrum of the SNI groups during quiet wakefulness (a state determined polysomnographically), which strongly supports the presence of neuropathic pain-like hypersensitivity in the animals used in our study. These data are included in a new Figure 2 in the main manuscript.</p><p>In conclusion, we now provide the most sensitive physiological measures of experimental chronic pain currently available. In particular, we were able to correlate it with the sleep data, as requested by the Editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There are a number of concerns about the analysis of the EEG data.

Wouldn't one expect that neuropathic pain patients suffer more constantly and are thus, more likely to experience sub-optimal night sleep with more microarousals?</p></disp-quote><p>The increased arousability is linked to both – mechanical stimulation on the skull, and a higher frequency of brief arousals that we characterize as “cortico-autonomic arousals” in the title. These are not the usual microarousals commonly described in mice. Instead, these are cortical arousals occurring locally in the cortex but that are nevertheless accompanied by heart rate increases. They take place in the hindlimb primary somatosensory cortex that is linked to the discriminative sensory component of pain processing (localization, intensity and modality).</p><p>We conclude that nerve injury, and thus neuropathic pain-like alterations, augments both, arousability to external mechanical stimulation and spontaneous arousability in precisely those brain areas that are concerned with pain processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. How can the authors claim specificity for the infraslow oscillation when no alternative frequency bands or spectral phenomena were probed? The general link to the 0.02 Hz oscillations is interesting, but for the naïve reader the step from Figure 1 to Figure 2 is hard to understand: Besides that they authors first described the 0.02 Hz oscillation in the Lecci 2017 paper, there is no direct obvious link to Figure 1.</p><p>In particular, since Figure 1 indicates no differences between groups. Hence, any other spectral metric could have been investigated. Maybe the authors could elaborate on the reasoning here.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this comment that made us realize that we have to describe more in details the reasoning for the use of the infraslow oscillation. We do this now explicitly in the rewritten Introduction (3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph), in which we review evidences that the infraslow time scale stands out in terms of identifying moments of sleep vulnerability.</p><p>Regarding the link from Figure 1 to Figure 2 that the reviewer describes as hard to understand: The figure sequence has now been changed such that the physiology of the infraslow oscillation comes first, and is then followed by studies in the experimental model of neuropathic pain (SNI).</p><p>Together, with these re-arrangements, we believe we have solved the major concerns of the reviewer: the issue of specificity, the clarity of the figure arrangement, and the reasoning for the choice of the infraslow oscillation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How do the authors interpret the fact that the observed effects (e.g. Figure 3) are not frequency specific, but seem to be present in almost every frequency band? Overall, the presentation of the results would benefit from clearly separating physiology vs. pathophysiology-based assumptions. Right now, the manuscript is difficult to follow because both a presented in an interleaved manner and one wonders which effects are truly specific to the pain model.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure which observed effects in Figure 3 the reviewer refers to. The data in this figure do not concern frequency specificity. In case the reviewer thought about Figure 4, then we remark the following: the observed effects cover precisely the frequency bands that need to change to give rise to an arousal: low-frequency bands decrease in power, while high-frequency bands increase.</p><p>We have taken up the reviewer’s excellent suggestion to better separate physiology versus pathophysiology. To do so, we position the Figure describing the phase-coupling of microarousals in healthy mice to the infraslow oscillation as the new Figure 1 (original Figure 2). We additionally modified the figure to make the infraslow oscillation more clear. Then, we introduce a new Figure 2 describing the physiological correlates of pain signature in SNI operated mice. The remaining figures are then focused on sleep pathophysiology. In this way, the separation between physiology and pathophysiology should be clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The visualization of the coupling in Figure 5 appears very cluttered. Could the authors maybe include circular representations of the data in addition to the histogram-based ones (with phase on the x-axis)? Specifically to avoid the binary contrasts between two large (270-90{degree sign} and 90-270{degree sign}) bins that were used for statistical comparisons? Why not utilize appropriate statistics that do not require rendering the data into linear format, such as Watson-Williams or Harrison-Kanji tests when testing for coupling interactions.</p><p>This seems critical, since the authors essentially present a cross-frequency coupling analysis (0.02 Hz to power or arousal coupling), which might benefit from the guidelines formulatedby Aru et al. (2015) Current Opinion in Neurobiology.</p></disp-quote><p>We have simplified the presentation of Figure 5 (now the new Figure 6) to amend the reviewers’ concern. The changes involve:</p><p>– The data of the original panels 5 H and I are now moved to the supplemental figure 2, panels A-C;</p><p>– The data from the original panel J are now shown more expanded in the new panel 6 H;</p><p>– The data from the original panels K, L are now shown expanded in the new panels 6 I, J.</p><p>Regarding the use of circular representations, we agree that this could be a worthwhile alternate way of presenting data that involve phase relationships. We are actually using this kind of representation in the lab (as recently done for the tuning of head direction units in the 360 ° space, see Vantomme et al., 2020, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107747">10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107747</ext-link>). Regarding the infraslow oscillation, we would prefer to keep a linear presentation that we have already started using some years ago (Lecci et al., 2017, doi: 10.1126/sciadv.1602026) when we first reported on the infraslow oscillation. Furthermore, we find the representation of the microarousal clustering around the trough of the oscillation (see new Figure 1) clearer as it brings the importance of the trough of the oscillation for sleep’s vulnerability to the forefront.</p><p>This representation also makes it clear that we are indeed interested in the two large bins described by the reviewer. These bins are defined by the natural clustering of microarousals. We currently have no incentive to use a finer graduation of angles as the microarousal distribution does not give us a physiological reason to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Interpretation of oscillatory signatures is sometimes a bit unspecific. E.g. in the introduction they authors discuss 'enriched oscillations', i.e. indexing increased spectral power – but how would they disentangle that from e.g. movement artifacts, which cover multiple frequency bands after spectral transformations, which is the defining element of microarousals?</p></disp-quote><p>The term “enriched oscillations” was used in the context of the description of insomnia patients. This part has been removed and the term “enriched oscillations” is no longer present.</p><p>Regarding movement artifacts.</p><p>The Intan recording system we used to obtain the data presented in this study renders movement artefacts very small. The reason is that the signals are digitized at the level of the pre-amplifier that is present on the animals head. In this way, movements that primarily arise from the movement of the cables are eliminated. Please also realized that when we study the novel cortico-autonomic arousals the EMG is completely flat (panel C of the new Figure 6). Therefore, in the analysis of these novel events, movement artefacts are not a potential source of confound. Similarly, when we analyze the spectral composition of quiet wakefulness, the EMG levels are very low (see the new Figure 2, panel C).</p><p>More generally, movement artefacts become a minor concern once recordings are obtained intracranially, as is the case for our LFP recordings. The problem is much greater in the case of surface EEG recordings, as is frequently done in humans. In our experiments, EEG signals were only used for scoring of microarousals and for the extraction of the infraslow dynamics in Figure 1. For both these analyses, movement artefacts played no role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Overall, the manuscript is difficult to read, because lots of different analyses are being introduced and detailed, but it is difficult to extract the main gist why the specific analysis was carried out.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment because it helped us realize the need of improving the clarity and structure of the manuscript. As already described, the work is now separated into sleep physiology- and abnormal sleep related to an experimental model of neuropathic pain. The transition between these parts is more explicitly described and so are the analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Queries per specific Figures:</p><p>Figure 1A – Why is more time spent awake in the 'dark phase'? Shouldn't this be the other way round?</p></disp-quote><p>Mice are nocturnal animals. Therefore, they spent most of their time awake during the dark phase (night), and most of their time asleep during the light phase (day).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1E – How were the spectra normalized?</p></disp-quote><p>We clearly describe the normalization procedure in the Methods on p.30-31 of the clean manuscript (lines 638-645). For the spectra of quiet wakefulness, we followed the procedure specified in the papers of C. Saab and colleagues, 2014, doi:10.1016/j.pain.2014.01.013 to enable direct comparisons between models (p.30, lanes 630-637).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4F-H implies a non-frequency specific effect, why not quantify and display the true comodulation to assess the spectral extent?</p></disp-quote><p>We have already explained above that we motivate our choice of analysis based on the natural physiology of how microarousals clusters around the trough of the infraslow oscillation. Our major questions were: what are the spectral changes at these moments of high sleep vulnerability? Do they coincide with power changes in frequency patterns that coincide with an arousal? Our results show that this is indeed the case: at moments of elevated sleep vulnerability, LFP data collected in the S1 hindlimb cortex show a pattern of frequency changes that indicate that an arousal takes place. An arousal is not a frequency-specific change, it consists of a decrease in low- and an increase in the power of higher frequencies. This is exactly what we see.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 – Isn't the presented analysis circular in nature? The authors predict labels using machine learning based on already classified stages using mutually-dependent criteria.</p></disp-quote><p>For this analysis, we first train the algorithm on datasets that are already scored. It is only then that the online monitoring of continuity and fragility periods is done. Thus, the presented analysis is not circular. The training was only done to enable the machine to predict the continuity and fragility periods online. No information about the MAs themselves was given during the training of the network. Moreover, the training was done on completely separate animals compared to the one used in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 – A Visualization of when stimulation is most effective in controls would help.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what the reviewer means by most effective. In this figure (new Figure 8), we clearly indicate two representative traces of wake-up and sleep-through (panel C). Moreover, using color-coded arrows, we present several NREMS bouts and indicate when stimulation resulted in a wake-up or a sleep-through.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Please report t values and effect sizes and not just p-values, specifically in the first part of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Please find now a new Supplementary Table for Statistics, arranged according to figure panel, statistical test used, group size, value of test statistics, p values and Cohen’s effect sizes. We have instead removed this info from all figure legends to simplify reading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. When discussing their finding 1 in the main discussing: What is the early stage of the disease and to what data are the authors referring to?</p></disp-quote><p>We study sleep 22-23 days after SNI surgery. In this model, pain hypersensitivity is initiated during the first 3 days after surgery, reaches a plateau a week after and is stable for weeks, even months at. Anxiety- and depressive-like behavior as well as cognitive impairment are seen during late phases. Three weeks after SNI, peripheral abnormal activity and central sensitization mechanisms responsible for pain hypersensitivity are established. On the other hand, at this time point, there is only low level of psychopathology associated with peripheral nerve injury and cognitive bias (see review of Guida et al., 2020 doi:10.3390/ijms21093396). In addition, the absence of an increased REMS in our animals (seen in Nollet et al., 2019, doi:10.1073/pnas.1816456116) also tends toward the conclusion that nerve-injury related pain is predominant during this time frame.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The authors should try to clearly separate hypotheses, predictions and analyses concerning physiology vs. pathophysiology. In its present form both appear interleaved, making it very difficult to follow the manuscript and reasoning.</p></disp-quote><p>With the above-mentioned points, we hope to have responded to these recommendations so that the paper is now easy to follow in terms of reading and reasoning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1. Study reads as if it is designed to explore sleep differences in SNI mice, rather than to test a hypothesis based on a clearly defined neurophysiological mechanism. There is no mechanistic evidence (other than a speculation about sustained peripheral drive from injury site, which is more stochastic than regular).</p><p>Significant findings have considerable limitations. They apply only to NREMS, during light phase, in absence of EMG, and in S1. This raises concerns about relevance and validity, especially that one animal model was used, no evidence for pain presented (and if so what pain category or correlation with pain severity), one time point at D20+, changes are minor, and other cited studies have noted local cortical arousal in humans (Nobili 2011).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this detailed summary that clearly lays out the revisions required to improve the strengths of the paper. We hope that with the revisions added, we have amended the major concerns. Please note in particular that we now do present evidence that mice might be suffering from pain electroencephalography evidences. We have now also expanded the analysis beyond NREMS to active and quiet wakefulness, alleviating the concern of the limited significance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Link between pain and sleep is bi-directional, as stated by the authors, but pain is causal to sleep disorder, so recommendations to better understand sleep to treat pain should be reworded more carefully. Also recommendations for treatment options (e.g. TMS localized to S1) should be re-considered, especially when mechanisms are still unknown.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we have kept the text on the implications of our findings for treatment options short and over-conclusive on the dimension of sleep intervention as a new approach for pain alleviation. We have now formulated a novel paragraph at the end of the discussion to discuss this topic – we discuss both, the implications for animal models of sleep disorders, and for diagnosis and management strategies in patients. In addition, bad sleep decreases highly the quality of life in patients suffering from neuropathic pain. A large subset of patients have an intractable form of neuropathic pain, and improving quality of life by reducing pain interferences such as sleep and mood disorders is essential for their treatment. In this line, we think that we point out early mechanisms for sleep disturbances that can be further explored to understand better their contribution to the persistence of pain and development of other related alterations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Analysis of EEG data requires more clarification. Normalization of EEG is common practice, though standards differ, along with data interpretation. Due to the inherent variability in EEG, the most accurate analysis is within-subject comparison. In this study, EEG was normalized dividing by the average mean power from 0.75-47 Hz. This could lead to bias. For e.g., if absolute EEG power in the 1-45 Hz is modulated in one group, normalization will dilute this modulation and artificially enhance power in bands outside this range.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ concerns regarding normalization. Normalization of EEG power spectra is common practice. Normalization removes the variations in absolute power values between individuals that naturally arise from the different positioning and/or impedance of recording electrodes with respect to the brain and from variations in brain size. Moreover, normalization permits to see directly how much power changes in one frequency band relative to another one. This is exactly the information that is needed to estimate chronic alterations in brain states after in SNI in mice.</p><p>What is critical is how normalization is done. In our case, we used the 0.75-47 Hz band to determine relative power changes between vigilance states. When it came to the quantification of gamma power that lies outside this band, we used only power value ratios between baseline and after SNI within individuals. Therefore, there were no artificial enhancements of power values.</p><p>For the quantification of changes in theta power in quiet wakefulness, we used normalization procedures described previously for the chronic constrictive model of neuropathic pain (CCI) model and other pain models (LeBlanc et al., 2014, doi:10.1016/j.pain.2014.01.013) in the interest of comparison (see also response to reviewer 1 and below). This consisted of normalizing the spectra by their mean power between 2-30 Hz.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Movement artifact is a common source of noise in EEG. How was this dealt with? It is recommended that an automated algorithm be used to limit subjectivity and bias.</p></disp-quote><p>We have received a similar comment from Reviewer 1. Therefore, we reply here in the same words.</p><p>The Intan recording system we used to obtain the data presented in this study renders movement artefacts very small.

However, cited paper by Leblanc 2014 clearly showed increased theta in awake rats after CCI (another sciatic pain model). The same group has since published 7 papers replicating these findings in multiple pain models, including one study in humans. Thalamic mechanisms for theta was presented by Leblanc, as correctly discussed by the authors (however that was Leblanc 2017, not 2014, please correct). The only explanation for the discrepancy here is the fact that Leblanc recorded theta during brief (~15 min) awake resting state with no apparent movement once per day. Analysis of EEG during the entire wake period when an animal is engaged in day-time activity (potentially distracted from pain) might dilute this effect on theta power.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point raised by the reviewer that we have now followed up using an analysis of quiet wakefulness. The results are now included (see figure summarized in a new Figure 2. Briefly, after SNI, mice do show an enhanced power at frequencies above ~5 Hz). When binned in frequency bands for theta (5-10 Hz), σ (10-15 Hz), β (16-25 Hz) and low (26-40 Hz) and high (60-80 Hz), we find significant increases in theta, beta and low gamma power.</p><p>We now cite adequately the LeBlanc studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Following the same logic, it should also be noted that the increased γ reported by Tan 2019 refers to the CFA model of acute inflammatory pain, which is different from chronic neuropathic pain.</p></disp-quote><p>We now appropriately cite this reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The study is largely based on the premise that mice are in chronic pain at D20+ after SNI. Typically, studies using animal models include behavioral data to verify the pain state (for e.g. sensory hypersensitivity, etc.) Whereas SNI is a widely used model, verification of model reproducibility is essential. Moreover, it appears from the literature that the predominant evidence for pain in this model is sensory hypersensitivity evoked by mechanical and thermal stimuli. Do we know if rodents (particularly mice) with SNI manifest spontaneous pain? This is important because only one model is used in this study and at only one time-point. This is also relevant when making translational claims about human pain, which is multi-dimensional (reference to model mimicking human pain should be avoided).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question and we divide our answer in several parts.</p><p>Regarding the need of behavioral data: We have intentionally refrained from testing the animals for recording stimulus-evoked pain hypersensitivity. First, we have large evidence in our lab that all operated mice develop pain-related behavior. Second, we know that behavioral testing of pain sensitivity is stressful for the animals (the tests induce nocifensive behavior only in SNI animals plus testing itself is disrupting the animal). It can likely be a cause of augmented sleep deprivation in the SNI group and would be a confounding factor in our experiments. We aimed at having only one distinct variable that is the sham or the SNI surgery</p><p>We add that, all along the years, all animals with SNI in our lab (and in the lab of many colleagues using the SNI model), display nocifensive behavior to non-nociceptive stimuli (Von Frey threshold assays with up and down method) or lower latency to heat-induced pain-like behavior. We are thus entirely confident that the mice used in the present work would have pain-hypersensitivity like behavior, an indirect sign of peripheral neuropathic pain-like behavior.</p><p>Regarding the presence of spontaneous pain. We agree that this is an indirect sign of pain, which does not correspond to spontaneous pain, but the discussion on this topic is not in the scope of our work on sleep. We can only mention that other laboratories studied the appearance of signs of spontaneous pain in this model (Langford et al., 2010, doi: 10.1038/nmeth.1455; Tappe-Theodor and Kuner, 2014, doi: 10.1111/ejn.1264). To be very clear, we have now modified the text and use appropriate phrasing to avoid any confusion between an experimental model of neuropathic pain and the presence of spontaneous pain. As stated by the reviewers’ using experimental model of nerve injury and claiming that the animal is suffering from neuropathic pain is over conclusive, and it is the limitation that all pain scientists encounter. Nonetheless, the physiological data provided in the new Figure 2 provide new indirect signs – as said by the author – a signature of pain in the mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.
