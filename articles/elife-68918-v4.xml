individualization. Here, we reveal that the linker histone H1.8 antagonizes condensins and topo II to shape mitotic chromosome organization. In vitro chromatin reconstitution experiments demonstrate that H1.8 inhibits binding of condensins and topo II to nucleosome arrays. Accordingly, H1.8 depletion in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts increased condensins and topo II levels on mitotic chromatin. Chromosome morphology and Hi-C analyses suggest that H1.8 depletion makes chromosomes thinner and longer through shortening the average loop size and reducing the DNA amount in each layer of mitotic loops. Furthermore, excess loading of condensins and topo II to chromosomes by H1.8 depletion causes hyper-chromosome individualization and dispersion. We propose that condensins and topo II are essential for chromosome individualization, but their functions are tuned by the linker histone to keep chromosomes together until anaphase.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromosome compaction</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>linker histone</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>Hi-C</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM132111</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Funabiki</surname><given-names>Hironori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HG003143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dekker</surname><given-names>Job</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CR-UK C47547/A21536</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vannini</surname><given-names>Alessandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200818/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vannini</surname><given-names>Alessandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dekker</surname><given-names>Job</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Linker histone H1.8 shapes mitotic chromosomes by tuning the number and size of condensin-dependent DNA loops and suppressing condensin and DNA topoisomerase II-dependent individualization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genomic DNA in eukaryotes is compacted by orders of magnitude over its linear length. The extent and mode of the packaging change between interphase and mitosis to support the cell cycle-dependent functions of the DNA. While loosely packed DNA allows efficient decoding of genetic information in interphase, mitotic compaction of DNA enables efficient distribution of genetic information to daughter cells. In addition, chromosome individualization during mitosis ensures that all duplicated chromosomes are independently moved by microtubules and are equally distributed to daughter cells. Despite these common functional requirements of mitotic chromosomes and evolutionary conservation of major known regulators of mitotic chromosome structures, the size and shape of chromosomes vary among species and developmental stages. For example, rod-like individual mitotic chromosomes can be readily visualized in fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, but not in budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Guacci et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Umesono et al., 1983</xref>). During early embryogenesis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, mitotic chromosome lengths become shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ladouceur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Micheli et al., 1993</xref>). The mechanistic basis of mitotic chromosome shape regulation remains largely speculative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Heald and Gibeaux, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Classical experiments on mitotic chromosomes indicated that DNA is organized into loops around a central protein scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Earnshaw and Laemmli, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Paulson and Laemmli, 1977</xref>). Two major chromosome-associated ATPases play pivotal roles in mitotic chromatid formation: DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) and the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family complex, condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Kinoshita and Hirano, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Kschonsak and Haering, 2015</xref>). Data obtained with chromosome conformation capture assays are consistent with the model that mitotic chromosomes are arranged in a series of loops organized by condensins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Naumova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Elbatsh et al., 2019</xref>). Vertebrate cells express two forms of the condensin complex, condensin I and condensin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ono et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Hirano et al., 1997</xref>). Condensin I is loaded onto chromatin exclusively during mitosis, whereas condensin II retains access to chromosomes throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Hirota et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Ono et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Walther et al., 2018</xref>). Condensin II plays a role in maintaining chromosome territories in <italic>Drosophila</italic> nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Rosin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauer et al., 2012</xref>) and drives sister chromatid decatenation by topo II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Nagasaka et al., 2016</xref>). It has been proposed that condensin II acts first in prophase to anchor large outer DNA loops, which are further branched into shorter inner DNA loops by condensin I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>). This proposal is consistent with their localization as determined by super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Walther et al., 2018</xref>). In chicken DT40 cells, condensin II drives the helical positioning of loops around a centrally located axis, thus controlling the organization of long distance interactions (6–20 Mb), whereas condensin I appears to control shorter distance interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>). This organization of the condensin I and II loops is also consistent with their roles in maintaining lateral and axial compaction, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Samejima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bakhrebah et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, in the presence of wildtype condensin I levels, condensin II depletion does not appear to change mitotic chromosome length, suggesting a reduced role for condensin II on these chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Shintomi and Hirano, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The prevailing model suggests that mitotic chromatin loops are formed by the dynamic loop extrusion activity of condensins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Riggs, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Nasmyth, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alipour and Marko, 2012</xref>), although the molecular details of the process remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Banigan and Mirny, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cutts and Vannini, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Datta et al., 2020</xref>). Single-molecule experiments using purified recombinant yeast and human condensin complexes demonstrated ATP-dependent motor activity and loop extrusion by yeast and human condensins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Terakawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kong et al., 2020</xref>). Condensin-dependent loop extrusion in a more physiological <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract system has also been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Golfier et al., 2020</xref>). In silico experiments further suggest that a minimal combination of loop extruders (like condensin) and strand passage activity (such as topo II) can generate well-resolved rod-like sister chromatids from entangled, interphase-like DNA fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Goloborodko et al., 2016a</xref>). However, it remains unclear if loop extrusion can proceed on chromatin since condensins prefer to bind nucleosome-free DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Zierhut et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Shintomi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Toselli-Mollereau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Piazza et al., 2014</xref>). Human and yeast condensin complexes are capable of loop extrusion through sparsely arranged nucleosomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Pradhan et al., 2021</xref>), but mitotic chromatin adopts a more compact fiber structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Grigoryev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Ou et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, large protein complexes such as RNA polymerases are able to limit loop extrusion by SMC protein complexes, such as bacterial condensins and eukaryotic cohesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brandão et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Krietenstein et al., 2020</xref>). Nucleosomes also restrict the diffusion of cohesin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Stigler et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the effect of higher-order chromatin fiber structure and other mitotic chromatin proteins on processive loop extrusion by condensin remains unknown.</p><p>Interphase nuclei are segmented to chromosome territories, each of which contain highly entangled sister chromatids after replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cremer and Cremer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Sundin and Varshavsky, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Farcas et al., 2011</xref>). Replicated pairs of chromatids are linked by cohesin during interphase, and cohesin removal during prophase (except at centromeres and other limited protected loci) promotes resolution of sister chromatids, together with actions of condensin II and topo II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Nagasaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gandhi et al., 2006</xref>). Different chromosomes are also largely unentangled in interphase HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Goundaroulis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Tavares-Cadete et al., 2020</xref>), and Ki-67 localization on chromosome peripheries may act as a steric and electrostatic barrier to prevent interchromosomal entanglement during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cuylen et al., 2016</xref>). However, some interchromosomal linkages were observed in metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Potapova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Marko, 2008</xref>). Although it has been shown that active transcription at rDNA results in mitotic interchromosomal links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Potapova et al., 2019</xref>), it remains unclear if mitotic chromosome compaction is coupled to resolution of these interchromosomal linkages.</p><p>One of the most abundant chromatin proteins beside core histones is the linker histone, which binds to the dyad of the nucleosome and tethers the two linker DNAs emanating from the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bednar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arimura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). In reconstitution experiments, linker histones cluster oligo-nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">White et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Li et al., 2016</xref>) and promote liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gibson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Shakya et al., 2020</xref>). In vivo, linker histones are also enriched in highly compact chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Izzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Th’ng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Parseghian et al., 2001</xref>). While core histones are evolutionarily highly conserved in eukaryotes, linker histones are much more diversified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Izzo et al., 2008</xref>). In the human and mouse genome, 11 H1 paralogs are found, among which some combination of six variants (H1.0–H1.5) is widely expressed in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hergeth and Schneider, 2015</xref>). In vertebrate oocytes and early embryos, H1.8 (also known as H1OO, H1foo, H1M, and B4) is the major linker histone variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dworkin-Rastl et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wühr et al., 2014</xref>). Immunodepletion of H1.8 from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts made mitotic chromosomes thinner and longer, causing defective chromosome segregation in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Maresca et al., 2005</xref>). However, the mechanism by which the linker histone affects large-scale chromosome length changes remains unknown.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that the linker histone H1.8 suppresses enrichment of condensins and topo II on mitotic chromosomes. In a reconstitution system with purified components, H1.8 inhibits binding of topo II and condensins to nucleosome arrays. Through a combination of chromosome morphological analysis and Hi-C, we show that H1.8 reduces chromosome length by limiting condensin I loading on chromosomes, while H1.8 limits chromosome individualization by antagonizing both condensins and topo II. This study establishes a mechanism by which the linker histone tunes the compaction and topology of mitotic chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Linker histone H1.8 limits enrichment of condensins and topo II on mitotic chromatin</title><p>Depletion of linker histone H1.8 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts makes chromosomes thinner and elongated (see Figure 3C, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Maresca et al., 2005</xref>). We asked if this phenotype may reflect the potential role of H1.8 in regulating condensins and TOP2A (the dominant topo II isoform in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Wühr et al., 2014</xref>), which are essential for mitotic chromosome compaction in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adachi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cuvier and Hirano, 2003</xref>). In silico simulation analysis suggests that increasing the number of loop extruders (such as condensin I) on DNA, beyond a minimum threshold, makes chromosomes longer and thinner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Goloborodko et al., 2016a</xref>). Reducing condensin I levels on chromatin also made chromosomes shorter experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Shintomi and Hirano, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Elbatsh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fitz-James et al., 2020</xref>). Although it has been reported that H1.8 depletion does not affect chromosomal enrichment of major chromatin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Maresca et al., 2005</xref>), we therefore attempted to quantify chromatin-bound levels of condensins and TOP2A.</p><p>To investigate whether H1.8 regulates chromatin levels of condensins and topo II, we prepared mitotic chromosomes in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts depleted of H1.8. Demembranated <italic>X. laevis</italic> sperm nuclei were added to either mock (ΔIgG) or H1.8-depleted (ΔH1) extracts from eggs arrested at meiotic metaphase II by cytostatic factor (CSF extracts; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Calcium was added to cycle the extract into interphase and induce functional nuclear formation, in which chromosomes were replicated. The corresponding depleted CSF extract was then added to generate metaphase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Shamu and Murray, 1992</xref>). To eliminate the microtubule-dependent change in chromosome morphology, which may affect quantitative analyses of chromatin proteins, spindle assembly was inhibited using nocodazole. Chromosomes were fixed and the levels of TOP2A and condensin I subunit CAP-G were measured by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Depletion of H1.8 increased the levels of both CAP-G and TOP2A on mitotic chromosomes, while adding back recombinant H1.8 rescued the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Identical results were obtained when immunofluorescence signal normalization was done by the minor groove DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 or by fluorescent dUTP that was incorporated during replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

We observed similar weak binding of condensin I to nucleosome arrays, and this binding was stimulated by ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Since this enhancement was not seen when magnesium concentration was higher than the ATP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>), we hypothesized that ATP might have enhanced condensin binding to the nucleosome arrays by chelating magnesium, which is known to induce chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Finch and Klug, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Eltsov et al., 2008</xref>).

In contrast, ATP did not stimulate condensin I binding to mononucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>), indicating that excess magnesium may limit condensin binding through compaction of the nucleosome array.</p><p>In the buffer condition where excess ATP was present over magnesium, preloading of H1.8 to the nucleosome array reduced binding of both wild-type and the ATP-binding-deficient Q-loop mutant of condensin I at physiological salt concentrations (50–150 mM NaCl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). H1.8 also suppressed binding of condensin II and its Q-loop mutant to the nucleosome array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), though, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kong et al., 2020</xref>), condensin II showed higher affinity to the nucleosome array than condensin I. We noticed that the subunit stoichiometry of condensin I and condensin II was altered in the bead fraction from that in the input. Since the condensin complexes were intact at the assay conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), we suspect that non-SMC subunits of condensins were less stable on the nucleosome array than SMC subunits, while H1.8 reduced binding of all condensin subunits to the nucleosome array. The reduced binding of condensins in the presence of H1.8 can be explained by either direct competition between H1.8 and condensins for the linker DNA or by H1.8-mediated formation of a higher-order structure of the nucleosome array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Rudnizky et al., 2021</xref>). The direct competition model can be tested by using mononucleosomes with linker DNAs instead of the nucleosome array since H1.8 binding to mononucleosomes does not promote higher-order structure or aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">White et al., 2016</xref>).

Similar to previous reports from other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Farr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Samejima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>), mitotic chromosomes prepared in extracts with reduced TOP2A activity show slightly increased chromosome length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Consistent with these observations, partial depletion of TOP2A in H1.8-depleted extracts also led to a further increase and not decrease in chromosome length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C–E</xref>), suggesting that chromosome elongation in H1.8-depleted extracts was not caused by the increased level TOP2A on chromatin. In summary, these results demonstrate that H1.8 controls mitotic chromosome lengths primarily through limiting the chromosome binding of condensin I.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>H1.8 regulates condensin I-driven mitotic loop layer organization</title><p>Experimental and simulation studies have shown that mitotic chromosome length and width are sensitive to the number of condensin I molecules on a chromosome, through affecting the loop size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Goloborodko et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Goloborodko et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fitz-James et al., 2020</xref>). Low levels of condensin I are predicted to result in fewer and larger loops, while higher levels of condensin I will lead to a larger number of smaller loops. Therefore, if linker histone H1.8 decreases chromosome length through limiting condensin I association with chromatin, we expect that the average size of mitotic condensin loops decreases upon H1.8 depletion. As an alternative way to quantitatively assess the effect of H1.8 and condensins on mitotic chromosome organization, we used the chromosome conformation capture assay Hi-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Hi-C contact probability maps were generated from replicated metaphase <italic>X. laevis</italic> sperm chromosomes 60 min after cycling back into mitosis in the presence of nocodazole.

Specifically, the first derivative (slope) of the <italic>P</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) plots can reveal both the average loop size and the amount of DNA per layer of the rod-shaped mitotic chromosome (layer size) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abramo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Average loop size can be estimated from the peak value in the derivative plot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). As the derivative plot in our data showed a peak in the 10 kb to 1 Mb range, we estimated that this peak location reflects the average loop size. Unlike mitotic chromosomes in DT40 or HeLa cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abramo et al., 2019</xref>), metaphase chromosomes from <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts had a flattened peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), possibly due to a larger variation in loop sizes. Although it is difficult to estimate the exact loop size from these plots, chromosomes from ΔH1 extracts showed a reproducible shift of the peak towards smaller genomic distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This is consistent with a decrease in loop size due to increased condensin I accumulation on chromatin upon H1.8 depletion. Derivative plots generated from Hi-C maps of dispersed chromosomes in diluted extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) showed a similar shift in the peak towards smaller genomic distances upon H1.8 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The derivative plots from these dispersed chromosomes showed a better-defined peak, allowing a coarse loop size estimate of ~140 kb in control (ΔIgG) extracts and ~110 kb in ΔH1 extracts using the previously reported derivative peak heuristic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>). These coarse loop size estimates are comparable to the estimated size of condensin I-driven loops in DT40 and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Naumova et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>P</italic>(<italic>s</italic>) plots for mitotic chromosomes display three regimes that are typical for relatively stiff rod-shaped conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Naumova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>): for small genomic distance, the contact probability is dominated by interactions between pairs of loci located within loops (up to 100–200 kb). For loci separated by up to a few megabases, the contact probability decays slowly with genomic distance. These interactions mostly reflect contacts between loci located in different loops that are relatively closely packed as a radial layer of loops around the central axis (intralayer regime). The third regime is characterized by a steep decay in contact probability at several megabases. This represents pairs of loci separated by a relatively large distance along the axis of the rod-shaped chromosome so that they very rarely interact (interlayer regime). The size of these layers can be obtained from the derivative of <italic>P</italic>(<italic>s</italic>), where the steep drop in contact probability curve is marked by sharp drop in the derivative value. For control chromosomes, the average amount of DNA in each layer of loops (layer size) was approximately 5 Mb, given the steep decay in contact probability observed for loci separated by more than 5 Mb for both replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). For H1.8-depleted chromosomes, we observed a smaller layer size of around 3.5 Mb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). This 1.5-fold reduction of DNA content of each layer would explain the observed 1.5-fold increase in chromosome length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Further, we can derive the number of loops per layer by dividing the layer size by the loop size in the corresponding condition. In both control (ΔIgG) and H1.8-depleted extracts (ΔH1), the number of loops per layer was ~40. This indicates that the change in the layer size upon H1.8 depletion is a result of decreased loop size, while the number of loops per layer is not affected.</p><p>The layer size in H1.8/condensin I co-depleted extracts (ΔH1ΔCAP-G) was larger than those in control extracts (ΔIgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Further supporting the idea that the layer size anticorrelates with the chromosome length, chromosomes in ΔH1ΔCAP-G extracts were indeed shorter than those in control ∆IgG extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and F</xref>). Condensin II co-depletion (ΔH1ΔCAP-D3) did not affect the layer size (3.5 Mb) and also the chromosome length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). Condensin II depletion alone (ΔCAP-D3) also did not affect the layer size, consistent with the observed lack of change in the chromosome length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that H1.8 limits the condensin I level on chromatin and shortens chromosome lengths, allowing each condensin I to form a longer loop, and consequentially tuning the amount of DNA present in each layer. The data also suggest that unlike in chicken DT 40 cells condensin I and not condensin II plays the dominant role in the organization of loop layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Since condensin I binding to DNA is also limited by nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Zierhut et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Shintomi et al., 2017</xref>), we expected that loss of nucleosomes would similarly reduce the loop and layer sizes. To test this, we depleted H3-H4 tetramers using an antibody to acetylated lysine 12 of histone H4 (H4K12ac; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib156">Zierhut et al., 2014</xref>) and generated metaphase chromosomes for Hi-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Since <italic>X. laevis</italic> sperm contains preloaded paternal H3-H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Shechter et al., 2009</xref>), the number of nucleosomes in our metaphase chromosomes was expected to be reduced by at most 50%. As nucleosomes occupy a large majority of the genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chereji et al., 2019</xref>), even a partial histone depletion (ΔH3-H4) increased chromatin-bound condensin I beyond that of H1.8 depletion (ΔH1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Consequentially, the layer size in ∆H3-H4 extracts became much smaller (around 500 kb) than in ∆H1 extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Assuming that the number of loops per layer is similar in these chromosomes (~40), the loop size estimate is 12 kb, which is much shorter than in H1.8 depletion. Altogether these results suggest that global occupancy of nucleosomes and linker histones can affect DNA loop size and chromosome through controlling the number of condensin molecules on the chromatin fiber.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>H1.8 suppresses condensin-driven mitotic chromosome individualization</title><p>Condensins and topo II act in concert to generate mitotic chromosomes from decondensed interphase nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cuvier and Hirano, 2003</xref>).

The first was to measure the three-dimensional surface area of metaphase chromosome clusters. In the presence of the microtubule depolymerizing drug nocodazole, metaphase chromosomes derived from each nucleus clustered to form tight ball-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This clustering can be quantified by the large reduction in the surface area of metaphase chromosome clusters over control nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This clustering suggests that, in control extracts, chromosomes are predisposed to accumulate interchromosomal contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To verify if these interchromosomal contacts are topological in nature, we physically dispersed the clustered chromosomes by extract dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Funabiki and Murray, 2000</xref>). Since this dilution procedure involves mechanical dispersal by hydrodynamic forces, we expect that chromosomes would remain clustered after dilution only in the presence of strong unresolved interchromosomal contacts. Indeed, when ICRF-193, the drug that inhibits topo II-dependent catenation/decatenation without leaving double-strand DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Tanabe et al., 1991</xref>), was added to egg extracts at the mitotic entry, chromosome individualization was completely blocked, forming large chromosome clusters after extract dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>, ICRF-50 min). Even when ICRF-193 was added to metaphase egg extracts after completion of metaphase chromatid formation, but 2 min before extract dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, bottom), efficiency of chromosome individualization decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, ICRF-2 min). These results suggest that substantial interchromosomal topological catenations remain unresolved in metaphase and that these can be resolved by TOP2A during mechanical dispersion (via spindle or dilution). To quantify the clustering of unresolved chromosomes, we stained the coverslips for CENP-A, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant, which marks a centromere locus per chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Edwards and Murray, 2005</xref>). While each fully individualized chromosome showed one CENP-A focus (CENP-A doublet, representing centromeres of a paired sister chromatids, is counted as one focus), multiple CENP-A foci were observed in a cluster of chromosomes. Since even fully individualized chromosomes stochastically interacted during chromosome dispersion, we redefined the chromosome cluster here for the chromosome mass containing four or more CENP-A foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Although chromosomes from each nucleus tightly compact into a ball-like mass in nocodazole treated metaphase extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), they individualized normally by dispersion upon extract dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This suggests that the interchromosomal contacts accumulated in the absence of spindles can be resolved by mechanical dispersion. TOP2A inhibition by treatment with ICRF-193 however almost completely blocked chromosome individualization in nocodazole-treated extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>), confirming the accumulation of interchromosomal catenations in clustered chromosomes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Substantial interchromosomal links remain in metaphase chromosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the dispersal protocol and the different stages for the two chromosome individualization measurements.

If so, H1.8 depletion may reduce the minimum required level of condensin activities to support chromosome individualization. In metaphase mock-depleted (ΔIgG) and H1.8-depleted (∆H1) extracts with replicated chromosomes, the extract dilution procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) resulted mostly in physically separated single chromosomes but also a small number of clumped chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

This apparent bypass of condensin I requirement in chromosome individualization required condensin II as chromosome individualization failed in the triple-depleted extracts (ΔH1ΔCAP-G∆CAP-D3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). The increased condensin II in ΔH1ΔCAP-G extracts may replace the function of condensin I by condensin II in the absence of H1.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

To assess the consequence of these reduced interchromosomal links, we measured the chromosome clustering in nocodazole-treated extracts. As shown earlier, chromosomes of each nucleus in nocodazole-treated control extracts cluster into tight balls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). In contrast, individual chromosomes were more readily distinguished by DNA staining and spread to larger area in ΔH1 extracts, suggesting that the H1.8-mediated suppression of chromosome individualization is responsible for the chromosome clustering when spindle assembly is compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). Although condensin I depletion (ΔCAP-G) led to failed chromosome individualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>), these chromosomes do not show increased clustering over those seen in control (ΔIgG) extracts. This is consistent with the notion that chromosomes may already be maximally clustered in control extracts. However, H1.8 condensin I co-depleted extracts (ΔH1ΔCAP-G) showed reduced clustering compared to ∆IgG extracts, despite the shorter average chromosome length in ∆H1∆CAP-G extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>), suggesting that chromosome spreading upon H1.8 depletion is not primarily driven by chromosome elongation but by chromosome hyper-individualization. Since TOP2A is enriched on chromosomes upon H1.8 depletion in a condensin-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we then asked if this increased TOP2A plays a role in this increased chromosome spreading. Partial TOP2A depletion had no effect on clustering in control (ΔIgG) extracts since these chromosomes were already tightly packed together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>–25% TOP2A). TOP2A depletion in H1.8-depleted extracts also did not reduce the chromosome spreading even though TOP2A levels on these chromosomes became comparable to that of the control (ΔIgG-100%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>), perhaps because increased condensin loading can compensate for reduced TOP2A activity. However, partial TOP2A depletion reduced chromosome spreading in H1.8/condensin I co-depleted (ΔH1ΔCAP-G) extracts, suggesting that suppression of both condensin I and topo II by H1.8 keeps egg extract chromosomes together during mitosis even in the absence of spindle microtubules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been thought that the linker histone H1 promotes local chromatin compaction through stabilizing linker DNA and facilitating nucleosome-nucleosome interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">White et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Li et al., 2016</xref>).

Now we showed that the linker histone H1.8 limits binding of condensin I and II to chromatin both in vitro and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts. H1.8 suppressed condensin binding on both mononucleosomes and nucleosome arrays, suggesting that H1.8 is able to compete out condensins for the same linker DNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Rudnizky et al., 2021</xref>), though the capacity of linker histones to promote higher-order structures or phase separation may also limit the access of condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Song et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gibson et al., 2019</xref>). Since condensin I subunits are most abundant chromatin proteins whose levels were enhanced by H1.8 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>), and chromosome lengths can be dictated by the amount of condensins in a manner independently of H1.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), we propose that regulating linker histone stoichiometry could serve as a rheostat to control chromosome length through tuning the condensin level on chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although such a linker histone-mediated chromosome length shortening seems odd in the large oocyte cells, mitotic chromosome length is constrained not only by the cell size but also by the spindle size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Schubert and Oud, 1997</xref>). As spindle size in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos does not scale with the cell size during the early divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib147">Wühr et al., 2008</xref>), lack of chromosome clearance from the spindle midzone due to elongated anaphase chromosomes may result in chromosome breakage by the cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Maresca et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Janssen et al., 2011</xref>). By keeping the spindle and chromosome length short, variations in duration for chromosome segregation would be reduced to better synchronize cell division. Since the larger cell size correlates with reduced mitotic checkpoint strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Galli and Morgan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Minshull et al., 1994</xref>), limiting chromosome length might be important for their timely and synchronous segregation during the rapid early embryonic cell divisions.</p><p>Since the average loop size is an aggregate result of loop extrusion rate, processivity, and number of loop extruders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Goloborodko et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alipour and Marko, 2012</xref>), it is unclear from our data whether H1.8 affects the loop extrusion kinetics of a single condensin molecule. However, our observation is consistent with the in silico simulation showing that increasing the number of loop extruders makes chromosomes thinner and longer by reducing average loop size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Goloborodko et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Goloborodko et al., 2016b</xref>). Similar DNA loop shortening accompanied with increased condensin I loading was also reported on integrated fission yeast genome DNA segments in mouse and human chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fitz-James et al., 2020</xref>). Reduced condensin loading due to mutations in condensin I or expression of phosphomimetic H3 mutants in human cells also led to reduced chromosome length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Elbatsh et al., 2019</xref>). Condensin binding is similarly suppressed by nucleosomes, but loop extrusion proceeds unhindered through sparsely distributed nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Kong et al., 2020</xref>). Since the length of chromosomes with similar condensin I levels is unaffected by the presence of H1.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>), H1.8 may increase the loop size by simply reducing the number of condensin molecules on chromatin but may not necessarily inhibit the loop extrusion rate or processivity.</p><p>The regulatory mechanisms of TOP2A recruitment to mitotic chromatin are less clear than those of condensins. Similar to condensin, both TOP2A and TOP2B preferentially localize at active and highly transcribed chromatin, indicating a possible preference for nucleosome-free regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Canela et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Thakurela et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). We observe that TOP2A levels on chromatin increase upon linker histone depletion in egg extracts and that linker histone inhibits TOP2A binding to nucleosome arrays in vitro. The preference of topo II for binding linker DNA may also explain the observation of well-spaced TOP2B binding peaks around the well-spaced nucleosomes around the CTCF- binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Canela et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Canela et al., 2019</xref>). A recent report has also demonstrated the competition between TOP2A and H1.8 in the absence of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Shintomi and Hirano, 2021</xref>). Unlike condensin I depletion, TOP2A depletion did not rescue chromosome elongation phenotype of H1.8 depletion. Rather, depletion of topo II leads to elongated chromosomes in vertebrate somatic cell lines and in early embryos of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Farr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Samejima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ladouceur et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>) and also in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data support the proposed structural role for TOP2A in axial compaction of mitotic chromosomes through its C-terminal chromatin-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Shintomi and Hirano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Lane et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our data also suggest that condensins and topo II combine to resolve extensive and persistent interchromosomal topological entanglement during mitotic compaction in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but these activities are counterbalanced by H1.8. In HeLa cells, somatic variants of H1 are phosphorylated and evicted along the inter-chromatid axis. This partial H1 eviction in prophase seems to be required for complete decatenation along the chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Krishnan et al., 2017</xref>). This suggests that local enrichment of condensins (particularly condensin II) upon H1 eviction may play a role in sister chromatid decatenation. In contrast, H1.8 binding to nucleosomes is enhanced upon transition from interphase to M phase in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arimura et al., 2020</xref>). It might be counterintuitive that condensins and topo II are actively antagonized during mitosis by H1.8 to suppress chromosome individualization, which is a prerequisite for chromosome segregation. Since spindle assembly in oocytes relies on chromatin-induced microtubule nucleation (Heald et al., 1996), keeping chromosomes at metaphase plate might be important for maintaining robust bipolar spindle. As we showed that H1.8 is important for chromosome clustering when spindle assembly is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), this microtubule-independent chromosome clustering may be particularly important for the large oocyte and early embryonic cells since it would be difficult to assemble a bipolar spindle onto all the chromosomes once they disperse into the large space of the cytoplasm. Clustering chromosomes through incomplete individualization may also avoid generation of chromosomes that do not associate with the spindle. Such a mechanism would facilitate effective kinetochore attachment during early embryonic cell divisions when the spindle checkpoint cannot be activated by unattached chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Mara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gerhart et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hara et al., 1980</xref>). Indeed, it was recently shown that paternal and maternal chromosomes cluster at the interface of two pronuclei prior to the first zygotic mitosis after fertilization to facilitate rapid and efficient kinetochore microtubule attachment in human and bovine embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cavazza et al., 2021</xref>). Another possible reason for the suppressed individualization is related to the fact that oocyte chromosomes completely lose cohesion from arms at the end of meiosis I, while maintaining sister chromatid cohesion only at the centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Lister et al., 2010</xref>). Normally, this centromeric cohesion is critical for supporting the kinetochore tension to establish bipolar attachment. During long natural arrest at meiotic metaphase II, these centromeres undergo cohesion fatigue, where centromeres prematurely separate. However, proper segregation may still be accomplished due to apparent inter-chromatids DNA linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Gruhn et al., 2019</xref>). Resolution of these DNA linkages may be prevented by H1.8-mediated suppression of condensin and TOP2A. However, our data do not eliminate the possibility that H1.8 plays a condensin and TOP2A-independent role in regulating chromosome individualization. Regulation of Ki-67, which coats the surface of chromosomes, may be a good candidate of H1-mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">White et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gibson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cuylen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Linker histones are a dynamic component of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Misteli et al., 2000</xref>). Linker histone occupancy varies widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Woodcock et al., 2006</xref>) and can be controlled by both the linker histone variant and their post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Th’ng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Christophorou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hergeth and Schneider, 2015</xref>). We expect that changing the H1 stoichiometry on chromatin by changing the amount, subtype, and/or affinity (e.g., through post-translational modifications) of H1 affects the length and individualization of chromosomes through regulating the levels of condensins and topo II. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, somatic histone H1 fails to rescue chromosome elongation phenotype of H1.8 depletion since highly abundant importin β sequesters the somatic H1 and suppresses its binding to mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Freedman and Heald, 2010</xref>). It has been shown that the sperm male pronucleus dynamically interacts with microtubules during its dramatic nuclear reorganization upon exposure to the egg cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib151">Xue et al., 2013</xref>), during which H1.8 suppresses chromosome fragmentation mediated by microtubule-dependent force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is possible that H1.8 is tuned to provide chromatin with physical strength of bulk chromatin rather than facilitating chromosome individualization during the unique fertilization process. Linker histones also serve important interphase roles through regulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Izzo et al., 2008</xref>), and the epigenetic landscape of the chromatin determines the linker histone variant on chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Th’ng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Parseghian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Izzo et al., 2013</xref>). Since H1.8 competitively inhibits condensin binding in mitosis, it is tempting to speculate that linker histones also inhibit condensin II and cohesin binding in interphase. We suggest that local and global regulation of chromatin structure and function can be regulated by controlling differential expression of linker histone H1 variants and their modifications not just through promoting inter-nucleosomal interactions but also by controlling accessibility of SMC proteins and topo II.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This paper takes advantage of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg cell free system, combining classical immunofluorescence assays with chromosome conformation (Hi-C) analyses to elucidate the contribution of linker histone H1 to mitotic chromosome organization. The authors find that linker histone H1.8 limits the association of condensin and topoisomerase II to control both chromosome length and individualization. These effects of histone HI on larger scale chromosome organisation may be important for clustering chromosomes for segregation in cells with a large cytoplasm, such as oocytes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Linker histone H1.8 inhibits chromatin-binding of condensins and DNA topoisomerase II to tune chromosome length and individualization&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Adèle L Marston as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors conclude from their study that Condensins and topo II &quot;functionalities are antagonized by H1.8 to tune chromosome length and prevent hyper-individualization&quot;. This interpretation comes from the removal of histone H1.8 from extracts/chromatin and the authors suggest that this is due to a direct competition of H1.8 with Condensins and topo II. However, they show in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 that the abundance of several chromatin proteins is also increased when depleting histone H1.8. Since one of those proteins is histone H1.3, it is unclear how the author can directly ascribe the increased binding of topo II and Condensins on chromosome to the removal of H1.8. Could it not be that removal of H1.8 leads to enrichment of H1.3 and that the latter histone has topo II/Condensin-loading properties on chromosomes? In fact, any of the proteins whose abundance increases due to the loss of H1.8 could act as a topo II/Condensin-loader on chromosomes, which would also explain the authors observations.</p><p>2) The purified Condensin complexes used in the DNA/nucleosome binding experiments have major issues with its subunit stoichiometry. Inspection of band patterns in the Condensin input gels reveals that the purified preparations used in this study fluctuate between nearly stoichiometric (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B), to partly stoichiometric (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A) to severely unbalanced (Figure 2A,B; Figure 2—figure supplement 2C). In all cases, the 8S (CAP-E/C) subcomplex of Condensin is overrepresented relative to the 11S subcomplex (CAP-G/H/D2). This indicates enzyme subunit dissociation during purification. This subunit imbalance is even more dramatic when comparing the DNA-bound (bead) fraction to the inputs in these experiments. The bead fraction is typically pulling down ~10-fold more CAP-E/C than other subunits. This indicate that the DNA/nucleosome binding behavior attributed to the Condensin &quot;complex&quot; is in fact reflective of only the SMC subcomplex (CAP-E/C without CAP-G/H/D2). As a consequence, most or all the DNA/nucleosome array binding experiments need to be repeated with genuine/ stoichiometric Condensin complexes to provide valid conclusions on the DNA binding behavior of this enzyme.</p><p>3) Regarding chromosome individualization, the authors show that the percentage of &quot;individualized chromosomes&quot; is the same in mock and H1 depleted extracts (after dilution of the chromosome preparation before fixation). However, the dispersion of the chromosomes (processed for immunofluorescence without dilution) is clearly higher in the latter. What is driving the clustering? Interchromosomal entanglements? If so, shouldn´t the entanglements prevent chromosome individualization upon dilution?</p><p>4) Related to point (3), the link between H1, condensin, Top2A and chromosome individualization is not clear. In Figure 6, chromosome individualization is measured by the separation of CENP-A foci, while in Figure 7, the authors examine surface area. These measurements may underlie quite distinct phenomena and so it is unclear what the different measurements in each of the conditions refer to. The authors need to clarify what these differences mean.</p><p>5) On the same line, the authors write at the beginning of Discussion: &quot;H1 (…) can also suppress chromosome dispersion that is driven by condensins and topo II that organize the long-range DNA folding&quot;. Two issues here:</p><p>a) It is not clear which results in the paper actually connect long range DNA folding with the dispersion phenotype.</p><p>b) The role of topoII in long range DNA folding is not tested in the paper.</p><p>Maybe the contribution of topoII to chromosome length could be tested using the same scheme as in Figure 6G-H and the protocol for observing individualized chromosomes (dilution before fixation)</p><p>6) A previous study showed that depletion of condensin I results in complete loss of individualization of replicated chromosomes in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (Shintomi and Hirano, Genes Dev 2011), whereas in the current study the authors see only a partial effect (Figure 5C). Could this mean that depletion is not complete (western bloting in Figure 5A suggests this might be the case)? Incomplete depletion would complicate the interpretation of the rescue experiment. Does the amount of protein in the extract and relate this to the extent of chromosomal condensation observed? The authors need to explain this discrepancy with previously published work.</p><p>7) The authors propose that one of histone H1.8 role is to reduce chromosome length (a function achieved by antagonizing topo II/Condensin loading on chromosome). However, histone H1.8 is an embryonic linker histone and cells in early embryos are typically large and less dependent on chromosome size-reduction mechanisms. One would assume that chromosome size should be maximally reduced in small somatic cells and, consequently, shortening of chromosomes should be promoted by somatic linker histone H1 subtypes. In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, histone H1.8 accumulates during oogenesis, persists until the mid-blastula transition, and is then replaced by somatic H1 subtypes. It seems like H1.8 disappears when its putative chromosome shortening function is most needed. The authors did not explain how their results are consistent with this biological context.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Is there a threshold amount of condensin I that needs to be associated with chromosomes for &quot;normal&quot; length. Can the authors partially deplete histone H1 and see a correlation between the amount of condensin and chromosome length?</p><p>2. Related to 2. If chromosome individualization is affected in H1 depletion, the authors should be able to observe inter-chromosomal interactions in their Hi-C dataset. Can this be quantified for the different conditions?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very nice study from a laboratory that has contributed several important papers to the field of mitosis over the years. Experiments were well designed and carefully performed for the most part (with the exception of DNA/nucleosome binding experiments with purified Condensins). The flow of experiments in this manuscript is logical. Overall, I would say this manuscript addresses an important biological question, and this topic has obvious implications for development and genome stability. The manuscript would however benefit from toning down several overinterpretations and would also be improved by providing a more compelling rationale to justify a role for an early embryonic histone in the reduction of chromosome length.</p><p>1 – All experiments presented in this study should be performed a minimum of 3 times as this represents a basic requirement for reproducibility in biomedical research. This includes all Hi-C experiments (two replicates are reported) and some nucleosome-binding experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><p>2 – There is a missing reference in the following sentence on page 4: Since Condensins prefer to bind nucleosome-free DNA (Kong et al. 2020; Zierhut et al., 2014; Shintomi et al., 2017; Toselli‐Mollereau et al., 2016). This observation was originally made by Piazza et al., 2014, Nat Struct Mol Biol.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It could be very useful to present a table in the Discussion with a summary of:</p><p>1 – the relative amounts of condensins I and II and topo II on DNA , taken from figures 5D, 5E, and Figure 6_supplement1 C.</p><p>2 –the phenotype observed in terms of chromosome length, chromosome individualization, and clustering, under the different conditions tested (control, δ H1, deltaH1deltaG, deltaH1deltaD3 and deltaH1deltaGdeltaD3).</p><p>This would help understand the co-dependencies in recruitment of the factors under study and the correlation between the different phenotypes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Linker histone H1.8 inhibits chromatin-binding of condensins and DNA topoisomerase II to tune chromosome length and individualization&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Adèle L Marston as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>You will see below that Reviewer #2 has two outstanding issues. Please address these as follows:</p><p>1. Please add a sentence to the Results section for the condensin binding assays to qualify that SMC subunits may be retained on the chromatin beads more efficiently than the other condensin subunits. You may also want to speculate why this is the case, as in your rebuttal letter.</p><p>2. While three repetitions of every experiment are not insisted on, it is important that the statistical analysis used is appropriate and clearly reported throughout the manuscript. In a number of places in the manuscript, t tests appear to have been carried out where n=2. If/where this is the case, please reanalyse the data using the appropriate statistical test and state this clearly in the figure legend. Where key experiments fail to show significance using these criteria, an additional repeat may be appropriate. For example, the legend of Figure 2 states &quot;The statistical significance of the changes in each immunofluorescence experiment was assessed by a Mann Whitney U-test and the p-values shown in D, E and G are calculated by an unpaired Student's t-test of the aggregate medians (immunofluorescence) or blot intensities of each single experiment.&quot; A t-test would not be appropriate for Figure 2D where it appears that two immunofluorescence experiments are presented, if this is indeed what is shown. Please also refer to the comment by reviewer #2.</p><p>In addition, please note suggestions for textual changes from Reviewer #1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed all of the essential revisions. In addition they have provided convincing responses to all reviewers comments. There are a few places where the text could be clarified:</p><p>Line 185. Please explain the Q loop mutant</p><p>Line 195 &quot;Although SMC2 and SMC4 appeared to be better retained on nucleosome beads than the non-SMC subunits&quot;</p><p>Line 318 &quot;This is consistent with the shorter chromosomes in DH1DCAP-G1 extracts as compared to control…&quot;</p><p>Line 362: Please explain ICRF-193.</p><p>Line 368: Suggest: To quantify the clustering, we stained the coverslips for CENP-A and used the CENP-A foci (CENP-A doublet is counted as one focus) to measure the number of chromosomes in each chromosome mass. The fraction of chromosomes was measured in small clusters (&lt;4 CENP-A foci, since a few chromosomes can colocalizae stochastically).</p><p>Line 383 &quot;better&quot; can be deleted here since the assay has already been introduced.</p><p>Line 421 &quot;showed reduced clustering compared to..&quot;</p><p>Line 427 Suggest replacing &quot;background&quot; with &quot;extracts&quot;</p><p>Line 428 &quot;TOP2A depletion in H1.8 depleted extracts also did not reduce the chromosome spreading even though TOP2A levels on these chromosomes became comparable to that of the control&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript has been improved by the authors but two issues raised in previous reviews have not been addressed in the latest version of the manuscript.</p><p>1 – Condensin stoichiometry: Experiments shown in Figure 2 and associated supplemental figures use Condensin complexes with non-stoichiometric subunit composition. The authors recognize this fact in their rebuttal letter, stating that the &quot;stoichiometry of condensin subunits seems to be changed in DNA-bound fraction in DNA-beads pull-down experiments…&quot; The issue is not convincingly resolved by the mass photometry experiment shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 because this experiment does not fully recapitulate conditions of the DNA binding reactions.</p><p>The authors suggest problems with stoichiometry are not relevant because Condensin complexes used in their experiments were &quot;purified as reported previously (Kong et al., 2020)&quot; and &quot;are similar to those seen in previous reports in both recombinant yeast condensin and immunoprecipitated <italic>Xenopus</italic> and human condensins (Kong et al., 2020; Ganji et al., 2018; Kimura, Cuvier, and Hirano 2001; Kimura and Hirano 1997).&quot; Examination of Condensin purification gels from Kong et al., shows that the complexes purified by these authors are actually stoichiometric (see Figure 1D in PMID 32445620). The same conclusion can be reached for the yeast complexes purified by the Häring group (see Figure 1C in PMID 28882993). The other two studies cited by the authors (Kimura, Cuvier, and Hirano 2001; Kimura and Hirano 1997) use silver staining to label Condensin subunits, a staining method that most biochemists recognize as non-linear and inappropriate to compare the abundance of different proteins. The contention that subunit imbalances seen in the Condensin complexes used by Choppakatla and colleagues are normal and/or reflect imbalances seen in other purified Condensin complexes cannot be verified in the published literature.</p><p>The DNA/nucleosome binding behavior attributed to Condensin is this study is likely reflective of the SMC subcomplex (CAP-E/C without CAP-G/H/D2), not the genuine Condensin 1 enzyme. As a consequence, most or all the DNA/nucleosome array binding experiments need to be repeated with stoichiometric Condensin complexes to provide valid conclusions on the DNA binding behavior of the entire/native enzyme.</p><p>2 – Several experiments presented in the revised manuscript have been performed as duplicates, and on one occasion (Figure 3E-F) the results presented come from a single experiment. This reviewer argued previously that all experiments in this study should be performed a minimum of 3 independent times. The authors stated in their rebuttal letter that they &quot;do not see that the level of confidence significantly increases by enforcing every experiment to be done 3 times, statistically speaking.&quot; I disagree with this statement. There is ample evidence to show that statistical analyses are less reliable with sample sizes of 2. Many textbooks /reference papers in statistics support this view and, as an example, I would refer the authors to &quot;A biologist's guide to statistical thinking and analysis.&quot; The authors are correct, though, in their statement that <italic>eLife</italic> has no explicit publication policy on the minimal number of independent replicates required for publication.</p><p>The insistence of the authors to use two independent datasets/experiments for most figures has statistical implications. For example, on some occasions, the authors use a t-test to compare two groups, which is a parametric test. On other occasions, the authors use a Mann Whitney U test, which is a non-parametric test. Parametric testing assumes that the data are normally distributed. With n=2, it is expected that the data would not pass a normality test, hence a Mann-Whitney U test is likely the only appropriate option for most of the figures presented in the manuscript. Separate from these points, when comparing multiple groups on a graph, a One-Way ANOVA is more appropriate than performing multiple independent t-tests. Overall, the authors need to justify their rationale for the choice of statistical analyses performed throughout the manuscript, especially when using only n=2. In many cases, performing an extra experiment to bring datasets to n=3 would likely alleviate the concerns expressed above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have clarified most of my doubts and answered carefully to the criticisms raised during revision.

Thus, we believe that a direct competition between H1.8 and condensins and topo II for the linker DNA represents a very likely model to explain the chromatin enrichment of condensins and topo II in egg extracts. Other DNA binding proteins also showed some changes in chromatin binding in H1.8 depleted extracts (Figure 1-figure supplement 1E, figure supplement 2, 3), but condensins and topo II are the most abundant chromatin proteins whose chromatin binding is significantly affected by H1.8 depletion. The amount of H1.3 bound to chromatin upon H1.8 depletion was around two orders of magnitude lower than that of condensins and topo II on chromatin (Figure 1-figure supplement 1E) and was 6-fold lower than the residual undepleted H1.8. Therefore, it would be highly unlikely that H1.3 directly stimulates condensin and topo II recruitment unless it can exhibit an unknown catalytic action. If that is the case, it is clearly out of the scope of this manuscript. Interestingly, we now showed that partial depletion of TOP2A did not rescue chromosome elongation phenotype of H1.8 depletion. We believe that this new result would further highlight the unique role of condensin in chromosome elongation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The purified Condensin complexes used in the DNA/nucleosome binding experiments have major issues with its subunit stoichiometry.

As a consequence, most or all the DNA/nucleosome array binding experiments need to be repeated with genuine/ stoichiometric Condensin complexes to provide valid conclusions on the DNA binding behavior of this enzyme.</p></disp-quote><p>The human condensin complexes used in the binding assays in Figure 2 were purified as reported previously (Kong et al., 2020). These complexes eluted as a single peak in a gel filtration column, and the varied intensities of the subunits in the complex are similar to those seen in previous reports in both recombinant yeast condensin and immunoprecipitated <italic>Xenopus</italic> and human condensins (Kong et al., 2020; Ganji et al., 2018; Kimura, Cuvier, and Hirano 2001; Kimura and Hirano 1997). Apparent difference in band intensities in the input samples is most likely due to the different numbers of Coomassie dye binding sites among different condensin subunits. In order to confirm that the condensin complexes used in the binding assays were intact full-length complexes, we also performed mass photometry in the binding assay conditions and added these as Figure 2—figure supplement 1. We had also shown that the wildtype human condensin I was functional as it was able to rescue chromosome morphology in condensin I depleted egg extracts (Figure 2-figure supplement 2A). Although stoichiometry of condensin subunits seems to be changed in DNA-bound fraction in DNA-beads pull-down experiments, most likely due to selective loss of non-SMC subunits during bead-washing steps, H1.8 clearly reduced DNA-binding of all condensin subunits. Since we observed H1.8 mediated inhibition of condensin binding by both chromatin pulldowns (Figure 2) and using electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA Figure2-figure supplement 4), we believe that this represents the behavior of full length condensin complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding chromosome individualization, the authors show that the percentage of &quot;individualized chromosomes&quot; is the same in mock and H1 depleted extracts (after dilution of the chromosome preparation before fixation). However, the dispersion of the chromosomes (processed for immunofluorescence without dilution) is clearly higher in the latter. What is driving the clustering? Interchromosomal entanglements? If so, shouldn´t the entanglements prevent chromosome individualization upon dilution?</p><p>4) Related to point (3), the link between H1, condensin, Top2A and chromosome individualization is not clear. In Figure 6, chromosome individualization is measured by the separation of CENP-A foci, while in Figure 7, the authors examine surface area. These measurements may underlie quite distinct phenomena and so it is unclear what the different measurements in each of the conditions refer to. The authors need to clarify what these differences mean.</p></disp-quote><p>To better explain our observations and the apparent contradictions in the data, we added an additional figure discussing the two metrics for individualizations (Figure 5). We measured chromosome individualization in two contexts, with mechanical dispersal (Figure 6- Dilution assay) and in nocodazole treated extracts (Figure 7-Surface area).</p><p>Two lines of evidence demonstrate that significant interchromosomal links persist in mitosis and the TOP2A activity is needed to resolve these links. The first involves the clustering of chromosomes in the absence of a spindle (Figure 5B, 5C) which we quantify using the surface area of the chromosomal masses. The second is shown using the chromosome dilution assay (Figure 5A). In this assay, entropic forces, generated by dissolving the spindle matrix and reduced molecular crowding, disperse chromosomes and generate single chromosomes. The number of CENP-A foci per chromosome mass was a convenient way to quantitate chromosome clustering/individualization. Although the collapse of spindles due to the addition of nocodazole leads to chromosome clustering due to the accumulation of interchromosomal links (Figure 5A), the mechanical dispersion in the dilution assay can resolve the additional interchromosomal links (Figure 5D, 5E). We also then showed that the resolution of these interchromosomal links requires TOP2A activity during the dilution process (Figure 5D, 5E, figure supplement 1).</p><p>Due to the differences in the two assays, chromosome clustering observations by the dilution assay can differentiate between normal individualization in control (ΔIgG) and the hyperindividualization in ΔH1 extracts. However, the accumulation of interchromosomal links in ΔCAP-G extracts can be observed readily (Figure 6B, 6C). The surface area measurements assay measure individualization in nocodazole treated extracts (Figure 5A). Since no mechanical forces separate the chromosomes in this experiment, control extracts already appear to show maximal clustering (Figure 5B, 5C) and no differences between control and ΔCAP-G extracts seem to be observed. The hyper-individualization due to the loss of H1.8 mediated suppression of condensins and TOP2A is however observed as chromosome declustering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) On the same line, the authors write at the beginning of Discussion: &quot;H1 (…) can also suppress chromosome dispersion that is driven by condensins and topo II that organize the long-range DNA folding&quot;. Two issues here:</p><p>a) It is not clear which results in the paper actually connect long range DNA folding with the dispersion phenotype.</p><p>b) The role of topoII in long range DNA folding is not tested in the paper.</p><p>Maybe the contribution of topoII to chromosome length could be tested using the same scheme as in Figure 6G-H and the protocol for observing individualized chromosomes (dilution before fixation)</p></disp-quote><p>(a)We apologize for a grammatical mistake in this sentence, which should have read;</p><p>“Thus, the linker histone H1, which can promote local chromatin compaction through promoting nucleosome-nucleosome interaction, can also suppress chromosome dispersion that is driven by condensins and topo II, which organize the long-range DNA folding.”</p><p>Instead of “which”, we incorrectly connected the clauses with “that”. We meant to say that H1.8 plays a role in both long-distance genome folding and chromosome dispersion and this happens through its regulation of condensins and topo II. We do not wish to directly connect the long-range folding phenotype to the chromosome individualization phenotype. This is evident from our observations that shortened chromosomes with larger DNA loop layers in ΔH1ΔCAP-G extracts (Figure 3C, D, Figure 4D, E) are more dispersed than chromosomes in control extracts. Thus, although condensins and topo II may play a role in both processes, the processes appear to be regulated differently. To avoid the confusion, the rephrased sentence reads;</p><p>“Thus, the linker histone H1, which can promote local chromatin compaction through promoting nucleosome-nucleosome interaction, can also suppress chromosome dispersion and long-range DNA folding.”</p><p>(b) The data presented in Figure 3E, 3F show that chromosome length was determined solely by the condensin I levels on the chromatin, since condensin I co-depletion did notaffect the topo II overloading upon H1.8 depletion (Figure 7F). We also added Figure 3-figure supplement 2 where we show that partial TOP2A depletion leads to a small increase in chromosome length and that this does not rescue chromosome elongation in ΔH1 extracts. This is consistent with previous reports of the effect of TOP2A depletion or inhibition in vertebrate cells (Farr et al., 2014; Ladouceur et al., 2017; Nielsen et al., 2020; Samejima et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) A previous study showed that depletion of condensin I results in complete loss of individualization of replicated chromosomes in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (Shintomi and Hirano, Genes Dev 2011), whereas in the current study the authors see only a partial effect (Figure 5C). Could this mean that depletion is not complete (western bloting in Figure 5A suggests this might be the case)? Incomplete depletion would complicate the interpretation of the rescue experiment. Does the amount of protein in the extract and relate this to the extent of chromosomal condensation observed? The authors need to explain this discrepancy with previously published work.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer notes, previous reports suggest that complete condensin I depletion fails to generate well-individualized chromosomes (Shintomi and Hirano 2011). We believe that the phenotype reported in Figure 6B, 6C is consistent with this above data. Since we mechanically separate chromosomes by a dilution step before fixing them, we believe that we can separate a small number of ‘fuzzy’ chromosomes from each nucleus in ΔCAP-G extracts. Since we observe only ~15-20% of the chromosomes are individualized even after mechanical dispersion, we believe that this represents a complete failure of chromosome individualization.</p><p>Please note that the interpretation of partial condensin depletion effect would have been complicated only if we had argued that apparent chromosome individualization in ΔH1ΔCAPG extracts is executed by a condensin-independent mechanism. Since additional condensin II co-depletion in triple depletion experiment (ΔH1ΔCAP-GΔCAP-D3) resulted in failed individualization, we instead argue that apparent chromosome individualization in ΔH1ΔCAPG extracts is due to increased chromatin-binding of condensin II (and likely due to residual condensin I). Although we may not eliminate the potential role of other proteins in promoting chromosome individualization in egg extract chromosomes, this possibility would not affect our conclusion that H1 suppresses chromosome individualization through limiting chromatinloading of condensin I and condensin II.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors propose that one of histone H1.8 role is to reduce chromosome length (a function achieved by antagonizing topo II/Condensin loading on chromosome). However, histone H1.8 is an embryonic linker histone and cells in early embryos are typically large and less dependent on chromosome size-reduction mechanisms. One would assume that chromosome size should be maximally reduced in small somatic cells and, consequently, shortening of chromosomes should be promoted by somatic linker histone H1 subtypes. In <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, histone H1.8 accumulates during oogenesis, persists until the mid-blastula transition, and is then replaced by somatic H1 subtypes. It seems like H1.8 disappears when its putative chromosome shortening function is most needed. The authors did not explain how their results are consistent with this biological context.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that one may assume that long chromosomes can be allowed in a large oocyte/egg. This is exactly why our discovery that the oocyte-specific H1.8 actively suppresses the actions of condensin is surprising and has important implications. Mitotic chromosome length is constrained not only by the cell size but also by the spindle size (Schubert and Oud 1997). Importantly, the spindle size in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos does not scale with the cell size during the early divisions (Wuhr et al., 2008). Functional significance of the upper limit of the spindle size remains speculative, but in the discussion, we suggested a potential role for limiting the spindle size to reduce the time of chromosome segregation/mitosis in rapid, synchronized cell divisions in frogs without cell cycle checkpoint controls. The longer the spindle is, the variations in duration for chromosome segregation may increase, making it difficult to maintain the cell division synchrony. Chromosomes prepared in H1.8 depleted extracts (ΔH1) are too long to fit into the mitotic spindles and this may lead to anaphase defects (Maresca, Freedman, and Heald 2005). H1.8 depletion also results in more fragile chromosomes, suggesting that condensin overloading due to loss of H1.8 may result in chromosome fragmentation due to spindle forces (Xiao et al., 2012).</p><p>Despite their smaller cell sizes, mitotic durations can be longer in somatic cells with checkpoint controls than in early embryonic cells with larger cell sizes. Indeed, it was suggested that the larger cell size in early embryos correlates with reduced mitotic checkpoint strength (Galli and Morgan 2016). Thus, it rather makes sense that having shorter mitotic chromosome length is more important in larger early embryonic cells that have reduced mitotic checkpoint strength. We have emphasized these points in our revised Discussion.</p><p>It is also possible that limiting the chromosome size may be a byproduct of preventing chromosome hyper-chromosome individualization by limiting the number of chromatin-bound condensins and TOP2A. As we pointed out in Discussion, clustering chromosomes during or prior to spindle formation by limiting chromosome individualization may be particularly important in a large oocyte to ensure that a bipolar spindle assembles on the whole set of chromosomes. Pronuclear clustering in human and bovine oocytes has also recently been shown to be important to ensure efficient chromosome segregation (Cavazza et al., 2021). Previous studies have also shown that, when bound to chromatin, somatic linker histones can rescue the chromosome elongation observed in H1.8 depleted extracts (Freedman and Heald 2010). However, exogenously provided somatic linker histones are sequestered by importin β during mitosis and are thus excluded largely from mitotic chromatin and somatic linker histones can only rescue loss of H1.8 upon release from this sequestration (Freedman and Heald 2010). This suggests that H1.8 plays a specialized role in oocyte and early embryo mitoses to restrict the chromosome length and individualization in these cells. Somatic linker histones may also play a similar role in the chromosome shortening observed in post MBT embryos as importin sequestration is weaker in smaller cells (Freedman and Heald 2010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Is there a threshold amount of condensin I that needs to be associated with chromosomes for &quot;normal&quot; length. Can the authors partially deplete histone H1 and see a correlation between the amount of condensin and chromosome length?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3E, F, by co-depletion of H1.8 and condensin I, we were able to generate a broad range of chromosome-bound condensin I levels. The chromosome lengths are highly correlated with the amount of chromosome-bound condensin I in this range. Since condensin I is essential for chromosome individualization, a process that is needed for chromosome length measurement, it might not be simple to address the question of whether a threshold level of condensin is required for “normal” chromosome length. Based on Figure 3E, F and Hi-C data, we would assume that chromosome length is linearly correlated with the chromosome-bound levels of condensin I when there is enough condensin I to make chromosome individualized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to 2. If chromosome individualization is affected in H1 depletion, the authors should be able to observe inter-chromosomal interactions in their Hi-C dataset. Can this be quantified for the different conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question, and we tried to monitor inter-chromosomal interactions by Hi-C. Unfortunately, the data were difficult to interpret. As the ligation step was performed in situ as described previously (Belaghzal, Dekker, and Gibcus 2017), the lack of a cellular membrane in pelleted mitotic nuclei from <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts likely resulted in increased inter-nuclear trans contacts. Although this data still captures the mitotic chromosome structure through cis contacts, we observe a high incidence of trans contacts that may be artifactual. While it may be possible to reduce internuclear trans contacts by modifying the dilution procedure, this requires substantial efforts and is thus beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a very nice study from a laboratory that has contributed several important papers to the field of mitosis over the years. Experiments were well designed and carefully performed for the most part (with the exception of DNA/nucleosome binding experiments with purified Condensins). The flow of experiments in this manuscript is logical. Overall, I would say this manuscript addresses an important biological question, and this topic has obvious implications for development and genome stability. The manuscript would however benefit from toning down several overinterpretations and would also be improved by providing a more compelling rationale to justify a role for an early embryonic histone in the reduction of chromosome length.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the functional implications of our findings in oocytes and early embrios, please note our response to Essential Point #7, where we explain why it rather makes sense to keep chromosomes short and suppress hyper chromosome individualization prior to anaphase in a large egg/oocyte.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1 – All experiments presented in this study should be performed a minimum of 3 times as this represents a basic requirement for reproducibility in biomedical research.

We do not see that the level of confidence significantly increases by enforcing every experiment to be done 3 times, statistically speaking.

While three repetitions of every experiment are not insisted on, it is important that the statistical analysis used is appropriate and clearly reported throughout the manuscript.

If/where this is the case, please reanalyse the data using the appropriate statistical test and state this clearly in the figure legend. Where key experiments fail to show significance using these criteria, an additional repeat may be appropriate. For example, the legend of Figure 2 states &quot;The statistical significance of the changes in each immunofluorescence experiment was assessed by a Mann Whitney U-test and the p-values shown in D, E and G are calculated by an unpaired Student's t-test of the aggregate medians (immunofluorescence) or blot intensities of each single experiment.&quot; A t-test would not be appropriate for Figure 2D where it appears that two immunofluorescence experiments are presented, if this is indeed what is shown.

The t-test comparing just the medians of the samples is the most stringent significance test that ignores the confidence generated by the technical replicates in each sample. We also note that the t-test is still valid for n=2, although it reduces statistical power (Naegle, Gough, and Yaffe 2015). This may result in false negatives, where smaller differences between samples are likely to be deemed non-significant. However, since the changes we observed were substantial, we observed significantly low p values with the reduced power of n=2 experiments. However, as the reviewer notes, the t-test with the reduced n value may lead to erroneous conclusions. As suggested, we changed the analysis in those experiments where the experiment was only repeated twice to a non-parametric test (Figure 1G, 6E). We also added an additional experiment for Figure 1D, where we now applied Student’s t-test. For Figure 6B, 6C, although similar experiments were repeated multiple times, the CENP-A metric was only performed twice.

Since even fully individualized chromosomes stochastically interacted during chromosome dispersion, we redefined the chromosome cluster here for the chromosome mass containing four or more CENP-A foci (Figure 5D, 5E, Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). Although chromosomes from each nucleus tightly compact into a ball-like mass in nocodazole treated metaphase extracts (Figure 5B), they individualized normally by dispersion upon extract dilution (Figure 5D, 5E, figure supplement 1E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 383 &quot;better&quot; can be deleted here since the assay has already been introduced.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the sentence as advised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 421 &quot;showed reduced clustering compared to..&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the sentence as advised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 427 Suggest replacing &quot;background&quot; with &quot;extracts&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the advice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 428 &quot;TOP2A depletion in H1.8 depleted extracts also did not reduce the chromosome spreading even though TOP2A levels on these chromosomes became comparable to that of the control&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We incorporated this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The revised manuscript has been improved by the authors but two issues raised in previous reviews have not been addressed in the latest version of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the assessment of the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1 – Condensin stoichiometry: Experiments shown in Figure 2 and associated supplemental figures use Condensin complexes with non-stoichiometric subunit composition. The authors recognize this fact in their rebuttal letter, stating that the &quot;stoichiometry of condensin subunits seems to be changed in DNA-bound fraction in DNA-beads pull-down experiments…&quot; The issue is not convincingly resolved by the mass photometry experiment shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 because this experiment does not fully recapitulate conditions of the DNA binding reactions.</p><p>The authors suggest problems with stoichiometry are not relevant because Condensin complexes used in their experiments were &quot;purified as reported previously (Kong et al., 2020)&quot; and &quot;are similar to those seen in previous reports in both recombinant yeast condensin and immunoprecipitated <italic>Xenopus</italic> and human condensins (Kong et al., 2020; Ganji et al., 2018; Kimura, Cuvier, and Hirano 2001; Kimura and Hirano 1997).&quot; Examination of Condensin purification gels from Kong et al. shows that the complexes purified by these authors are actually stoichiometric (see Figure 1D in PMID 32445620). The same conclusion can be reached for the yeast complexes purified by the Häring group (see Figure 1C in PMID 28882993). The other two studies cited by the authors (Kimura, Cuvier, and Hirano 2001; Kimura and Hirano 1997) use silver staining to label Condensin subunits, a staining method that most biochemists recognize as non-linear and inappropriate to compare the abundance of different proteins. The contention that subunit imbalances seen in the Condensin complexes used by Choppakatla and colleagues are normal and/or reflect imbalances seen in other purified Condensin complexes cannot be verified in the published literature.</p><p>The DNA/nucleosome binding behavior attributed to Condensin is this study is likely reflective of the SMC subcomplex (CAP-E/C without CAP-G/H/D2), not the genuine Condensin 1 enzyme. As a consequence, most or all the DNA/nucleosome array binding experiments need to be repeated with stoichiometric Condensin complexes to provide valid conclusions on the DNA binding behavior of the entire/native enzyme.</p></disp-quote><p>The mass photometry experiments shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 were performed in the assay buffers and at assay conditions (Room temperature incubation). It is not immediately obvious to us why this does not completely recapitulate the experimental conditions in the binding reactions in Figure 2. Since mass photometry is a more direct measurement of the complex stoichiometry than the Coomassie staining on the gels, we are confident that the input condensin complexes are stoichiometric in nature. Please note that the mass photometry analysis was done on the aliquots from the same lot of purified condensin complexes used in all experiments shown in this manuscript. Although the stoichiometry in the condensin complexes bound to the beads appears to be different, we feel that this may be due to a differential elution from the chromatin beads during the washing step. Supporting this possibility, the electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) performed in solution also recapitulate the H1.8 mediated inhibition of condensin binding (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). Importantly, we verified that the purified condensin I complex can support condensin I-depletion phenotypes in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). This is an ultimate verification that our purified condensin I is fully functional.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – Several experiments presented in the revised manuscript have been performed as duplicates, and on one occasion (Figure 3E-F) the results presented come from a single experiment. This reviewer argued previously that all experiments in this study should be performed a minimum of 3 independent times. The authors stated in their rebuttal letter that they &quot;do not see that the level of confidence significantly increases by enforcing every experiment to be done 3 times, statistically speaking.&quot; I disagree with this statement. There is ample evidence to show that statistical analyses are less reliable with sample sizes of 2. Many textbooks /reference papers in statistics support this view and, as an example, I would refer the authors to &quot;A biologist's guide to statistical thinking and analysis.&quot; The authors are correct, though, in their statement that eLife has no explicit publication policy on the minimal number of independent replicates required for publication.</p><p>The insistence of the authors to use two independent datasets/experiments for most figures has statistical implications. For example, on some occasions, the authors use a t-test to compare two groups, which is a parametric test. On other occasions, the authors use a Mann Whitney U test, which is a non-parametric test. Parametric testing assumes that the data are normally distributed. With n=2, it is expected that the data would not pass a normality test, hence a Mann-Whitney U test is likely the only appropriate option for most of the figures presented in the manuscript. Separate from these points, when comparing multiple groups on a graph, a One-Way ANOVA is more appropriate than performing multiple independent t-tests. Overall, the authors need to justify their rationale for the choice of statistical analyses performed throughout the manuscript, especially when using only n=2. In many cases, performing an extra experiment to bring datasets to n=3 would likely alleviate the concerns expressed above.</p></disp-quote><p>In general (Figures 1D, 3D, 6D, 7E, 7F), the statistical analysis of superplots with data from multiple experiments was performed as described here (Lord et al., 2020). The t-test comparing just the medians of the samples is the most stringent significance test that ignores the confidence generated by the technical replicates in each sample. We also note that the t-test is still valid for n=2, although it loses statistical power (Naegle, Gough, and Yaffe 2015). This may result in false negatives, where smaller differences between samples are likely to be deemed non-significant. However, since the changes we observed were substantial, we observed significantly low p values with the reduced power of n=2 experiments. However, as the reviewer notes, the t-test with the reduced n value may lead to erroneous conclusions. As suggested, we changed the analysis in those experiments where the experiment was only repeated twice to a non-parametric test (Figure 1G, 6E). We also added an additional experiment for Figure 1D, where we now applied Student’s t-test. For Figure 6B, 6C, although similar experiments were repeated multiple times, the CENP-A metric was only performed twice. To supplement this, we now include additional data performed independently thrice, where chromosome individualization was quantified based on chromosome morphological classification (Figure 6- figure supplement 1C).</p><p>Regarding the experiment shown in Figure 3E-F, the result was reproduced in a biological replicate (Figure 3- figure supplement 1C,D), as we had reported in the previous revision.</p><p>We also wish to stress that none of the conclusions of the paper rely on the statistical significance of any single measurement. The functional consequences of condensin and TOP2A suppression by H1.8 were shown by several different orthogonal experiments. Collectively, we believe that it is highly unlikely that addition or even subtraction of an experiment would debunk our major conclusions described in this paper. Thus, we stand by the scientific rigor of the manuscript.</p><p>References</p><p>Edwards, Nathaniel S, and Andrew W Murray. 2005. “Identification of <italic>Xenopus</italic> CENP-A and an Associated Centromeric DNA Repeat.” Molecular Biology of the Cell 16 (4): 1800–1810. https://doi.org/10.1091/mbc.e04-09-0788.</p><p>Ikegami, Yoji, Ryoji Ishida, and Toshiwo Andoh. 1991. “Inhibition of Topoisomerase II by Antitumor Agents Bis(2,6-Dioxopiperazine) Derivatives.” Cancer Research 51 (18): 4903–8.</p><p>Lord, Samuel J, Katrina B Velle, R Dyche Mullins, and Lillian K.
