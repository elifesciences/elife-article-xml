transposable elements (TEs) for host gene regulation. However, high numbers of integrations typical of TEs, coupled with sequence divergence within families, have made systematic interrogation of the regulatory contributions of TEs challenging. Here, we employ CARGO, our recent method for CRISPR gRNA multiplexing, to facilitate targeting of LTR5HS, an ape-specific class of HERVK (HML-2) LTRs that is active during early development and present in ~700 copies throughout the human genome. We combine CARGO with CRISPR activation or interference to, respectively, induce or silence LTR5HS en masse, and demonstrate that this system robustly targets the vast majority of LTR5HS insertions. Remarkably, activation/silencing of LTR5HS is associated with reciprocal up- and down-regulation of hundreds of human genes. These effects require the presence of retroviral sequences, but occur over long genomic distances, consistent with a pervasive function of LTR5HS elements as early embryonic enhancers in apes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endogenous retroviruses</kwd><kwd>transposable elements</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>HERVK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuentes</surname><given-names>Daniel R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wysocka</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM112720</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wysocka</surname><given-names>Joanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new approach combines guide RNA multiplexing with CRISPR activation and interference to facilitate functional studies of transposable elements present in hundreds of copies throughout the human genome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nearly half of the human genome is composed of transposable elements (TEs), which are increasingly being recognized not just as parasitic DNA, but as an important source of regulatory innovation for the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chuong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feschotte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rayan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Thompson et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which comprise about 8% of the human genome, are sequences derived from ancient retroviruses whose germ-line infections have persisted through millions of years of evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feschotte and Gilbert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium et al., 2001</xref>). At the time of endogenization, ERVs, like all retroviruses, contain 5ʹ and 3ʹ long terminal repeats (LTRs) that flank open reading frames encoding retroviral proteins; over time, these LTRs accumulate mutations and often undergo homologous recombination, which reduces them to so-called ‘solo’ LTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kassiotis and Stoye, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stoye, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Young et al., 2013</xref>). In their capacity as retroviral promoters, LTRs are enriched for transcription factor motifs and thus are a particularly fertile substrate for evolving new regulatory elements that can be exapted for host gene regulation. Many examples of such exaptations now exist, for example: in the mouse two-cell (2C) stage embryo, MERVL elements serve as alternative promoters for a subset of mouse 2C genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>), while LTRs of a human ERV, MER41, can function as interferon-inducible enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>). Epigenomic mapping studies detected cell type-selective active enhancer signatures at thousands of LTRs, suggesting that acquisition of tissue-specific or inducible regulatory functions by these elements is a widespread phenomenon that may have profound effects on host gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourque et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chuong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kunarso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sundaram et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Trizzino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that a large proportion of primate-specific enhancer/promoter sequences, as well as those that changed their activity most recently, since the separation of humans from chimpanzees, originate from TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacques et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Prescott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rayan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Trizzino et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, understanding the functional impact of TEs on gene regulation is essential for comprehending the emergence of primate- and human-specific traits.</p><p>Despite evidence suggesting the importance of LTRs and other TEs in rewiring gene regulatory networks, most current studies are either correlative or focus on the analysis of individual insertions, rather than on systematically perturbing specific TE classes, with one notable exception of a report utilizing transcription activator-like effector (TALE) fused to effector domains for functional perturbations of mouse LINE1 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jachowicz et al., 2017</xref>). This knowledge gap is associated with technical challenges, as LTR subfamilies are often present in hundreds or thousands of copies, which are highly repetitive, but, due to accumulated mutations, sufficiently sequence-divergent to prevent their recognition by a single short-sequence-dependent factor, such as a zinc finger protein or CRISPR guide RNA (gRNA). To overcome these limitations and develop a strategy for systematic interrogation of TE function, we leveraged our recently developed method for gRNA multiplexing called CARGO (Chimeric Array of gRNA Oligos), which allows for the introduction of tens of gRNAs into single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we couple CARGO with nuclease dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to an activation or repression domain (CRISPRa and CRISPRi, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chavez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>) to facilitate transcriptional induction or silencing of HERVK LTR5HS elements en masse. Among human ERVs, HERVK (HML-2) is of particular interest, as it is the most recently endogenized retrovirus, which infected the primate lineage both before and after the human-chimpanzee divergence and retained many intact proviruses with coding potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbulescu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belshaw et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Medstrand and Mager, 1998</xref>). This ERV class contains integrations so recent that polymorphic insertions across the human population exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belshaw et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wildschutte et al., 2016</xref>). All human-specific and human-polymorphic HERVK insertions are associated with a specific LTR5 family subclass, LTR5HS, present in 697 copies in the human genome (hg38 assembly) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref>). We recently showed that HERVK is transcriptionally activated in human preimplantation embryos and in naïve, but not primed, human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref>). Naïve hESCs model an early, preimplantation stage of the human blastocyst, characterized by global DNA hypomethylation similar to that observed in the inner cell mass, with transcriptional profiles and epigenetic landscapes different from those of primed hESCs, which are most similar to a later, postimplantation stage of the blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bates and Silva, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zimmerlin et al., 2017</xref>). Embryonic activation of HERVK can also be modeled in human embryonal carcinoma NCCIT cells, which exhibit both pluripotent and tumorigenic characteristics, but, unlike naïve hESCs, are easy to maintain and manipulate. Similarly to naïve hESCs and preimplantation embryos, NCCIT cells express pluripotency transcription factors and are characterized by DNA hypomethylation and high expression of HERVK-derived transcripts and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boller et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herbst et al., 1996</xref>). Transcriptional reactivation of HERVK in NCCIT is associated with the acquisition of enhancer-like chromatin signatures at LTR5HS elements, raising the possibility that these elements may influence host gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We now demonstrate that a CARGO-based CRISPRa/CRISPRi strategy facilitates robust and specific targeting of dCas9 to ~90% of LTR5HS elements throughout the human genome for efficient activation or repression of HERVK transcripts and proteins. Moreover, perturbation of LTR5HS function by recruitment of an activator or a repressor leads to the reciprocal up- and down-regulation of nearly 300 human genes, along with widespread effects on the chromatin landscape surrounding the promoters of these genes and LTR5HS insertions. Remarkably, these effects on host gene expression occur over long genomic ranges, indicating that LTR5HS elements function as distal enhancers for a substantial number of genes. In agreement, deletion of select LTR5HS elements confirms their strong contribution to host gene transcription. These LTR5HS-regulated genes are preferentially expressed in naïve relative to primed hESCs and their transcripts are also elevated in developing human blastocysts as compared to those of rhesus macaque, a primate species that does not contain LTR5HS insertions. These observations suggest that recent HERVK endogenization has contributed to the establishment of unique gene expression patterns in preimplantation embryos of humans and other apes. Altogether, our work provides a novel and broadly applicable strategy for functional manipulation of specific TE classes across the genome and supports a pervasive role of LTRs as embryonic gene enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CARGO-CRISPRa/CRISPRi system for manipulating function of transposable elements across the genome</title><p>To investigate the role of HERVK LTR5HS insertions in the regulation of embryonic gene expression and, more broadly, to establish a proof of principle for using CARGO to simultaneously target hundreds of repetitive elements interspersed across the genome, we designed a CARGO array with 12 distinct gRNA transcriptional units, altogether predicted to recognize ~91% (635/697) of LTR5HS integrations in the human genome (hg38 assembly) when allowing zero mismatches between gRNA sequences and LTR5HS sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We computationally predict that many insertions are recognized by multiple gRNAs, with a maximum of nine gRNAs expected to target any single insertion. For example, at zero mismatches, ~87% of LTR5HS insertions are targeted by at least two gRNAs, and ~57% by at least four gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), an important consideration given that a single gRNA is often insufficient for robust gene activation/silencing by CRISPRa/CRISPRi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perez-Pinera et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although our custom scoring algorithm penalized potential gRNAs that target genomic regions other than LTR5HS, we ‘masked’ the highly related (~88% sequence similarity) HERVK LTR5A and LTR5B sequences to exclude them from negatively affecting candidate gRNA scores. Consequently, our CARGO array is computationally predicted to exhibit some binding to LTR5A and LTR5B, but should not target other classes of LTRs or other TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), including the SVA elements, which are in part derived from the LTR5 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hancks and Kazazian, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ono et al., 1987</xref>). With this strategy, we expect 58% (178/306) of LTR5A and 50% (235/472) of LTR5B insertions to be bound when no mismatches are allowed.</p><p>We assembled CARGO LTR5HS-targeting arrays using either the <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> gRNA scaffold (hereafter called LTR5HS Sp) or the <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> gRNA scaffold (LTR5HS Sa). As a non-targeting control, we also assembled a CARGO array with gRNAs that should not pair anywhere in the human genome, with the <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> gRNA scaffold (nontarget Sp). To couple CARGO with CRISPRa/CRISPRi approaches for systematic perturbation of function, we used the human embryonal carcinoma NCCIT model to generate six transgenic cell lines, each expressing one of the three aforementioned CARGO arrays and a doxycycline-inducible <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> dCas9 fused to either the strong transactivation domain VPR (dCas9-VPR; CRISPRa) or to a repressive KRAB domain (dCas9-KRAB; CRISPRi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chavez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilbert et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Only cells expressing the LTR5HS Sp array will recruit dCas9 fusion proteins to the target regions, for either activation (dCas9-VPR) or repression (dCas9-KRAB) of HERVK/LTR5HS transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). By contrast, LTR5HS Sa gRNAs will not complex with the <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> dCas9, and thus cells with the LTR5HS Sa array serve as a control for overexpression of LTR5HS-derived short RNAs. Finally, in nontarget Sp cell lines, the gRNAs will form a complex with dCas9, but will not bind the genome (at least not in a sequence-dependent manner), thereby serving as a control for the presence of RNA-loaded dCas9 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35989.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Control of HERVK/LTR5HS expression by CARGO-CRISPRa/CRISPRi.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of experimental strategy for generation of NCCIT human embryonal carcinoma cell lines expressing CARGO arrays and indicated <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> dCas9 fusion proteins (SpdCas9).

We therefore also examined expression of HERVK transcripts encoding <italic>env</italic>, <italic>gag</italic>, and <italic>pro</italic>, as well as protein levels of Env. We found that although HERVK is already highly expressed in NCCIT cells, levels of both HERVK proviral transcripts and LTR5HS-derived transcripts further increase between 10- and 15-fold in the dCas9-VPR activating lines in the recruitment condition LTR5HS Sp, as compared to the control conditions LTR5HS Sa and nontarget Sp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, in the dCas9-KRAB expressing lines, HERVK transcript expression decreases by over 98-fold in the binding condition LTR5HS Sp, compared to the control conditions LTR5HS Sa and nontarget Sp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, observed repression levels are generally as strong as or stronger than those previously reported in CRISPRi experiments with silencing of active single copy loci, attesting to the efficacy of our system. In agreement with effects on transcript expression, we also observed global increases and decreases in HERVK Env protein levels with, respectively, dCas9-VPR and dCas9-KRAB recruitment to LTR5HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Altogether, CARGO-CRISPRa/CRISPRi provides a robust system for manipulating the function of highly repetitive TEs such as HERVK.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>dCas9 selectively binds the majority of LTR5HS insertions</title><p>We next employed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to characterize the prevalence and specificity of dCas9 targeting to individual LTR5HS instances across the genome. We derived NCCIT lines stably expressing doxycycline-inducible dCas9 fused to EGFP (dCas9-GFP), and one of the three CARGO arrays: the recruitment (LTR5HS Sp) array or the two control (LTR5HS Sa or nontarget Sp) arrays. For each CARGO array condition, we performed ChIP-seq using three antibodies: one against Cas9, and two against GFP (example UCSC genome browser tracks are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In order to avoid artifacts associated with antibody cross-reactivity, we focused our analysis on peaks called with all three antibodies. Using paired-end 150 bp sequencing allowed us to map obtained signals to individual instances of HERVK in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We identified 1178 high-confidence peaks for the recruitment (LTR5HS Sp) condition, while for the control conditions we called 72 peaks (LTR5HS Sa) and 0 peaks (nontarget Sp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that most peaks in the LTR5HS Sp condition are due to site-specific targeting by CARGO. In agreement, the majority of dCas9 binding occurs at LTR5HS sites (591 peaks, corresponding to 85% of LTR5HS elements) or the computationally predicted and highly sequence related LTR5A/5B/5 sites (343 peaks, corresponding to 53%, 41%, and 19% of, respectively, LTR5A, LTR5B, and LTR5 instances), and is selective for the LTR5HS Sp array condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). These HERVK LTR5 peaks lie almost entirely in intergenic (~68.6%) and intragenic (~30.6%) regions, with very few (~0.8%) overlapping with promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The remaining 244 non-LTR peaks we classify as off-targets, and these are distributed evenly between intergenic and intragenic sites. Some of these peaks (33/244, ~14%) are legitimate Watson-Crick base-pairing off-targets of the CRISPR gRNAs in the CARGO array to the human genome sequence, when allowing for up to three mismatches between gRNA and genome sequence. The rest, we believe, are simply non-specific binding sites, though some may be legitimate off-targets when permitting more than three mismatches; indeed, it is known that gRNA-to-target mismatches are tolerated beyond this threshold, especially when these mismatches are outside of the 5 bp ‘seed’ sequence immediately adjacent to the PAM site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuscu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35989.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Robust and selective dCas9 targeting to LTR5HS via CARGO.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative UCSC hg38 genome browser tracks showing ChIP-seq profiles for dCas9 performed with three different antibodies (Cas9, GFP Abcam, GFP Invitrogen) from NCCIT cells expressing one of the three CARGO arrays (LTR5HS Sp, LTR5HS Sa, nontarget Sp; colored as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We also found that in these cells, a large subset of LTR5HS elements is marked by H3K27ac and H3K4me3, with H3K4me3 showing the expected asymmetric distribution consistent with the direction of LTR-driven transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, LTR5HS insertions generally lack H3K9me3 in WT NCCIT, regardless of the presence or absence of H3K27ac and H3K4me3, suggesting that LTR5HS insertions in these cells escape KRAB-mediated repression, a major mechanism of endogenous retrovirus silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedli and Trono, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rowe et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35989.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Changes in LTR5HS chromatin landscape upon CARGO-CRISPRa/CRISPRi.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat maps of normalized ChIP-seq signal using antibodies against Cas9, H3K27ac, H3K4me3, or H3K9me3.

With CRISPRa, over 90% of LTR5HS elements gain a high level of H3K27 acetylation, with no appreciable change in H3K4me3. In fact, strong gains in H3K27ac occur even at those LTR5HS insertions that have low endogenous acetylation, which may suggest that ectopic enhancer activation is relatively common and efficient with this system. Conversely, with CRISPRi, we observed a reduction in both active marks, H3K27ac and H3K4me3, and a strong concomitant increase in H3K9me3, as expected, given that KRAB repression is mediated by H3K9me3 deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, individual LTR5HS examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Under both CRISPRa and CRISPRi conditions, we found strong signals of dCas9 binding, though enrichments at the corresponding elements were higher with dCas9-VPR than dCas9-KRAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This is likely attributable to the fact that VPR, a strong activation domain, recruits coactivators that promote nucleosomal depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</xref>), whereas KRAB-mediated H3K9me3 facilitates chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2016</xref>), which may in turn provide, respectively, positive or negative feedback for dCas9 fusion binding, especially given that nucleosomes can impede access of Cas9 to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horlbeck et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, dCas9-KRAB still occupies and mediates H3K9me3 deposition at over 90% of LTR5HS elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Taken together, these data show that a large subset of LTR5HS elements is enriched in active chromatin marks in WT cells, but that targeted recruitment of dCas9 fusions results in widespread effects on the LTR5HS chromatin landscape that are consistent with the predicted activity of the fusion protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Reciprocal effects of LTR5HS CRISPRa/CRISPRi on host gene expression</title><p>CARGO-CRISPRa/CRISPRi allows us to systematically test the impact of LTR5HS activation or repression on the host transcriptome. To do so, we performed RNA-seq on the six cell lines described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> after doxycycline induction of dCas9-VPR or dCas9-KRAB. First, we examined transcriptional changes of repetitive elements and found that, as expected, LTR5HS and HERVK transcripts are upregulated by dCas9-VPR recruitment to LTR5HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and downregulated by dCas9-KRAB recruitment to LTR5HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next analyzed expression of non-repetitive genes, and identified 390 transcripts that significantly change in expression (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05) with both dCas9-VPR (CRISPRa) and dCas9-KRAB (CRISPRi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Of those, the majority (275 genes, 71%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, blue points in lower right quadrant) are reciprocally upregulated by CRISPRa and downregulated by CRISPRi, which is consistent both with LTR5HS-dependent regulation, and with the possibility that LTR5HS elements function as enhancers, since activation or repression of an enhancer would be expected to induce or decrease, respectively, expression of a target gene. Some genes were only affected by one of the treatments (i.e. dCas9-VPR only, 3980 genes, 1886 upregulated and 2094 downregulated, in green, or dCas9-KRAB only, 288 genes, 145 upregulated and 143 downregulated, in red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and these effects could reflect a genuine contribution of LTR5HS to their regulation. Nonetheless, when we analyzed transcripts with respect to distance from the nearest LTR5HS, grouped by deciles from closest to furthest, we found that the majority of reciprocally affected genes (218/275, 79%) fell within the closest decile, consistent with regulation by LTR5HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, the magnitude of expression changes of genes affected by CRISPRa-only or CRISPRi-only is relatively modest: only 40% and 18%, respectively, have a greater than two-fold change in expression in either direction. Most (78% and 60%, respectively) of these CRISPRa-only or CRISPRi-only affected genes fall outside of the first or second decile in distance with respect to the nearest LTR5HS (i.e. within 436 kb of the LTR5HS; compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>), suggesting many indirect effects. In contrast, of the 275 genes reciprocally upregulated by CRISPRa and downregulated by CRISPRi, 225 (82%) show greater than two-fold change in expression in at least one condition, and 250 (91%) fall within the first or second decile of distance from the nearest LTR5HS. Therefore, we further focus on the 275 genes that show reciprocal transcriptional effects in CRISPRa/CRISPRi, and we refer to them as LTR5HS-regulated transcripts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35989.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Reciprocal effects of LTR5HS CARGO-CRISPRa/CRISPRi on host gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gene expression log2 fold change of CRISPRi (recruitment vs. control) vs. log2 fold change of CRISPRa (recruitment vs. control).

This finding suggests that even downstream LTR5HS insertions can have a transcriptional effect on the gene, meaning that these insertions do not serve as alternative promoters. Furthermore, since LTR sequences do have a natural orientation, we also examined the relative orientation of the nearest LTR5HS for each of these genes. In the 150 cases in which the nearest LTR5HS insertion is upstream of the promoter, the LTR5HS has the same orientation as the gene (both on Watson strand or both on Crick strand) 83 times, compared to 67 in the opposite orientation. In the 125 cases in which the nearest LTR5HS insertion is downstream of the promoter, the LTR5HS has the same orientation as the gene 48 times, compared to 77 in the opposite orientation. Together, these findings suggest that neither the relative position of the LTR5HS insertion to the promoter, nor its orientation, determines its ability to effect a transcriptional change on the gene in question under CRISPRa or CRISPR, consistent with the putative enhancer function. Furthermore, when we analyzed the RNA-seq data for the presence of chimeric transcripts between LTR5HS and the LTR5HS-regulated genes, we detected an appreciable level (i.e. transcripts per million [TPM] &gt; 1) of chimeric transcription at only four of the 275 genes (specifically, <italic>NBPF12</italic>, <italic>SLC4A8</italic>, <italic>FA2H</italic>, and <italic>TIMM50</italic>). Thus, the function of LTR5HS as alternative promoters cannot broadly explain the observed regulatory effects on host gene transcription.</p><p>Gene ontology analysis of the LTR5HS-regulated transcripts did not detect strong enrichments in specific biological processes and pathways (data not shown). Interestingly, however, even though our experiments were performed in NCCIT embryonal carcinoma cells, we analyzed previously published RNA-seq data and observed statistically significant relationships between LTR5HS-regulated transcripts and differentially expressed genes in these public datasets. Specifically, we found that 138 of the 275 LTR5HS-regulated transcripts (50%, Fisher’s exact test p value = 2.63×10<sup>−26</sup>) are also upregulated in naïve as compared to primed hESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takashima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>), and that 55 of these transcripts (20%, Fisher’s exact test p value = 3.85×10<sup>−21</sup>) are expressed in the human preimplantation epiblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). These observations are consistent with potential LTR5HS-dependent gene regulation in naïve hESC and preimplantation embryos, where these elements undergo transcriptional reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>). We next analyzed published single cell RNA-seq data from both human and rhesus macaque early embryos, and found that LTR5HS-regulated transcripts are more highly expressed in human than rhesus preimplantation blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney p value &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yan et al., 2013</xref>). A trend towards human-specific upregulation of these transcripts can be observed starting at the 8-cell stage through the morula, although it only reaches statistical significance in the blastocyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Given that the rhesus genome does not contain any LTR5HS insertions, and that LTR5HS-driven expression in the developing human embryo begins at the 8-cell stage and peaks in the blastocyst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref>), these observations suggest that the acquisition of LTR5HS after the split of apes from old world monkeys has contributed to increased expression of a subset of preimplantation genes specifically in apes. We then analyzed the evolutionary age of the LTR5HS insertions closest to the LTR5HS-regulated transcripts (ranging from over 20 million years for the oldest elements to a couple of hundred thousand years for the youngest). We observed no bias for older insertions to be associated with regulatory changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) and consequently, a subset of LTR5HS-regulated transcripts was linked to human-specific LTR5HS instances (i.e. those 5 million years old or younger). These observations raise the intriguing possibility that LTR5HS may mediate not only ape-specific, but also human-specific features of early embryonic gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>LTR5HS activation and repression affect host gene transcription over long genomic distances</title><p>A hallmark of enhancer elements is their ability to activate host gene expression over long genomic distances and in an orientation-independent manner. We noted that although most LTR5HS-regulated transcripts fell within the closest decile category with respect to distance from the nearest LTR5HS, this category encompassed distances of up to ~436 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We therefore took an LTR5HS-centric approach, and examined changes in host gene expression in relation to distance from each gene transcription start site (TSS) to the nearest LTR5HS at higher resolution within the ±200 kb domain. We found that expression of genes with promoters located not only in direct proximity of LTR5HS, but up to ~200 kb upstream or downstream of LTR5HS, was significantly upregulated by recruitment of dCas9-VPR (CRISPRa) to LTR5HS (LTR5HS Sp), compared to controls (LTR5HS Sa and nontarget Sp), but at further distances the changes became non-significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for statistical analysis).

We observed naïve state-biased expression of genes located up to 40–120 kb away from the LTR5HS, depending on the dataset used for the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for statistical analysis).</p><p>In contrast, we found more limited impact on transcription of genes near LTR5A and LTR5B, where only local effects can be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Given that 53% of LTR5A regions and 41% of LTR5B regions are bound by dCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), this suggests that LTR5A/B insertions likely do not have robust long-range enhancer activity in NCCIT cells, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the weaker transcriptional effects are associated with lower enrichments of dCas9 fusion proteins at these elements. Nonetheless, LTR5HS, which contains an OCT4 motif, is preferentially bound by OCT4 and p300 as compared to LTR5A and LTR5B, which do not contain the motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">You et al., 2013</xref>). We also analyzed publicly available ChIP-seq data and observed OCT4 and H3K27ac enrichments at LTR5HS in NCCIT and naïve hESC, but not primed hESC, while no enrichments were detected at LTR5A or LTR5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data suggest that genuine functional differences in regulatory capacity exist within distinct subclasses of HERVK LTR5 elements, and that their regulatory activity is cell type-specific. As a control, we analyzed gene expression changes under CRISPRa and CRISPRi conditions with respect to distance from HERVE LTR2, a class of LTR that is not targeted in these experiments. As expected, we found no effect on genes near this LTR class, confirming that the transcriptional changes observed are dependent on specific targeting of HERVK LTR5HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to determine if transcriptional changes observed at the LTR5HS-regulated genes under CRISPRa and CRISPRi conditions are accompanied by differences in histone modifications at the promoters of these genes. We used the histone modification ChIP-seq data described above to examine patterns of H3K27ac, H3K9me3, and H3K4me3 surrounding the promoters of the 275 LTR5HS-regulated transcripts (i.e. blue points in lower right quadrant of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Most of these promoters are marked by at least some H3K27ac and H3K4me3 in WT NCCIT, and most gain or lose, respectively, H3K27 acetylation under CRISPRa or CRISPRi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Notably, these changes occur in the absence of direct dCas9 binding to the promoters, suggesting that they result from the long-range effects of LTR5HS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Furthermore, although some gains of H3K9me3 can be observed in the vicinity of the promoters under CRISPRi conditions, most TSS remain unmethylated at H3K9, and, unlike at the LTRs, their H3K4me3 levels are relatively unaffected, suggesting that direct silencing of promoters via H3K9me3 spreading from a nearby LTR5HS is not likely to explain the transcriptional effects we examine in this study. As a control, we performed these same analyses on a set of 275 random promoters, and we detected no changes in any histone mark under CRISPRa or CRISPRi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Long-range effects on host gene expression are dependent on LTR5HS DNA sequence</title><p>We next sought to test whether the presence of LTR5HS DNA sequences is required for both the deposition of enhancer marks in the vicinity of the LTR5HS and for the observed long-range effects on host gene expression.

While we focused on HERVK LTR5HS, the strategy described here could be easily adapted to study different classes of TEs. We exploited the sequence similarity of LTR5HS insertions to target hundreds of insertions with only twelve gRNAs, with most insertions being targeted by multiple gRNAs. Given that CARGO can easily deliver 36 or more gRNAs to single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2018</xref>), our approach is applicable for targeting TEs that are more sequence-divergent and/or present in higher copy numbers than LTR5HS. Furthermore, different dCas9 fusions could replace the dCas9-VPR and dCas9-KRAB fusions used in this work. These could potentially enable imaging at these loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2018</xref>) or local manipulation of DNA or histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hilton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kearns et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vojta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Xu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The findings that CRISPRa/CRISPRi reciprocally affects expression and promoter histone modification patterns of genes located tens or even several hundreds of kilobases away from LTR5HS elements, and that CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of individual LTR5HS insertions substantially decreases expression of nearby host genes spanning a wide range of distances and distinct orientations with respect to the LTR, altogether indicate that these insertions act as enhancer elements. While multiple recent studies demonstrated the presence of enhancer chromatin signatures at various classes of LTRs, correlated them with expression of nearby genes, or directly demonstrated the importance of select individual LTR instances for host gene activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chuong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Theunissen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), to our knowledge this study is the first to systematically interrogate the function of a specific LTR class in long-range gene regulation. We uncovered a broad impact of LTR5HS on host gene transcription, with 275 genes being reciprocally up- or down-regulated in our CRISPRa/CRISPRi experiments. Given the widespread redundancies in mammalian regulatory landscapes where loss of a single enhancer often has only a minor influence on expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hnisz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Osterwalder et al., 2018</xref>), the transcriptional effects we observe upon deletion of single LTR5HS elements are surprisingly potent, suggesting that these elements indeed function as strong and/or relatively non-redundant enhancers of their target genes.</p><p>Considering that other classes of TEs beyond LTR5HS are likely contributing to gene regulation in the early human embryo, these observations are consistent with a pervasive, rather than occasional, role of TEs in transcriptional control. In the mouse, MERVL elements in 2C stage embryos function as alternative promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Macfarlan et al., 2012</xref>), and, so far, no evidence exists to suggest that they may act as transcriptional enhancers. Hundreds of chimeric transcripts spanning junctions between 5ʹ ERV LTRs and exons containing open reading frames were detected in these cells. However, we found no evidence of pervasive chimeric transcription between HERVK LTR5HS insertions and nearby host genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref> and this study), illustrating diverse mechanisms that may underlie regulatory functions in the early embryo.</p><p>Although the fact that evolutionarily young LTRs such as LTR5HS have been so extensively adapted for enhancer function may seem counterintuitive, it is important to note that preimplantation embryo cells and germ cells may be a privileged environment for such early adaptation, not only due to global DNA hypomethylation in these cells, but because in order to persist through vertical transmission, these ancient retroviruses must have been able to replicate in the germline or early embryonic cells, before the germline has been set aside. Thus, LTRs of retroviruses that successfully endogenized might have been optimized to begin with for directing expression in early embryo/germ cells. Interestingly, LTR5HS elements (but not related LTR5A/B elements) contain a consensus motif and are bound by the pluripotent stem cell/primordial germ cell/reprogramming factor and master regulator OCT4, which may have contributed both to their endogenization and cooption for enhancer function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, OCT4 plays a central role in activating pluripotency network enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Los Angeles et al., 2015</xref>) and our previous work demonstrated that its binding motif is important for the ability of LTR5HS to drive transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grow et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is intriguing to consider whether regulatory repurposing of LTR5HS elements for enhancer function may have contributed to human-specific transcriptome divergence and endowed the early developmental stages of the human embryo with species-specific attributes. All LTR5HS insertions are unique to apes, and a subset is human-specific or even human-polymorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belshaw et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wildschutte et al., 2016</xref>). We found that both human-specific and older, ape-specific LTR5HS elements contribute to long-range gene regulation, and that some of the genes dependent on them in embryonal carcinoma cells are also expressed in human preimplantation embryos. Interestingly, we found that transcript levels of genes that are orthologous between human and rhesus macaque and regulated by LTR5HS in human cells are significantly elevated in human blastocysts compared to rhesus blastocysts. Given that rhesus diverged from the human lineage approximately 25 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rhesus Macaque Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, et al., 2007</xref>), before the integration of LTR5HS, our findings suggest that a recent burst of HERVK endogenization supplied humans and other apes with new early embryonic enhancers, leading to a shift in preimplantation gene expression programs. Although there is no evidence thus far to suggest that the phenotypic consequences of the molecular adaptation of LTR5HS for enhancer function have been beneficial to the host, it is nonetheless tempting to speculate that some LTR5HS-driven changes in gene expression may have measurable phenotypic consequences on early development, endowing it with ape-specific attributes. Regardless, the CARGO-CRISPRa/CRISPRi strategy described here provides a novel tool to study the impact of LTRs and other TEs on primate-specific features of development and disease.</p></sec><sec

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Deborah Bourchis (Reviewer #1); Cédric Feschotte (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the question of the extent to which Transposable Elements and their relics in a genome have been adapted to influence &quot;host&quot; gene regulation is addressed. By adapting their recently published gRNA multiplexing CARGO method (Gu et al., 2018) the authors target dCAS9-fusion activator (VPR) or repressor (KRAB) proteins to the ~700 copies of the HERVK (HML-2), LTR5HS elements of the human genome (known to be expressed early on in human development). The authors examine the effects of this TE modulation on nearby gene expression in human embryonal carcinoma cells derived from a germ-line tumor (NCCIT). The authors report that activation/silencing of LTR5HS is associated with reciprocal up- and down-regulation of nearly 300 human genes, although the VPR activation shows more striking effects than KRAB repression. They go on to look at the range of impact that these LTR5HS elements have is up to 160kb, suggesting that they might be acting as potential enhancers. The authors also specifically delete three individual LTR5HS elements, and examine effects on nearby genes by qRT-PCR which points to their potential role in gene regulation.</p><p>This study is of a great interest for the field as it serves as an important demonstration that expression of hundreds of copies of a specific family of LTR retrotransposons can be efficiently modulated using dCas9 effectors and the recently developed CARGO system and it allows the impact of a whole LTR family on gene expression to be addressed in a systematic way. Although previous studies (Guallar et al.,; Ishiuchi et al.,; Jachowicz et al., 2017; Amabile et al., 2016 – which should have been cited) have targeted whole TE families, the present study is one of the first to describe an in depth, genome-wide analysis of what the functional contribution of LTR elements might be for gene expression control across the human genome. The manuscript is well written, easy to read and the experiments are of high quality. There are however some important issues that the authors will need to address.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the LTR5HS sequences they have affected are acting as enhancers. However, they need to prove this enhancer potential at the endogenous locations. As the study stands they cannot rule out that the elements are acting as alternative promoters, particularly as the three LTR5HS elements that they deleted were in close proximity (a few kb) to the associated genes. Several approaches can address this, as outlined in the reviewers' comments. These include demonstrating enhancer orientation independence for the LTRs; presenting their analyses in Figure 4 using stranded information, and directionality of the LTR as well as clarifying distances from TSS; demonstrating that chimeric transcripts are not produced between the LTR5HS elements and the up-regulated genes in the CRISPRa approach using 5'RACE or CAGE RNAseq; performing ChIP-PCR to examine enhancer marks such as H3K27ac, H3K122ac and H3K4me1 to see if their distributions change in wt versus LTR-deleted condition across at least two of the loci studied (enhancer, promoter, and LTR); performing deletion experiments for LTRs that are more distant to the misregulated genes identified; examining the effects both upstream and downstream of the genes.</p><p>2) The authors should provide more information about the transcription factor and chromatin landscape of the LTR sequences. This could thus assess whether there is a pre-existing regulatory activity of individual LTR5HS elements in NCCIT cells that could influence the efficiency and outcomes of the CRISPRi/a assays.</p><p>3) The repressive effects on neighbouring genes upon KRAB targeting is not clear (Figure 4B and supplementary figures). There are no statistics and the number of genes falling into different categories are not given; the effects on basal transciprition of CACNA2D2, <italic>NFKB2</italic> and SERPINB9 upon deletion of the unique LTR is not shown.</p><p>4) Statistics need to be checked and included in several of the figures including Figure 4 above. The distance analyses lack statistics: how many genes per 'distance' block were analysed? Are the changes in transcription statistically significant? How would this look with a negative control (e.g. another repeat)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35989.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the LTR5HS sequences they have affected are acting as enhancers.

We followed the reviewers’ suggestions and took a multi-pronged approach to addressing this comment, as outlined below:</p><p>Demonstrating orientation independence for the LTR5HS effect on gene expression: We reanalyzed the data concerning the LTR5HS-regulated genes (as defined in Figure 4A of the revised manuscript) and their nearest LTR5HS insertion (the putative enhancer). We found that for these 275 genes, the nearest LTR5HS is upstream of the promoter in 150 cases, and downstream in 125 cases. This finding suggests that even downstream LTR5HS insertions can have a transcriptional effect on the gene, a finding not compatible with their function as alternative promoters. Importantly, we deleted three of those downstream LTR5HS insertions and confirmed that they indeed significantly affect expression of the candidate target gene (see next section for details). As LTR sequences do have a natural orientation, we also examined the relative orientation of the nearest LTR5HS for each of these genes. In the 150 cases where the LTR5HS insertion is upstream of the promoter, the LTR5HS insertion has the same orientation (both on the Watson strand or both on the Crick strand) 83 times, compared to 67 in the opposite orientation. In the 125 cases where the LTR5HS insertion is downstream, the insertion has the same orientation as the gene 48 times, compared to 77 in the opposite orientation. These findings together suggest that neither the relative position of the LTR5HS to the promoter, nor its orientation, determines its ability to effect a transcriptional change on the gene in question under CRISPRa or CRISPRi, consistent with the proposed enhancer function. This information has now been incorporated in the text of the revised manuscript under the header “Reciprocal effects of LTR5HS CRISPRa/CRISPRi on host gene expression.”</p><p>Additional deletion experiments for LTRs that are more distant to the misregulated genes identified and located downstream from the TSS:</p><p>The reviewers suggested that the three LTR5HS elements deleted in our original manuscript were all <italic>“in close proximity”</italic> to the associated genes and thus may not be enhancers. First, we would like to clarify that since these LTRs were respectively ~17 kb, ~2 kb and ~6 kb upstream from the promoter, they all fall under the definition of distal regulatory elements, typically defined as those that do not overlap with promoter sequences (usually contained within 200-500 bp of the TSS). Furthermore, two of the genes (<italic>SERPINB9</italic> and <italic>CACNA2D2</italic>) are transcribed in opposite orientation relative to the LTR5HS, making their LTR5HS-originating chimeric transcription unlikely. Nonetheless, we agree that since all deleted elements were upstream from the target genes, additional deletions were needed to further exclude a possibility that the LTR5HS elements function as alternative promoters. In the revised manuscript, we present analysis of clonal lines with homozygous deletions of three LTR5HS elements located downstream from the candidate target genes: (i) ~16 kb downstream of the <italic>ALPPL2</italic> gene TSS, (ii) ~245 kb downstream of the <italic>EPHA7</italic> gene TSS (as this gene is long, the deletion is 65 kb downstream of the annotated transcription termination site [TTS]) and (iii) ~69 kb downstream of the <italic>GDPD1</italic> gene TSS. In all three cases, we observed downregulation of the candidate target gene (see Figure 6B in the revised manuscript). Together with our previous results, we now show examples of deletions of LTR5HS elements located within a wide distance range from the target gene promoter (e.g. from 2 kb for the closest to 245 kb for the most distal), positioned either upstream or downstream from the gene TSS and transcribed in either direction with respect to the gene. In all cases, we observed downregulation of the candidate target gene (Figure 6B), providing definitive evidence that LTR5HS elements indeed function as enhancers.</p><p>We also want to clarify (since there may have been some confusion, see essential revision point 3), that these deletion experiments were all performed in WT NCCIT cells that do not express any dCas9 fusions. We believe that the confusion might have been caused by our inclusion of the genome browser images with dCas9 binding at these selected LTRs in the figure, and thus we eliminated those browser images and reorganized the figure to incorporate new data.</p><p>ChIP-PCR analysis of enhancer marks in the LTR5HS deletion lines:</p><p>We performed ChIP-qPCR for the histone modifications H3K27ac and H3K4me1 in homozygous deletion and wild type clones for three separate LTR5HS insertions: those near <italic>CACNA2D2, ALPPL2</italic>, and <italic>EPHA7</italic>. In each case, we observe loss of both H3K27ac and H3K4me1 from the LTR5HS flanking regions in the deletion lines (shown in Figure 6A of the revised manuscript), demonstrating that deposition of these enhancer marks is dependent on the presence of the LTR sequence. Furthermore, analysis of the H3K27ac at the target gene promoters revealed downregulation of promoter acetylation levels in LTR5HS deletion lines, though we note that this downregulation did not reach statistical significance at one of the genes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Analysis of chimeric transcripts between the LTR5HS elements and the upregulated genes: We analyzed deeply sequenced (~500 million 150 bp paired-end reads) RNA-seq data for the presence of the chimeric transcripts between LTR5HS and 275 LTR5HS-regulated genes identified in our study. We detected an appreciable level (e.g. &gt; 1 TPM, transcript per million) of chimeric transcription at only four of the 275 genes (specifically, <italic>NBPF12, SLC4A8, FA2H</italic> and <italic>TIMM50</italic>). Notably, of the six LTR5HS elements that we deleted, all showed effect on candidate target gene expression, but none had detectable levels of chimeric transcription between the LTR5HS and the regulated gene. We therefore conclude that while such chimeric transcripts may indeed arise at some loci, they cannot explain the regulatory effects observed in our study. This information has been incorporated into the manuscript under the header, “Reciprocal effects of LTR5HS CRISPRa/CRISPRi on host gene expression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should provide more information about the transcription factor and chromatin landscape of the LTR sequences. This could thus assess whether there is a pre-existing regulatory activity of individual LTR5HS elements in NCCIT cells that could influence the efficiency and outcomes of the CRISPRi/a assays.</p></disp-quote><p>To investigate the chromatin landscape of the LTR sequences, we performed ChIP-seq for H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K9me3. In addition to doing these experiments in the parental WT NCCIT line, we also performed these ChIPs in lines expressing dCas9-VPR and dCas9-KRAB along with the LTR5HS <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> CARGO array (i.e. under targeting conditions). This experimental design allows us to not only examine the landscape in unperturbed NCCITs, but also to measure the effects of VPR activation and KRAB repression on the chromatin states. Results from these experiments are presented in a new figure (Figure 3 in the revised manuscript, subsequent figures have been renamed accordingly).</p><p>Briefly, our results can be summarized as follows:</p><p>H3K27ac, H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 patterns</p><p>A subset of LTR5HS elements is marked by H3K27ac and H3K4me3 in WT cells in the absence of perturbation, with H3K4me3 showing asymmetric distribution consistent with the direction of the LTR-driven transcription, as has previously been observed at promoters and highly transcribed enhancers. Under CRISPRa conditions, most (over 90%) LTR5HS elements gain high level of H3K27 acetylation, but interestingly, H3K4me3 levels remain relatively unaffected. Strong gains of H3K27ac occur even at those LTR5HS elements that have low/no endogenous acetylation, which may indicate that ectopic enhancer activation is relatively common and efficient with dCas9-VPR system. Conversely, under CRISPRi conditions, endogenous H3K27ac and H3K4me3 are suppressed, and most LTR5HS elements become decorated with high levels of H3K9me3, as would be expected, given that KRAB repression is mediated by the H3K9me3 deposition (Figure 3). Notably, in WT NCCIT cells, LTR5HS elements typically lack H3K9me3, regardless of the presence or absence of the active marks, suggesting that in these cells LTR5HS escapes KRAB-mediated repression, a major mechanism of endogenous retrovirus silencing.</p><p>In addition to examining histone modifications at LTR5HS insertions, we also assessed H3K27ac, H3K4me3, and H3K9me3 patterns surrounding the promoters of the 275 LTR5HSregulated transcripts (i.e. the genes activated by CRISPRa and repressed by CRISPRi, as defined in Figure 4A). We found that most of these promoters have at least some H3K27ac and H3K4me3 in WT cells, and most gain or lose, respectively, H3K27 acetylation under CRISPRa or CRISPRi conditions (new Figure 5E). Notably, these changes occur in the absence of direct dCas9 binding to the promoters, suggesting that they result from the long-range effects we describe. Furthermore, although some gains of H3K9me3 can be observed in the vicinity of the promoters under CRISPRi conditions, most of the TSS remain unmethylated at H3K9 and, unlike at the LTRs, their H3K4me3 levels are relatively unaffected, suggesting that direct silencing of promoters via H3K9me3 spreading from a nearby LTR5HS is not likely to explain the transcriptional effects we examine in this study. As a control, we performed these same analyses on a set of 275 randomly selected promoters, and we detected no changes in any histone mark under CRISPRa or CRISPRi conditions (Figure 5—figure supplement 3).</p><p>dCas9 binding patterns</p><p>We also performed ChIP-seq for dCas9-VPR and dCas9-KRAB fusions (in addition to the dCas9-GFP ChIP-seq reported in the original manuscript), as suggested in minor point 9. This experiment shows no dCas9 signal in WT (non-dCas9-expressing cells), but widespread binding to over 90% of LTR5HS in dCas9-VPR- and dCas9-KRAB-expressing cells (Figure 3A in the revised manuscript). We further observed that the dCas9-VPR levels at LTR5HS were higher than dCas9-KRAB levels. This is likely attributable to the fact that VPR, a strong activation domain, recruits coactivators that promote nucleosomal depletion, whereas KRAB-mediated H3K9me3 facilitates chromatin compaction, which may in turn provide, respectively, positive or negative feedback for dCas9 fusion binding. Nonetheless, dCas9-KRAB still occupies and mediates H3K9me3 deposition at the vast majority of LTR5HS elements (Figure 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The repressive effects on neighbouring genes upon KRAB targeting is not clear (Figure 4B and supplementary figures). There are no statistics and the number of genes falling into different categories are not given; the effects on basal transciprition of CACNA2D2, NFKB2 and SERPINB9 upon deletion of the unique LTR is not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>A discussion of statistics in Figure 4B (now Figure 5B in revised manuscript) follows in point 4. As for the effects on basal transcription of <italic>CACNA2D2, NFKB2</italic>, and <italic>SERPINB9</italic> upon deletion of the nearest LTR5HS, this result was shown in the initial manuscript in Figure 5C (now Figure 6B in revised manuscript). Again, perhaps due to our inclusion of the genome browser images with dCas9 binding at these selected LTRs, it was not clear to the reviewers that these deletion experiments were all performed in WT NCCIT cells that do not express any dCas9 fusions. In any case, as discussed above, we now extended the analysis to the additional three elements and show the effect of deletion of six different LTR5HS on the basal transcript levels of their candidate target genes (Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statistics need to be checked and included in several of the figures including Figure 4 above. The distance analyses lack statistics: how many genes per 'distance' block were analysed? Are the changes in transcription statistically significant? How would this look with a negative control (e.g. another repeat)?</p></disp-quote><p>(Please note that Figure 4 from the initial submission is now Figure 5 in the revised manuscript.)</p><p>We analyzed a total of 26517 genes.

To further address the reviewer’s point, as a negative control we generated similar plots of fold change under CRISPRa and CRISPRi, using an unrelated LTR, in this case LTR2 of the HERVE family, which has a similar number (~900) of insertions as LTR5HS, but is not active in NCCIT cells.
