Oscillations also play an important role in normal physiological processes and serve distinct functional roles at different points in time. We characterised the effect of dopaminergic medication on oscillatory whole-brain networks in PD in a time-resolved manner by employing a hidden Markov model on combined STN local field potentials and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from 17 PD patients. Dopaminergic medication led to coherence within the medial and orbitofrontal cortex in the delta/theta frequency range. This is in line with known side effects of dopamine treatment such as deteriorated executive functions in PD. In addition, dopamine caused the beta band activity to switch from an STN-mediated motor network to a frontoparietal-mediated one. In contrast, dopamine did not modify local STN–STN coherence in PD. STN–STN synchrony emerged both on and off medication. By providing electrophysiological evidence for the differential effects of dopaminergic medication on the discovered networks, our findings open further avenues for electrical and pharmacological interventions in PD.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>whole-brain</kwd><kwd>time-resolved analysis</kwd><kwd>local field potential</kwd><kwd>magnetoencephalography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>89387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Florin</surname><given-names>Esther</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dopaminergic medication has differential effects on the discovered electrophysiological networks, which could be used to develop new electrical and pharmacological interventions in Parkinson’s disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Oscillatory activity serves crucial cognitive roles in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akam and Kullmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akam and Kullmann, 2014</xref>), and alterations of oscillatory activity have been linked to neurological and psychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schnitzler and Gross, 2005</xref>). Different large-scale brain networks operate with their own oscillatory fingerprint and carry out specific functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keitel and Gross, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mellem et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidaurre et al., 2018b</xref>). Given the dynamics of cognition, different brain networks need to be recruited and deployed flexibly. Hence, the duration for which a network is active, its overall temporal presence, and even the interval between the different activations of a specific network might provide a unique window to understanding brain functions. Crucially, alterations of these temporal properties or networks might be related to neurological disorders.</p><p>In Parkinson’s disease (PD), beta oscillations within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and motor cortex (13–30 Hz) correlate with the motor symptoms of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marreiros et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Wijk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">West et al., 2018</xref>). Beta oscillations also play a critical role in communication in a healthy brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engel and Fries, 2010</xref>). (For the purposes of our paper, we refer to oscillatory activity or oscillations as recurrent but transient frequency-specific patterns of network activity, even though the underlying patterns can be composed of either sustained rhythmic activity, neural bursting, or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quinn et al., 2019</xref>]. Disambiguating the exact nature of these patterns is, however, beyond the scope of this work.) At the cellular level, loss of nigral dopamine neurons in PD leads to widespread changes in brain networks, to varying degrees across different patients. Dopamine loss is managed in patients via dopaminergic medication. Dopamine is a widespread neuromodulator in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gershman and Uchida, 2019</xref>), raising the question of whether each medication-induced change restores physiological oscillatory networks. In particular, dopaminergic medication is known to produce cognitive side effects in PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Voon et al., 2009</xref>). According to the dopamine overdose hypothesis, a reason for these effects is the presence of excess dopamine in brain regions not affected in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacDonald and Monchi, 2011</xref>). Previous task-based and neuroimaging studies in PD demonstrated frontal cognitive impairment due to dopaminergic medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cools et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ray and Strafella, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Using resting-state whole-brain MEG analysis, network changes related to both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Olde Dubbelink et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olde Dubbelink et al., 2013b</xref>). However, these studies could not account for simultaneous STN–STN or cortico–STN activity affecting these networks, which would require combined MEG/electroencephalogram (EEG)–LFP recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Litvak et al., 2021</xref>). Such recordings are possible during the implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes, an accepted treatment in the later stages of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Volkmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deuschl et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kleiner-Fisman et al., 2006</xref>). Combined MEG–LFP studies in PD involving dopaminergic intervention report changes in beta and alpha band connectivity between specific cortical regions and the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Litvak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirschmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oswal et al., 2016</xref>). Decreased cortico–STN coherence under dopaminergic medication (ON) correlates with improved motor functions in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George et al., 2013</xref>). STN–STN intra-hemispheric oscillations positively correlate to motor symptom severity in PD without dopaminergic medication (OFF), whereas dopamine-dependent nonlinear phase relationships exist between inter-hemispheric STN–STN activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">West et al., 2016</xref>). Crucially, previous studies could not rule out the influence of cortico–STN connectivity on these inter-hemispheric STN–STN interactions.</p><p>To further characterise the differential effects of dopaminergic medication and delineate pathological versus physiological-relevant spectral connectivity in PD, we study PD brain activity via a hidden Markov model (HMM), a data-driven learning algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vidaurre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidaurre et al., 2018b</xref>). Due to the importance of cortico–subcortical interactions in PD, we investigated these interactions with combined spontaneous whole-brain magnetoencephalography (MEG) and STN local field potentials (LFPs) recordings from PD patients. We study whole-brain connectivity including the STN using spectral coherence as a proxy for communication based on the communication through coherence hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fries, 2015</xref>). This will allow us to delineate differences in communication OFF and ON medication. Furthermore, we extended previous work that was limited to investigating communication between specific pairs of brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Litvak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirschmann et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we identified the temporal properties of the networks both ON and OFF medication. The temporal properties provide an encompassing view of network alterations in PD and the effect of dopamine on these networks.</p><p>We found that cortico–cortical, cortico–STN, and STN–STN networks were differentially modulated by dopaminergic medication. For the cortico–cortical network, medication led to additional connections that can be linked to the side effects of dopamine. At the same time, dopamine changed the cortico–STN network towards a pattern more closely resembling physiological connectivity as reported in the PD literature. Within the third network, dopamine only had an influence on local STN–STN coherence. These results provide novel information on the oscillatory network connectivity occurring in PD and the differential changes caused by dopaminergic intervention. These whole-brain networks, along with their electrophysiological signatures, open up new potential targets for both electric and pharmacological interventions in PD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Under resting-state conditions in PD patients, we simultaneously recorded whole-brain MEG activity with LFPs from the STN using directional electrodes implanted for DBS. Using an HMM, we identified recurrent patterns of transient network connectivity between the cortex and the STN, which we henceforth refer to as an ‘HMM state’. In comparison to classic sliding window analysis, an HMM solution can be thought of as a data-driven estimation of time windows of variable length (within which a particular HMM state was active): once we know the time windows when a particular state is active, we compute coherence between different pairs of regions for each of these recurrent states. Each HMM state itself is a multidimensional, time-delay embedded (TDE) covariance matrix across the whole brain, containing information about cross-regional coherence and power in the frequency domain. Additionally, the temporal evolution of the HMM states was determined. The PD data were acquired under medication (L-DOPA) OFF and ON conditions, which allowed us to delineate the physiological versus pathological spatio-spectral and temporal changes observed in PD. To allow the system to dynamically evolve, we use time delay embedding. Theoretically, delay embedding can reveal the state space of the underlying dynamical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Packard et al., 1980</xref>). Thus, by delay-embedding PD time series OFF and ON medication, we uncover the differential effects of a neurotransmitter such as dopamine on underlying whole-brain connectivity. OFF medication, patients had on average a Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part III of 29.24 ± 10.74. This was reduced by L-DOPA (176.5 ± 56.2 mg) to 19.47 ± 8.52, indicating an improvement in motor symptoms.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spontaneous brain activity in PD can be resolved into distinct states</title><p>Using an HMM, we delineated cortico–subthalamic spectral changes from both global source-level cortical interactions as well as local STN–STN interactions. Three of the six HMM states could be attributed to physiologically interpretable connectivity patterns. We could not interpret the other three states within the current physiological frameworks both OFF and ON medication and they are therefore not considered in the following (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The connectivity between different brain regions for each state was visualised for the frequency modes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> show the connectivity patterns for the three physiologically meaningful states in both the OFF (top row) and ON medication condition (bottom row). We refer to the state obtained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as the cortico–cortical state (<italic>Ctx–Ctx</italic>). This state was characterised mostly by local coherence within segregated networks OFF medication in the alpha and beta band. In contrast, there was a widespread increase in coherence across the brain from OFF to ON medication. Therefore, ON medication, the connectivity strength in the alpha and beta band was not significantly different from the mean noise level. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> displays the second state. A large proportion of spectral connections in this state enable cortico–STN communication via spectral coherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lalo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Litvak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirschmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oswal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Wijk et al., 2016</xref>) and thus we labelled this as the cortico–STN state (<italic>Ctx–STN</italic>). This state was characterised by connectivity between multiple cortical regions and the STN OFF medication, but increased specificity of cortical–STN connectivity ON medication. Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows the third state. Within this state, highly synchronous STN–STN spectral connectivity emerged, both OFF and ON medication and therefore we named it the STN–STN state (<italic>STN–STN</italic>). The spectral characteristics of this state largely remain unaffected under the influence of dopaminergic medication. In the following sections, we describe these three states in detail.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Data-driven frequency modes.</title><p>Each plotted curve shows a different spectral band.

We identified three states exhibiting distinct coherence patterns ON and OFF medication: a cortico–cortical, a cortico–STN, and a STN–STN state. Our results indicate a tendency of neural activity to engage in connectivity patterns in which coherence decreases under the effect of dopaminergic medication and which maintain selective cortico–STN connectivity (Ctx–STN and STN–STN states). Only within the Ctx–Ctx state did coherence increase under dopaminergic medication. These results are in line with the multiple effects of dopaminergic medication reported in resting and task-based PD studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jubault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">West et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tinkhauser et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The differential effect of dopamine allowed us to delineate pathological and physiological spectral connectivity. The Ctx–Ctx state provided electrophysiological evidence in the delta/theta band for the overdose effect of dopaminergic medication in PD. Prior to the electrophysiological evidence in our study, there was only evidence through task-based or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cools et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ray and Strafella, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>). The Ctx–STN state revealed that simultaneous cortico–cortical and STN–STN interactions emerge ON medication, with spectrally and spatially specific cortico–STN interactions. In addition, ON medication, a frontoparietal motor network was present, indicating a shift from STN-mediated motor connectivity to a cortical one. These findings have not been reported in previous studies. The STN–STN state exhibited the limited ability of dopaminergic medication to modify local STN–STN delta oscillations. Our analysis also revealed significant changes in the temporal properties of the connectivity profiles, including lifetime and FO, under the effect of dopaminergic medication. This insight might in the future prove important for modifying medication as well as DBS-based strategies for therapeutic purposes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Increased tonic dopamine causes excessive frontal cortical activity</title><p>The Ctx–Ctx state showed significant coherent connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortical regions in the delta/theta band ON medication. According to the dopamine overdose hypothesis in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cools, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacDonald and Monchi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vaillancourt et al., 2013</xref>), the commonly used doses of dopaminergic medication to mitigate the motor symptoms cause the ventral frontostriatal cortical circuits to experience an excessive increase in tonic dopamine levels. This medication-induced increase is due to excessive compensation of dopamine in the ventral striatal circuitry, which experiences a lower loss of dopamine than its dorsal counterpart. The reason is that in PD dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra are primarily lost and therefore the dopamine depletion within the dorsal circuitry is higher than within the ventral one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kelly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacDonald and Monchi, 2011</xref>).

Increased frontal cortex connectivity potentially explains the cognitive deficits observed in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shohamy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George et al., 2013</xref>). Our detected emergence of frontal cortico–cortical coherence (between orbitofrontal and medial orbitofrontal regions) specifically in the delta/theta band could explain the cognitive deficits observed in PD due to dopaminergic medication, given the role of frontal delta/theta oscillations in cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harmony, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zavala et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A comparison of temporal properties of the Ctx–Ctx state OFF versus ON medication revealed that the interval between visits was significantly increased ON medication, while the FO of this state was significantly reduced. In fact, the FO of the Ctx–Ctx state was the lowest among the three states. The temporal results indicate that the Ctx–Ctx state is least visited. Neural activity ON medication is not likely to visit this state, but whenever it does, its visits are of the same duration as OFF medication. Hence, the Ctx–Ctx state’s presence could explain the cognitive side effects observed ON medication in PD.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Selective spectral connectivity remains preserved with increased dopamine levels</title><p>An interesting feature of the Ctx–STN state was the emergence of local STN–STN coherence in all three frequency modes. Bilateral STN–STN coherence in the alpha and beta band did not change in the Ctx–STN state ON versus OFF medication (InterMed analysis). However, STN–STN coherence was significantly higher than the mean level ON medication (IntraMed analysis). Since synchrony limits information transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cruz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cagnan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holt et al., 2019</xref>), the high coherence within the STN ON medication could prevent communication with the cortex. A different explanation would be that a loss of cortical afferents leads to increased local STN coherence. The causal nature of the cortico–basal ganglia interaction is an endeavour for future research.</p><p>Previous studies have reported STN–sensorimotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirschmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Litvak et al., 2011</xref>), STN–parietal, and STN–frontal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Litvak et al., 2011</xref>) coherence in the beta band OFF medication. Consistent with previous studies STN–sensorimotor, STN–parietal (inferior parietal), STN–frontal (insular cortex, pars orbitalis, pars opercularis, and lateral orbitofrontal), and STN–medial prefrontal (medial orbitofrontal) coherence emerged in the Ctx–STN state. In contrast, ON medication sensorimotor regions were coherent with parietal (para central) and frontal (superior frontal)/medial prefrontal (caudal middle frontal) regions in the beta frequency range. Previous research has not reported the emergence of such a coherent frontoparietal motor network ON medication. But consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirschmann et al., 2013</xref>), sensorimotor–STN coherence was reduced ON compared to OFF medication.</p><p>In addition, critical processing regarding sensorimotor decision-making involves frontoparietal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gertz and Fiehler, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Siegel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallivan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martínez-Vázquez and Gail, 2018</xref>). Hence, the emergence of frontoparietal connectivity with motor regions points towards the physiological relevance of the Ctx–STN state. Moreover, neural activity ON medication remained longer in the Ctx–STN state as the lifetime of this state significantly increased compared to OFF medication. The finding is in line with our hypothesis that a state showing physiologically relevant spectral connectivity lasts longer ON medication.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Tonic dopamine has a limited effect on local STN–STN interactions</title><p>In the Ctx–STN state, STN–STN coherence accompanied network changes affecting cortico–STN communication ON medication, thereby likely having a functional role. In contrast, in the STN–STN state, STN–STN coherence emerged without the presence of any significant cortico–STN coherence either OFF or ON medication. This may indicate that the observed STN–STN activity in the STN–STN state emerged due to local basal ganglia circuitry. No changes were observed in the alpha and beta band in the STN–STN state ON versus OFF medication, which may indicate the inability of tonic dopamine to modify basal ganglia circuit activity. These results provide more evidence that the changes in STN–STN coherence observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Little et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oswal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shimamoto et al., 2013</xref>) reflect cortical interaction affecting STN activity. Future studies should analyse changes occurring within the STN. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to uncover modulation of STN–STN delta/theta oscillations by dopaminergic medication. Studies have shown that local basal ganglia delta oscillations, which do not require input from the motor cortex, are robust biomarkers of dopamine depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Whalen et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, selective elimination of delta/theta oscillations under dopaminergic medication in the STN–STN state points towards restoration of physiologically relevant network activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>In the present study, we employed a data-driven approach based on an HMM. In order to find the appropriate model, we had to specify the number of states a priori. We selected the number of HMM states based on a compromise between spectral quality of results and their redundancy. The number of states could also be determined by selecting the one with the highest negative free energy. However, model selection based on free energy often does not yield concrete results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2014</xref>). Another limitation is the use of multivariate Gaussian distributions to characterise the state covariance matrices. Although it improves the tractability of the HMM estimation process, it is by construction unable to capture higher-order statistics of the data beyond the first two moments. For example, burst activity might also be a relevant property of brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Florin et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, we would like to note that the HMM was used as a data-driven, descriptive approach without explicitly assuming any a priori relationship with pathological or physiological states. The relation between biology and the HMM states, thus, purely emerged from the data; that is, is empirical. What we claim in this work is simply that the features captured by the HMM hold some relation with the physiology even though the estimation of the HMM was completely unsupervised (i.e., blind to the studied conditions).</p><p>Besides these limitations inherent in the analysis approach, there are also some related to the experimental design. As this is a study containing invasive LFP recordings, we can never have a healthy control group. In addition, we only recorded four female patients because during the study period fewer female patients underwent a DBS surgery at our centre. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous literature reporting a sex difference in MEG markers or the prescribed dopaminergic medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Umeh et al., 2014</xref>). The medication led to a marked motor improvement in these patients based on the UPDRS, but the patients still have impairments. Both motor impairment and motor improvement can cause movement during the resting state in PD. While such movement is a deviation from a resting state in healthy subjects, such movements are part of the disease and occur unwillingly. Therefore, such movements can arguably be considered part of the resting state of PD. None of the patients in our cohort experienced hyperkinesia during the recording. All patients except for two were of the akinetic-rigid subtype. We verified that tremor movement is not driving our results. Recalculating the HMM states without these two subjects, even though it slightly changed some particular aspects of the HMM solution, did not materially affect the conclusions. A further potential influencing factor might be the disease duration and the amount of dopamine patients are receiving. Both factors were not significantly related to the temporal properties of the states.</p><p>To differentiate pathological and physiological network activity, we had to rely on the temporal properties of the networks. A further limitation was that all our recordings were made under resting conditions, preventing us from discerning the functional role of oscillations within the discovered networks. We opted for the current design because resting-state data allows the study of networks independent of a task and because using a specific task bears the risk that the patients are not able to properly perform it. Nevertheless, future studies should analyse the behaviour of specific networks using tasks to probe them.</p><p>Lastly, we recorded LFPs from within the STN – an established recording procedure during the implantation of DBS electrodes in various neurological and psychiatric diseases. Although for Parkinson patients results on beta and tremor activity within the STN have been reproduced by different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Litvak et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Florin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirschmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neumann et al., 2016</xref>), it is still not fully clear whether these LFP signals are contaminated by volume-conducted cortical activity. However, while volume conduction seems to be a larger problem in rodents even after re-referencing the LFP signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lalla et al., 2017</xref>), the same was not found in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marmor et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, we used directional contacts, which have a smaller surface area than the classical ring contacts. Based on the available literature, our sampling rate was high enough to resolve oscillatory activity in the STN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Telkes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using a data-driven machine learning approach, we identified three distinct networks (states) that captured differential effects of dopaminergic medication on spectral connectivity in PD. Our findings uncovered a Ctx–Ctx state that captured the potentially adverse effects of increased dopamine levels due to dopaminergic medication. Furthermore, a Ctx–STN state was identified that maintained spatio-spectrally selective cortico–STN connectivity ON medication. We also found an STN–STN coherent state, pointing towards the limited effect of dopaminergic medication to modify local basal ganglia activity. Our findings bring forth a dynamical systems perspective for differentiating pathological versus physiologically relevant spectral connectivity in PD. Furthermore, we were able to uncover differential changes induced by altered levels of a neuromodulator such as dopamine in a completely data-driven manner without providing detailed information about large-scale dopaminergic networks to the HMM. This shows another advantage of our dynamical systems-level approach. Furthermore, our whole-brain STN approach provides novel electrophysiological evidence of distributed changes due to dopaminergic medication in brain connectivity, extending previous pairwise connectivity results reported in PD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>In total, 17 (4 female) right-handed PD patients (age: 55.2 ± 9.3 years) undergoing surgery for therapeutic STN DBS were recruited for this study. Patients had been selected for DBS treatment according to the guidelines of the German Society for Neurology. The experimental procedure was explained to all participants and they gave written consent. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (study number 5608R) and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Bilateral DBS electrodes were implanted in the dorsal part of the STN at the Department of Functional Neurosurgery and Stereotaxy in Düsseldorf. The implanted DBS electrodes used were the St. Jude Medical directional lead 6172 (Abbott Laboratories, Lake Bluff, IL) and in one case the Boston Scientific Vercise segmented lead (Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, MA). These electrodes have four contact heights and the two middle heights are segmented into three equally spaced contacts.</p><p>The DBS leads were externalised and we measured the patients after 1–3 days. To simultaneously acquire MEG and LFP signals, we connected the externalised leads to an EEG amplifier integrated with the MEG system. We used a whole-head MEG system with 306 channels (Elekta Vectorview, Elekta Neuromag, Finland) housed within a magnetically shielded chamber. All patients were requested to sit still and awake during data acquisition. To ensure that patients did not fall asleep, we tracked patients’ pupil diameter with an eye tracker. To remove eye blink and cardiac artefacts, electrooculography and electrocardiography were recorded along with the LFP and MEG signals. In order to co-register the MEG recording with the individual MRI, four head position indicator coils were placed on the patient’s head. Their position as well as additional head points were digitised using the Polhemus Isotrack system (Polhemus, Colchester, CT). The data were recorded with a sampling rate of 2400 Hz and a low-pass filter of 800 Hz was applied. An electrode was placed at the mastoid and all LFP signals were referenced to it.</p><p>For the clinical OFF medication state, oral PD medication was withdrawn overnight for at least 12 hr. If a patient had an apomorphine pump, this pump was stopped at least 1 hr before the measurement. First, we recorded resting-state activity in the medication OFF condition. The patients were then given their morning dose of L-DOPA in the form of fast-acting levodopa. Data were acquired in three runs of 10 min, for a total of 30 min for each medication condition. We started the ON medication measurement at least half an hour after the administration of the dose and after clinical improvement was seen. The same procedure as for the OFF medication state was followed for the ON medication measurement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Pre-processing</title><p>All data processing and analyses were performed using Matlab (version R 2016b; Math Works, Natick, MA).

To ensure artefact-free data, two people independently inspected the data visually, cleaned artefacts, and compared the cleaning output. The final cleaned data included changes agreed upon by both the people involved in cleaning. The Neuromag system provides signal-space projection (SSP) vectors for the cleaning of external artefacts from the MEG channels, which were applied. The line noise was removed from all channels with a notch filter at 50, 100, 150, …, 550, and 600 Hz with a 3 dB bandwidth of 1 Hz. The LFP recordings from the DBS electrode were re-referenced against the mean of all LFP channels. Very noisy and flat MEG/LFP channels were excluded from further analysis. Time segments containing artefacts were removed from the time series. However, if artefacts regularly occurred only in one single channel, this whole channel was removed instead. Frequently arising artefacts following the same basic pattern, such as eye blinks or cardiac artefacts, were removed via SSP. All data were high-pass filtered with 1 Hz to remove movement-related low-frequency artefacts. Finally, the data were down-sampled to 1000 Hz.</p><p>Source estimation was performed on these recordings at an individual level using each individual’s anatomy. Therefore, using Freesurfer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</ext-link>, v.5.3.0), the individual cortical surfaces were extracted from the individual T1-weighted MRI scans (3T scanner and 1 mm³ voxel size). We used the overlapping spheres method with 306 spheres for the forward model. As the inverse model, we used a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer. The data covariance matrix for the LCMV beamformer was computed directly from each 10 min recording. The data covariance was regularised using the median eigenvalue of the data covariance matrix. The noise covariance was obtained from an empty room recording on the same day as the actual measurement.</p><p>For each subject, the invasive entry point of the STN was identified based on intraoperative microelectrode recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gross et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moran et al., 2006</xref>). Subsequently, the first recording height after the entry into the STN was selected to obtain the three directional LFP recordings from the respective hemisphere. In addition, we visualised the location of all electrodes using lead-DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horn et al., 2019</xref>). All electrodes were properly placed within the STN – except for one (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To exclude that our results were driven by outlier, we reanalysed our data without this patient. No qualitative change in the overall connectivity pattern was observed.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode location for all subjects.</title><p>Lead-DBS reconstruction with all subjects. The red leads are the ones of a subject with one of the outside the STN.

We used the Mindboggle atlas to spatially reduce the data dimensions. For each of the 42 cortical regions in the atlas, a multidimensional time series consisting of the vertices within that anatomical region was extracted. To reduce the multivariate times series for each region to a single one, we employed the first principal component explaining the highest variance share in each region. The first principal component row vectors from all 42 anatomical regions were stacked into a MEG cortical time series matrix. To correct for volume conduction in the signal, symmetric orthogonalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colclough et al., 2015</xref>) was applied to each subject’s resulting MEG cortical time series matrix. The row vectors of this orthogonalised matrix and the six LFPs (three each for left and right STN) were z-scored. Subsequently, they were stacked into one multidimensional time series (N by T) matrix. Here, N = 48 is the total number of nodes/regions (42 regions from the cortex and 6 LFP electrode contacts) and T denotes the length of the time dimension. This 48 by T data matrix obtained from each subject was concatenated along the temporal dimension across all subjects for each specific medication condition. Finally, to resolve sign ambiguity inherent in source-reconstructed MEG data as well as resolve polarity of LFP channels across subjects, a sign-flip correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vidaurre et al., 2016</xref>) procedure was applied to this final 48 by (T by number of subjects) dataset within a medication condition. The pre-processing steps were performed for OFF and ON medication separately.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>HMM analysis</title><p>The HMM is a data-driven probabilistic algorithm which finds recurrent network patterns in multivariate time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vidaurre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vidaurre et al., 2018a</xref>). Each network pattern is referred to as a ‘state’ in the HMM framework, such that these networks can activate or deactivate at various points in time. Here onwards, ‘state’ or ‘network’ is used interchangeably. We used a specific variety of the HMM, the TDE-HMM, where whole-brain networks are defined in terms of both spectral power and phase coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidaurre et al., 2018b</xref>). Hence, for every time point, the HMM algorithm provided the probability that a network is active. Here onwards, a contiguous block of time for which the probability of a particular network being active remained higher than all the other networks is referred to as a ‘state visit’. Hence, the HMM produced temporally resolved spatial networks for the underlying time series. In our approach, we also performed spectral analyses of these state visits, leading to a complete spatio-spectral connectivity profile across the cortex and the STN. By applying the HMM analysis to the combined MEG–LFP dataset, we were able to temporally, spatially, and spectrally separate cortico–cortical, cortico–STN, and STN–STN networks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Estimation of the HMM</title><p>Since we were interested in recovering phase-related networks, the TDE-HMM was fit directly on the time series obtained after pre-processing steps described previously, as opposed to its power envelope. This preserved the cross-covariance within and across the underlying raw time series of the cortical regions and the STN. The model estimation finds recurrent patterns of covariance between regions (42 cortical regions and 6 STN contacts) and segregates them into ‘states’ or ‘networks’. Based on these covariance patterns, for each state, the power spectra of each cortical region and the coherence amongst regions can be extracted.</p><p>We opted for six different states as a reasonable trade-off between the spectral quality of the results and their redundancy. The HMM-MAR toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vidaurre et al., 2016</xref>) was used for fitting the TDE-HMM. We employed the TDE version of the HMM where the embedding took place in a 60 ms window (i.e., a 15 time point window for a sampling frequency of 250 Hz). Since time embedding would increase the number of rows of the data from 48 to 48 times the window length (also referred to as number of lags), an additional PCA (principal component analysis) (reduction across 48 by number of lags) step was performed after time embedding. The number of components retained was 96 (48 × 2). This approach follows <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidaurre et al., 2018b</xref>. To characterise each state, a full covariance matrix with an inverse Wishart prior was used. The diagonal of the prior for the transition probability matrix was set as 10. To ensure that the mean of the time series did not take part in driving the states, the ‘zero mean’ option in HMM toolbox was set to 1. To speed up the process of fitting, we used the stochastic version of variational inference for the HMM. In order to start the optimisation process, the ‘HMM-MAR’-type initialisation was used (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vidaurre et al., 2016</xref>). The HMM was fit separately OFF and ON medication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analysis of the states</title><p>After the six states were obtained for HMM OFF and HMM ON medication, these states were statistically compared within each medication condition as well as between medication conditions. In addition, the temporal properties of these states were compared.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Intra-medication analysis</title><p>We investigated the spectral connectivity patterns across the different states within a medication condition (intra-medication or IntraMed). The objective was to uncover significant coherent connectivity standing out from the background within each frequency band (delta/theta [1–8 Hz], alpha [8–12 Hz], and beta [13–30 Hz]) in the respective states. The HMM output included the state time courses (i.e., when the states activated) for the entire concatenated data time series. The state time courses allowed the extraction of state- and subject-specific data for further state- and subject-level analysis. For each HMM state, we filtered the state-specific data for all the subjects between 1 and 45 Hz. (For state-wise data extraction, please refer the HMM toolbox wiki [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR/wiki/User-Guide">https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR/wiki/User-Guide</ext-link>].) Then we calculated the Fourier transform of the data using a multitaper approach to extract the frequency components from the short segments of each state visit. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidaurre et al., 2018b</xref> for discussion on multitaper for short time data segments.) Seven Slepian tapers with a time–bandwidth product of 4 were used, resulting in a frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz and therefore binned frequency domain values. Subsequently, we calculated the coherence and power spectral density of this binned (frequency bins obtained during the multitaper step) data for every subject and every state. The coherence and the power spectral density obtained were three-dimensional matrices of size f (number of frequency bins) by N (42 cortical locations + 6 STN contacts) by N.</p><p>Based on the coherence matrices, we performed a frequency band-specific analysis. Canonical definitions of frequency bands assign equal weight to each frequency bin within a band for every subject. This might not be suitable when considering analyses of brain signals across a large dataset. For example, the beta peak varies between individual subjects. Assigning the same weight to each bin in the beta range might reduce the beta effect at the group level. To allow for inter-subject variability in each frequency bin’s contribution to a frequency band, we determined the frequency modes in a data-driven manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidaurre et al., 2018b</xref>). Because we focused on interactions that are important to establish the STN–cortex communication, the identification of the relevant frequency modes was restricted to the cross-coherence between the STN–LFPs and cortical signals; in other words, the block matrix consisting of rows 1–6 (STN) and columns 7–48 (cortex). For each subject, this extracted submatrix was then vectorised across columns. This gave us a (number of frequency bins by 252 [6 STN locations by 42 cortical locations]) matrix for each state. For every subject, this matrix was concatenated along the spatial dimension across all states producing a (number of frequency bins by [252 by 6 (number of states)]) matrix. We called this the subject-level coherence matrix. We averaged these matrices across all subjects along the spectral dimension (number of frequency bins) to yield a (number of frequency bins by [252 by 6]) group-level coherence matrix. We factorised the group-level coherence matrix into four frequency modes using a non-negative matrix factorisation (NNMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Seung, 2001</xref>). Each of the resulting four frequency modes obtained was of size (one by number of frequency bins). The values of frequency modes are the actual NNMF weights obtained from the NNMF estimation (which, just like a regression coefficient, are unit-less, because coherence is unit-less). Three of them resembled the canonical delta/theta (delta and theta frequencies were combined into one band), alpha, and beta bands whereas the last one represented noise. Since NNMF does not guarantee a unique solution, we performed multiple instances of the factorisation. In practice we could obtain frequency modes, which showed correspondence to the classical frequency bands, within four iterations of the algorithm. At each instance, we visualised the output to ensure frequency specificity of the frequency modes. The stability of the output was ensured by using ‘robust NNMF’, which is a variant of the NNMF algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidaurre et al., 2018b</xref>). While these frequency modes were derived in fact from coherence measures (as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vidaurre et al., 2018a</xref>), they can be applied to power measures or any other frequency-specific measure. We then computed the inner product between the subject- and group-level coherence matrix and the frequency modes obtained above. We called these the subject-level and group-level projection results, respectively.</p><p>To separate background noise from the strongest coherent connections, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) approach was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vidaurre et al., 2018b</xref>). For the group-level projection results, we normalised the activity in each state for each spectral band by subtracting the mean coherence within each frequency mode across all states. As a prior for the mixture model, we used two single-dimensional Gaussian distributions with unit variance: one mixture component to capture noise and the other to capture the significant connections. This GMM with two mixtures was applied to the coherence values (absolute value) of each state. Connections were considered significant if their p-value after correction for multiple comparisons was smaller than 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Inter-medication analysis</title><p>To test for differences in coherence across medication conditions (inter-medication or InterMed), the first step was to objectively establish a comparison between the states found in the two HMMs fit separately for each condition. There is no a priori reason for the states detected in each condition to resemble each other. To find OFF and ON medication states that may resemble each other, we calculated the Riemannian distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Förstner and Moonen, 2003</xref>) between the state covariance matrices of the OFF and ON HMM. This yielded an OFF states by ON states (6 × 6) distance matrix. Subsequently, finding the appropriately matched OFF and ON states reduced to a standard linear assignment problem. We found an ON state counterpart to each OFF state by minimising the total sum of distances using the Munkres linear assignment algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vidaurre et al., 2018a</xref>). This approach yielded a one-to-one pairing of OFF and ON medication states, and all further analysis was conducted on these pairs. For ease of reading, we gave each pair its own label. For example, when we refer to a ‘Ctx–STN’ state in the following sections, then such a state was discovered OFF medication and its corresponding state ON medication is its distance-matched partner. In subsequent sections, all mentions of ON or OFF medication refer to these state pairs unless mentioned otherwise.</p><p>We used the subject-level projection results obtained during IntraMed analysis to perform InterMed analyses. We performed two-sided independent sample t-tests between the matched states to compare the coherence, which was calculated between different regions of interest (see Dataset preparation). We grouped individual atlas regions into canonical cortical regions like frontal, sensorimotor, parietal, visual, medial PFC (prefrontal cortex), and STN contacts. For example, in the beta band, STN (contacts)–sensorimotor coherence in the OFF condition was compared to the STN (contacts)–sensorimotor coherence in the ON condition. The p-values obtained were corrected for multiple comparisons for a total number of possible combinations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Temporal properties of HMM states</title><p>To test for changes in the temporal properties OFF versus ON medication, we compared the lifetimes, interval between visits, and FO for each state both within and across HMMs using two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by post hoc tests. Lifetime/dwell time of a state refers to the time spent by the neural activity in that state. Interval of visit was defined as the time between successive visits of the same state. Finally, the FO of a state was defined as the fraction of time spent in each state. Extremely short state visits might not reflect neural processes, hence we only used values that were greater than 100 ms for lifetime comparisons.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>EF gratefully acknowledges support by the Volkswagen Foundation (Lichtenberg program 89387).

However, the raw data cannot be made publicly available due to the European and German data privacy laws. When signing the informed consent forms, our patients consented to using their data for research purposes, but they did not sign a form stating that their data can be shared publicly, even in anonymized form. In addition, the MRIs of their heads and brains might make them identifiable. Hence, posting them within a public repository is not possible. The raw data can be requested from the corresponding author for replication of the current results and will then be shared in an anonymized way. We are providing the intermediate Matlab data underlying the figures with our submission.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation

A key feature is the combined use of invasive and noninvasive recordings and to investigate network changes by employing a hidden markov model. They identified three physiologically interpretable spectral connectivity patterns and found that cortico-cortical, cortico-STN, and STN-STN networks were differentially modulated by dopaminergic medication. These findings provide new insights regarding the mechanisms by which dopamine and medications alter cortico-basal ganglia dynamics, and open up new directions for studying their functions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Differential dopaminergic modulation of spontaneous cortico-subthalamic activity in Parkinson's disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kelly Bijanki (Reviewer #1); Muthuraman Muthuraman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. I believe one strong concern is the first one raised by reviewer #1 in that it is important to differentiate neural activity differences in the ON medication state in whether they may originate from the effects of dopamine on the brain or the fact that the patients are moving more. Is there any possibility to address this issue? E.g. were motion parameters analysed to some degree? Does archival data exist that could be used to differentiate states at rest vs. states with movement (e.g. finger tapping)? If not this limitation should be prominently discussed.</p><p>2. While I personally think the concern of rev. 3 with contamination of STN signals by EEG is not of major concern (and the method has been established with reproducible results e.g. based on the Litvak / Hirschmann / Neumann works). Still, electrode localization could help to at least assure all leads were properly placed (or if not results would remain stable if the ones outside STN would be discarded)</p><p>3. I agree with rev. #2 that presentation can be improved. While circular connection plots are informative, it could be helpful to see to results in Figures 2-4 mapped to a brain (or sensor space). In general, I think the Results section could be stratified and presentation optimized.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below is a list of concerns upon reviewing the manuscript, with suggestions for improvement.</p><p>1. The style of writing in the introduction is a little light on examination of the prior literature and motivation for the study. Starting at line 79, it transitions into a preview of the methods section listing of the analyses the researchers undertook and less like a true introduction setting the scene for the experiments.</p><p>2. This reviewer was surprised by the use of the word &quot;communication&quot;, communication state, comms, etc. Perhaps this is a term of art in MEG (not this reviewer's area of expertise) but defining an MEG feature as indicative of communication seems presumptuous and merits at least brief discussion in the manuscript. Please add more background on MEG analysis and interpretation, especially in PD, in the introduction section.</p><p>3. This reviewer was unclear on why increased &quot;communication&quot; in the medial OFC in δ and theta was interpreted as a pathological state indicating deteriorated frontal executive function. Given that the authors provide no evidence of poor executive function in the patients studied, the authors must at least provide evidence from other studies linking this feature with impaired executive function.</p><p>4. Authors further reported that increased DA (L-DOPA administration) caused β activity to switch from STN-mediated motor network to a frontoparietal mediated one. The authors provide somewhat impoverished anatomical detail about the differences between the observed STN-mediated motor network and the known pathological β activity in STN in PD.</p><p>5. Last, authors report that DA didn't modify locally-originating STN oscillations in PD, but the detail on how they define locally-originating is unclear.</p><p>6. On line 86 the authors identify prior research limited by its investigation of specific connectivity pairs, whereas on line 104 the authors report on connectivity pairs in the current study.</p><p>7. The authors use the term &quot;oscillations&quot; without properly defining it in terms of neural activity and they have not addressed the analytical approach they use to confirm the activity measured on LFP or MEG reflects oscillatory activity vs. bursting activity or other neural activity types.</p><p>8. Authors need to acknowledge the role of DBS in PD therapy earlier in the study and identify that as the means by which they have access to simultaneous LFP recording. They don't even define the acronym &quot;DBS&quot; at its first use.</p><p>9. Authors could be more clear in lines 90-97 to define what they mean by &quot;disruptive, &quot;physiologically restorative&quot;, and &quot;limited&quot;.</p><p>10. Authors repeatedly state their method allows them to delineate between pathological and physiological connectivity, but they don't explain how dynamical systems and discrete-state stochasticity support that goal. Lines 106 and 111.</p><p>11. Authors must address differences in neural activity other than DA-mediated changes in the on and off medication state. For example, when patients are off med, their UPDRS scores are elevated – do they not have movements that would pick up extra activations in MEG during &quot;rest&quot;? Is it possible to do a true &quot;resting state&quot; in active PD? At minimum, this concern must be discussed in the manuscript.</p><p>12. Figure 1: this reviewer would like to see the Y axis indicating amplitude or power, rather than arbitrary units from NNMF output. This figure also begs the question why the NMMF categorized 10-20hz oscillations as δ/theta (bump in blue line in &quot;ON medication&quot; and above 30Hz as α (red line, same plot)). To this reviewer, it appears as though the NMMF factorization worked effectively in the &quot;OFF medication&quot; data set but failed in the &quot;ON medication&quot; data set.</p><p>13. Patient sample appears to under-represent female patients. Is there a relationship between sex and DA metabolism/uptake/MEG markers? Perhaps simply acknowledge the imbalance in the manuscript.</p><p>14. LFP recordings were sampled from externalized DBS leads using the St. Jude directional 6172 lead except in one patient who had the Boston Scientific leads (which I think is fine to include in analysis together provided surface areas of contacts are identical). The geometry of the segmented leads needs to be addressed relative to sensitivity for various frequencies of oscillatory activity. Segmented leads have very low surface area and may require ultra-high sampling rates (30 kHz and higher) to resolve oscillatory activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General remarks:</p><p>1. A visualization of the state time series would be a nice addition to see the dynamics of the network. Including the probabilities would further give an impression of &quot;how clear the states are&quot;, i.e. were they exclusive or were there some intervals where 2 states were rather active at the same time.</p><p>2. The color coding in table 1 (4x orange) does not correspond to the ring figures (2x orange/hemisphere). Both areas 17 and 18 are termed &quot;medial orbitofrontal&quot;.</p><p>Results</p><p>As stated in the public review, there are several points concerning the presentation of the results:</p><p>3. Line 180 Supporting the dopamine overdose hypothesis in PD, we identified a δ/theta oscillatory network involving lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortical regions.</p><p>– Figure 2 also shows the inter-hemispheric connectivity of the pars orbitalis. What is the reason to not mention this in the main text?</p><p>4. Line 259: Furthermore, ON medication in the α band only the connectivity between temporal and parietal cortical regions and the STN was preserved (Figure 3C α; p &lt; 0.05), consistent with previous findings (Litvak et al. 2011). In contrast, in the β band only STN-medial orbitofrontal connectivity remained intact (p &lt; 0.05, Figure 3C β).</p><p>– Similar to the comment on line 180, the figure also shows α connectivity between the STN and medial orbitofrontal cortex.</p><p>5. Line 269: Finally, ON medication, a sensorimotor-frontoparietal network emerged (p &lt; 0.05, Figure 3C β) where sensorimotor, frontal, and parietal regions were no longer connected to the STN, but instead directly communicated with each other in the β band.</p><p>– Similar to the comment on line 180: is there a reason to exclude the connection from the somatomotor cortex to the caudal middle frontal (e.g. figure 3c, β: 13r-16r)?</p><p>6. 256: Importantly, coherence OFF medication was significantly larger than ON medication between STN and sensorimotor, STN and temporal and STN and frontal cortices (p &lt; 0.05 for all connections, Figure 3B α and β).</p><p>– The figure does not these results for STN and sensorimotor cortex</p><p>7. 263: Most previous PD studies report a decrease in the motor-STN coherence ON medication in the β band (Hammond, Bergman, and Brown 2007; Litvak et al. 2011; Hirschmann et al. 2013; Little et al. 2013; Marinelli et al. 2017) but do not indicate any changes that the sensorimotor regions might experience at the whole-brain level. In the communication state, OFF medication, STN-pre-motor (sensory), STN-frontal, and STN-parietal connectivity was present (p &lt; 0.05, Figure 3A α and β). STN-cortical coherence was then significantly reduced ON compared to OFF medication (p &lt; 0.05, Figure 3B α and β).</p><p>– The first sentence introduces cortico-cortical connections, which is then, however, followed by STN-cortical results. This is then followed by results on the sensorimotor-frontoparietal network, which indeed is cortico-cortical. However, later in the manuscript, the following statement suggests that the cortico-cortical network differs from the sensorimotor-frontoparietal network: &quot;Still, significant connectivity was selectively preserved in a spectrally-specific manner ON medication both at the corticocortical level and the cortical-STN level. Furthermore, a sensorimotor-frontoparietal network emerged ON medication&quot; (line282). It is not clear what exactly resembles the cortico-cortical network, and where the results are presented.</p><p>On the results of temporal properties:</p><p>8. Line 324: Previous research has shown that ON medication, spectrally-specific cortico-STN connectivity remains preserved in PD compared to OFF medication (Litvak et al. 2011; Hirschmann et al. 2013). This indicates the existence of functionally relevant cortico-STN loops. A decrease in coherence between the cortex and the STN has also been observed ON medication (George et al. 2013), which was correlated with improved motor functions in PD. All the connectivity effects were observed in our results for the communication state. Furthermore, in the communication state, we showed the existence of a frontoparietal sensorimotor 331 network in the β band ON medication. Recent evidence indicates that with the loss of dopamine and the start of PD symptoms, δ/theta oscillations emerge within the basal ganglia (Whalen et al. 2020). In line with these findings, STN-STN δ/theta oscillations in the local state were reduced ON medication.</p><p>– I have the impression that this paragraph is not in the right position. It repeats and even discusses the previously mentioned results and jumps from &quot;frontoparietal sensorimotor networks&quot; to &quot;STN-STN δ/theta&quot; findings.</p><p>Further, it is not clear if &quot;All the connectivity effects were observed in our results for the communication state&quot; relates to the citations above, especially since other states are shown to have effects on connectivity as well.</p><p>9. Additionally, the main text should provide t-scores and degrees of freedom, not only p-values. The comprehension of the results could be improved by displaying significantly different comparisons in a clear way in Figure 5 (e.g. provide * for p&lt;0.05). However, what was the rationale for testing the medication condition and states with different t-tests? Would a 2way- repeated measures ANOVA not be more appropriate?</p><p>10. Line 353: The lifetimes for both the local and communication state were significantly increased by medication (ON &gt; OFF: local, p &lt; 0.01; comms, p {less than or equal to} 0.01).</p><p>and line 360: Both the local and communication state tended to last longer ON medication.</p><p>– This seems to be a repetition. Also, it is not clear what &quot;tended to last longer&quot; means? Is there a significant difference or a trend?</p><p>Methods</p><p>11.

According to this analysis, one patient was tremor-dominant and one of mixed type.

OFF medication results for the Ctx-Ctx and STN-STN state remained the same as well.

We have reconstructed the electrode location with Lead-DBS (Horn et al., 2019). All electrodes were properly placed within the STN – except for one (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref> and Figure 7 in the manuscript).

Although for Parkinson patients results on β and tremor activity within the STN have been reproduced by different groups (Reck et al., 2010, Litvak et al., 2011, Florin et al., 2013, Hirschmann et al., 2013, Neumann et al., 2016), it is still not fully clear whether these LFP signals are contaminated by volume-conducted cortical activity.

In particular, dopaminergic medication is known to produce cognitive side effects in PD patients (Voon et al., 2009). According to the dopamine overdose hypothesis, a reason for these effects is the presence of excess dopamine in brain regions not affected in PD (MacDonald et al., 2011; MacDonald and Monchi, 2011). Previous task-based and neuroimaging studies in PD demonstrated frontal cognitive impairment due to dopaminergic medication (Cools et al., 2002; Ray and Strafella, 2010; MacDonald et al., 2011).</p><p>Using resting-state whole-brain MEG analysis, network changes related to both motor and non-motor symptoms of PD have been described (Olde Dubbelink et al., 2013a, b). However, these studies could not account for simultaneous STN-STN or cortico–STN activity affecting these networks, which would require combined MEG/EEG–LFP recordings (Litvak et al., 2021). Such recordings are possible during the implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes, an accepted treatment in the later stages of PD (Volkmann et al., 2004; Deuschl et al., 2006, Kleiner-Fisman et al., 2006). Combined MEG-LFP studies in PD involving dopaminergic intervention report changes in β and α band connectivity between specific cortical regions and the STN (Litvak et al., 2011; Hirschmann et al., 2013; Oswal et al., 2016). Decreased cortex-STN coherence under dopaminergic medication (ON) correlates with improved motor functions in PD (George et al., 2013). STN–STN intra-hemispheric oscillations positively correlate to motor symptom severity in PD without dopaminergic medication (OFF), whereas dopamine-dependent nonlinear phase relationships exist between inter-hemispheric STN–STN activity (West et al., 2016). Crucially, previous studies could not rule out the influence of cortico–STN connectivity on these inter-hemispheric STN–STN interactions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The terminology was based on the communication through coherence (CTC) hypothesis (Fries, 2005, 2015), but we think the new label is more descriptive. More background on MEG analysis in PD has been added to the manuscript (see previous reply).

We have elaborated upon the dopamine overdose hypothesis in the discussion on page 10. In short, dopaminergic neurons are primarily lost from the substantia nigra in PD, which causes a higher dopamine depletion in the dorsal striatal circuitry than within the ventral striatal circuits (Kelly et al., 2009; MacDonald and Monchi, 2011). Thus, dopaminergic medication to treat the PD motor symptoms leads to increased dopamine levels in the ventral striatal circuits including frontal cortical activity, which can potentially explain the cognitive deficits observed in PD (Shohamy et al., 2005; George et al., 2013).

Because only STN-STN coherence/connectivity is altered under medication in the “local state”, we termed this state “local state”. But we agree the term is confusing and changed it to “STN-STN state”. Unfortunately, identifying whether the STN oscillations are indeed originating locally within basal ganglia circuits would require a higher coverage of invasive recording locations as well as intracellular recordings.

Each HMM state can subsequently be analysed in a spectrally-specific manner. To eliminate this seemingly contradictory statement we changed this sentence to (page 4): “Each HMM state itself is a multidimensional, time-delay embedded covariance matrix across the whole brain, containing information about cross-regional coherence and power in the frequency domain.”</p><p>Analysing whole brain connectivity instead of investigating pre-specified bilateral connectivity pairs is an important difference to previous studies.

The authors use the term &quot;oscillations&quot; without properly defining it in terms of neural activity and they have not addressed the analytical approach they use to confirm the activity measured on LFP or MEG reflects oscillatory activity vs. bursting activity or other neural activity types.</p></disp-quote><p>For the purpose of our paper, oscillatory activity or oscillations refers to recurrent but transient frequency–specific patterns of network activity. Because our analysis pipeline relies on an HMM, the oscillatory connectivity under consideration is neither exclusively made up of sustained rhythmic activity nor neural bursting, and it can be a mix of both (van Ede et al., 2018; Quinn et al., 2019). We have added this information as a footnote to the paper on page 2.</p><p>“For the purposes of our paper we refer to oscillatory activity or oscillations as recurrent but transient frequency–specific patterns of network activity, even though the underlying patterns can be composed of either sustained rhythmic activity, neural bursting, or both (Quinn et al., 2019).

Authors need to acknowledge the role of DBS in PD therapy earlier in the study and identify that as the means by which they have access to simultaneous LFP recording. They don't even define the acronym &quot;DBS&quot; at its first use.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We now define DBS at its first use and added the information on DBS surgery as a further treatment option to the introduction. We added on page 2:</p><p>“However, these studies could not account for simultaneous STN-STN or cortico–STN activity affecting these networks, which would require combined MEG/EEG–LFP recordings (Litvak et al. 2021). Such recordings are possible during the implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes, an accepted treatment in the later stages of PD (Volkmann et al., 2004; Deuschl et al., 2006, Kleiner-Fisman et al., 2006)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Authors could be more clear in lines 90-97 to define what they mean by &quot;disruptive, &quot;physiologically restorative&quot;, and &quot;limited&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed those lines to make the reported findings more accessible. We used “disruptive” to denote that connectivity changes due to dopamine were related to the cognitive side effects reported in literature. “Physiologically restorative” was supposed to refer to connectivity changes on medication that brought connectivity closer to normal physiological connectivity as previously reported in PD. Finally, “limited” referred to the fact that there were only changes in STN-STN coherence in that state.</p><p>The relevant passage now reads (page 3):</p><p>“For the cortico–cortical network medication led to additional connections that can be linked to the side effects of dopamine. At the same time, dopamine changed the cortico-STN network towards a pattern more closely resembling physiological connectivity as reported in the PD literature. Within the third network, dopamine only had an influence on local STN-STN coherence. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Authors repeatedly state their method allows them to delineate between pathological and physiological connectivity, but they don't explain how dynamical systems and discrete-state stochasticity support that goal. Lines 106 and 111.</p></disp-quote><p>To recapitulate, the HMM divides a continuous time series into discrete states. Each state is a time-delay embedded covariance matrix reflecting the underlying connectivity between brain regions as well as the specific temporal dynamics in the data when such state is active. See Packard et al., (1980) for details about how a time-delay embedding characterises a linear dynamical system.</p><p>Please note that the HMM was used as a data-driven, descriptive approach without explicitly assuming any a-priori relationship with pathological or physiological states. The relation between biology and the HMM states, thus, purely emerged from the data; i.e. is empirical. What we claim in this work is simply that the features captured by the HMM hold some relation with the physiology even though the estimation of the HMM was completely unsupervised (i.e. blind to the studied conditions). We have added this point also to the limitations of the study on page 18 and the following to the introduction to guide the reader more intuitively (page 4):</p><p>“To allow the system to dynamically evolve, we use time delay embedding. Theoretically, delay embedding can reveal the state space of the underlying dynamical system (Packard et al., 1980). Thus, by delay-embedding PD time series OFF and ON medication we uncover the differential effects of a neurotransmitter such as dopamine on underlying whole brain connectivity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. Authors must address differences in neural activity other than DA-mediated changes in the on and off medication state. For example, when patients are off med, their UPDRS scores are elevated – do they not have movements that would pick up extra activations in MEG during &quot;rest&quot;? Is it possible to do a true &quot;resting state&quot; in active PD? At minimum this concern must be discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Parkinson’s disease can lead to unwanted movements such as tremor as well as hyperkinesias. This would of course be a deviation from a resting state in healthy subjects. However, such movements are part of the disease and occur unwillingly. The main tremor in Parkinson’s disease is a rest tremor and – as the name already suggests – it occurs while not doing anything. Therefore, such movements can arguably be considered part of the resting state of Parkinson’s disease. Resting state activity with and without medication is therefore still representative for changes in brain activity in Parkinson’s patients and indicative of alterations due to medication.</p><p>To further investigate the effect of movement in our patients, we subdivided the UPDRS part 3 score into tremor and non-tremor subscores. For the tremor subscore we took the mean of item 15 and 17 of the UPDRS, whereas for the non-tremor subscore items 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14 were averaged. Following Spiegel et al., 2007, we classified patients as akinetic-rigid (non-tremor score at least twice the tremor score), tremor-dominant (tremor score at least twice as large as the non-tremor score), and mixed type (for the remaining scores). Of the 17 patients, 1 was tremor dominant and 1 was classified as mixed type (his/her non-tremor score was greater than tremor score). None of our patients exhibited hyperkinesias during the recording. To exclude that our results are driven by tremor-related movement, we re-ran the HMM without the tremor-dominant and the mixed-type patient (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><p>ON medication results for all HMM states remained the same. OFF medication results for the Ctx-Ctx and STN-STN state remained the same as well. The Ctx-STN state OFF medication was split into two states: Sensorimotor-STN connectivity was captured in one state and all other types of Ctx-STN connections were captured in another state (see Figure 1 response letter). The important point is that the biological conclusions stand across these solutions. Regardless, both with and without the two subjects a stable covariance matrix entailing sensorimotor-STN connectivity was determined, which is the main finding for the Ctx-STN state OFF medication.</p><p>We therefore discuss this issue now within the limitation section (page 13):</p><p>“Both motor impairment and motor improvement can cause movement during the resting state in PD. While such movement is a deviation from a resting state in healthy subjects, such movements are part of the disease and occur unwillingly. Therefore, such movements can arguably be considered part of the resting state of Parkinson’s disease. None of the patients in our cohort experienced hyperkinesia during the recording. All patients except for two were of the akinetic-rigid subtype. We verified that tremor movement is not driving our results. Recalculating the HMM states without these 2 subjects, even though it slightly changed some particular aspects of the HMM solution did not materially affect the conclusions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Figure 1: this reviewer would like to see the Y axis indicating amplitude or power, rather than arbitrary units from NNMF output. This figure also begs the question why the NMMF categorized 10-20hz oscillations as δ/theta (bump in blue line in &quot;ON medication&quot; and above 30Hz as α (red line, same plot). To this reviewer, it appears as though the NMMF factorization worked effectively in the &quot;OFF medication&quot; data set but failed in the &quot;ON medication&quot; data set.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the misunderstanding. The graphs in manuscript figure 1 do not reflect power, but the spectral templates derived from the NNMF method; that is, these values are the actual NNMF weights obtained from the NNMF estimation. These templates were in fact derived from coherence measures (as detailed in Vidaurre et al., 2018), which is a unit less measure. Therefore, these NNMF weights also don’t have a unit. We have clarified this in methods section titled Intra-medication analysis on page 20.</p><p>Please also note that NNMF is a data-driven technique and it is therefore natural that the spectral templates do not exactly match the canonical frequency bands. In particular, it is common that residual “bumps” emerge besides the main characteristic frequency (for example, as seen in the “α” band ON medication). However, given that all the results are statistically thresholded at a p-value of 0.05, any connections purely arising from the frequency bumps at 10-20 /20-40Hz Hz for the δ / α mode would be discarded as background noise, because the weights for the bumps observed in these modes are lower than the peak values in the respective mode. The analysis and selection of the frequency modes follows the analysis pipeline described and validated by Vidaurre et al., (2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.

Perhaps simply acknowledge the imbalance in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We now acknowledge the sex imbalance in the discussion, caused by more male patients having been admitted for DBS surgery. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous literature reporting a sex difference in MEG markers. Previous studies have found the density of dopamine transporters to be higher in females than in males, which is in line with findings from animal studies (Lavalaye et al., 2000). On the other hand, previous work has not found any significant differences between men and women in the type and dose of dopaminergic medication used in PD (Umeh et al., 2014).</p><p>We have added the following paragraph to the limitations of study on page 13:</p><p>“In addition, we only recorded 4 female patients because during the study period fewer female patients underwent DBS surgery at our centre.

LFP recordings were sampled from externalized DBS leads using the St. Jude directional 6172 lead except in one patient who had the Boston Scientific leads (which I think is fine to include in analysis together provided surface areas of contacts are identical). The geometry of the segmented leads needs to be addressed relative to sensitivity for various frequencies of oscillatory activity. Segmented leads have very low surface area and may require ultra-high sampling rates (30 kHz and higher) to resolve oscillatory activity.</p></disp-quote><p>The surface area of the directional contacts is almost the same for the two systems: In both cases, the contact is 1.5mm long, but for the St. Jude electrode the diameter is 1.29mm, while for the Boston scientific lead it is 1.3mm. Our data was acquired at 2.4 KHz. Other studies using directional electrodes for LFP recordings employed 1Khz (Telkes et al., 2020) and 24 KHz down-sampled to 375 Hz for analysis (Nguyen et al., 2020) and were able to resolve oscillatory activity in the STN. Thus we are confident the sampling rate is sufficient. We now discuss this issue in limitations of the manuscript on page 14.</p><p>“Moreover, we used directional contacts, which have a smaller surface area than the classical ring contacts.

A decrease in coherence between the cortex and the STN has also been observed ON medication (George et al. 2013), which was correlated with improved motor functions in PD. All the connectivity effects were observed in our results for the communication state. Furthermore, in the communication state, we showed the existence of a frontoparietal sensorimotor 331 network in the β band ON medication. Recent evidence indicates that with the loss of dopamine and the start of PD symptoms, δ/theta oscillations emerge within the basal ganglia (Whalen et al. 2020).

Marmor et al., (2017) investigated this on humans and is therefore most closely related to our research. They find that re-referenced STN recordings are not contaminated by cortical signals. Furthermore, the data in Lalla et al., (2017) is based on recordings in rats, making a direct transfer to human STN recordings problematic due to the different brain sizes. Since we re-referenced our LFP signals as recommended in the Marmor paper, we think that contamination due to cortical signals is relatively minor; see Litvak et al., (2011), Hirschmann et al. (2013), and Neumann et al., (2016) for additional references supporting this. That being said, we now discuss this potential issue in the paper on page 13-14.</p><p>“Lastly, we recorded LFPs from within the STN –an established recording procedure during the implantation of DBS electrodes in various neurological and psychiatric diseases.

However, while volume conduction seems to be a larger problem in rodents even after re-referencing the LFP signal (Lalla et al., 2017), the same was not found in humans (Marmor et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors could make the paper more reader-friendly. In particular, could classical spectral and coherence analyses be performed to visualize the characteristics of the oscillatory activity and neural synchronization of the EMG and LFP signals in the recurrent oscillatory patterns of transient network connectivity both ON and OFF medication?</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain our analysis more intuitively within the manuscript (see page 4). To aid intuition on how to interpret the result in light of the methods used, one can compare the analysis pipeline to a windowing approach. In a more standard approach, windows of different time length can be defined for different epochs within the time series and for each window coherence and connectivity can be determined. The difference in our approach is that we used an unsupervised learning algorithm to select windows of varying length based on recurring patterns of whole brain network activity. Within those defined windows we then determine the oscillatory properties via coherence and power – which is the same as one would do in a classical analysis. We have added an explanation of the concept of “oscillatory activity” within our framework to the introduction (page 2 footnote):</p><p>“For the purpose of our paper, we refer to oscillatory activity or oscillations as recurrent, but transient frequency–specific patterns of network activity, even though the underlying patterns can be composed of either sustained rhythmic activity, neural bursting, or both (Quinn et al. 2019).”</p><p>Moreover, we provide a more intuitive explanation of the analysis within the first section of the results (page 4):</p><p>“Using an HMM, we identified recurrent patterns of transient network connectivity between the cortex and the STN, which we henceforth refer to as an ‘HMM state’. In comparison to classic sliding-window analysis, an HMM solution can be thought of as a data-driven estimation of time windows of variable length (within which a particular HMM state was active): once we know the time windows when a particular state is active, we compute coherence between different pairs of regions for each of these recurrent states.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In this study, the authors could reconstruct the trajectories of the DBS leads within the STN (using for example the open source LeadDBS program?).</p></disp-quote><p>We selected the electrode contacts based on intraoperative microelectrode recordings (for details, see page 16). The first directional recording height after the entry into the STN was selected to obtain the three directional LFP recordings from the respective hemisphere. This practice has been proven to improve target location (Kochanski et al., 2019; Krauss et al., 2021). The common target area for DBS surgery is the dorsolateral STN. To confirm that the electrodes were actually located within this part of the STN, we now reconstructed the DBS location with Lead-DBS (Horn et al., 2019). All electrodes – except for one – were located within the dorsolateral STN (see figure 7 of the manuscript). To exclude that our results were driven by outlier, we reanalysed our data without this patient.
