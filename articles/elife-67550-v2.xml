Both TCR and CD28 aggregate into clusters at the plasma membrane of activated T cells. While the role of TCR clustering in T cell activation has been extensively investigated, little is known about how CD28 clustering contributes to CD28 signalling. Here, we report that upon CD28 triggering, the BAR-domain protein sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) is recruited to CD28 clusters at the immunological synapse. Using three-dimensional correlative light and electron microscopy, we show that SNX9 generates membrane tubulation out of CD28 clusters. Our data further reveal that CD28 clusters are in fact dynamic structures and that SNX9 regulates their stability as well as CD28 phosphorylation and the resulting production of the cytokine IL-2. In summary, our work suggests a model in which SNX9-mediated tubulation generates a membrane environment that promotes CD28 triggering and downstream signalling events.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>CD28</kwd><kwd>membrane curvature</kwd><kwd>membrane organisation</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd><kwd>sorting nexin 9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_172969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossy</surname><given-names>Jeremie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO 6238/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossy</surname><given-names>Jeremie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1102730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossy</surname><given-names>Jeremie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004784</institution-id><institution>Novartis Stiftung für Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossy</surname><given-names>Jeremie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sorting nexin 9, a membrane curvature inducing protein, creates a distinct environment within clusters of the co-receptor CD28 and thereby allows T cell activation to proceed to a successful outcome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T cell activation is at the centre of the adaptive immune response and relies primarily on the T cell receptor (TCR). Priming of naive T cells requires an additional costimulatory signal delivered by CD28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boomer and Green, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Esensten et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rudd et al., 2009</xref>). Upon binding of the ligands CD80 and CD86 (otherwise known as B7-1 and B7-2) at the surface of professional antigen-presenting cells, CD28 recruits several effector proteins including filamin-A, Grb2, PI-3K, and PKCθ. Ultimately, CD28 triggering promotes T cell activation through cytoskeletal rearrangements, the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFAT and the secretion of internleukin-2 (IL-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanchez-Lockhart et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fraser et al., 1991</xref>). In absence of CD28 signalling, naive T cells fail to activate and fall into a permanent state of unresponsiveness known as anergy. Anergy is characterised by the inability to produce IL-2 and proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harding et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jenkins et al., 1988</xref>). CD28 signalling also promotes cytokines transcription independently of TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Raab et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>T cell activation by antigen-presenting cells leads to the formation of a specialised cell-cell interface, the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis and Dustin, 2004</xref>). Stimulation of TCR and CD28 is required to localise CD28 within the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanchez-Lockhart et al., 2008</xref>), whose formation is impaired in absence of CD28 co-simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wülfing et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, localisation and activation of CD28 at the synapse are required to trigger downstream signalling events required for productive T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sanchez-Lockhart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tseng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yokosuka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Within the immunological synapse, surface receptors, signalling and adaptor proteins assemble in protein clusters, which are essential for the initiation and amplification of T cell signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Varma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rossy et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, T cell activation or engagement of CD80/86 leads to CD28 clustering, which is driven only by interactions within the extracellular domain of CD28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tseng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tseng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yokosuka et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, TCR and CD28 clusters are spatially segregated within the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tseng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tseng et al., 2008</xref>), which suggests that they might have distinct properties and regulatory mechanisms. How CD28 cluster stability is regulated and how these clusters contribute to CD28 signalling and T cell activation remains poorly understood.</p><p>Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) is a BAR-domain protein that stands at the interface between the plasma membrane and intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bendris and Schmid, 2017</xref>). SNX9 binds to specific areas of membranes through two types of domains: a curvature-sensitive BAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2008</xref>) and a phosphoinositides-interacting pleckstrin homology (PX) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pylypenko et al., 2007</xref>). The affinity of SNX9 for distinct membrane domains is coupled with strong membrane remodelling abilities, inherent to the membrane-bending activity of the BAR domains and because of interactions with membrane remodelling proteins. The SH3 domain of SNX9 recruits N-WASP, an activator of the Arp2/3 actin nucleating complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yarar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2008</xref>) and the membrane scission protein dynamin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2008</xref>). The so-called low complexity domain of SNX9 mediates further interactions with components of the actin polymerisation and clathrin-mediated endocytosis machineries such as clathrin, AP-2 and Arp2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2008</xref>). Unidentified domains of SNX9 also link it to the small GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bendris et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, SNX9 activity is related to localised actin polymerisation and formation of tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Weering et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yarar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2008</xref>), often in the context of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schöneberg et al., 2017</xref>). SNX9 plays a role in many cellular processes that involve membrane remodelling, such as the formation of the apical domain of polarised cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Román-Fernández et al., 2018</xref>), macropinosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), phagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almendinger et al., 2011</xref>), or invadopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bendris et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>SNX9 expression is decreased in T cells upon inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ish-Shalom et al., 2016</xref>) and has been implicated in CD28 endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badour et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we sought to investigate how the membrane remodelling properties of SNX9 contribute to organise the immunological synapse, T cell activation and CD28 signalling. We show that T cell activation leads to the formation of tubules decorated by SNX9 at the immunological synapse. Our investigations further indicate that these tubules are connected to CD28 clusters at the plasma membrane and that SNX9 regulates the stability of CD28 clusters. Finally, we present functional data showing that SNX9 is required for CD28 phosphorylation, subsequent NFAT nuclear translocation and IL-2 production upon T cell activation. Together our data indicate that membrane organisation at CD28 clusters by SNX9 promotes CD28 triggering and contributes to steer T cells away from anergy during activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recruitment of SNX9 to the immunological synapse upon T cell activation</title><p>SNX9 has been shown to support membrane remodelling during various cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bendris and Schmid, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2009</xref>) and is expressed in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ish-Shalom et al., 2016</xref>). However, its role in T cell activation remains to be demonstrated. We first investigated if SNX9 is recruited to the immunological synapse upon T cell activation. To do so, Jurkat T cells were activated with Raji B cells pulsed with or without superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin E (±SEE respectively) and fixed at 2, 5, 10, or 15 min after initial cell-cell contact. Conjugates were stained with an antibody against SNX9 and phalloidin-Alexa488 to detect F-actin to identify the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hammer et al., 2019</xref>). A blinded analysis of the localisation of SNX9 revealed that it was present at the immunological synapse from 2 min onwards, where it was detected in 75% ± 7.6% of the conjugates after 15 min of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recruitment of SNX9 to the immunological synapse upon T cell activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of maximum intensity projections from Z-stacks (0.19 µm per slice) of WT Jurkat T cells conjugated to SEE pulsed (+ SEE) or non-pulsed (-SEE) antigen presenting cells (APC).

We further confirmed the recruitment of SNX9 to the immunological synapse in primary T cells interacting with dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were isolated from transgenic OT-II mice, virally transduced to expressed SNX9-GFP and activated with LPS-matured bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) pulsed with the OT-II peptide. We observed a clear recruitment to the synapse, here identified by CD28, in over 70% of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. One notable difference compared to the data obtained in Jurkat cells is the fact that a bit more than 10% of the unspecific conjugates displayed enrichment of SNX9 where CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contacted the BMDCs (no SNX9 was detected at the Jurkat-Raji cell interface in absence of SEE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Together, these results confirm the recruitment of SNX9 to the immunological synapse upon T cell activation.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> further revealed that the signal of SNX9-mCherry was organised in membranous structures immediately above the synapse. To better understand how these SNX9-positive structures relate to T cell activation, we tested how TCR and/or CD28 signalling promote their formation. We imaged z-stacks of live Jurkat T cells expressing SNX9-GFP and deposited on non-activating (PLL-coated) or on activating (coated with antibodies against CD3ε and/or CD28) cover glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The number of SNX9-positive structures in the 3D reconstructions of the cells was quantified using a particle detection analysis routine based on intensity thresholding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Strikingly, SNX9 was completely cytosolic in resting cells, where not a single SNX9-positive structure was detected over four independent experiments. This transition from cytosolic to membrane at the immunological synapse upon activation was also observed in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activated by BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of note, the low levels of activation reported for PLL in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Santos et al., 2018</xref>) were not sufficient to promote membrane association of SNX9. Stimulation of CD28 alone and co-stimulation of CD28 and TCR were about twice as potent as TCR triggering alone in stimulating the formation of SNX9-positive structures. Altogether, these data show that CD28 stimulation during T cell activation promotes the formation of SNX9-positive structures at the immunological synapse.</p><p>Activation leads to the localisation of the T cell intracellular trafficking machinery behind the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Onnis and Baldari, 2019</xref>). To determine if the SNX9-positive membranous structures resulting from CD28 triggering are linked to synaptic endosomes, we characterised their spatial distribution in respect to vesicles and endosomes positive for TCR or for the early endosome marker Rab5. To do so, the whole volume of activated Jurkat T cells expressing SNX9-GFP or mCherry and either TCRζ-mCherry, Rab5-mCherry or CD28-GFP was imaged live with an axial resolution of 190 nm using an Airyscan detector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The number of structures positive for mCherry was determined in each z-stack to obtain their axial distribution relative to the first focal plane where the cell initially came in to focus (defined as axial position = 0 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In line with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Compeer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Redpath et al., 2019</xref>), we detected many TCRζ and Rab5-positive vesicles and endosomes distributed through the cell, from slightly above the synapse to the top of the cell, with their number peaking at 1.35 and 1.8 μm from the 0 μm position, respectively. The signal of CD28 was restricted to the plasma membrane of the immunological synapse (peak at 0.4 μm from the 0 μm position). This suggests that the CD28-positive structures identified by the analysis routine were not vesicles but rather plasma membrane microclusters. Strikingly, the membranous structures positive for SNX9 were detected just above the immunological synapse within a narrow peak around 0.9 µm from the 0 μm position, immediately after the peak defined by the CD28 clusters and yet closer to the synapse than TCR or Rab5 endosomes. We further extracted the axial position of the maximum number of structures detected for each cell of each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This analysis confirmed that SNX9 intracellular structures were below TCR and Rab5-positive endosomes. While the average of the positions of the maximum number of structures for SNX9 was higher than for CD28, the difference was not statistically significant. However, the lack of significance is more likely to reflect the limitation of the resolution of the system rather than an absence of difference, as detailed below in Figure 4. In summary, these experiments show that SNX9 is not associated with endosomes in resting cells but rather decorates structures strictly proximal to the immunological synapse upon T cell activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Recruitment of SNX9 to CD28 clusters at the immunological synapse</title><p>As our observations showed that CD28 triggering leads to the formation of SNX9-positive membrane structures at the immunological synapse to a higher extent than TCR stimulation alone, we sought to determine the potential connection between SNX9 and CD28 clusters. Jurkat T cells expressing wild type CD28 (CD28WT) or non-phosphorylatable CD28 generated by point mutations of intracellular tyrosine residues to phenylalanine (CD28YF) fused to EGFP were activated on cover glass coated with antibodies against anti-CD3ε and CD28 antibodies, fixed and stained with an antibody against SNX9. We imaged these cells under total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) illumination for optimal visualisation of protein distribution within the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In accordance with previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tseng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tseng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yokosuka et al., 2008</xref>), both CD28WT and CD28YF were organised in clusters within the plasma membrane. Crucially, SNX9 was also clustered with line profiles of fluorescence intensity across the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We used an intensity-based threshold analysis identifying clusters in each channel to confirm that the majority of clusters defined by SNX9 overlapped with CD28 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While not significant, we observed a clear tendency of a lower overlap of SNX9 clusters with the non-phosphorylatable form of CD28 when compared to WTCD28, suggesting that CD28 phosphorylation may contribute to the recruitment of SNX9. Of note, the same intensity-based threshold revealed no obvious overlap between SNX9 and Rab5, which we used here as negative control for the quantification approach. Photoactivation of CD28-PAmCherry at the plasma membrane by TIRF 405 nm illumination also revealed that CD28 clusters remain co-localised with clusters of SNX9-EGFP after photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Recruitment of SNX9 to CD28 clusters upon T cell activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative TIRF images of fixed WT Jurkat T cells expressing CD28WT-EGFP or CD28YF-EGFP (cyan) and activated for 10 min.

To circumvent this limitation, we used Airyscan confocal microscopy and 3D reconstruction to visualise protein clustering in immunological synapses of conjugates between Jurkat T cells and Raji B cells pulsed with SEE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). En face projections revealed that these synapses contained large clusters of co-localising CD28 and SNX9, confirming the results obtained using antibody-coated glass and TIRF microscopy. Finally, colocalization of SNX9 and CD28 at the synapse was further confirmed in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activated by BMDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these data indicate that SNX9 at the immunological synapse is contained in CD28 clusters in a dynamic fashion.</p><p>We next investigated the temporal dynamics of the formation of CD28 and SNX9 clusters to understand which protein recruits the other. To do so, T cells expressing CD28WT-EGFP and SNX9-mCherry were imaged in TIRF while being deposited on cover glass coated with activating antibodies against CD3ε and CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Cells were imaged from the moment they touched the glass until they were fully activated (12 min in total). CD28 clusters were first observed in ‘ridges’ of plasma membrane mediating the first contacts of the cell with the stimulatory surface, as previously described for clusters of Lat in activating T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sherman et al., 2011</xref>). SNX9 was first found in the cytosol within these ridges and clusters of SNX9 were detected approximately 50 s later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This observation is consistent with the transition of SNX9 from cytosol to membrane that we observed upon T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In line with the results obtained with endogenous SNX9 in fully spread and fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), the SNX9 signal first appeared within the denser CD28 clusters and remained within these clusters for the entire duration of the acquisition (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Thus, these time-sequence experiments establish that SNX9 is recruited to pre-existing CD28 clusters, as opposed to CD28 being recruited to SNX9 clusters. These results further indicate that SNX9 is not required to establish CD28 clusters upon T cell activation.</p><p>Because SNX9 was mobilised to CD28 clusters independently of the phosphorylation of CD28 intracellular domains, we set out to investigate the interactions responsible for this recruitment. SNX9 contains a membrane binding domain that binds to phosphoinositide-rich (PX) and curved (BAR) membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pylypenko et al., 2007</xref>) and an SH3 domain that mediates interactions with proteins containing proline-rich motifs, including dynamin and the Arp2/3 activator WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yarar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2008</xref>). In order to determine if these interaction domains were responsible for the recruitment of SNX9 into CD28 clusters, we generated two deletion mutants preventing SNX9 interactions with most of its protein partners – missing the SH3 domain (ΔSH3) – or with membranes – missing the PX domain (ΔPX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pylypenko et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schöneberg et al., 2017</xref>). We further generated SNX9 knock-out (SNX9 KO) Jurkat cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). When expressed in SNX9 KO cells, SNX9-ΔSH3-mCherry defined long tubules, while SNX9-ΔPX-mCherry was cytosolic and in highly mobile vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Crucially, none of these mutants displayed a clustered distribution. These observations are in line with previous studies showing that preventing interaction with the actin-polymerising machinery or with membranes results in abnormal tubular structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shin et al., 2008</xref>) and a cytosolic localisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pylypenko et al., 2007</xref>), respectively.</p><p>We next used these mutants to determine which functional domains of SNX9 are required for recruitment to CD28 clusters. SNX9 KO Jurkat T cells expressing SNX9-WT, SNX9-ΔSH3 or SNX9-ΔPX fused to mCherry and CD28-EGFP were activated on antibody-coated cover glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). To quantify the recruitment of SNX9 mutants into CD28-positive clusters, the CD28 signal was used to generate a ‘cluster’ mask and the fluorescence intensity of the mCherry signal was measured both inside and outside this mask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). We measured significantly less mCherry signal within CD28 clusters for both deletion mutants when compared to WT SNX9. Thus, SNX9 recruitment to CD28 clusters is not mediated by phosphorylated tyrosine residues on CD28 but requires the functional domains of SNX9 conferring interaction with proteins containing proline-rich motifs and membranes. As CD28 triggering seems to play a preponderant role in the recruitment of SNX9 to CD28 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), we can only speculate that this recruitment relies on interactions with CD28 effectors and/or a specific lipid environment within the clusters. Importantly, because the low complexity domain which binds to clathrin and AP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lundmark and Carlsson, 2009</xref>) is still present in the ΔSH3-SNX9 mutant, our results suggest that interactions with clathrin or AP-2 are not sufficient to locate SNX9 in CD28 clusters. The fact that the ΔSH3-SNX9 mutant was not recruited to CD28 clusters despite having been shown to be normally recruited to clathrin coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schöneberg et al., 2017</xref>) further indicates that SNX9 localisation in CD28 clusters is independent of the clathrin endocytic machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Dynamics and persistence of SNX9 within CD28 clusters</title><p>Our data clearly show that SNX9 is recruited to existing CD28 clusters upon T cell activation. We next used photoactivation of fluorescent proteins to obtain a better insight into the dynamics of how SNX9 associates with CD28 clusters. We designed an approach to distinguish between unconstrained diffusion of the PAmCherry signal from the region of photoactivation throughout the entire synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> upper) and the propagation of this signal only through clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> lower). Activated cells expressing CD28-EGFP and SNX9 fused to photoactivatable mCherry (SNX9-PAmCherry) were repetitively illuminated every 34 s with 405 nm light at the cell periphery in order to evaluate the diffusion of SNX9 through the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The SNX9-PAmCherry fluorescence rapidly spread from the photoactivated region over the whole cell-glass interface. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, we used a mask defined by CD28-EGFP to quantify the distribution of the SNX9-PAmCherry signal within CD28 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This quantification revealed that SNX9 diffused rapidly throughout the immune synapse, while predominantly co-localising with the clustered signal of CD28. The signal of SNX9-PAmCherry was significantly higher in clusters than in the cytosol within 4 s after the beginning of 405 nm illumination. Of note, we did not observe formation of any endosomal structures positive for SNX9-PAmCherry following photoactivation when a threshold and subsequent size-based quantification was used (size cut-off: 5–1000 pixel units, 65 nm per pixel; threshold images and quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) as we did when we used the same approach to investigate endocytosis of TCRζ, flotillins or clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Compeer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Redpath et al., 2019</xref>).

We used IMOD to generate contours to identify and determine the length, surface area and volume of tubules connected to CD28-rich area of the plasma membrane, positive for SNX9 and displaying consistent densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). SNX9-positive tubules showed a clear tendency to be larger than SNX9-negative tubules, being significantly longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Of note, the average length of SNX9-positive tubules (250 nm) made it impossible to formally distinguish them from the plasma membrane in conventional fluorescence microscopy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>. In summary, these high-resolution analyses and quantification suggest that SNX9 is enriched in tubules emanating from CD28 clusters on the plasma membrane and promote their elongation in activated T cells. As we did not detect CD28 within these tubular SNX9 structures, we speculate that their function is to regulate the presence of lipids or specific effectors within CD28 clusters, and thereby mediate CD28 signalling as detailed below in the discussion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SNX9 promotes CD28 residence in clusters</title><p>We then sought to uncover the functional role on T cell signalling of connection of the SNX9-positive tubules and CD28 clusters.

Surprisingly, we observed that when photoactivated with 405 nm light at the periphery of the cells, CD28-PAmCherry diffused rapidly through the entire activation area while remaining strictly within clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>).

This result reveals that even though CD28 clusters appear very stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), CD28 is constantly exchanged within the population of clusters.</p><p>Considering that CD28 clusters are not static structures, we investigated whether SNX9 might have an influence on cluster stability using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Regions of interest corresponding to CD28-EGFP clusters were photobleached by illumination with an 800-nm two-photon laser in WT or SNX9 KO Jurkat T cells expressing CD28WT-EGFP or CD28YF-EGFP with or without SNX9 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5—video 2</xref>). We used two-photon illumination to ensure that only molecules within the focal plane of the plasma membrane were bleached. The increase of fluorescence over time in the bleached clusters was normalised by the signal from unbleached ROIs to correct for fluorescent protein bleaching. The final curves of fluorescence recovery were obtained by calculating the mean of all the individual acquisitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Divergence analysis revealed that the recovery rate of fluorescence in CD28 clusters of cells overexpressing SNX9 was significantly lower than the recovery rate of control cells from 94 s on. Plotting the mean of the fluorescence intensity profiles at 380 s after initial photobleaching further showed that CD28WT-EGFP clusters had recovered 57.4% ± 10.9% of their initial fluorescence in WT cells without SNX9 transfection and only 34.6% ± 4.8% of fluorescence in cells overexpressing SNX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This suggests that SNX9 promotes the stability of CD28 clusters. In line with this, fluorescence intensity within CD28 clusters recovered significantly faster in both SNX9 KO Jurkat T cell lines, diverging significantly from the WT control recovery curve at 124 and 384 s after bleaching in two SNX9 KO clones. The recovery curve of KO#4 diverged from the WT curve only at the latest time points, but it nevertheless showed impaired recovery relative to WT cells. To verify the divergence of the KO#4 from the WT, we normalised the curves and fitted them with a bi-exponential decay, indicating that the fluorescence recovery occurred via two processes characterised by kinetic constants tau1 and tau2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The kinetic constant of the component, tau2, was significantly different from the WT for both KO#3 and KO#4, confirming that the recovery of fluorescence within CD28 clusters was affected by SNX9 knock-out. This was further illustrated by the fact that the percentage of CD28-EGFP fluorescence recovery at 380 s was higher in SNX9 KO cells than for WT cells (57.4%), reaching 70.4% ± 4.7% and 69% ± 13%. Of note, these differences were not the result of differential expression of CD28, as the absence of SNX9 in the knock-out cell lines did not alter CD28 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). There was no significant difference in the FRAP of clusters of CD28WT and CD28YF, indicating that unlike SNX9, phosphorylation of the intracellular domains of CD28 does not contribute to CD28 cluster stability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Surface levels and endocytosis of CD28 upon SNX9 knock-out.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean fluorescence intensity of resting and activated (20 min) WT Jurkat and SNX9KO#3 and SNX9KO#4T cells incubated with an antibody against CD28 (CD28-FITC).

More importantly, there were no significant differences in the FRAP of Lck10 upon overexpression or knock-out of SNX9, confirming the specificity of the effect of SNX9 on CD28 cluster stability.

Thus, we measured CD28 surface expression and uptake using flow cytometry in order to test if SNX9 could be related to any CD28 endocytic process.</p><p>Jurkat WT and SNX9 KO cells were activated with anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28 for 20 min or left in non-activating conditions. Following activation, surface bound antibodies were removed by acid washing and cells were stained with FITC-labelled anti-CD28 to detect surface CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate CD28 uptake, cells were incubated with anti-CD3ε and anti-CD28-FITC on ice to allow antibody binding, and then at 37°C for 20 min to allow for internalisation. Surface bound antibodies were then washed off by an acid wash and fixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Cell surface expression and internalisation of CD28 did not differ significantly between Jurkat WT and SNX9 KO in resting or activated cells. To compensate for the difference in CD28 surface expression between the various KO cell lines, we calculated the normalised ratio between surface expression and uptake of CD28-FITC fluorescence signal, which confirmed that SNX9 does not regulate CD28 internalisation from the cell surface in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Our data globally suggest that extensive endocytosis of CD28 does not occur in activated T cells. We did not observe any obvious intracellular pool of CD28 or intracellular vesicles or compartments positive for CD28 in activated cells expressing CD28-EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), CD28-PAmCherry was not detected in endocytic vesicles following photoactivation at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, the low number of intracellular structures positive for CD28 in activated cells matches the lower rates of internalisation of CD28 upon activation when compared to TCR. After 10 min of activation only 42.8% ± 5.7% of the initial levels of cell surface TCR could still be detected at the cell surface, in contract to 88.8% ± 7.3% for CD28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In summary, our observations indicate that SNX9 does not significantly contribute to the moderate internalisation of CD28.</p><p>We next investigated if SNX9 contributes specifically to CD28 signalling to determine the functional consequences of the regulation of CD28 cluster stability by SNX9.

The fluorescence signal was then measured by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>). Mean fluorescence intensity of the WT cells was normalised to 100% and compared to the mean of each group to evaluate statistical significance using a one sample t-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). Both SNX9 KO cell lines showed a significant decrease of CD28 phosphorylation (40% ± 19.2%) compared to WT cells. By contrast, the fluorescence intensity of phosphorylated TCR did not differ between WT and SNX9 KO cells.

Requirement for CD28 co-signalling is the reason for the inclusion of the intracellular domain of CD28 in the design of some chimeric antigen receptors in cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van der Stegen et al., 2015</xref>). Like TCR, CD28 assembles into signalling clusters at the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tseng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yokosuka et al., 2008</xref>). However, in contrast to TCR, how CD28 clustering contributes to CD28 signalling remains poorly understood. Here, we show that upon CD28 triggering, the membrane-organising protein SNX9 is recruited to CD28 clusters at the immunological synapse where it generates membrane tubulation. Our data further reveal that CD28 is continuously exchanged within the population of clusters, and that SNX9 plays a role in regulating CD28 clusters stability. Functionally, SNX9 brings an essential contribution to CD28 triggering and downstream signalling.</p><p>It has been shown that adaptor proteins regulate stability of T cell clusters and thereby determine the intensity of T cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lasserre et al., 2011</xref>). The question stemming from our results is how SNX9 achieves a similar function in CD28 signalling. Below we discuss the potential mechanisms through which SNX9 could regulate CD28 triggering and recruitment of effectors to CD28 clusters.</p><p>Regulation of cell surface expression modulates receptor signalling and SNX9 plays a role in CD28 internalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badour et al., 2007</xref>). However, our data suggests very modest rates of CD28 endocytosis occur in activated T cells. Furthermore, SNX9 knock-out had no impact on CD28 surface expression. Another possible mechanism of regulation of CD28 signalling by SNX9 in clusters could be via the control of actin polymerisation, as SNX9 can recruit and activate the actin nucleating complex Arp2/3 through its SH3 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yarar et al., 2007</xref>). In T cells, actin is required for TCR cluster formation at the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campi et al., 2005</xref>) and, more generally, can regulate cluster stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavi et al., 2012</xref>). CD28 signalling is also connected to actin polymerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tavano et al., 2006</xref>). Yet, the assembly of CD28 clusters does not involve actin polymerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yokosuka et al., 2008</xref>) and they have never been described as actin-rich structures.</p><p>The SNX9-positive tubular structures that we observed at the immunological synapse rather suggest that SNX9 regulates CD28 signalling by organising the membrane and lipids, perhaps by way of its BAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bendris and Schmid, 2017</xref>). Indeed, membrane heterogeneity and local enrichment of lipid species have been shown to regulate many aspects of T cell signalling and activation. Diacylglycerol at the synapse promotes T cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chauveau et al., 2014</xref>) and phosphoinositides control actin organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Le Floc’h et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gawden-Bone et al., 2018</xref>) and TCRζ accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeFord-Watts et al., 2011</xref>) at the immunological synapse.</p><p>More importantly, phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gagnon et al., 2012</xref>) and phosphoinositides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chouaki Benmansour et al., 2018</xref>) play a central role in TCR triggering by favouring the release of intracellular domains of the TCR-CD3 complex from the plasma membrane. This model, in which intracellular domains are inaccessible to effectors while bound to the inner leaflet, has also been put forward to explain CD28 triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dobbins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is possible that organisation of the plasma membrane by SNX9 within CD28 clusters contributes to establish a distinct lipid environment within CD28 clusters and, by doing so, promotes cluster stability and signalling. Several BAR-domain proteins can cluster phosphoinositides and generate lipid domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Picas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saarikangas et al., 2009</xref>), although this has not yet been described for SNX9. Membrane curvature, like the SNX9-positive tubules that we observed at the synapse, is also thought to promote formation of specific lipid subdomains by driving the enrichment of lipids that preferentially associate with the curvature of the local membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Callan-Jones et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parton et al., 2020</xref>). This would favour membrane detachment of the CD28 cytoplasmic domain and, in doing so, would provide improved access of CD28 intracellular domain to effectors.</p><p>Clustering of CD28 occurs independently of cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yokosuka et al., 2008</xref>) and SNX9 was recruited to pre-existing CD28 clusters in our time-lapse experiments. This indicates that SNX9 binding to CD28 is not required for the initial formation of CD28 clusters. However, membrane curvature can favour clustering of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reynwar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Strahl et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, membrane curvature induced by SNX9 tubulation in CD28 cluster could promote recruitment and clustering of CD28 effectors to facilitate CD28 phosphorylation and signalling. Aside from clustering, curvature is postulated to influence diffusion of membrane proteins in theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yoshigaki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balakrishnan, 2000</xref>). We speculate that slower diffusion at CD28 clusters increases the dwell time of CD28 effectors and by doing so potentiates CD28 signalling as it has been recently shown for SOS and N-WASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin and Mittag, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Finally, membrane curvature can directly regulate enzymatic activity, including of proteins that are reported effectors of CD28. The activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which is recruited to the YMNM motif on the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 upon triggering, is increased by membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bettache et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hübner et al., 1998</xref>). Similarly, curvature has been shown to modulate the activity of PKC, another key effector of CD28 signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldberg and Zidovetzki, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiménez-Monreal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Epand and Lester, 1990</xref>).</p><p>In summary, in this study we show that CD28 clusters at the immunological synapse recruit SNX9 upon CD28 triggering. We present evidence that SNX9 generates membrane tubulation at CD28 clusters and regulates their stability and we establish a clear link between SNX9, and CD28 phosphorylation and downstream signalling in T cells. Our results suggest a revised model of lipid organisation at the immunological synapse, in which membrane-binding protein would organise the composition and curvature of the membrane at T cell microclusters. They further suggest that lipid organisation inside clusters could be central to how signalling is regulated within these structures. This raises many questions. What is the exact nature of the distinct lipid environment promoted by SNX9 within CD28 clusters? Which effectors are either recruited or more likely activated by the CD28-SNX9 subdomains? Answering will require the development of more sensitive probes and approaches to better dissect the lipid environments and their role in regulating signalling in T cell clusters.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Expression constructs encoding for human SNX9-pmCherryC1 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_27678">Addgene_27678</ext-link>), SNX9-EGFP, SNX9ΔPX-mCherry, SNX9ΔSH3-mCherry and CD28-EGFP, were provided by Prof. K.

Normalised curves were then fitted with either a mono-, bi-, or triple-exponential decay model, with the goodness-of-fit evaluated by the sum of the weighted summed square of residuals (SSR).

Tubules were defined based on 1- co-localisation with SNX9 and CD28 fluorescence signal; 2- originating from the plasma membrane and 3- electron density consistent with either other SNX9 tubules, endoplasmic reticulum tubules or clathrin-coated pits Specific tubules were excluded from being analysed as SNX9-positive tubules based upon their distinct densities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis excepting time of divergence analysis were performed using GraphPad software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/">Graphpad Prism</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>).

Here Ecker et al., link the T cell costimulatory receptor CD28 to the sorting nexin SNX9. They show that SNX9 is recruited to the vicinity of CD28 clusters formed when Jurkat T cells are activated on cover slips coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies. This recruitment was dynamic and required the SNX9 SH3 and PX domains. Correlative light electron microscopy suggests that tubular structures are associated with CD28 and SNX9, something to be expected for the sorting nexin family. Overexpression of SNX9 led to more stable CD28 clusters on the antibody-coated cover slips. Deletion of SNX9 led to reduced CD28 phosphorylation, NFAT nuclear translocation and IL-2 secretion upon activation of Jurkat T cells by antibody-coated cover slips and Raji B cells, respectively. The strength of the manuscript lies in extensive, technically demanding and interesting imaging data on CD28 and SNX9 with the potential to establish intriguing biological connections. There are substantial conceptual and technical concerns. Briefly, corroboration of key data obtained using T cells activated with antibody-coated glass cover slips with T cells activated by antigen presenting cells are largely missing. Such corroboration is critical as fixing receptor location by antibody binding and limited membrane deformation on the cover slips substantially alter receptor localization, versicular trafficking and the connection between the two processes. In addition, incomplete image quantification limits the conclusions that can be drawn for the extensive imaging data.</p><p>1. Linking receptor localization and vesicular trafficking is technically highly demanding, as many of the relevant structures have a size below the resolution limit of fluorescence microscopy. The formation of receptor clusters is greatly enhanced when T cells are activated on antibody-coated cover slips and such clusters are much more readily detectable as immobile diffraction-limited objects in a single imaging plane. Using antibody-coated cover slips thus is an important tool in investigating receptor localization and vesicular trafficking at the T cell synapse. However, with receptor clustering and vesicular trafficking it is critical to confirm all key findings in cell couples between T cells and antigen presenting cells. Lateral mobility influences receptor localization (and is prevented on the cover slips by the immobile antibodies fixing the receptors in place) and membrane deformation is central to vesicular trafficking, in particular its regulation by BAR domain-containing proteins (as greatly reduced on the flat cover slips). Work from the Hivroz laboratory illustrates how cover slips and cell couples can be effectively used to complement each other. With the exception of Figure 1A (which doesn't resolve SNX9 puncta) and Figure 6G (IL-2 secretion) the data in the main figures rely on antibody-coated cover slips only. At the very least, the existence of co-localized CD28 and SNX9 puncta needs to be shown in cell couples.</p><p>2. Using images to understand biology is rewarding because of their high information content, yet it requires rigorous quantification. In particular any new structure of interest should be defined in quantitative terms rather than presented through representative images. This applies prominently to the CD28 'ridges' in Figure 2 and the CD28/SNX9-associated 'tubules' in Figure 4.</p><p>The order of recruitment of CD28 and SNX9 to the 'ridges' is an important part of the author's argument that SNX9 doesn't control CD28 clustering but the signaling of the clusters. For that case to be made convincingly, the authors should define quantitative criteria what constitutes a 'ridge', some idea of what the cell biological structure underlying them is would be good (first membrane contacts stabilized by binding of CD28 to the anti-CD28 antibody? IRM to show glass membrane contacts would be very helpful) and then recruitment of SNX9 and a negative control protein (GFP?) to the independently defined ridges would need to be quantified as a function of time.</p><p>Similarly, Figure 4 shows that tubules occur in regions where there is CD28 and SNX9. By visual inspection of the single representative image set, tubules also occur outside the areas of CD28 and SNX9 accumulation. The authors should identify tubules independently in the EM images (e.g. length, frequency) and then calculate whether they are enriched in areas of CD28 fluorescence, SNX9 fluorescence and areas positive for both. In addition, a detailed description of how the fluorescence and EM data were aligned would be welcome.</p><p>Additional figures would benefit from enhanced image quantification and/or a more detailed description of the methods to do so.</p><p>Criteria for interface enrichment of SNX9 in Figure 1A/B should be given.</p><p>Vicinity to the glass cover slip should be quantified in Figure 1C.</p><p>The methods relating to Figure 1E state that 'endosomes were first identified by manual thresholding'. The authors should describe why that was done, how that was done in detail and preferentially show supplementary data how this affects the figure. This is important as Figure 1E established a dominant role of CD28 in SNX9 recruitment.</p><p>Statistics for the differences in distances from the cover slip in Figure 1G would be welcome.</p><p>The colocalization between CD28 and SNX9 in Figure 2A/B should be quantified. This is important as the figure makes the argument that CD28 signaling is not required for SNX9 recruitment. However, the visual inspection of the two representative traces suggests better colocalization of CD28 with SNX9 than CD28YF. Inclusion of a negative control to establish a baseline of random colocalization would be welcome.</p><p>There are a number of additional comments:</p><p>The authors state that the SNX9-mCherry signal in Figure 1C was organized in 'membranous structures'. This reviewer can see punctuate structures. How do the authors know that the structures are membranous, rather than e.g. large protein complexes?</p><p>Poly L-lysine is activating for T cells (Nature Immunology 19, 203-205 (2018)). This should be acknowledged.</p><p>With regard to Figure 3A the authors state that they 'did not observe formation of any endosomal structures positive for SNX9-PAmcherry'. If they would like to make the statement, it should be supported by quantitative data.</p><p>In Figure 5E/F the authors have chosen to quantify fluorescence recovery at 380s showing a slight delay upon SNX9 knockout. At earlier time points up to 240 s they would reach a partially different conclusion, as one of the two knock out cell lines behaves the same as the control. This should be acknowledged, and conclusions should be modified accordingly. In the same experiment it would be good to know how much overexpression of SNX9 changes its expression level relative to endogenous protein expression.</p><p>As overexpression of SNX9 rather than its knockout has a substantial effect on CD28 complex stability, it would be good to see what the function effects thereof (NFAT, IL-2) are.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript, Ecker et al., designed serial experiments to address the function of a BAR-domain protein SNX9 in regulating CD28 signaling. In addition to the BAR domain that senses membrane curvature, SNX9 also contains a PX domain to interact with phosphoinositides and a SH3 domain to interact with membrane-remodeling proteins. The physiological functions of SNX9 in T cells are not fully understood.</p><p>The major strength of this manuscript is its application of multiple imaging technologies in measuring CD28-SNX9 interaction, which can be further strengthened by additional biochemical experiments. Through the knockout strategy, the authors showed that SNX9 promotes CD28 signaling, which agrees with its role in promoting CD28 clustering. The physiological importance of SNX9 can be further established by applying other manipulation strategies including SNX9 overexpression and mutations.</p><p>This manuscript highlights a fact that different immunoreceptors are subject to specific regulations. Understanding the detailed mechanisms can pave the way for developing new immunotherapies based on precise manipulation of immunoreceptor signaling.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. CD28-SNX9 interaction needs to be further confirmed. In addition to the nice imaging experiments showing co-localization between CD28 and SNX9, biochemical experiments such as co-immunoprecipitation will be helpful to confirm the interaction and the key interaction sites. Or if the interaction is rather indirect, can the authors provide the bridging mechanism?</p><p>2. The regulation of CD28 clustering by SNX9 needs to be further studied. The authors suggest that SNX9 contributes to regulate the rates of exchange of CD28 in and out of clusters and thereby their stability. If that is the case, CD28 clustering dynamics, in particularly at later time points when clusters disassemble, should be affected by manipulation of SNX9 levels. In addition to the snapshot images shown in Figure 5A, real-time TIRF imaging should be more informative to show the impacts of SNX9 manipulation. The authors proposed that SNX9 might regulate local lipid environment to stabilize CD28 clustering. This idea can be tested in a straightforward way by using widely used lipid probes. Moreover, the binding between CD28 cytoplasmic domain with the plasma membrane can also be imaged when SNX9 levels are altered.</p><p>3. The function of SNX9 in CD28 signaling needed to be further demonstrated. In addition to the SNX9 knockout strategy, the SNX9 overexpression strategy and mutation strategy (mutating PX or SH3 domain) should be applied to see the functional outcomes of CD28 signaling.</p><p>4. In terms of CD28 internalization, can the authors comment why they observe opposing results as Badour et al., (PNAS 2007)? In Figure S5, it seems that SNX9-KO#4 cells had higher levels of CD28 internalization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper by Ecker et al., elegantly documents the role of SNX9 in CD28 clustering. The analysis is at a high level and the paper should be of interest to investigators in the field. The major shortcoming is the focus on the use of Jurkat T-cells as a model for their work. This choice is a puzzle since Jurkat cells have been well documented to have major defects in key signaling pathways linked to CD28 function such as a lack of PTEN which has major effect on the expression level of D-3 lipids which play in role in SNX9 function. The paper needs to include more data on primary T-cells and if possible from confirmation of their findings in T-cells interacting with normal antigen presenting cells and in response to the natural ligands CD80/CD86. There are many TCR transgenic mouse models which respond to specific antigens presented by dendritic cells. This is a normal expectation and would greatly strengthen the paper. The authors should also address there any evidence of binding in SNX9-CD28 binding in their studies (i.e. co-IP?) and how the data fits with the AP2 complex and PKCtheta interations with CD28. There are also some issues related to sample size and statistics that need to be addressed in one figure.</p><p>Specific Points</p><p>1) The paper needs to include more data on primary T-cells and if possible from confirmation of their findings in T-cells interacting with normal antigen presenting cells. There are many TCR transgenic mouse models which respond to specific antigens presented by dendritic cells. This is a normal expectation and would greatly strengthen the paper.</p><p>2) The implications related to CD28 endocytosis seem important. In Figure S5, the authors present some data but it is puzzling. Firstly, the behaviour of KO#3 vs KO#4 seem different…why? If there are differences between the two Kos, is this not a problem for the other analysis? Secondly, there seem only 2 points for WT making the statistical analysis unclear. Some mention of the observation that YMXM mutations affect CD28 π 3K binding endocytosis should be made (PMID: 9498761).</p><p>3) Is there any evidence of binding in SNX9-CD28 binding in their studies (i.e. co-IP?) and is the AP2 complex part of the cluster or does this binding occur after the involvement of SNX9?</p><p>4) It is unclear whether the connection between SNX9 and CD28 is unique or is CD28 simply a surrogate for other receptors such as the TCR complex? It is too bad that CTLA-4 is not present…this is be very exciting if CTLA-4 disrupted the link between SNX9 and CD28 as might be seen with pre-activated T-cells?</p><p>5) Figure 1: analysis is done on slides with anti-CD3 and CD28; however it is important to show some analysis with immobilised CD80 or CD86 to be certain that the effects seen are not due to some artificial effect of high affinity antibody rather than natural ligand. It is not necessary to do all the analysis with natural ligand but at least to replicate some of the key features.</p><p>6) It is still not clear show the clustering specifically relates to the formation of the c-SMAC and p-SMAC…do the authors have images that include LFA-1 as a marker for the pSMAC? PKCtheta localisation is connected to CD28 but is SNX9 connected to PKCtheta which in turn leads to CD28…what is the model?</p><p>7) Figure 6: Panel C..which pTCR? Zeta and CD3 ITAMs? Panel E: the authors need to explain more clearly what their standard is for NFAT nuclear localisation (i.e. 50% is scored positive?) It is also noteworthy that some cells in the SNX9KO overlap with wild type cells…is there an explanation? Is it that T-cells are heterogenous in their dependency on SNX9-CD28…this could be quite interesting if true?</p><p>8) Figure S4: small point…no impact on Lck, but do tyrosine kinase inhibitors interfere with SNX9-CD28..is the process tyrosine phosphorylation dependent? An easy experiment to do.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67550.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Four essential revisions are needed:</p><p>1.

Even if Jurkat T cells are an extensively validated model of T cell activation and immunological synapse formation, primary cell data was missing from the original submission. As suggested, we have used a transgenic mouse model to validate the co-recruitment to the immunological synapse of CD28 and SNX9. We used primary CD4 T cells isolated from OT-II transgenic mice, which were activated with LPS-matured mouse bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) pulsed with the OT-II peptide. BMDCs express high levels of SNX9, which prevented clear visualisation of SNX9 recruitment to the T cell synapse by immunofluorescence. We therefore virally transduced the OT-II T cells so that they expressed SNX9-GFP and detected CD28 with an antibody.</p><p>These experiments confirmed the data obtained in Jurkat cells (new Figure 1—figure supplement 1). SNX9 was unambiguously recruited to the immunological synapse of CD4 T cell, where it co-localised with CD28. These images further show that SNX9 was cytosolic in primary CD4 T cells interacting with BMDCs that did not present the OT-II peptide, confirming that SNX9 is recruited to membranous structures only in activated T cells. The main text has been amended to include these results (lines 122-130, 140-142, 218-220).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

These are visible in the enface views of 3D reconstructions of Z-stacks. Importantly, such double-positive puncta were not visible in conjugate where Raji B cells had not been pulsed with super antigen.

Similarly, we observed no nuclear translocation of NFAT in cells plated on PLL (Figure 7E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>– Figure 1: analysis is done on slides with anti-CD3 and CD28; however it is important to show some analysis with immobilised CD80 or CD86 to be certain that the effects seen are not due to some artificial effect of high affinity antibody rather than natural ligand.

We also would like to point out that one of the functional consequences of SNX9 knock-out – secretion of IL-2 – has been investigated using stimulation by antigen-presenting cells, which further indicates that the importance of SNX9 for CD28 signalling is not only observable in the context of CD28 cross-linking by high-affinity antibodies onto an immobilised surface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Similarly, we detected no SNX9 after immunoprecipitation with an antibody against CD28. These data support the hypothesis presented in the discussion, which postulates that the SNX9 contribution to CD28 signalling is probably to generate a favourable membrane environment (curvature or charge), as opposed to relying on a direct physical interaction between the two proteins.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis of the interaction between SNX9 and CD28.</title><p>SNX9knock-out Jurkat T cells were retrovirally reconstituted to stably express GFP-SNX9.

However, while SNX9 maximum peaks above CD28 maximum, this difference is not statistically significant, and we have modified the main text accordingly (lines 182-187). Of note, the lack of statistical significance is most likely because of the signal of the SNX9positive tubules extends from 0 to 250 nm from the plasma membrane (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1, EM quantification), which prevents distinguishing between these tubules and CD28 clusters in the plasma membrane using Airy scan confocal microscopy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The methods relating to Figure 1E state that ‘endosomes were first identified by manual thresholding’. The authors should describe why that was done, how that was done in detail and preferentially show supplementary data how this affects the figure. This is important as Figure 1E established a dominant role of CD28 in SNX9 recruitment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing that we had not sufficiently described how an intensitybased threshold was used to identify the intracellular structures in Figure 1E. For better clarity, we have added a new figure supplement (2) to Figure 1 that describes step by step the workflow used in ImageJ to quantify these structures, which we mention in the main text line 138. We also have amended the methods to be more accurate as to how we have performed this quantification (lines 803-808).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The colocalization between CD28 and SNX9 in Figure 2A/B should be quantified. This is important as the figure makes the argument that CD28 signaling is not required for SNX9 recruitment. However, the visual inspection of the two representative traces suggests better colocalization of CD28 with SNX9 than CD28YF. Inclusion of a negative control to establish a baseline of random colocalization would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, this quantification was missing and so was a negative control (no expected colocalization). We used a similar intensity-based threshold approach as now described in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 to generate a mask of the overlap between the GPF (CD28) and Alexa-647 (SNX9) channels. We have modified the methods to add a description of this analysis (lines 809-817) and the main text to mention its outcome (lines 203-209). These results are now shown in a new figure panel (Figure 2C) and new supplement (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The reviewer’s visual inspection was confirmed by our analysis, as there is a clear tendency to a lower overlap between SNX9 clusters and the YF mutant than with WTCD28, although the difference was not significant. Nevertheless, it suggests that phosphorylation of CD28 contributes to recruit SNX9 to CD28 clusters, which we would not have been aware of without the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– With regard to Figure 3A the authors state that they ‘did not observe formation of any endosomal structures positive for SNX9-Pamcherry’. If they would like to make the statement, it should be supported by quantitative data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noting the lack of relevant quantification. To overcome this oversight, we applied again an intensity-based threshold to identify the number of vesicles after photoactivation of TCRζPA-mCherry and SNX9-PamCherry (described in the methods, lines 819-823). This quantification, which confirms our statement about the absence of SNX9positive vesicles following photoactivation, is mentioned line 300-302 and is now a new supplement (Figure 3—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Using images to understand biology is rewarding because of their high information content, yet it requires rigorous quantification. In particular any new structure of interest should be defined in quantitative terms rather than presented through representative images. This applies prominently to the CD28 ‘ridges’ in Figure 2 and the CD28/SNX9-associated ‘tubules’ in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer concerning the ridges in Figure 2. These structures are commonly observed in T cell activated on antibody coated cover glassed and have been reported and described before, typically in the paper by Sherman et al., which we cite in the main text line 225. We actually mentioned these ridges only because they had been reported before in the context of T cells being dropped on antibody-coated glass, merely to indicate that we observed what others had observed before. If the reviewer considers that these structures should nevertheless be thoroughly quantified, we will happily remove any reference to them, as nowhere else in the manuscript we mentioned these ridges and they play no role in the model we put forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Similarly, Figure 4 shows that tubules occur in regions where there is CD28 and SNX9. By visual inspection of the single representative image set, tubules also occur outside the areas of CD28 and SNX9 accumulation. The authors should identify tubules independently in the EM images (e.g. length, frequency) and then calculate whether they are enriched in areas of CD28 fluorescence, SNX9 fluorescence and areas positive for both. In addition, a detailed description of how the fluorescence and EM data were aligned would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we have analysed the EM images using IMOD. We identified individual tubules based on (1) co-localisation with SNX9 and CD28 fluorescence signal; (2) connection to the plasma membrane and (3) electron density consistent with either other SNX9 tubules, endoplasmic reticulum tubules or clathrin-coated pits. We next quantified the length, surface area and volume of these tubules. The images showing the quantification approach and its results are now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. These results indicate a clear tendency for tubules originating from CD28-rich area of the plasma membrane to be SNX9-positive and longer than other tubules identified at the immunological synapse. This has been added to the description of the EM data, lines 353-361 and to the methods lines 840-847.</p><p>We also have added a more detailed description of how the fluorescence and EM data were aligned in the methods (lines 783-788).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 5E/F the authors have chosen to quantify fluorescence recovery at 380s showing a slight delay upon SNX9 knockout. At earlier time points up to 240 s they would reach a partially different conclusion, as one of the two knock out cell lines behaves the same as the control. This should be acknowledged, and conclusions should be modified accordingly. In the same experiment it would be good to know how much overexpression of SNX9 changes its expression level relative to endogenous protein expression</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, the recovery curve of the KO#4 diverges from the WT only at later times points. We did acknowledge this in the original version of the manuscript (line 398).</p><p>We were however sensitive to the reviewer’s scepticism about the divergence at 380 sec and have performed further analyses to strengthen our conclusion. We have fitted the normalized recovery curves with bi-exponential decay model (with the goodness-of-fit confirmed by the sum of the weighted summed square of residuals). The kinetic constant characterizing the slow recovery process tau2 of both KO#3 and KO#4 differed significantly from the WT ones, confirming that fluorescence recovery is different in the WT than in both knock-out cell lines. Together with our original analysis, we believe there is better recovery in fluorescence in both KO cells and would prefer not to modify our conclusions.</p><p>We have added a reference to the results of this analysis in the main text (lines 399-405), a detailed description of how it was performed in the methods (lines 829-835) and show the charts corresponding to this analysis in a new Supplement (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Finally, we understand the reviewer’s concern regarding CD28 expression in the Kos, as it might indeed affect the recovery curves. However, data in the original version of the manuscript, Figure 6, indicated that CD28 expression (measured by flow cytometry) is not affected by the absence of SNX9. We have amended the main text to refer to this figure when we describe the FRAP data (lines 406-408).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>– Figure 6: Panel C..which pTCR? Zeta and CD3 ITAMs?Panel E: the authors need to explain more clearly what their standard is for NFAT nuclear localisation (i.e. 50% is scored positive?).</p></disp-quote><p>The main text mentions the subunit of the TCR complex that is targeted by this antibody (TCRζ-Y142, line 483). However, the reviewer is correct, this was missing in the figure This has been corrected (lines 492).</p><p>We further apologise for the insufficient description of the way we quantified NFAT nuclear translocation. We did not use a scoring approach but only integrated NFAT fluorescence intensity over the Hoechst-stained nucleus. What is plotted in 7F is the percentage of the total NFAT fluorescence intensity measured in nuclei in relation to the total NFAT fluorescence detected. We have amended the figure legend (lines 496-498), the main text (line 511) and the methods (lines 836-837) to avoid that confusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
