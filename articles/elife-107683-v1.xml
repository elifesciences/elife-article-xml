but its efficacy remains debated. While some reported successful conversion, others disputed this, citing a lack of neuronal gene expression as evidence of failed reprogramming. This interpretation was further challenged, attributed to incomplete PTBP1 inactivation, fueling ongoing controversy. Mechanistic understanding of the conversion, or the lack thereof, requires investigating, in conjunction with lineage tracing, the effect of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss of function in mature astrocytes on RNA splicing, which has not yet been examined. Here, we genetically ablated PTBP1 in adult Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 Ai14 mice to determine whether lineage-traced <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout astrocytes exhibited RNA splicing alterations congruent with neuronal differentiation. We found no widespread induction of neurons, despite a minuscule fraction of knockout cells showing neuron-like transcriptomic signatures. Importantly, PTBP1 loss in mature astrocytes induced splicing alterations unlike neuronal splicing patterns. These findings suggest that targeting PTBP1 alone is ineffective to drive neuronal reprogramming and highlight the need for combining splicing and lineage analyses. Loss of astrocytic PTBP1 is insufficient to induce neuronal splicing, contrasting with its well-known role in other non-neuronal cells, and instead affects a distinct astrocytic splicing program.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PTB</kwd><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>neuronal cell fate</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05h1kgg64</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS125276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Sika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PTBP1 loss in mature astrocytes causes unique astrocytic splicing changes, not neuronal-like, contrasting its role in other non-neuronal cells and indicating PTBP1 depletion alone is ineffective to drive adult-astrocyte-to-neuron conversion.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) possess limited regenerative capacity, posing a great challenge in restoring brain function in neurodegenerative disease. The irreversible nature of CNS damage has spurred a wave of effort to convert non-neuronal cells into functional neurons to compensate for those lost in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bocchi et al., 2022</xref>). The use of endogenous cells for direct neuronal conversion presents key advantages stemming from their proliferative capacity, maintenance of epigenetic and transcriptomic aging signatures lost upon reprogramming to stem cells, and bypassing a proliferative intermediate stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mertens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Diverse neuronal conversion protocols targeting microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuda et al., 2019</xref>), fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Torper et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoo et al., 2011</xref>), oligodendrocyte precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heinrich et al., 2014</xref>), pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Karow et al., 2018</xref>), and astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mattugini et al., 2019</xref> have shown feasibility of neural reprogramming. However, such approaches remain controversial for therapeutic application. <italic>In vivo</italic> neuronal reprogramming studies often achieve variable levels of success and provide inadequate evidence to explicitly show converted neurons originate from endogenous non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qian et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rao et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Recent reports have aimed to achieve neuronal reprogramming in the brain through depletion of polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu and Mobley, 2023</xref>). PTBP1 is an RNA-binding protein that functions as a master repressor of neuronal splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vuong et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vuong et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). To date, seven studies have reported the success of glial <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion to induce neuronal conversion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Initial observations by Weinberg et al. demonstrated an apparent generation of functional striatal neurons from oligodendrocytes targeted by an oligotropic adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding <italic>Ptbp1</italic> siRNAs in wild-type rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weinberg et al., 2017</xref>). Qian et al. employed delivery of AAV vectors encoding <italic>Ptbp1</italic> shRNA as well as <italic>Ptbp1</italic> antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) into the substantia nigra of 6-hydroxydopamine-treated (6-OHDA) mice modeling Parkinson’s disease (PD) and reported generation of new neurons and reversal of PD phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qian et al., 2020</xref>). Zhou et al. delivered CRISPR-CasRx guide RNAs targeting <italic>Ptbp1</italic> mRNA to 6-OHDA mouse striatum and reported induction of dopaminergic neurons and rescue of motor deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Maimon et al. used intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery of anti-<italic>Ptbp1</italic> ASO to generate new neurons in aged wild-type mouse hippocampus and improve cognitive measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maimon et al., 2021</xref>). Yang et al. reported neuronal reprogramming of astrocytes in a mouse model of spinal cord injury by viral GFAP promoter-driven <italic>Ptbp1</italic> shRNA administration and accompanying recovery of motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2023a</xref>). Yuan et al. used viral delivery of GFAP promoter-driven <italic>Ptbp1</italic> shRNA into the cortex of an ischemic stroke mouse model to induce astrocyte-to-neuron conversion and reported brain tissue repair of the infarction site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yuan et al., 2024</xref>). Fukui et al. virally transduced astrocytes with <italic>AAV-pGFAP-CasRx-SgRNA-Ptbp1</italic> by tail vein injection into adult mice following ischemic stroke and reported generation of neurons in the dentate gyrus and rescue of memory deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fukui et al., 2024</xref>). However, some studies have called this reprogramming approach into question. For example, Guo et al. failed to detect converted hippocampal, striatal, or substantia nigral neurons upon <italic>AAV-GFAP-shPtbp1</italic> injection in both wild-type and modeled Alzheimer’s disease mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>These studies exercised a variety of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> targeting approaches across a range of disease models but did not demonstrate that newly converted neurons truly arose from resident glial cells. Subsequent studies have conducted lineage tracing experiments to investigate the effects of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss on glia-to-neuron conversion. Wang et al. delivered AAVs encoding <italic>Ptbp1</italic> shRNA or <italic>AAV-GFAP-CasRx-Ptbp1</italic> and a fluorescent reporter to the striatum of an astrocyte lineage-tracing mouse model and found no co-labeling of lineage-traced astrocytes with <italic>Ptbp1</italic>-depleted neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Chen et al. employed Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 mice bred with hemagglutinin (HA) reporter mice to lineage trace reactive astrocytes in the substantia nigra or striatum of 6-OHDA mice treated with <italic>AAV-shPtbp1</italic> or <italic>Ptbp1</italic> ASO and observed no neuronal conversion in traced glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Hoang et al. found similar results in the mouse retina upon genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout (KO) by tamoxifen induction in GLAST-Cre/ERT2; Sun1-GFP<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>; <italic>Ptbp1</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice in Mϋller glia, with only subtle changes in gene expression by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of <italic>Ptbp1</italic>-depleted Mϋller glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoang et al., 2022</xref>). A follow-up study using Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2; Sun1-GFP<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>; <italic>Ptbp1</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice provided identical results by 2, 4, and 8 weeks following Cre induction in mouse cortex, striatum, and substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoang et al., 2023</xref>). Taken together, these independent studies have cast doubt on <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss-of-function approaches for neuronal reprogramming <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Counterarguments against the lack of astrocyte-to-neuron conversion have emerged, concerning the degree of PTBP1 depletion and inconsistency between approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2023</xref>). First, insufficient knockdown of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> using RNAi or CRISPR systems may result in ineffective loss of function. Second, durations following PTBP1 depletion do not align precisely between studies. Even <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoang et al., 2023</xref> investigation using a genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout was challenged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2023</xref> for inefficiencies, who attributed the lack of gene expression changes based on the scRNA-seq data obtained at 4 weeks after 4-OHT induction of knockout to ineffective PTBP1 depletion.</p><p>The controversy centers on the interpretation of the absence of gene expression changes: Hao et al. interpreted this as an insufficient loss of PTBP1 function, while Hoang et al. viewed it as a failure of astrocyte-to-neuron conversion. Indeed, no prior studies on astrocyte-to-neuron conversion, including those reporting positive conversion, have investigated PTBP1’s well-established molecular function of regulating alternative splicing.</p><p>Thus, three key issues remain concerning the effectiveness of adult <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss of function on neuronal reprogramming in the brain. First, no study has simultaneously examined the impact of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss on both alternative splicing and cellular changes, which is needed to firmly establish, or rule out, a direct relationship between PTBP1’s molecular function and its influence on neuronal reprogramming. The downstream effect of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss on alternative splicing in astrocytes remains unknown. Second, additional <italic>Ptbp1</italic> genetic mutants are needed to rigorously evaluate <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss of function <italic>in vivo</italic> as only one previous study has used genetic deletion. This is necessary because Hao et al. argued that complete deletion of PTBP1 induced cell death and there could be off-target effects of various knockdown approaches in prior publications. Third, a thorough investigation of transcriptomic changes upon astrocytic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout for a longer period matching those in reports of positive conversion is needed for a fair comparison.</p><p>Here, we address both the RNA splicing and cell type changes following PTBP1 depletion in mature astrocytes using astrocyte-specific inducible <italic>Ptbp1</italic> conditional knockout (<italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO) mice carrying a different <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loxP allele than the one in Hoang’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoang et al., 2023</xref>). We performed genetic lineage tracing and enriched the control and <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes in adult <italic>Ptbp1</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup>;tdT<italic><sup>+/-</sup>;</italic>Aldh1l1-Cre<italic><sup>+/-</sup></italic>mice for scRNA-seq analysis as well as for bulk RNA-seq and splicing analysis following <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion. We observed efficient depletion of PTBP1 from astrocytes but no neuronal conversion in <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO mice at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion. Our RNA-seq analysis of <italic>Ptbp1</italic>-depleted astrocytes showed minimal alterations in astrocytic gene expression but obvious changes in RNA splicing profiles, confirming loss of PTBP1 function. However, these splicing changes do not resemble the characteristics typically observed in neuronal splicing. ScRNA-seq analysis further revealed limited astrocyte-to-neuron conversion following genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss. We conclude that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion in mature astrocytes effectively alters RNA splicing but is insufficient to induce widespread neuronal conversion. Intriguingly, our findings also indicate that PTBP1 in mature astrocytes, unlike in other non-neuronal cell types, is a dispensable repressor of neuronal splicing and controls a distinct astrocytic splicing program.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishing an astrocyte-specific <italic>Ptbp1</italic> conditional KO (cKO) mouse model</title><p>To specifically knockout <italic>Ptbp1</italic> in mature astrocytes, we crossed <italic>Ptbp1</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice containing loxP sites flanking <italic>Ptbp1</italic> exon 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stork et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yeom et al., 2018</xref>) with the astrocyte-specific tamoxifen-inducible mouse line Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>), and with a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line Ai14 (LSL-tdTomato-WPRE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

For a fair comparison, we assessed the degree of neuronal conversion at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after tamoxifen injection to fully cover previously reported investigation windows.

The presence of these Cre+ Exc-1 cells, exclusively in <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO but not in control samples, hints at the potential of a very small subset of Aldh1l1+ astrocytes (&lt;1%) for <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss to facilitate neuron-like identity. On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility of rare neuronal expression of Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 in individual animals, since in our lineage tracing experiments we also observed a very small fraction (&lt;1%) of tdT<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells in animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using a genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout approach in combination with lineage tracing and transcriptomic analyses, we found little evidence to support that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss of function efficiently induces astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in the adult mouse brain. Our lineage tracing data accord with recent studies that examined the effects of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss through AAV, Cas13X, ASO, and genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2023b</xref>). Our RNA-seq data from <italic>Ptbp1</italic>-depleted astrocytes shows no enhancement of neuron-related gene expression, and our scRNA-seq analysis did not uncover any widespread changes in cell type proportion at 12 weeks after <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion apart from a very small subgroup of Cre+ neurons with unknown origin.</p><p>Our study is the first to examine RNA splicing changes in <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes. In contrast to minimal gene expression changes, <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes exhibit widespread splicing alterations, confirming PTBP1’s splicing regulatory function and a clear loss of PTBP1 function in our isolated astrocytes. As a well-characterized repressor of neuronal RNA splicing, PTBP1 has been shown to regulate brain-specific exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Makeyev et al., 2007</xref>). Our analysis in mature astrocytes suggests that PTBP1 regulates a core astrocytic splicing network distinct from its neuronal or developmental splicing regulatory role. While the function of astrocyte-specific PTBP1 splicing regulation remains to be understood, our data indicate that loss of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> in mature astrocytes is not sufficient to induce neuron-specific splicing patterns, unlike its well-established effect in other non-neuronal cell types.</p><p>Previous genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout studies have used mutant mice harboring loxP sites flanking the <italic>Ptbp1</italic> promoter and the first exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shibayama et al., 2009</xref>). Our study produced similar findings by using a different <italic>Ptbp1</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mouse line carrying loxP sites that flank the second exon. We confirmed our <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion was exclusive and specific to astrocytes using the Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 transgenic mice and the Ai14 Cre-reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our genetic targeting approach mitigates concerns of leaky neuronal Cre expression associated with GFAP-based reagents or promoters raised by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bocchi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings reinforce the conclusion that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion in astrocytes is not sufficient to induce neuronal conversion irrespective of the genetic targeting method employed to induce <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss. We did not detect broad induction of neuronal cell types among <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes in our scRNA-seq analysis, but uncovered a very small subpopulation of Cre+ excitatory neurons among <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO cells. These cells make up &lt;0.5% <italic>Ptbp1</italic>-depleted cells, indicating that while <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss could promote acquisition of neuronal identity, such a phenomenon is exceedingly rare or may be an experimental artifact.</p><p>Discrepancies in previous reports on <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockdown-mediated astrocyte-to-neuron conversion have raised arguments for phenotypic improvements and the cellular origin of converted neurons. GFAP promoter leakage in neurons may account for widespread reporter expression in endogenous neurons during AAV-based <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Rescue of disease and aging phenotypes upon <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion in astrocytes in the absence of neuronal conversion has been speculated to occur by trophic remodeling of local cellular environment and suppression of pro-inflammatory responses in glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fu and Mobley, 2023</xref>). While it is possible that induction of the astrocyte-specific network of PTBP1-regulated splicing observed in <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes could mediate a protective response supporting phenotypic recovery, our GO enrichment analysis did not uncover upregulation of ontologies related to neurotrophic effects or inflammatory responses. The possibility remains that other glial cell types are responsible for the increased neuronal populations reported in previous studies of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockdown. ASO-mediated knockdown of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> has been shown to activate neurogenesis in ependymal cells within neurogenic niches of the subventricular zone (SVZ) in aged mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maimon and Chillon-Marinas, 2024</xref>). Radial glial cells residing in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus have also been shown to possess neurogenic capacity in adult rodents in physiological conditions and upon <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grelat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maimon and Chillon-Marinas, 2024</xref>). These glial-like subpopulations may represent the original sources of converted neurons, but the extent to which they obtain intrinsic neurogenic potential to be susceptible to reprogramming remains to be further investigated. More importantly, considering the stem-cell-like features of these cell populations, whether the observed reporter-positive new-born neurons originate from the reprogramming or reactivated proliferation still needs to be carefully characterized.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations of current studies and future directions</title><p>Molecular markers and transcriptomic analyses provide an important assessment of key molecular changes and alterations of transcriptome-defined cell states associated with <italic>in vivo</italic> reprogramming but do not capture any cellular or morphological transformation.

Correlations in gene expression and splicing profiles were then assessed for DEGs and DSEs detected either in astrocytes or neuronal samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p>Both mouse brain cortices were collected 12 weeks after tamoxifen injection and subjected to single-cell isolation. After cell sorting, the single-cell suspension of tdT<sup>+</sup> cells was approximately adjusted to 1000 cells/ul, and the procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions for Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' GEM, Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v3.1 (10x Genomics # 1000128). To enrich the tdT<sup>+</sup> cells, for each animal, the cells subjected to 10× procedure were mixed as a 1:1 ratio of tdT<sup>+</sup> and tdT<sup>-</sup> from the same animal.</p><p>For quantification of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) in our scRNA-seq reads from <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout samples, we employed the Snakemake workflow ‘kb-nac.smk’ from SnakeNgs (version 0.2.0).

We ran this workflow with customized genome and transcript annotation files that contain tdTomato and Cre gene sequences as well as the reference Gencode mouse genes. The UMI count matrix was then processed by Scanpy (version 1.9.5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>).

Indeed, the deletion of exon 2 introduces a frameshift that is predicted to disrupt the PTBP1 open reading frame and trigger nonsensemediated decay (NMD). While our CPM-normalized coverage plots (Figure 4D) and gene-level expression analysis (Figure 6A) suggest that PTBP1 mRNA levels remain largely unchanged in cKO astrocytes, we acknowledge that this observation is counterintuitive and merits further clarification.</p><p>We suspect that the process of brain tissue dissociation and FACS sorting for bulk or single cell RNA-seq may enrich for nucleic material and thus dilute the NMD signal, which occurs in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, the transcripts (like other genes) may escape NMD for unknown mechanisms. Although a frameshift is a strong indicator for triggering NMD, it does not guarantee NMD will occur in every case. (lines 346-353)</p><p>Regarding the validation of PTBP1 protein depletion in cKO astrocytes by Western blotting, we acknowledge that orthogonal approaches to confirm PTBP1 elimination would address uncertainty around the effect of exon 2 deletion on PTBP1 expression. The low cell yield of cKO astrocytes vis FACS poses a significant burden on obtaining sufficient samples for immunoblotting detection of PTBP1 depletion. On average 3-5 adult animals per genotype (with three different alleles) are needed for each biological replicate. The manuscript contains PTBP1 immunofluorescence staining of brain slides to demonstrate PTBP1 deletion (Figures 1-2, Figure 3 supplement 1). Our characterization of this Ptbp1 deletion allele in other contexts show the loss of full length PTBP1 proteins in ESCs using Western blotting (PMID: 30496473). Furthermore, germline homozygous mutant mice do not survive beyond embryonic day 6, supporting that it is a loss of function allele.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should analyze PTBP1 expression in WT and cKO substantia nigra samples shown in Figure 3 or justify why this analysis is not necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important question. Although we are using an astrocyte-specific PTBP1 knockout (KO) mouse model, which is designed to delete PTBP1 in all the astrocyte throughout mouse brain, and although we have systematically verified PTBP1 elimination in different mouse brain regions (cortex and striatum) at multiple time points (from 4w to 12w after tamoxifen administration), we agree that it remains necessary and important to demonstrate whether the observed lack of astrocyte-to-neuron conversion is indeed associated with sufficient PTBP1 depletion.</p><p>We have analyzed the PTBP1 expression in the substantia nigra, as we did in the cortex and striatum. We added a new figure (Figure 3-figure supplement 1) to show the results. We found in cKO samples, tdT+ cells lack PTBP1 immunostaining, and there is no overlapping of NeuN+ and tdT+ signals. These results show effective PTBP1 depletion in the substantia nigra, similar to that observed in the cortex and striatum.

We agree that assessing the positional distribution of CU-rich motifs between PTBP1-activated and PTBP1-repressed exons would provide valuable insight into the position-specific regulatory mechanisms of PTBP1. In response, we have performed separate motif enrichment analyses for PTBP1-activated and PTBP1-repressed exons and examined whether their positional patterns differ (Figure 4–figure supplement 2).</p><p>Our analysis revealed that CU-rich motifs were significantly enriched in the upstream introns of both activated and repressed exons by PTBP1 loss, with higher enrichment observed in repressed exons (Enrichment ratio = 2.14, q = 9.00×10-5) compared to activated exons (Enrichment ratio = 1.72, q = 7.75×10-5) (Figure 4–figure supplement 2B–C). In contrast, no CU-rich motifs were found downstream of activated exons (Figure 4–figure supplement 2D), while a weak, non-significant enrichment was observed downstream of repressed exons (Enrichment ratio = 1.21, q = 0.225; Figure 4–figure supplement 2E). These results do not necessarily fully fit with a couple of earlier PTBP1 CLIP studies showing differential PTBP1 binding for repressed vs activated exons but are more in line with the Black Lab study (PMID: 24499931) that PTBP1 binds upstream introns of both repressed and activated exons. Either case, PTBP1 affects a diverse set of alternative exons and likely involves diverse contextdependent binding patterns (lines 244-257).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The analyses in Figure 5 and its supplement strongly suggest that the splicing changes in PTBP1-depleted astrocytes are distinct from those occurring during neuronal differentiation.

We agree that transcriptome-wide differences in gene expression between astrocytes and developing neurons could confound the interpretation of splicing differences. To address this concern, we have incorporated publicly available RNA-seq datasets from studies in which astrocytes are reprogrammed into neurons using proneural transcription factors, Ngn2 or PmutNgn2 (PMID: 38956165).</p><p>The results of principal component analysis (PCA) for splicing profiles revealed that the <italic>in vivo</italic> splicing profiles from this study and the <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing profiles from PMID 38956165 are well separated on PC1 and PC2. While Ngn2/PmutNgn2-induced neurons and control astrocytes started to show distinction on PC3 (and to some degree on PC4), Ptbp1 cKO samples remained tightly grouped with control astrocytes and showed no directional shift toward the neuronal cluster (Figure 5–figure supplement 2B). These findings further support the conclusion that PTBP1 depletion in mature astrocytes does not induce a neuronal-like splicing program, even when compared against neurons derived from the astrocyte lineage (lines 306318).</p><p>The pairwise correlation analysis of percent spliced in between Ptbp1 cKO, control astrocytes, and induced neurons confirmed that Ptbp1 cKO astrocytes are highly similar to control astrocytes (ρ = 0.81) and clearly distinct from induced neurons (ρ = 0.62) (Figure 5– figure supplement 2C), reinforcing the notion that PTBP1 loss alone is insufficient to drive a neuronal-like splicing transition (lines 319-336).</p><p>Consistent with the analysis for splicing profiles, PCA for gene expression profiles showed that control and Ptbp1 cKO astrocytes clustered tightly together and no directional shift toward the neuronal cluster while Ngn2/PmutNgn2-induced neurons and control astrocytes were distributed across a broader range (Figure 6–figure supplement 1A–B). Correlation analysis further supported this result, with a strong similarity between Ptbp1 cKO and control astrocytes (ρ = 0.97), and low similarity between Ptbp1 cKO astrocytes and induced neurons (ρ = 0.27) (Figure 6–figure supplement 1C). These findings indicate that, even with PTBP1 loss, cKO astrocytes retain a transcriptional profile very distinct from that of neurons, underscoring that Ptbp1 deficiency alone does not induce astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming at the transcriptomic level (lines 366-373).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Zhang and colleagues describes a study that investigated whether the deletion of PTBP1 in adult astrocytes in mice led to an astrocyte-to-neuron conversion.

The idea is to compare the splicing pattern change caused by PTBP1 deletion in astrocytes to what occurs during neurodevelopment. This is an important experiment that will help illuminate whether the astrocyte-to-neuron transition occurred in the system. The result was consistent with that of the cell staining experiments: no significant transition was detected.</p><p>These experiments demonstrate that, in this experimental setting, PTBT1 deletion in adult astrocytes did not convert the cells to neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a well-designed, elegantly conducted, and clearly described study that addresses an important question. The conclusions provide important information to the field.</p><p>To this reviewer, this study provided convincing and solid experimental evidence to support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The Discussion in this manuscript is short and can be expanded. Can the authors speculate what led to the contradictory results in the published studies? The current study, in combination with the study published in Cell in 2021 by Wang and colleagues, suggests that observed difference is not caused by the difference of knockdown vs. knockout. Is it possible that other glial cell types are responsible for the transition? If so, what cells? Oligodendrocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s careful reading and valuable suggestions. We have expanded the Discussion to include discussion of possible origins of glial cells responsible for neuronal transition.
