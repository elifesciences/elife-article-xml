Here, we use immune cell type-specific methylation patterns in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) for studying human immune cell dynamics. We characterized cfDNA released from specific immune cell types in healthy individuals (N = 242), cross sectionally and longitudinally. Immune cfDNA levels had no individual steady state as opposed to blood cell counts, suggesting that cfDNA concentration reflects adjustment of cell survival to maintain homeostatic cell numbers. We also observed selective elevation of immune-derived cfDNA upon perturbations of immune homeostasis. Following influenza vaccination (N = 92), B-cell-derived cfDNA levels increased prior to elevated B-cell counts and predicted efficacy of antibody production. Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis (N = 21) and B-cell lymphoma (N = 27) showed selective elevation of eosinophil and B-cell cfDNA, respectively, which were undetectable by cell counts in blood. Immune-derived cfDNA provides a novel biomarker for monitoring immune responses to physiological and pathological processes that are not accessible using conventional methods.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circulating biomarkers for monitoring inflammatory or immune responses are an essential part of diagnostic medicine and an important tool for studying physiological and pathological processes. These include, among others, counts of specific immune cell types in peripheral blood, RNA expression profiles in blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maas et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tuller et al., 2013</xref>), and levels of circulating proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gabay and Kushner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sproston and Ashworth, 2018</xref>). A major limitation of circulating immune cell analysis is that it often fails to report on immune processes taking place in remote locations. Conversely, CRP and similar proteins do reflect the presence of tissue inflammation but are highly non-specific with regard to tissue location and the nature of inflammatory process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gabay and Kushner, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Dying cells release nucleosome-size fragments of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which travel transiently in blood before being cleared by the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heitzer et al., 2019</xref>). Analysis of the sequence of such fragments is emerging as a powerful diagnostic modality. Liquid biopsies using cfDNA have been applied to reveal the presence of mutations in a fetus as reflected in maternal cfDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lo et al., 1997</xref>), identify and monitor tumor dynamics via the presence of somatic mutations in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wan et al., 2017</xref>), and detect the rejection of transplanted organs when the levels of donor-derived DNA markers are elevated in recipient plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Vlaminck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Vlaminck et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, we and others have shown that tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns can be used to determine the tissue origins of cfDNA, allowing to infer cell death dynamics in health and disease even when no genetic differences exist between the host and the tissue of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehmann-Werman et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although the majority of cfDNA in healthy individuals is known to originate in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehmann-Werman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moss et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2015</xref>), it has often been regarded as background noise, against which one may look for rare cfDNA molecules released from a solid tissue of interest. We hypothesized that identification of immune cell-derived cfDNA could open a window into immune and inflammatory cell dynamics, even in cases where peripheral blood counts are not informative. Here, we describe the development of a panel of immune cell type-specific DNA methylation markers, and the use of this panel for cfDNA-based assessment of human immune cell turnover in health and disease. We show that immune cell cfDNA measurement can provide clinical biomarkers in multiple disease and treatment conditions, otherwise undetectable by cell subset enumeration in blood.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of cell type-specific DNA methylation markers for immune cells</title><p>Using a reference methylome atlas of 32 primary human tissues and sorted cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moss et al., 2018</xref>), we searched for CpG sites that are uniquely methylated or unmethylated in a specific immune cell type. Notably, across the entire atlas, the vast majority of such unique loci are hypomethylated in the cell type of interest and methylated elsewhere (typically marking cell type-specific enhancers), while just a small minority are methylated in a given cell type and hypomethylated elsewhere (manuscript in preparation). We identified dozens of uniquely hypomethylated CpG sites for most cell types examined, qualifying these as biomarkers for DNA derived from a given cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Based on this in silico comparative analysis, we selected for further work 17 different CpG sites, whose combined methylation status could distinguish the DNA of seven major immune cell types: neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, B-cells, CD3 T-cells, CD8 cytotoxic T-cells, and regulatory T-cells (Tregs). For each marker CpG we designed PCR primers to amplify a fragment of up to 160 bp flanking it, considering the typical nucleosome size of cfDNA molecules. Amplicons included additional adjacent CpG sites, to gain enhanced cell type specificity due to the regional nature of tissue-specific DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehmann-Werman et al., 2016</xref>). We then established a multiplex PCR protocol, to co-amplify all 17 markers from bisulfite-treated DNA followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for assessment of methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neiman et al., 2020</xref>). Methylation patterns of amplified loci across 18 different human tissues validated the patterns inferred from in silico analysis and supported the ability of this marker cocktail to specifically identify the presence of DNA from each of the seven immune cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also assessed assay sensitivity and accuracy via spike-in experiments. We mixed human leukocyte DNA with DNA from the HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cell line and used the methylation cocktail to assess the fraction of each immune cell type. The markers quantitatively detected the presence of DNA from specific immune cell types even when blood DNA was diluted 10- to 20-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1â€”figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings establish specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of the methylation marker cocktail for detection of DNA derived from the seven selected immune cell types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of specific immune cell DNA methylation markers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Methylation atlas, based on Illumina 450K arrays, composed of 32 tissues and sorted cells (columns).

The cfDNA findings were consistent with this model. For example, the fraction of lymphocyte cfDNA in plasma was always smaller than the fraction of lymphocyte DNA in circulating blood cells or the fraction of lymphocytes in CBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bâ€“C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2â€”figure supplement 1</xref>), in agreement with the long half-life of lymphocytes compared with other blood cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Macallan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Michie et al., 1992</xref>). Conversely, the fraction of monocyte cfDNA was larger than the fraction of monocyte DNA in genomic DNA from whole blood or the fraction of monocytes in CBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Bâ€“C</xref>), consistent with the shorter half-life of monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the relative presence of immune cfDNA in plasma and whole blood, we employed an independent set of samples and an independent technology to measure and interpret methylation markers. Specifically, we performed deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moss et al., 2018</xref>) of methylomes obtained by whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) (85Ã— average coverage), on genomic DNA from whole blood, and matched plasma cfDNA from 23 healthy donors (see Materials and methods). This analysis, based on genome-wide methylation patterns, also revealed that lymphocyte and monocyte cfDNA was under- and over-represented, respectively, relative to the abundance of DNA from these cells in blood (lymphocytes, p-value = 0.002; monocytes, p-value = 0.0005, Kruskal-Wallis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>These findings support the exciting idea that cfDNA levels from a given immune cell type integrate total cell number and the lifespan of that cell type, and can provide information on processes not evident from circulating cell counts. For example, if the level of cfDNA from a specific immune cell type increases while the circulating counts of this cell type are unchanged, this can indicate either growth in the size of a tissue-resident population, or increased cell turnover, both of which are important immune parameters that cannot be easily obtained otherwise. Below, we provide evidence that such information can be extracted following perturbations of immune homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Estimation of immune cfDNA baseline in healthy individuals</title><p>To define the baseline levels of immune-derived cfDNA in healthy individuals, we collected and tested plasma samples from 227 healthy donors (males and females, ages 1â€“85 years). Consistent with our previous plasma methylome analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moss et al., 2018</xref>), we found that neutrophils were the main source of immune-derived cfDNA (mean = 390, range 10â€“1064 genome equivalents [GE]/ml), followed by monocytes (mean = 101, range 6â€“233 GE/ml), eosinophils (mean = 38, range 0â€“111 GE/ml) and lymphocytes (T-cells, mean = 30, range 1-79; B-cells, mean = 17, range 3â€“42; CD8 T-cells, mean = 8, range 0â€“27; Tregs, mean = 2, range 0â€“9 GE/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2â€”figure supplement 2</xref>). These data chart the normal range of cfDNA concentrations from specific immune cell types, including age and gender characteristics, against which pathological deviations can be identified (see below).</p><p>We also conducted a longitudinal study, to understand how immune-derived cfDNA is changing over time in the same individual. We collected weekly blood samples from 15 healthy donors over a period of 6 weeks. For each sample we obtained CBC and measured immune DNA methylation markers in genomic DNA of blood cells and in plasma cfDNA. We then calculated the coefficient of variation among CBC, blood methylation markers, and cfDNA methylation markers, within and between individuals. In circulating blood cells, the inter-individual variation in immune methylation markers and CBC was always higher than the intra-individual variation in these markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2â€”figure supplement 2</xref>). This is consistent with previous reports that blood cell counts among individuals are more similar to themselves than to others, indicating distinct set points per person for the total number of specific immune cell types circulating in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alpert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr et al., 2016</xref>). Strikingly, cfDNA values of the same immune methylation markers varied to the same extent among samples of the same individual and among samples of different individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This argues that unlike cell counts, cfDNA of immune cells has no individual set point. Rather, cfDNA levels appear to reflect homeostatic maintenance of cell number, whereby cell birth and death are modulated to maintain a desired cell count.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Elevation of B-cell-derived cfDNA after influenza vaccination precedes changes in cell counts and correlates with specific antibody production</title><p>We hypothesized that upon perturbations of the immune system, cfDNA markers will reveal information about immune cell dynamics that is not present in peripheral blood cell counts, for example, extensive cell death during the process of affinity maturation, which repeatedly selects for B-cell clones with increased antibody-target affinity. To test this hypothesis, we examined longitudinal blood samples from healthy individuals who received an annual quadrivalent <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/quadrivalent.htm">influenza vaccination</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakaya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voigt et al., 2018</xref>). The influenza vaccine response is mediated mostly by the humoral immune system (B-cells) aided by CD4 T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gage et al., 2018</xref>). Changes in circulating cell counts occur a week after vaccination, reflecting processes such as plasma cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Victora and Wilson, 2015</xref>). cfDNA responses to vaccination were not previously reported. We recruited 92 healthy volunteers (age range 20â€“73, mean age 37.4) who received the vaccination in 2018 or 2019. From each volunteer we obtained blood samples a day before vaccination (day 0, D0), and at day 3, 7, and 28 post-vaccination. Consistent with previous reports, B-cell counts (measured by methylation analysis of DNA from whole blood) were moderately but significantly elevated on day 7, and persisted to day 28 (p-value = 0.0048, Kruskal-Wallis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012</xref>).

The assay opens a window into aspects of human immune and inflammation biology that are not reflected in blood cell counts or gene expression patterns. Specifically, the concentration of cfDNA derived from a given immune cell type is a function of the total number of cells of that type (circulating and remote pools, combined), the lifespan of this population, determinants of cfDNA release (e.g. efficiency of phagocytosis) and determinants of cfDNA clearance from plasma (e.g. liver uptake). While many of these parameters are typically unknown, in some cases cfDNA dynamics allow to infer a change in cell turnover or in total cell number outside systemic circulation. For example, when analyzing cfDNA from different cell types in the same sample, it is fair to assume that they were subject to the same clearance kinetics.</p><p>We propose that a deeper qualitative and quantitative understanding of the fundamental rules governing cfDNA release and clearance will enrich our ability to relate liquid biopsy data to physiological processes taking place in vivo.</p><p>Since the method relies on highly stable methylation marks of cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dor and Cedar, 2018</xref>), it is expected to be universal, with the same markers allowing to accurately monitor immune cell dynamics in all individuals. While our current assay uses a panel of 17 methylation markers specific to seven key immune cell types, future improvements should increase the resolution of analysis to target essentially all immune cell types. For example, identification of methylation markers specific to memory B-cells, plasma cells, T-cell subtypes, and tissue-specific macrophages is likely feasible, and could greatly increase the information gained from immune cfDNA analysis. We note however that dynamic cellular states may involve changes in gene expression that do not involve reprogramming of DNA methylation patterns, representing a limitation of the approach. In other words, methylation markers can inform on the turnover dynamics of cell types, not cell states. Analysis of more dynamic aspects of the epigenome, such as the profile of histone marks on circulating nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sadeh et al., 2021</xref>), may allow inference of transient gene expression programs in cells prior to death and release of cfDNA.</p><p>Our cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of immune cfDNA in healthy individuals begins to define the normal range among the population, an essential step toward using the assay for identifying deviations from health. More extensive characterization of immune cell cfDNA in healthy individuals is necessary to interpret trends that were revealed by our healthy cohorts. For example, we noticed lower levels of neutrophil cfDNA in adult females compared with adult males, suggesting that neutrophils in females live longer; we speculate that such differences in lifespan explain why women have a higher steady-state neutrophil count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bain and England, 1975</xref>) (and data not shown). Additional observations of healthy immune cfDNA dynamics that merit further investigation regard age-related changes, such as elevated monocyte cfDNA and reduced lymphocyte cfDNA in individuals older than 60. Finally, the intra- and inter-individual variation in immune cfDNA levels shows that unlike blood cell counts, cfDNA levels vary wildly, apparently with no regulatory mechanism that attracts them to a certain set point typical to an individual. We propose that varying cfDNA levels reflect the action of regulated cell death as a homeostatic mechanism by which the healthy body maintains cell numbers within a desired range (model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A schematic view of immune marker variance within individuals.</title><p>Intra-individual variance of immune cell count (blue) and immune-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) (red) in multiple time points. Our findings suggest that while immune cell counts are stable and typical within an individual, immune cell cfDNA levels vary greatly, reflecting changes in cell turnover that help maintain the cell count set point.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70520-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This model has some practical implications. For diagnostic applications of immune cfDNA, one should use the healthy population baseline levels of each methylation marker. Deviation from the normal range would indicate abnormality that requires attention (similar to the situation with blood counts). Our study suggests that fluctuations of specific cfDNA markers within norm levels are not indicative of pathology, but are rather part of a normal homeostatic process.</p><p>Beyond the healthy baseline, we studied immune cfDNA dynamics in three settings of immune system perturbation. First, post influenza vaccination, we identified an early elevation of B-cell cfDNA, preceding an increase in circulating B-cell counts and correlating to the effectiveness of antibody production. The correlation was statistically significant and independent of the known age-related risk of non-responsiveness. We propose that elevated B-cell turnover (and elevated B-cell cfDNA as its readout) reflects early stages in the successful response of B-cells to the vaccine, including the process of affinity maturation whereby large numbers of B-cells are generated and eliminated within lymph nodes as a result of insufficient binding to the target epitope. More work is needed to accurately define the population of B-cells that release cfDNA after vaccination, and to understand the physiological driver of this response. Practical applications, if the association between B-cell cfDNA and vaccination outcome proves robust, may include an early personalized indication for the success of vaccination. Second, we examined immune cfDNA dynamics in EoE, a model for an inflammatory disease in which one tissue is damaged by infiltration of a specific immune cell population, while leaving a minimal mark on peripheral cell counts. cfDNA analysis revealed the selective elevation of eosinophil turnover in active EoE, in some cases even when circulating eosinophil cell counts are unchanged. Larger scale studies are warranted to determine if eosinophil cfDNA can be a sufficiently sensitive and specific biomarker for assisting the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of EoE, ultimately relieving the need for invasive biopsies of the esophagus. Lastly, cfDNA dynamics in patients with B-cell lymphoma revealed the impact of disease on the turnover of B-cells (consistent with a previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2015</xref>), and the reflection in B-cell cfDNA of the response to treatment. This analysis also revealed the involvement of turnover of other immune cell types in lymphoma. As with EoE, cfDNA in lymphoma provides a systemic biomarker of immune processes taking place in remote locations. However in lymphoma, these processes include both tumor dynamics and host responses â€“ either bystander effects (collateral damage) or an immune response to the tumor. Potential uses of immune methylation markers in this field include early diagnosis of hematological malignancies, detection of minimal residual disease, and monitoring response to treatment (although our findings suggest that the latter may involve complex relationships between B-cell cfDNA and clinical response). Beyond hematological malignancies, immune-derived cfDNA dynamics can inform on the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p>It is important to put the novel assay of immune cfDNA in the context of other emerging immune monitoring tools. In conditions that involve activation of the adaptive immune system, sequencing of the B- and T-cell receptor repertoire can be highly informative regarding the nature of the involved B- and T-cell clones, and the nature of the specific target epitopes. An important current limitation of immune repertoire analysis is that it requires large genomic fragments, which can only be derived from whole cells. This precludes cfDNA-based analysis, and limits access to T- and B-cell dynamics taking place in remote locations. Expression profiling of leukocytes, using single cell RNA sequencing and CyTOF, is also emerging as a powerful tool for understanding immune cell dynamics, revealing rich information about the transcriptome of circulating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bucasas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kurtz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Voigt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meng et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that both T/B repertoire analysis and expression profiling can be complemented by cfDNA profiling, which will provide non-overlapping information about immune cell turnover (and potentially also gene expression patterns associated with cell death) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sadeh et al., 2021</xref>) in remote locations.</p><p>In summary, analysis of specific immune cell methylation markers in cfDNA allows for monitoring of human immune cell dynamics, providing temporal and spatial information not accessible via circulating cell counts. We propose that this novel tool can illuminate healthy and pathological immune processes, including non-immune diseases having an inflammatory component such as cancer, rejection of transplanted organs, metabolic and neurodegenerative disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subject enrollment</title><p>This study was conducted according to protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board at each study site, with procedures performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

As noted above, such putative marker loci are far more abundant in the genome than loci that are methylated in the cell type of interest and unmethylated elsewhere. From our previously described atlas of human tissue-specific methylomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lehmann-Werman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moss et al., 2018</xref>), we identified ~50 CpG sites that are unmethylated in specific immune cells and methylated in all other major immune cells and tissues. We selected arbitrarily two to three of these sites for neutrophils (i.e. NEUT1, NEUT2, NEUT3), monocytes (i.e. MONO1, MONO2), eosinophils (i.e. EOSI1, EOSI2, EOSI3), B-cells (i.e. B-CELL1, B-CELL2), T-cells (i.e. T-CELL1, T-CELL2), CD8 T-cells (CD8A, CD8B), Tregs (TREG1, TREG2), and designed primers to amplify ~100 bp fragments surrounding them using the multiplex two-step PCR amplification method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neiman et al., 2020</xref>).

In the first step, up to 17 primer pairs were used in one PCR reaction to amplify regions of interest from bisulfite-treated DNA, independent of methylation status. Primers were 18â€“30 base pairs (bp) with primer melting temperature ranging from 58Â°C to 62Â°C. To maximize amplification efficiency and minimize primer interference, the primers were designed with additional 25 bp adaptors comprising Illumina TruSeq Universal Adaptors without index tags. All primers were mixed in the same reaction tube. For each sample, the PCR was prepared using the QIAGEN Multiplex PCR Kit according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions with 7 Î¼l of bisulfite-treated cfDNA. Reaction conditions for the first round of PCR were: 95Â°C for 15 min, followed by 30 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 s, 57Â°C for 3 min and 72Â°C for 1.5 min, followed by 10 min at 68Â°C.</p><p>In the second PCR step, the products of the first PCR were treated with Exonuclease I (ThermoScientific) for primer removal according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Cleaned PCR products were amplified using one unique TruSeq Universal Adaptor primer pair per sample to add a unique index barcode to enable sample pooling for multiplex Illumina sequencing. The PCR was prepared using 2Ã— PCRBIO HS Taq Mix Red Kit (PCR Biosystems) according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Reaction conditions for the second round of PCR were: 95Â°C for 2 min, followed by 15 cycles of 95Â°C for 30 s, 59Â°C for 1.5 min, 72Â°C for 30 s, followed by 10 min at 72Â°C. The PCR products were then pooled, run on 3% agarose gels with ethidium bromide staining, and extracted by Zymo GEL Recovery kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>NGS and analysis</title><p>Pooled PCR products were subjected to multiplex NGS using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (Illumina) or the <italic>NextSeq</italic> 500/550 v2 Reagent Kit (Illumina). Sequenced reads were separated by barcode, aligned to the target sequence, and analyzed using custom scripts written and implemented in R. Reads were quality filtered based on Illumina quality scores. Reads were identified as having at least 80% similarity to the target sequences and containing all the expected CpGs. CpGs were considered methylated if â€˜CGâ€™ was read and unmethylated if â€˜TGâ€™ was read. Proper bisulfite conversion was assessed by analyzing methylation of non-CpG cytosines. We then determined the fraction of molecules in which all CpG sites were unmethylated. The fraction obtained was multiplied by the concentration of cfDNA measured in each sample, to obtain the concentration of tissue-specific cfDNA from each donor. Given that the mass of a haploid human genome is 3.3 pg, the concentration of cfDNA could be converted from units of ng/ml to haploid GE/ml by multiplying by a factor of 303.</p><p>Methylation markers were calibrated compared to CBC to give a more accurate quantitative number, using linear regression. When necessary, methylation values were multiplied by a coefficient number derived from our spike-in calibration curves, to reflect the actual concentration of DNA from the relevant cell type. The fraction of neutrophil-derived cfDNA was obtained by dividing methylation fraction by 0.69.</p><p>Our entire dataset of PCR sequencing reactions used in this study is available upon request.

To prevent a bias due to difference in sample size (intra-individual variation, six time points; inter-individual variation, 15 individuals), we used R (version3.6.1) to sample all different combinations of a randomly selected six-person group and calculated the inter-individual coefficient of variation.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Y M Dennis Lo as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers indicated that the primary data and analysis routines are not accessible. Please share all data and analysis routines in a public repository.</p><p>2) Please address the question raised by R3 regarding the possibility/need to distinguish B cell subtypes with new experiments, new analysis or, alternatively, additional discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting manuscript in which Fox-Fisher et al., report a novel method for minimally invasive monitoring of the dynamics of the human immune system, based on profiling of cell-type specific cell-free DNA methylation marks. This method implements targeted DNA sequencing of a small panel of cell-type specific CpG markers and has the potential to be useful for the monitoring of a wide range immune-related diseases. The authors have tested the utility of this assay in three settings: influenza vaccination, Eosinophilic Esophagitis and B cell lymphoma. The experiments are well described and well powered, and the results are compelling, and I am happy to recommend this paper for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after the following points are addressed:</p><p>1. I appreciate that the authors shared PCR primer sequences. To ensure reproducibility it is important that all sequencing data, as well as analysis scripts or software are shared in a public resource.</p><p>2. The presentation of the data in some of the figures can be improved. The cell type labels in panels A, B and C are not consistent. Please indicate the number of samples evaluated in all box, bar and scatter plots (Figures 2D, 3A-C, 3E-F, 4A-C, 5A-B, 5G-H).</p><p>3. The observation of significant immune cfDNA dynamics and intra- and interindividual variation is interesting, and the schematic of Figure 6 is helpful. Some discussion of the challenges that this variability brings along for diagnostic applications would be helpful, and it would be great if the authors can suggest solutions.</p><p>4. The statistical analysis of the dynamics of B-cell cfDNA for vaccine responders vs non-responders can be improved. How were responders and non-responders selected and how sensitive is the cfDNA analysis to the selection criteria used? The differences observed for the two groups are relatively minor (certainly not striking as claimed in the discussion, please tone this down), and may be largely due to small number of samples from responders that are analyzed?</p><p>5. The ROC analysis of the performance of eosinophil cfDNA to discriminate patients with active EoE and healthy controls is helpful. Please provide a similar analysis of the performance of your assay to discriminate inactive EoE from no disease, and to discriminate active and inactive EoE.</p><p>6. The lymphoma patients are newly diagnosed and treatment naÃ¯ve, which is appropriate because treatment would likely lead to a greatly increased burden of B cell cfDNA. Do you have access to samples collected during treatment? It would be interesting to evaluate the possibility to monitor treatment responses and disease recurrence.</p><p>7. I would like to hear your thoughts (in the Discussion section), for ways to disentangle the different parameters that define the amount of cfDNA from specific immune cell types in blood (turnover rate, total number of cells, determinants of clearance and release).</p><p>8. The Discussion section would benefit from broader and more deeper discussion of other immune monitoring tools that have been reported or that are used in clinical practice, and the relative merit of the immune cfDNA assay the authors describe. For example, immune repertoire analyses of B and T cell compartments have been used to evaluate vaccine response (see the work by Jiang and Quake, and Vollmers and Quake, for example), and to monitor lymphoma. Other assays to monitor inflammation marks, or that use gene expression profiling are in use, or have been used.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors should investigate the subtypes of B cells and redo the analysis. In addition As reported by the authors and others (Lam et al., Clin Chem 2017, Moss et al., Nat Commun 2018), blood cells of erythroid lineage also contribute quite a lot in cfDNA, therefore the authors need to validate the specificity of their CpG loci in erythroblasts.</p><p>2. The authors clearly stated that they only work on hypo-methylated CpGs, why? I understand that biologically there may not be tissue-specific hyper-methylated CpGs, but the author need to explain this point.</p><p>3. Elevation of cfDNA from B-cells in lymphoma has been reported before (Sun et al., PNAS 2015), the authors need to mention such information.</p><p>4. Figure 1B is very unclear, what do the values represent? Do they denote the proportions in the mixture?</p><p>5. The presentation of Figure 1C is not easy to follow. A barplot with cumulative frequency for all cell types could be better.</p><p>6. The authors miss citations of many important prior works in their citation. This needs to be improved in a revision.</p><p>7. The blood processing procedure is not as commonly used, especially that the author uses only 3,000g for the 2<sup>nd</sup> step of centrifusion, while the common approach uses ~16,000g, so I wonder is there any contaminations in cfDNA? Which could significantly affect the result as this work specifically look at immune cells.</p><p>8. The data could only partially support the aims and conclusions, and the work is in principle-of-concept stage that needs further enhancements and validations.</p><p>9. I could not find any statement on data release in the article. Please kindly add this in a revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70520.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewers indicated that the primary data and analysis routines are not accessible.

These include:</p><p>â€“ Full primer sequences (Supplementary Table S1)</p><p>â€“ A more detailed protocol for our multiplex PCR, including a reference to our recently published protocol (Methods).</p><p>â€“ A more detailed description of analysis routines i.e. how primary sequences are interpreted.

The information content of each sequence run is pretty thin, and can be summarized as the fraction of molecules that carry a specific pattern of methylation (which can identify the cell type of origin). In the course of the study we performed many thousands of PCR reactions (hundreds of plasma samples, 17 markers in each), and each product was sequenced &gt;10,000 times. We are happy to share the entire set of raw data with anyone interested, but do not see the value of posting this information online. In the revised version we provide the algorithm used to interpret the raw sequence data, and a sample of sequence output using multiplex PCR followed by sequencing, on the genomic DNA samples described in Figure 1C (uploaded to GitHub). This example will make interested readers understand how the analysis is performed.</p><p>We have also shared 46 WGBS methylomes of healthy controls (white blood cells and plasma), which were deconvoluted to provide an independent and unbiased view of the contribution of different immune cell types to healthy cfDNA (Figure 2D).

To ensure reproducibility it is important that all sequencing data, as well as analysis scripts or software are shared in a public resource.</p></disp-quote><p>Revision contains a more detailed description of methods, including the protocol for multiplex PCR (Methods), primer sequences (Supplementary Table S1) and analysis routines (uploaded to GitHub).</p><p>Note that the assay described in this paper is targeted, such that each PCR reaction generated ~10,000 reads of the same sequence, differing in methylation status which indicates the cell of origin. We are happy to share with any interested investigator the many thousands of sequence datasets that gave rise to the results presented in the paper, however we think this will not be useful. In a sense, a reproducibility test of our findings will be much easier achieved by simply ordering a few pairs of primers and running PCR-sequencing reaction on fresh cfDNA samples! However, to demonstrate the analytic process fully, we uploaded to GitHub a representative sequencing dataset (Figure 1C) in its raw form, as well as a demonstration of its analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The presentation of the data in some of the figures can be improved. The cell type labels in panels A, B and C are not consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that this comment refers to Figure 1. We revised the labels to be consistent throughout the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please indicate the number of samples evaluated in all box, bar and scatter plots (Figures 2D, 3A-C, 3E-F, 4A-C, 5A-B, 5G-H).</p></disp-quote><p>The number of samples is now indicated for each panel. For clarity of visualization we prefer to provide this information in the figure legends rather than in the panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The observation of significant immune cfDNA dynamics and intra- and interindividual variation is interesting, and the schematic of Figure 6 is helpful. Some discussion of the challenges that this variability brings along for diagnostic applications would be helpful, and it would be great if the authors can suggest solutions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. The issue is now better discussed (3<sup>rd</sup> paragraph in the revised Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The statistical analysis of the dynamics of B-cell cfDNA for vaccine responders vs non-responders can be improved. How were responders and non-responders selected and how sensitive is the cfDNA analysis to the selection criteria used? The differences observed for the two groups are relatively minor (certainly not striking as claimed in the discussion, please tone this down), and may be largely due to small number of samples from responders that are analyzed?</p></disp-quote><p>The definitions of responders and non-responders are now better explained in the methods section. Briefly, definition is based on the levels of antibodies observed. Responders are people who did not have antibodies (any of the 4 measured) prior to vaccination, and showed a titer &gt;40 when measured 28 days after vaccination. Non-responders are individuals who did not show elevation in any of the antibodies after vaccination.</p><p>We added now a new panel (Figure 3F) showing the ROC curve for discrimination of responders from non-responders based on peak B-cell cfDNA post-vaccination. The signal is statistically significant so should not be ignored, but is indeed not striking. As requested, we toned down the statement regarding prediction of response (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The ROC analysis of the performance of eosinophil cfDNA to discriminate patients with active EoE and healthy controls is helpful. Please provide a similar analysis of the performance of your assay to discriminate inactive EoE from no disease, and to discriminate active and inactive EoE.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. We found that indeed eosinophil cfDNA can discriminate active from inactive EoE. We added a new panel (4F) showing a ROC curve to this end.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The lymphoma patients are newly diagnosed and treatment naÃ¯ve, which is appropriate because treatment would likely lead to a greatly increased burden of B cell cfDNA. Do you have access to samples collected during treatment? It would be interesting to evaluate the possibility to monitor treatment responses and disease recurrence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we had access to samples from patients who received treatment (n=16) and added information on their B-cell cfDNA levels to figure 5 (new panel 5H). The results show an overall decrease in B-cell derive cfDNA after treatment, as might have been expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I would like to hear your thoughts (in the Discussion section), for ways to disentangle the different parameters that define the amount of cfDNA from specific immune cell types in blood (turnover rate, total number of cells, determinants of clearance and release).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We elaborate on this important issue in the revised Discussion. In brief, we stated that it is possible to extract important information from cfDNA analysis even without knowing much about cfDNA release and clearance (as practice shows). However we propose that a qualitative and quantitative understanding the fundamental rules governing cfDNA dynamics will enrich our ability to relate cfDNA data to physiological processes taking place in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The Discussion section would benefit from broader and more deeper discussion of other immune monitoring tools that have been reported or that are used in clinical practice, and the relative merit of the immune cfDNA assay the authors describe. For example, immune repertoire analyses of B and T cell compartments have been used to evaluate vaccine response (see the work by Jiang and Quake, and Vollmers and Quake, for example), and to monitor lymphoma. Other assays to monitor inflammation marks, or that use gene expression profiling are in use, or have been used.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion about cfDNA in the context of other immune monitoring tools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors should investigate the subtypes of B cells and redo the analysis. In addition As reported by the authors and others (Lam et al., Clin Chem 2017, Moss et al., Nat Commun 2018), blood cells of erythroid lineage also contribute quite a lot in cfDNA, therefore the authors need to validate the specificity of their CpG loci in erythroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. Indeed, the next step of this work should be increasing the resolution of methylation markers to include additional cell types, for example memory B cells and plasma cells, memory and effector T cell, and tissue-specific macrophages. However this is a major undertaking that falls beyond the scope of this work. In the revised discussion we describe the potential and the limitations of expansion of the spectrum of cellular subtypes that can be tested in cfDNA. With regard to erythroblasts, this is indeed an important cell type to include in specificity analysis of methylation markers. This is now included in the revised heatmap in Figure 1B. All markers but one retained their specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors clearly stated that they only work on hypo-methylated CpGs, why? I understand that biologically there may not be tissue-specific hyper-methylated CpGs, but the author need to explain this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the majority of our cell type-specific markers (in the immune system and beyond) are hypo-methylated in the cell type of interest and hypermethylated elsewhere. Occasionally we do identify loci that are hypermethylated specifically in the cell type of interest, and these work just as fine. The reason for the more frequent use of hypomethylated markers is that these are far more abundant in the genome, typically reflecting tissue-specific gene enhancers. This is clarified in the revised manuscript (first section in Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Elevation of cfDNA from B-cells in lymphoma has been reported before (Sun et al., PNAS 2015), the authors need to mention such information.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. Sun et al., was unintentionally not mentioned. It is now cited in the Results (lymphoma section) and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 1B is very unclear, what do the values represent? Do they denote the proportions in the mixture?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We changed the presentation of the panel as well as the legend to clarify the meaning of the shades of grey. Grey blocks represent the percentage of unmethylated molecules of each marker (X axis) in DNA from each cell type (Y axis).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The presentation of Figure 1C is not easy to follow. A barplot with cumulative frequency for all cell types could be better.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary Figure S1 provides the information from the spike-in experiment for each marker, in the form of a bar plot as requested. We did generate a cumulative bar plot but noticed that is more difficult to understand than the version shown in Figure 1C. Text was revised to clarify this plot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors miss citations of many important prior works in their citation. This needs to be improved in a revision.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We added key references that were unfortunately omitted in the first version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The blood processing procedure is not as commonly used, especially that the author uses only 3,000g for the 2nd step of centrifusion, while the common approach uses ~16,000g, so I wonder is there any contaminations in cfDNA? which could significantly affect the result as this work specifically look at immune cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Our blood processing procedure is similar to that used by others in the field. In fact, different centrifugation procedures have been compared systematically and found to be equivalent. The revised Methods section cites papers that performed the comparison (Effects of Collection and Processing Procedures on Plasma Circulating Cell-Free DNA from Cancer Patients, PMID 30165204; and Preanalytical variables that affect the outcome of cell-free DNA measurements, PMID 32393081), and discusses the isolation parameters that we found to be essential for immune cfDNA analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The data could only partially support the aims and conclusions, and the work is in principle-of-concept stage that needs further enhancements and validations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a proof of concept study, showing the potential utility of cfDNA for studying immune cell dynamics. This is further emphasized in the revised Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. I could not find any statement on data release in the article. Please kindly add this in a revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we include a statement about availability of all sequencing data, and provide an example of the output of a PCR-sequencing reaction and its interpretation (detailed in Methods, and algorithm + sequence data uploaded to GitHub). In addition, we uploaded to GEO the 23 pairs of white blood cell genomic DNA + plasma cfDNA WGBS samples described in Figure 2D.</p></body></sub-article></article>
