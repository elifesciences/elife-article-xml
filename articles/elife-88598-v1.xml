In female <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we have previously shown that individually activating either aIPg or pC1d cell types can induce aggression. Here we investigate further the individual roles of these cholinergic, sexually dimorphic cell types, and the reciprocal connections between them, in generating a persistent aggressive internal state. We find that a brief 30-second optogenetic stimulation of aIPg neurons was sufficient to promote an aggressive internal state lasting at least 10 minutes, whereas similar stimulation of pC1d neurons did not. While we previously showed that stimulation of pC1e alone does not evoke aggression, persistent behavior could be promoted through simultaneous stimulation of pC1d and pC1e, suggesting an unexpected synergy of these cell types in establishing a persistent aggressive state. Neither aIPg nor pC1d show persistent neuronal activity themselves, implying that the persistent internal state is maintained by other mechanisms. Moreover, inactivation of pC1d did not significantly reduce aIPg-evoked persistent aggression, arguing that the aggressive state did not depend on pC1d-aIPg recurrent connectivity. Our results suggest the need for alternative models to explain persistent female aggression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>internal state</kwd><kwd>aggression</kwd><kwd>persistence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robie</surname><given-names>Alice A</given-names></name><name><surname>Branson</surname><given-names>Kristin</given-names></name><name><surname>Vippa</surname><given-names>Tanvi</given-names></name><name><surname>Epstein</surname><given-names>Samantha</given-names></name><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Gerald M</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><name><surname>Schretter</surname><given-names>Catherine E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37DA031389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While persistent aggressive states in females are promoted by select cell types with recurrent connections (aIPg, pC1d+e), additional data and models are needed to explain the maintenance of these states.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Persistence is an evolutionarily conserved feature of internal states, which governs the duration of an animal’s behavior beyond an inciting stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Adolphs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flavell et al., 2022</xref>). For example, a glance at a moving muleta is sufficient to keep a Spanish fighting bull aggressive for tens of minutes. Recent studies in mammals and invertebrates have begun to uncover potential mechanisms for maintaining persistent behavioral states on various timescales. These mechanisms can be ‘electronic’, such as persistent firing in certain cell types or circuits, ‘biochemical’, such as slow decay of second messengers or their effectors influencing neural excitability, or ‘systemic’, such as persistent elevation of circulating hormones or neuromodulators, and may span timescales of hundreds of milliseconds to tens of seconds to days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dylla et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thornquist et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thornquist et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kennedy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marques et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rhoades et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robson and Li, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).

(<bold>A</bold>) aIPg neurons form direct and indirect connections with pC1e. The most prominent indirect connection goes through the interneuron SMP312. Previous connectomic analysis highlighted SMP054 neurons in a circuit indirectly linking aIPg with LC10 neurons, a specific type of lobula columnar visual output neurons tuned to small moving objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to being a common target of aIPg, pC1d, and pC1e, SMP054 receives indirect visual input through SMP312, possibly indicating the presence of another fly.

However, recent progress in identifying cell types that control female aggression has opened up this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Palavicino-Maggio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>).

They observed that activation of pC1d neurons alone generated only time-locked aggression, while stimulation of pC1e had no effect on aggression at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref> also identified an additional female aggression-promoting cell type, aIPg, not directly tested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>. They observed that a 30-second stimulation of aIPg neurons, like that of pC1d+e neurons, promoted aggression that outlasted the stimulation period. However, as individual flies were not separated during the stimulation period, this study could not definitively conclude that stimulation of aIPg neurons generated a persistent aggressive internal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>These two studies, therefore, raised a number of questions about the mechanisms generating persistent aggressive internal states in female flies. For example, can stimulation of pC1d alone generate a persistent internal aggressive state, or is pC1e needed in combination with pC1d to see this long-lasting effect? Does the duration of the persistent state depend on the type of neuron stimulated (aIPg vs. pC1d+e), the duration of stimulation, or on other factors? It is difficult to answer these questions by combining the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref> due to experimental differences between the two studies.

In this report, we evaluate the contribution of individual cell types, specifically aIPg, pC1d, and pC1e, to generating a persistent aggressive state, under directly comparable stimulation and behavioral assay conditions, and begin to test predictions of connectome-based models for circuit mechanisms underlying persistence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stimulation of aIPg neurons but not pC1d neurons promotes a persistent aggressive state in females</title><p>We used a well-established behavioral test for evaluating persistent aggressive internal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>), in which same-genotype flies expressing the red-shifted channelrhodopsin, CsChrimson (CsChR), in the specified neuronal population were separated by a sliding metal door (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The driver lines marking these specific cell types were previously characterized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref> and show similar levels of expression. Moreover, in all cases, the strength of the optogenetic stimulus used to test for persistence was similar to that needed to induce aggression during stimulation. Then, 10 minutes following the stimulation, the doors were removed to allow social interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Preliminary experiments using 1-, 5-, 10-, and 30-minute delays showed persistence at 1, 5, and 10 minutes, but not at 30 minutes; therefore, we performed more detailed experiments at the 10-minute time point. Aggressive behaviors such as head butting and shoving were analyzed using the Caltech FlyTracker and a JAABA classifier (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We observed elevated female aggression that was detectable after 10 minutes when aIPg or pC1d+e, but not pC1d neurons, were stimulated, suggesting that the aIPg neurons alone are sufficient to promote a persistent aggressive internal state. In contrast, pC1d depends on co-stimulation with pC1e to generate a persistent effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Because stimulation of pC1e neurons alone does not produce female aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>), its contribution to the regulation of the persistent aggression was unexpected. Collectively, these results demonstrate the sufficiency of either aIPg or pC1d+e neurons to promote a persistent aggressive state in females.</p><p>Using a different experimental paradigm, we next investigated whether social feedback from a less aggressive (group housed, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2021</xref>) wild-type target fly can contribute to the duration of persistent aggression. In this ‘mixed-pair’ assay, CsChrimson-expressing females were paired with wild-type female targets in chambers without a divider, allowing for social interactions at any time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under these conditions, attacks by the tester fly persisted following the stimulation of aIPg or pC1d+e, but not of pC1d. Activation of pC1e alone did not significantly increase aggression during or following stimulation (data not shown), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>). The aIPg-induced persistent aggression lasted minutes in this paradigm, which is longer than the tens of seconds-long persistence we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>). As there is a sevenfold difference in the fly density per area in the two experiments (current study: 0.2 flies per sq. cm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>: 0.03 flies per sq. cm) and since density is known to alter social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rooke et al., 2020</xref>), we asked if the duration of persistence was influenced by the fly density in the chamber. Indeed, we found that even a modest increase in fly density (0.08 flies per sq. cm) extended persistent aggression in both aIPg and pC1d+e activated flies. These observations suggest that the frequency of social encounters can be an external factor that increases the duration of aggression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>pC1d-aIPg functional connectivity is not required for aIPg-induced persistent aggression</title><p>We investigated whether the reciprocal pC1d-aIPg connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is required for aIPg-induced persistent aggression by performing behavioral epistasis and in vivo calcium imaging experiments.

Because aIPg neurons form reciprocal connections amongst themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we also examined whether direct stimulation of aIPg neurons could cause persistent activity in these cells. We found that the response of aIPg neurons was time-locked to the stimulation period regardless of stimulation length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Given that a 30-second stimulation of aIPg neurons in intact flies is sufficient to elicit a persistent aggressive state that lasts longer than 10 minutes, it seems that neither aIPg nor pC1d neurons exhibit persistent activity on the time scale necessary to sustain persistent aggressive behavior. Together, our behavioral epistasis and in vivo imaging data indicate that reciprocal connections among aIPg neurons or between pC1d and aIPg neurons are neither required nor sufficient to generate a persistent internal state of aggressiveness. Therefore, persistent aggressive behavior is likely regulated by other downstream neurons that transform the output of aIPg or pC1d+e neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>This work demonstrates that optogenetic stimulation of aIPg neurons at the same levels needed to produce aggression during photo-stimulation also promoted a minutes-long behaviorally latent, persistent internal state of aggressiveness (or social arousal). In contrast, pC1d neuronal stimulation with the same optogenetic parameters generated time-locked aggression but not a latent, persistent internal state. However, such a persistent internal state was observed when pC1d and pC1e were co-stimulated. Our epistasis experiments do not support a model in which persistent aggression in females is driven by pC1d neurons acting through recurrent connections with aIPg neurons. Our imaging data further indicate that neither aIPg nor pC1d neurons themselves exhibit persistent neural activity when directly or indirectly stimulated, raising the question of how the persistent aggressive state is sustained by the downstream targets of these neurons and what role pC1e plays.</p><p>Our connectomic analysis revealed that aIPg, pC1d, and pC1e neurons have both unique and shared downstream targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). pC1d and pC1e neurons form a relatively small number of synapses with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>); however, aIPg neurons form strong reciprocal connections with both pC1d and pC1e as well as among themselves. While aIPg neurons’ recurrent synapses within the neuronal subset was a candidate for maintaining persistence, the GCaMP signals in aIPg were time-locked to the stimulus when aIPg neurons were activated. Additionally, pC1d stimulation triggered only time-locked responses in aIPg neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The results reported here confirm the observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref> that co-stimulation of pC1d and pC1e promotes persistent aggression, but reveal paradoxically that stimulation of pC1d alone promotes only time-locked, but not persistent aggression. Given that stimulation of aIPg alone can promote persistent aggression in the absence of pC1d activity, these results provide evidence of distinct classes of neurons controlling aggression in a time-locked versus persistent manner. The biological significance of this distinction remains to be determined. Additionally, our data reveal a key role for pC1e in maintaining persistent aggression, despite the fact that these neurons do not produce aggression when optogenetically stimulated alone. This observation suggests that persistent aggression promoted by pC1d+e is an emergent property of their co-activation. We note that pC1e receives distinct inputs that possibly indicate the presence of another fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). While pC1e also forms recurrent connections with aIPg, these synapses constitute a relatively low proportion of the total output of aIPg (0.177%). Interestingly, the function of pC1e neurons resembles that of pCd neurons in males, in that both classes of neurons regulate the persistence of internal states but do not directly evoke aggressive behavior when stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jung et al., 2020</xref>). However, pCd neurons are a cell type distinct from pC1d and pC1e neurons.</p><p>This study focused on the cell type-specific contribution of aIPg, pC1d, and pC1e neurons as well as the role of their recurrent connectivity. The persistence of aggressive states could be regulated by additional circuit components not present in our driver lines or other mechanisms, including neuropeptide modulation or prior experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guthman and Falkner, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kennedy, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Major and Tank, 2004</xref>). Identifying such components and their mechanisms of action will be an important focus for future work. RNA profiling data indicate that aIPg neurons produce the neuropeptide sNPF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>) and downstream targets might produce additional neuropeptides. Neuropeptides can act over the timescales needed to generate persistent aggressive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flavell et al., 2022</xref>). Additional mechanisms include attractor dynamics as suggested by a recent study in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nair et al., 2023</xref>). How neural circuits implement a persistent aggressive state, and whether individual circuit elements control distinct features of the aggressive state, remain major open questions that can be addressed by future studies of this circuit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">w1118;;20XUAS-CsChrimson-mVenus (attP2)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>;

Drivers for the pC1d or pC1d+e neurons were pC1d-SS (SS56987; 35C10-p65ADZp(JK73A); 71A09-ZpGDBD(attP2)) and pC1d+e-SS (SS43274; VT025602-p65ADZp (attP40); VT002064-ZpGDBD (attP2)/TM6B), respectively. Canton-S was used as wild-type target flies in mixed-pair experiments. 72C11LexA (attp40), 13xLexAop2-CsChrimson::tdT3.1 (su(Hw)attp5); 10xUAS-eGFP::Kir2.1(attp2) was generated in the Anderson lab.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Rearing conditions</title><p>Stocks and crosses were reared at 25°C and 50% humidity and maintained on a 12 hours:12 hours light:dark cycle. Fly density was kept consistent across experiments by crossing 10–12 virgin females with 5–6 males and flipping every 2 days. Experimental flies were collected as virgins and group housed (~20 flies per vial) on vials containing retinal food (0.2 mM) in the dark. Flies were flipped into fresh vials containing food 1 day before behavioral testing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Behavioral assays</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, the behavioral chambers used were 6-mm-high 16-mm-diameter acrylic cylinders with a clear top and floor. The wall and lids were coated with Insect-A-Slip and silicon fluid, respectively. The floor was covered with freshly prepared apple juice agar (2.5% [w/v] sucrose and 2.25% [w/v] agarose in apple juice) and illuminated with an 850 nm backlight (SOBL-200x150-850, SmartVision Lights, Muskegon, MI). Flies were introduced into the chambers by gentle aspiration and allowed to settle for at least 2 minutes prior to testing. Behaviors were recorded from above using a Point Grey Flea3 camera recording at 30 fps using a long pass IR filter (780 nm, Midwest Optical Systems). Flies were tested during the evening peak (Zeitgeber (ZT) 9–12).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Head butting and shoving JAABA classifier.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Classifier</th><th valign="bottom">True positive</th><th valign="bottom">True negative</th><th valign="bottom">False positive</th><th valign="bottom">False negative</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Head butting + shoving</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">80% (204)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">83.3% (1957)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">20% (51)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">16.7% (392)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-3-1"><title>Sliding-door assay</title><p>Detailed descriptions of the behavioral setup can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoopfer et al., 2015</xref>. Briefly, sliding-door experiments were performed in identical arenas apart from a vertical barrier that divides each chamber in half. Females were loaded into separate sides of the barrier and allowed to acclimate for 2 minutes before recording. Each trial comprised the pre-stimulation (30 seconds), stimulation (30 seconds), post-stimulation I (600 seconds), buffering (10 seconds), and post-stimulation II (600 seconds) period. The stimulation period comprises two stimulation blocks (13 and 15 seconds) separated by a 2-second inter-stimulation interval. For each stimulation block, a 655 nm LED above each chamber delivers 5 Hz pulsed light with a maximum intensity of 0.62 μW/mm<sup>2</sup>. Barriers were manually removed during the buffering period, meaning that social interaction is only allowed 10 minutes after neural stimulation. Interaction during the buffering period was not tracked due to the movement of the barrier. See ‘Behavioral analysis’ for quantification of aggressive behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-2"><title>Mixed-pair assay</title><p>To distinguish target versus tester in each experimental pair, one wing of the group housed Canton-S target is cut shorter 1 day before the experiment. Flies interacted freely in the chamber during the entire trial. Each trial comprised the pre-stimulation (30 seconds), stimulation (30 seconds), and post-stimulation (120 seconds) period. The stimulation condition is the same as the sliding-door assay. See ‘Behavioral analysis’ for quantification of aggressive behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3-3"><title>Density experiment</title><p>15 or 40 group-housed mated female flies were introduced via gentle aspiration into a 127 mm diameter arena as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>. Flies were tested during the morning peak (ZT 0–3) to replicate the conditions from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref>. The arena received was performed under white light illumination from above. Flies were acclimatized to the arena for 30 seconds prior to delivery of a single constant stimulus (1 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) from below with 660 nm LEDs lasting 30 seconds. Videos in this setup were recorded from above using a Point Grey Flea3 camera with an 800 nm long pass filter (B and W filter; Schneider Optics, Hauppauge, NY) at 30 fps.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>Flies were tracked using the Caltech FlyTracker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Tools/FlyTracker/">http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Tools/FlyTracker/</ext-link>) followed by automated classification of behavior with a JAABA classifier for head butting and shoving behaviors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; 80% [true positive] and 83.3% [true negative] framewise performance). Due to the camera resolution, head butting could not be distinguished from shoving and an instance of head butting and shoving was defined as when a fly moved toward the other, thrusting its head or forelimbs toward the other fly. All behavioral bouts were manually curated using the Caltech FlyTracker Visualizer to eliminate false positives and false negatives. Calculations of the fraction of time spent performing a behavior were made using the score files and averaging over the period indicated. To separate out the wild-type (Canton-S) target from the genotype of interest, mixed-pair experiments were manually corrected for tracking errors using the FixErrors MATLAB GUI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ctrax.sourceforge.net/fixerrors.html">https://ctrax.sourceforge.net/fixerrors.html</ext-link>). For density experiments, the same classifier used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schretter et al., 2020</xref> was employed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>In vivo calcium imaging</title><p>Experiments were performed as detailed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2021</xref>. Briefly, 6-day-old experimental flies were anesthetized on ice and head-fixed with the UV glue in their normal standing posture. The top of the fly head was immersed in fly saline, and a piece of cuticle (350 μm by 350 μm) was removed from the posterior side of the head capsule to create an imaging window. After surgery, the experimental fly was placed under a 0.8 numerical aperture (NA) ×40 objective (LUMPLFLN40XW, Olympus) and habituated for at least 5 minutes. The optical setup for two-photon imaging with optogenetic activation was described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>. Two stimulation paradigms were used: 13- and 15-second 5 Hz stimulation with 2-second inter-stimulation interval (same as the behavioral assays) or 5-minute 50 Hz stimulation (for replicating the stimulation used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deutsch et al., 2020</xref>). To calculate the decay time constant (Tau, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$\tau$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>), we fitted the GCaMP signals (a 15-second window that immediately follows the stimulation) with a one-term exponential model (MATLAB toolbox, function ‘fit’). Tau is calculated as –1/b.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Connectomic analysis</title><p>The primary data used for our analyses are described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>. Hemibrain data was queried using NeuPrint and v1.2.1 of the connectome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://neuprint.janelia.org">neuprint.janelia.org</ext-link>). Cytoscape (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cytoscape.org">cytoscape.org</ext-link>) was used to produce the node layout of connectivity diagrams of connections between neurons, which were then edited in Adobe Illustrator. Thresholds were used to limit the number of neurons in the figures to those connections with the most synapses. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, a threshold of 25 synapses between types was used, except for the connections from pC1d and pC1e in which all synapses were shown. In all cases, a threshold of three synapses was applied to connections between individual cells. Higher specific thresholds, when applied, are specified in each figure legend. A complete list of synaptic connections can be found in NeuPrint.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Statistics and quantification</title><p>No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Sample size was based on previous literature in the field and experimenters were not blinded in most conditions as almost all data acquisition and analysis were automated. Biological replicates completed at separate times using different parental crosses were performed for each of the behavioral experiments. For mixed-pair and sliding-door experiments, three biological repeats were performed, and the data was combined. For density experiments, data is representative of two independent biological repeats, only one of which is shown. For figures in which the behavioral data over the course of a trial is shown, gray shading indicates the stimulus period, the mean is represented as a solid line, and shaded error bars represent variation between experiments. For raster plots, each red line represents a bout in which either individual in the arena displayed head butting or shoving behavior. In the mixed-pair experiments, data from the wild-type target was not included.</p><p>For each experiment, the experimental and control flies were collected, treated, and tested at the same time. A Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s post hoc test were used for statistical analysis for behavioral experiments. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, a paired <italic>t-</italic> test was used for statistical analysis.

Chiu, Schretter, and colleagues, employed circuit dissection techniques to tease apart the specific roles of particular doublesex and fruitless expressing neurons in the fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> in generating a persistent aggressive state. They find that activating the fruitless positive alPg neurons, generated an aggressive state that persisted for &gt;10min after the stimulation ended. Similarly, activating the doublesex positive pC1de neurons also generated a peristent state. Activating pC1d or pC1e individually did not induce a persistent state. Interestingly, while neural activation of alPGs and pC1d+e neurons induced a persistent behavioural states it did not induce persistent activity in the neurons being activated.</p><p>The authors have revised the manuscript in accordance with comments of the reviewers. The conclusions of this paper are by and large well supported by the data. These data will be a useful addition to the literature on the circuit basis of female aggression, and open up intriguing avenues for further studies to explore.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88598.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Hui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>California Institute of Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Pasadena</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Robie</surname><given-names>Alice A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ashburn</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Branson</surname><given-names>Kristin M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ashburn</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vippa</surname><given-names>Tanvi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ashburn</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Epstein</surname><given-names>Samantha</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ashburn</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rubin</surname><given-names>Gerald M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ashburn</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>California Institute of Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Pasadena</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schretter</surname><given-names>Catherine E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Janelia Research Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ashburn</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We are grateful for the comments and suggestions from the reviewers and have followed the recommendation in producing our revised manuscript.

In addition, the authors show that while stimulation of PC1d alone is not sufficient to induce this persistent aggressive state, simultaneous activation of PC1d + PC1e is, suggesting a synergistic effect. Connectomics analysis performed in the authors' previous study had shown that PC1d and aIPg are interconnected. However, silencing pC1d neuronal activity did not reduce aIPg-evoked persistent aggression, indicating that the aggressive state did not depend on pC1d-aIPg recurrent connectivity.</p><p>The conclusions are well supported by the data, and the results presented in this manuscript represent an important contribution to our understanding of the neuronal circuitry underlying female aggression.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Previously, the authors have shown that the activation of PC1e alone does not induce female aggression. In this study, they investigate the role of aIPg, PC1d, or PC1d+e on aggression persistence, but they do not explore the effect of activation of PC1e alone. It is possible that PC1e activation may not produce an immediate short-term effect but could lead to a gradual increase in aggression over time, potentially explaining at least in part the observed effect upon PC1d+e activation. Incorporating an examination of the long-term impact of PC1e activation on aggression could provide valuable information.</p></disp-quote><p>We did perform mixed pair experiments with the pC1e-SS1 line from the Schretter et al. (2020) paper and did not find any significant changes in aggression over time in this setup as well. We have now added a reference to these experiments in the revised submission in lines 135 to 136.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Some important controls are missing: flies with the genetic combinations employed in the activation experiments shown in Figure 2 but in the absence of activation and under the exact same conditions and for a similar observation period.</p></disp-quote><p>For Figure 2, we used an empty split-Gal4 driver as a genetic control for our activation paradigms.

The quantification shown in Fig 3- Supplementary Figure 1 shows no effect during stimulation (13 s + 15s), but based on the plots of Figure 3, there may be an effect of silencing PC1d on aIPg-induced aggression during the initial 13 second period.

Expression of Kir2.1 in pC1d neurons while aIPg neurons were activated did not suppress aggression after aIPg stimulation, suggesting that connections from pC1d neurons are not necessary for the persistent aggressive state promoted by aIPg.

Therefore, we believe the suggested experiment is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How many times was each experiment repeated?

Determining the effect on persistent aggression of silencing sNPF (for example via RNAi or Crispr-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis) in aIPG neurons would be an important addition to the manuscript.

Chiu, Schretter, and colleagues, employed circuit dissection techniques to tease apart the specific roles of particular doublesex and fruitless expressing neurons in the fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> in generating a persistent aggressive state. They find that activating the fruitless positive alPg neurons, generated an aggressive state that persisted for &gt;10min after the stimulation ended. Similarly, activating the doublesex positive pC1de neurons also generated a persistent state. Activating pC1d or pC1e individually did not induce a persistent state. Interestingly, while neural activation of alPGs and pC1d+e neurons induced persistent behavioural states it did not induce persistent activity in the neurons being activated.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are well supported by the data, there were only a few points where clarification might help:</p><p>1. Figure 3 is a little confusing. This is a circuit behavioural epistasis experiment where the authors activate alPg with CsChrimson while inhibiting pC1d with Kir2.1. In Fig. 2 flies were separated for 10 min following stimulation which allowed for identification of a persistent state. However, in Fig 3 it appears as if flies were allowed to freely interact during and immediately post-stimulation. It is unclear why flies were not separated as in Fig. 2, which makes it difficult to compare the two results. Some discussion of this point would help. Also, from the rasters it appears as if inhibition of pC1d reduced aggression induced by alPg during the stimulation period. Is this true?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the need for clarification and we have modified the legend in Figure 3 to address the points raised. The flies were allowed to freely interact during the experiments shown in Figure 3 and we have added this information to the figure legend. To obtain a high level of aggressive behavior that would make it easier to observe a suppression of aggression, the epistasis experiments were performed with freely moving same-genotype pairs. The level of aggression triggered by the generation 1 LexA line labeling aIPg was lower than that observed when using with the aIPg-SS GAL4 line. The experiment was performed as in Schretter et al. (2020) where we found that aIPg activation induced persistent fighting in same genotype pairs. We have added a brief explanation in lines 152 to 155.</p><p>Inhibition of pC1d does not significantly reduce the overall aggression induced by aIPg stimulation in the 13s + 15s period. We also examined the differences within the two stimulation periods and did not find any significant differences (13s period, p = 0.2978; 15s period, p = 0.6650). We have now added this information to the figure legends for Figure 3 and Figure 3 supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. pC1e neurons also have recurrent connectivity with alPg neurons. It might help to also discuss the potential role of this arm of the microcircuit.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the review for this suggestion. The number of synapses that aIPg sends back to pC1e is a very low proportion of its total output (0.177%). However, based on the experiments that we have performed, we cannot rule out that this microcircuit might contribute to maintaining persistence.

Both studies combined behavioural analyses, optogenitic manipulation of neurons, and connectomics. One of these studies proposed that the extensive interconnections seen between the alPg and pC1d+e neurons might represent a recurrent motif known to support persistent behvioural states in other systems. In this manuscript, the authors test this idea and report that their data do not support it. Specifically, they report that alPg or pC1d+e (but not pC1d alone) can initiate a persistent state of aggression. But they find that the persistent aggressive state is maintained even when the pC1d neurons are inactivated. Finally, they show that neither of these neurons themselves sustains neuronal activity upon stimulation, nor do either of them induce a persistent activity in the other. Together, their data suggest that the recurrent connection between alPg and pC1d is not what supports the persistent state. The data underlying these claims are convincing. A possibility to explore before ruling out recurrent motifs (at this circuit level) in maintaining aggression is that the connections between alPg and pC1e can compensate for the loss of pC1e. Overall, the study is important and will be of interest to those who study the circuit basis of persistent behavioural states, but also to neuroscientists in general.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I enjoyed reading this manuscript for its clarity in writing and data presentation.</p><p>I would like the authors to comment on the possibility that pC1e can compensate for the loss of pC1d.

In order to examine if pC1e does compensate for pC1d, we would need to also activate pC1e while inhibiting pC1d.
