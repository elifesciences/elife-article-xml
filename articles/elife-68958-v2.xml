signalosome continuously generates IFNs and cytokines, leading to neutrophil recruitment and inflammation. Thus, attenuation of excessive immune and inflammatory responses is crucial to restore immune homeostasis and prevent unwarranted damage, yet few resolving mediators have been identified. In the present study, we demonstrated that RTN3 is strongly upregulated during RNA viral infection and acts as an inflammation-resolving regulator. Increased RTN3 aggregates on the endoplasmic reticulum and interacts with both TRIM25 and RIG-I, subsequently impairing K63-linked polyubiquitination and resulting in both IRF3 and NF-κB inhibition. Rtn3 overexpression in mice causes an obvious inflammation resolving phenomenon when challenged with VSV, Rtn3-overexpressing mice display significantly decreased neutrophil numbers and inflammatory cell infiltration, which is accompanied by reduced tissue edema in the liver and thinner alveolar interstitium. Taken together, our findings identify RTN3 as a conserved negative regulator of immune and inflammatory responses and provide insights into the negative feedback that maintains immune and inflammatory homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RTN3</kwd><kwd>RIG-I</kwd><kwd>TRIM25</kwd><kwd>antiviral response</kwd><kwd>inflammatory resolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81871643</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuang</surname><given-names>Ersheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32061143008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kuang</surname><given-names>Ersheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81971928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xiaojuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RTN3 is upregulated upon RNA viral infection, in turn suppresses antiviral responses by impairing TRIM25-mediated RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination and decreases neutrophil populations and inflammatory infiltration, representing a novel inflammatory resolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The innate immune responses can be triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and then serve as the first line of defense against invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Takeuchi and Akira, 2010</xref>). Upon viral infection, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect viral RNA, DNA and other viral products and subsequently mediate the activation of downstream signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Roers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Loo and Gale, 2011</xref>). Both RIG-I and MDA5, two crucial members of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family, sense cytoplasmic viral RNA and activate antiviral responses. Both RIG-I and MDA5 share the same domain architecture, comprising two N-terminal caspase activation recruitment domains (CARDs), a central DEAD box helicase/ATPase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Loo and Gale, 2011</xref>). MDA5 has been reported to recognize longer dsRNA molecules (&gt;2 kb), while RIG-I prefers shorter (&lt; 1–2 kb) or 5’ triphosphate-containing dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peisley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Peisley et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike MDA5, which is conformationally unaltered, upon recognition of dsRNA by the CTD domain, RIG-I unfolds and releases its CARDs from the inward folding state formed by its helicase domain, thereby transforming into an activated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jiang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>). The CARD domain then recruits MAVS and activates the downstream signaling cascade to induce the expression of type I interferons, IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), inflammatory cytokines, and/or chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Considering that RIG-I-mediated innate antiviral responses are important, drastic and rapid upon viral RNA recognition, multiple mechanisms have evolved to precisely regulate RIG-I-mediated antiviral signaling to maintain the balance between immunity and tolerance and prevent severe or even fatal unnecessary damage, which may be caused by excessive immune and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eisenächer and Krug, 2012</xref>). Some modifications of RIG-I reduce its stability. For example, LRRC25 targets RIG-I for ISG15-associated autophagy degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2018</xref>), whereas the E3 ubiquitin ligases RNF125, STUB1, c-Cbl, and CHIP induce the K48-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I to promote its proteasome-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arimoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, the posttranslational modification of RIG-I upon K63-linked polyubiquitination has been well shown to regulate RIG-I activation. TRIM25 and Riplet induce this modification in RIG-I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Oshiumi et al., 2010</xref>), whereas the deubiquitination enzyme USP3 targets the RIG-I CARDs to cleave its K63-linked polyubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, CKII and PKCα/β phosphorylate the RIG-I CTD and CARDs to negatively regulate its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maharaj et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although the acute immune response and inflammation defend against viral infection and eliminate virus-induced damage, excessive and unrestricted responses can lead to excessive tissue injury and even organ failure. Several diseases have been shown to be related to chronic inflammation or autoimmunity, such as asthma, arthritis, periodontal disease, and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiang and Serhan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sugimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alessandri et al., 2013</xref>). Inflammation resolution has been shown to be an essential active process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buckley et al., 2013</xref>), and pro-resolving mediators regulate inflammation resolution through multiple strategies, including the inhibition of signal transduction, the regulation of cytokines and chemokines, the cessation of leukocyte infiltration and the clearance of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sugimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ortega-Gómez et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Viral infections also trigger different ER stresses due to the excessive synthesis and accumulation of viral proteins in the ER lumen or through signal hijacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sano and Reed, 2013</xref>). In response to ER stress, two transcription factors, CHOP and ATF6, are activated, and the translational regulator eIF2α is phosphorylated and subsequently reprograms cellular transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Oyadomari and Mori, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Walter et al., 2011</xref>). Although reticulon family members have shown to comprise a highly conserved housekeeping protein family in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Moreira et al., 1999</xref>), one reticulon member, RTN3, is transcriptionally upregulated under ER stress by CHOP or ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wan et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In our previous unpublished experiments, we observed that RTN3 is dramatically upregulated upon RNA viral infection when using VSV as a stimulus. However, the mechanism and function of RTN3 upregulation during viral infection is unclear, raising the strong possibility that RTN3 is involved in antiviral and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we showed that RTN3 acts as a conserved negative regulator and suppresses RIG-I-mediated immune and inflammatory responses during RNA viral infections. We reveal that RTN3 exerts an inhibitory effect on RIG-I signalosome activation by impairing TRIM25-mediated RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination. Our study may contribute to a better understanding of a novel mechanism for inflammation resolution and the reconstitution of tissue homeostasis during viral infections.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RTN3 is upregulated and self-aggregates upon RNA viral infection</title><p>In our previous study, we occasionally observed increased RTN3 expression upon vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection, leading us to investigate why RNA viral infection increases RTN3 expression. Wild-type (WT) HEK293T cells were infected with enhanced GFP-tagged vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-eGFP) or treated with the dsRNA synthetic analog poly(I:C) at different time points.

In addition, human PBMCs from healthy donors infected with VSV exhibited an accordant upregulation of RTN3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

We noted that RTN3 may function as a tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)-binding protein through mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choudhury et al., 2017</xref>), and TRIM25 is a crucial E3 ligase for the K63-linked polyubiquitination modification of RIG-I to promote its activation upon RNA viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gack et al., 2007</xref>). To elucidate the relationship between RTN3 and TRIM25 or RIG-I, HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-tagged RTN3 and Flag-tagged TRIM25 followed by stimulation with or without VSV and then subjected to coimmunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. The results showed that RTN3 interacted with TRIM25 under basal conditions and was slightly strengthened upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Considering that the RTN3 overexpression leads to its aggregation in the ER and may cause nonspecific interactions (such as structural enfolding), we used GFP-TRIM25 to pull down endogenous RTN3 and confirmed its interaction with TRIM25 and that this interaction was strengthened by VSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Since TRIM25 directly targets RIG-I, the coimmunoprecipitation assays were performed in <italic>RIG1</italic> knockout HEK293T cells and the results showed that the TRIM25-RTN3 interaction did not require RIG-I, thus we concluded that RTN3 binds to TRIM25 independent of RIG-I and excluded the possibility that RTN3 may interact with TRIM25 through the interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Besides, we speculated that RTN3 may also interact with RIG-I. Therefore, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays and observed an interaction between TRIM25 and RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) as well as a similar VSV-promoting pattern as that detected for RTN3 interacting with TRIM25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, confocal microscopy results showed the colocalization of RTN3 with RIG-I or TRIM25 on the extended ER framework (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), indicating that RTN3 aggregation may provide a scaffold for TRIM25 oligomerization or the RIG-I signalosome complex. Immunoprecipitation using anti-RTN3 antibody in human PBMCs infected with VSV demonstrated endogenous interaction between RTN3 and TRIM25/RIG-I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

RTN3 localizes to the ER membrane and comprises a noncytoplasmic domain (NC) that inserts into the ER lumen, three transmembrane domains (TM) and two cytoplasmic domains. A series of RTN3 truncations were constructed from the C terminus based on its domain structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and were then assessed for their ability to suppress RIG-I-mediated immune activation through ISRE-luc and NF-κB-luc reporter assays.

The same phenomenon was also observed in NF-κB-luc reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, bottom). These results suggest that the first TM domain is required for the inhibitory activity of RTN3. Furthermore, ubiquitination analysis demonstrated that K63-linked polyubiquitination was impaired by the RTN3 mutants T1, T2 and T3 at levels similar to wild-type RTN3, whereas T4 mutants lacked this activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Our results demonstrate that RTN3 is upregulated upon infection with VSV or poly(I:C) stimulation and then self-aggregates along the ER membrane. A potential mechanism for RTN3 induction may be ER stress upon acute viral infection. As a UPR target gene, the promoter region of the <italic>RTN3</italic> gene harbors binding sites for the ER-stress-related transcription factors ATF6 and CHOP. As a consequence, RTN3 upregulation inhibited RIG-I-mediated immune responses, but had only slight and minimal effects on MDA5- and TLR3-induced activation. We further demonstrated that RTN3 overexpression significantly attenuates the RIG-I-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines.</p><p>In assessments of whether RIG-I is the predominant target through which RTN3 inhibits antiviral responses, our results demonstrated that RTN3 separately interacts with RIG-I and TRIM25 and that their interaction is augmented upon VSV stimulation. Furthermore, we showed that RTN3 overexpression impairs the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I in a TRIM25-dependent manner but does not interfere with RIG-I stability or interaction. Notably, the K63-linked polyubiquitination of TRIM25 was promoted while that of RIG-I was inhibited by RTN3 overexpression that led to RTN3 self-aggregation and the formation of a scaffold-like structure, indicating that RTN3 may interfere with the oligomerization of TRIM25 and its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity to promote RIG-I polyubiquitination. Furthermore, mapping analysis of truncated RTN3 constructs showed that RTN3 transmembrane domain 1 (TM1) is crucial for impairing RIG-I K63-linked polyubiquitination and inhibiting immune responses, indicating that a proper topological structure of RTN3 on the ER membrane is essential for its activity. Thus, the underlying mechanism of how RTN3 interferes with this process is worth further investigation.</p><p>Consistent with the in vitro results, in vivo experiments in mice showed that RTN3 is upregulated upon VSV infection or poly(I:C) stimulation. Importantly, our results provide evidence that RTN3 overexpression decreases the production of inflammatory factors and the neutrophil population in the liver and blood during RNA viral infection. The native neutrophil population may be primarily affected by the downregulation of cytokines and chemokines, and the circulating neutrophil population is affected secondarily. Because neutrophils have the capacity to damage tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ley et al., 2007</xref>), neutrophil inhibition is crucial in the inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ortega-Gómez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Soehnlein and Lindbom, 2010</xref>). The suppression of chemokine CXCL8 (IL-8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>) levels by RTN3 indicates that it may be a potential mediator of inflammation resolution by indirectly restricting neutrophil recruitment. Although the decreased macrophage populations in Rtn3-ovrerexpressing mice were not significant, we did observe a decreasing trend for these populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The histological results demonstrated that RTN3 overexpression attenuated the infiltration of lymphocytes and greatly relieved tissue inflammation and edema. Taken together, these results provide evidence that RTN3 functions to maintain tissue homeostasis and initiate the resolution of inflammation by inhibiting RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses and even terminating acute inflammation.</p><p>Therefore, we propose a working model that describes how RTN3 suppresses RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Upon RNA viral infection, the RIG-I signalosome undergoes TRIM25-mediated activation and induces the production of IFNs, cytokines and chemokines, leading to acute immune responses and inflammation. Subsequently, RTN3 is upregulated in an ER stress- and/or inflammation-dependent manner, which is directly associated with acute viral infection. Aggregated RTN3 on the endoplasmic reticulum interacts with TRIM25 and RIG-I, inhibiting the K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I via the E3 ligase activity TRIM25 to block the RIG-I signaling cascade and attenuate innate immune responses. As a result, the production of IFNs, cytokines and chemokines is attenuated, and the resolution of host inflammation is simultaneously initiated.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The working model of the inhibition of RIG-I mediated antiviral responses by RTN3 Upon RNA virus infection, the RIG-I signalosome is activated by TRIM25-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination, and then triggers IRF3 and NF-κB activation and the expression of interferon, cytokines and inflammatory factors.</title><p>On the other hand, RTN3 is up-regulated by acute viral infection and interferon/inflammatory factors in an ER stress-dependent manner.

Our findings demonstrate a novel negative feedback mechanism for acute immune responses and inflammation resolution and the potential reconstitution of tissue homeostasis during viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and mouse experiments</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sun Yat-Sen University, China.

studying inflammation and the molecular mechanisms that resolve inflammation.

The authors show that this interaction inhibits the K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I mediated by TRIM25, which is a process necessary for RIG-I signaling. The upregulation of RTN3 expression following RNA virus infection was confirmed in vivo, and the authors further demonstrated that neutrophil numbers, lymphocyte infiltration, and inflammation including edema were reduced in mice in which RTN3 was overexpressed. Altogether, this study identifies RTN3 as a regulatory protein that controls RNA virus infection associated upregulation of the innate immune/inflammatory response in order to alleviate tissue inflammation.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are overall supported by the data, and the experiments which represent both in vitro mechanistic studies and in vivo functional analysis, are well designed. The study demonstrates that enforced RTN3 expression inhibits RIG-I mediated innate immune responses and alleviates inflammation. However, additional extensive analyses detailing the effect of RTN3 gene targeting on antiviral innate immunity, as well as additional experiments with endogenously expressed RTN3, are needed to strengthen the physiological role of RTN3 in inflammation/immunity.</p><p>Major Strengths:</p><p>The authors performed a very thorough characterization of RTN3 and its mechanism. They convincingly show binding of RTN3 to both TRIM25 and RIG-I, and the inhibitory effect that this interaction mode has on K63-linked ubiquitination and antiviral signaling of RIG-I. It is clear from the in vitro and in vivo data that endogenous RTN3 is upregulated upon VSV infection or poly(I:C) stimulation, and that its enforced expression dampens the activation of downstream signaling mediators and the induction of proinflammatory genes. The authors performed detailed mapping studies to identify the domain responsible for RTN3's ability to block antiviral signaling, which suggested that proper localization of RTN3 on ER membranes is required for RTN3's immune dampening activity. The in vivo data convincingly show upregulation of endogenous Rtn3 upon VSV infection, and that the neutrophil population is decreased and inflammation is alleviated when Rtn3 expression is enforced.</p><p>The authors utilized a number of cell lines to support their findings, and numerous assays to validate their hypothesis and proposed model.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The design of the experiments solely relies on RTN3 overexpression. The study needs to be further strengthened by experiments that analyze: (a.) endogenous RTN3/TRIM25/RIG-I interaction or complex formation during virus infection or dsRNA stimulation; and (b.) the effect of RTN3 knockdown or knockout on RIG-I antiviral/proinflammatory signaling. RTN3 gene-targeting analysis in primary cells (human or mouse cells) would be preferred, if possible.</p><p>The overall writing and structure of the manuscript could be further improved for the reader's benefit.</p><p>1.
