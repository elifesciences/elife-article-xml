center of emotional expression, contributes to acoustic communication by first interpreting the meaning of social sounds in the context of the listener’s internal state, then organizing the appropriate behavioral responses. We propose that modulatory neurochemicals such as acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine (DA) provide internal-state signals to the BLA while an animal listens to social vocalizations. We tested this in a vocal playback experiment utilizing highly affective vocal sequences associated with either mating or restraint, then sampled and analyzed fluids within the BLA for a broad range of neurochemicals and observed behavioral responses of adult male and female mice. In male mice, playback of restraint vocalizations increased ACh release and usually decreased DA release, while playback of mating sequences evoked the opposite neurochemical release patterns. In non-estrus female mice, patterns of ACh and DA release with mating playback were similar to males. Estrus females, however, showed increased ACh, associated with vigilance, as well as increased DA, associated with reward-seeking. Experimental groups that showed increased ACh release also showed the largest increases in an aversive behavior. These neurochemical release patterns and several behavioral responses depended on a single prior experience with the mating and restraint behaviors. Our results support a model in which ACh and DA provide contextual information to sound analyzing BLA neurons that modulate their output to downstream brain regions controlling behavioral responses to social vocalizations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acoustic communication</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>vocalization playback</kwd><kwd>mating</kwd><kwd>restraint</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC00937</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wenstrup</surname><given-names>Jeffrey J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010254</institution-id><institution>Kent State University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Senate Research Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghasemahmad</surname><given-names>Zahra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018587</institution-id><institution>Northeast Ohio Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BMS Dissertation Completion Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghasemahmad</surname><given-names>Zahra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The modulatory neurochemicals acetylcholine and dopamine are released differentially into the basolateral amygdala depending on the emotional content of vocalizations and the sex, hormonal state, and experience of listening animals.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In social interactions utilizing vocal communication signals, the acoustic features of the signals carry emotional information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altenmüller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darwin, 1872</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seyfarth and Cheney, 2003</xref>). Listeners receive and analyze the acoustic information, compare it with previous experiences, identify the salience and valence of such information, and respond with appropriate behaviors. These integrated functions depend on brain circuits that include the amygdala, a region located within the temporal lobe that is recognized to play a role in orchestrating emotional responses to salient sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McGaugh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sah et al., 2003</xref>). The amygdalar target of auditory inputs from the thalamus and cortex is the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">LeDoux et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Romanski and LeDoux, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shi and Cassell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tsukano et al., 2019</xref>). By integrating this auditory input with other sensory inputs and inputs from other limbic areas, BLA neurons shape appropriate behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gründemann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Namburi et al., 2016</xref>) via projections to downstream targets such as the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stuber et al., 2011</xref>) and central nucleus of the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ciocchi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The BLA processes vocal and other acoustic information in a context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gadziola et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grimsley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wenstrup et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wiethoff et al., 2009</xref>).

Sources of internal state cues to BLA include brain circuits involving modulatory neurochemicals (i.e., neuromodulators), known to affect the processing of sensory signals, thus shaping attention, emotion, and goal-directed behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bargmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Likhtik and Johansen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schofield and Hurley, 2018</xref>). While previous work has demonstrated a role for some neuromodulators—dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh)—in the production of social vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Inagaki et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rojas-Carvajal et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Silkstone and Brudzynski, 2020</xref>), it remains unclear how these and other neuromodulators contribute to vocal processing in social interactions.</p><p>This study investigates contextual information provided by neuromodulatory inputs to the BLA in response to vocal communication signals. Our hypothesis is that these salient vocalizations elicit distinct patterns of neuromodulator release into the BLA, by which they shape the processing of subsequent meaningful sensory information. We further hypothesize that these neuromodulatory patterns may depend on longer-term processes that are critical to vocal communication: to experience with these behaviors and the accompanying vocalizations, to sex, and to estrous stage in females. To test these hypotheses, we conducted playback experiments in a mouse model to understand the behavioral and neuromodulator responses to salient vocalizations associated with very different behavioral states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study how vocalizations affect behaviors and release of neurochemicals within BLA, we first developed highly salient vocal stimuli associated with appetitive (mating) and aversive (restraint) behaviors of CBA/CaJ mice. From more intense, mating-related interactions between adult male and female mice that included female head-sniffing and attempted or actual mounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghasemahmad, 2020</xref>, see Materials and methods), we selected several sequences of vocalizations to form a 20-min mating vocal stimulus. These sequences included ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) with harmonics, steps, and complex structure, mostly emitted by males, and low-frequency harmonic calls (LFHs) emitted by females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaub et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghasemahmad, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hanson and Hurley, 2012</xref>).

On the first 2 days of the experiment, mice in an experienced group (EXP, <italic>n</italic> = 31) were each exposed to 90-min sessions with mating and restraint behaviors in a counterbalanced design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Mice were then implanted with a guide cannula for microdialysis. On the playback/sample collection day (Day 6), a microdialysis probe was inserted into the guide cannula. After a 4-hr period of mouse habituation and probe equilibration, we recorded behavioral reactions and sampled extracellular fluid from the BLA before (Pre-Stim) and during a 20-min playback period, divided into two 10-min stimulation/collection/observation periods that are designated Stim 1 and Stim 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>; see also Materials and methods). Each mouse received playback of either the mating or restraint stimuli, but not both: same-day presentation of both stimuli would require excessively long playback sessions, the condition of the same probe would likely change on subsequent days, and quality of a second implanted probe on a subsequent day was uncertain. Fluids were analyzed using a liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) technique that allowed simultaneous measurement of several neurochemicals and their metabolites in the same dialysate samples, including ACh, DA, and the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) (see Materials and methods).

There were also distinct patterns of ACh and DA release into the BLA depending on the type of vocalization playback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>).

Mating vocalizations, however, resulted in a decrease in ACh release during both playback periods (Stim 1: −19 ± 21.0%; Stim 2: −16.4 ± 24.0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). DA release displayed opposite patterns to ACh, increasing during playback of mating vocalizations during Stim 1 (+12.0 ± 27.4%) and Stim 2 (+25 ± 39% re baseline), but decreasing during playback of restraint vocal sequences (Stim 1: −11.0 ± 11.2%; Stim 2: −22 ± 25.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). For ACh, levels differed significantly between the mating and restraint groups during both Stim 1 and Stim 2, while DA levels differed significantly only during Stim 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). In contrast, the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA showed no distinct pattern over time following playback of either vocal stimulus, nor significant differences between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These findings suggest that both behavioral responses and ACh and DA release are modulated in listening male mice by the affective content of social vocalizations.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Behavioral and neuromodulator responses to vocal playback in male mice differ by behavioral context of vocalizations.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Boxplots show number of occurrences of specified behavior in 10-min observation periods before (Pre-Stim) and during (Stim 1, Stim 2) playback of mating or restraint vocal sequences (<italic>n</italic><sub>Mating</sub> = 7, <italic>n</italic><sub>Restraint</sub> = 6).

Both groups displayed increased ACh release. This supports the possible involvement of ACh in shaping such behavior in both males listening to restraint calls and in estrus females listening to mating vocalizations. Note that neuromodulator release, including ACh, has been previously linked to motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wall and Woolley, 2020</xref>), but the changes in ACh that we observed showed no relationship with behaviors involving motor activity such as rearing (restraint males: Stim 1: <italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>r</italic> = 0.1, p = 0.8; Est females: <italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>r</italic> = 0.7, p = 0.08), locomotion (Stim 1: restraint males, <italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>r</italic> = −0.2, p = 0.7; Est females: <italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>r</italic> = 0.3, p = 0.6), or distance traveled (Stim 1: restraint males, <italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>r</italic> = 0.16, p = 0.8; Est females: <italic>n</italic> = 6, <italic>r</italic> = −0.6, p = 0.2).

Does such experience shape the release patterns of these neuromodulators in response to vocal playback? We tested male and female mice under identical vocal playback conditions as previous groups, except that they did not receive the restraint and mating experiences (INEXP groups).

These experience effects were not observed in males in response to mating or restraint vocal playback. Furthermore, the differences in flinching behavior among EXP groups (male-mating vs male-restraint or estrus female-mating) were not evident among INEXP groups. For rearing behavior, EXP males responding to mating vocalizations showed an increase compared to INEXP males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This pattern was not observed during restraint playback for males or mating playback in estrus females. These findings indicate that behavioral responses to salient vocalizations result from interactions between sex of the listener or context of vocal stimuli with the previous behavioral experience associated with these vocalizations.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A single bout each of mating and restraint experience altered behaviors and acetylcholine (ACh) release in response to vocal playback.</title><p>In all graphs, dots represent measures from individual animals obtained during the Stim 1 playback period; thick horizontal lines represent mean values across subjects.

Nonetheless, how contextual information is delivered to the amygdala and contributes to vocal processing is not well understood. Since the amygdala receives strong projections from neuromodulatory brain centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitta-Aho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Asan, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bigos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bocchio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carlsen et al., 1985</xref>), and since the role of these neurochemicals in providing internal state and contextual information is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bocchio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Likhtik and Johansen, 2019</xref>), we hypothesized that release patterns of neuromodulators into the BLA provide contextual information during processing of affective vocalizations. Our results show that these emotionally charged vocalizations result in distinct release patterns of ACh and DA into the BLA of male and female mice. Furthermore, female hormonal state appears to influence ACh but not DA release into the BLA when processing mating vocalizations. Such context- or state-dependent changes were not observed in patterns of other neurochemicals (e.g., 5-HIAA), nor in the absence of experience with behaviors associated with the vocalizations. In particular, we showed that a single 90-min experience with intense behaviors is sufficient to establish strong, consistent patterns of ACh release into the amygdala. These data indicate that during analysis of affective vocalizations in the BLA, ACh, and DA provide experience-dependent, state- and context-related information that can potentially modulate sensory processing within the BLA and thus shape an individual’s response to these vocalizations.</p><p>The linkage between neuromodulator release and behavioral responses to vocalizations varies. The strongest case is for a link between increased ACh release and flinching behavior. Males in the restraint playback group and estrus females in the mating playback group both displayed significantly increased ACh release and flinching behavior, occurring in both playback periods. This suggests a mechanistic relationship. Other significant behavioral responses to vocal stimuli did not closely match the timing of neurochemical changes, suggesting a weak mechanistic link. Overall, it is not surprising that most behaviors and neurochemicals do not match well, given the poor temporal resolution of the neurochemical sampling. We believe that our results show the need for a finer analysis of DA and ACh release based on techniques for high temporal resolution of neurochemical measurements (e.g., genetically encoded ACh indicator; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jing et al., 2018</xref>), coupled with short interval behavioral observations. Only then can the role of the BLA and neuromodulator inputs in behavioral vocal responses be established more strongly. Furthermore, we note that no conclusion can be made regarding relationships between noradrenalin and serotonin concentrations and vocal playback, since these were not detected by the neurochemical analysis.</p><p>The BLA receives strong cholinergic projections from the basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitta-Aho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carlsen et al., 1985</xref>) that contribute to ACh-dependent processing of aversive cues and fear learning in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baysinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gorka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tingley et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings support these studies by demonstrating increased ACh release in BLA in EXP animals in response to playback of aversive vocalizations. Although the exact mechanism by which ACh affects vocal information processing in BLA is not clear yet, the result of ACh release onto BLA neurons seems to enhance arousal during emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Likhtik and Johansen, 2019</xref>). Our results, in conjunction with previous work, suggest mechanisms by which vocalizations affect ACh release and in turn drive behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Cholinergic modulation in the BLA is mediated via muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors on BLA pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitta-Aho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mesulam et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pidoplichko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Unal et al., 2015</xref>).

In the presence of aversive cues, ACh released from the basal forebrain acts on M1 ACh receptors (M1 mAChRs) to enhance the cue-induced excitatory responses of CeA-projecting neurons. In contrast, NAc-projecting neurons are quiescent, because they do not respond to aversive cues and are inhibited by interneurons that are activated through nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs).

When vocalizations or other rewarding cues are present, release of DA from VTA enhances D2R-mediated excitation in NAc-projecting neurons that are responsive to positive cues. In contrast, CeA-projecting neurons are not responsive to rewarding vocalizations and are inhibited by local interneurons. DA is thought to act on D1 DA receptors (D1Rs) in these local interneurons to shape a direct inhibition onto CeA-projecting neurons.

If projection neurons are at rest, ACh may exert an inhibitory effect by activating nicotinic ACh receptors on local GABAergic interneurons, which in turn synapse onto the quiescent pyramidal neurons. This results in GABA-A-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the pyramidal neurons. Alternately, direct activation of M1 ACh receptors on pyramidal neurons, activating inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> currents, may result in additional ACh-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitta-Aho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pidoplichko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Unal et al., 2015</xref>). When BLA pyramidal neurons are already active due to strong excitatory input associated with aversive cues, M1 receptor activation can result in long afterdepolarizations that produce persistent firing lasting as long as ACh is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Unal et al., 2015</xref>). Such a process may explain persistent firing observed in single neuron responses to aversive social vocalizations in bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gadziola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Peterson and Wenstrup, 2012</xref>). Through this process of inhibiting quiescent neurons and enhancing activation and persistent firing in active neurons, ACh sharpens the population signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during the processing of salient, aversive signals in the BLA. These neurons, processing negative cues, likely project to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) to regulate defensive behaviors such as escape and avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beyeler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement, our behavioral findings show increased behaviors such as flinching along with increased release of ACh during processing of aversive vocalizations. Such prolonged afterdepolarizations provide the appropriate condition for associative synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Likhtik and Johansen, 2019</xref>) and underlie an increase in the ratio of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor current to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor current among CeA-projecting neurons during processing of aversive cues.</p><p>Dopaminergic innervation from the ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asan, 1998</xref>) acts on BLA neurons via D1 and D2 receptors, both G-protein-coupled receptors. DA is important in reward processing, fear extinction, decision making, and motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Di Ciano and Everitt, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lutas et al., 2019</xref>). We observed increased DA release in the BLA in EXP groups in response to mating vocalizations both for males and for females across estrous stages. Electrophysiological studies show that DA enhances sensory processing in BLA neurons by increasing the population response SNR in a process like ACh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kröner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vander Weele et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, during processing of mating vocalizations or those related to other rewarding experiences, DA presence in the vicinity of BLA pyramidal neurons and interneurons is enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). For neurons with elevated spiking activity during processing of appetitive vocalizations or other sensory stimuli, DA acts on D2 receptors of pyramidal cells to further enhance neuronal firing and result in persistent firing of these projection neurons. Conversely, in BLA projection neurons that do not respond to such positive cues, such as CeA-projecting neurons, DA exerts a suppressive effect directly via D1 receptors and indirectly by activating inhibitory interneuron feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kröner et al., 2005</xref>). The net result of this process in response to appetitive vocalizations is an enhancement of activity in the reward-responding neurons and suppression of activity in aversive-responding neurons. This process likely depends on the increase in synaptic plasticity via an enhanced ratio of AMPA receptor current to NMDA receptor current during processing such cues in NAc-projecting neurons in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Namburi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Otani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">van Vugt et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings suggest that this may occur in the BLA in response to appetitive vocalizations.</p><p>As the results with males listening to restraint vocalizations demonstrate, increased ACh release in BLA is associated with processing aversive cues. How, then, should the increased ACh release in estrus females during mating vocal playback be interpreted? Previous work shows that neuromodulation of amygdalar and other forebrain activity is altered by sex hormone/receptor changes in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Egozi et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kalinowski et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirry et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsuda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mizuno et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van Huizen et al., 1994</xref>). For instance, the cholinergic neurons that project to the BLA, originating in the basal forebrain, exhibit high expression of estrogen receptors that is influenced by a female’s hormonal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shughrue et al., 2000</xref>). During estrus, the enhanced circulating estrogen affects release of ACh and may influence neuronal networks and behavioral phenotypes in a distinct manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gibbs, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McEwen, 1998</xref>). Thus, increased ACh release in estrus females may underlie increased attentional and risk-assessment behaviors in response to vocalization playback, as we observed with flinching behavior in this experimental group. Combined with DA increase, it may trigger both NAc and CeA circuit activation, resulting in both reward-seeking and cautionary behaviors in estrus females.</p><p>Our results demonstrate the strong impact of even limited experience in shaping behavioral and neuromodulatory responses associated with salient social vocalizations. In the adult mice, a single 90-min session of mating and of restraint, occurring 4–5 days prior to the playback experiment, resulted in consistent behavioral responses and consistent and enhanced ACh release into BLA for both vocalization types. As previous work shows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nadim and Bucher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pawlak et al., 2010</xref>), neuromodulatory inputs play crucial roles in regulating experience-dependent changes in the brain. However, it remains unclear whether the experience shapes neuromodulator release, or whether neuromodulators deliver the experience-related effect into the BLA. It is also unknown whether these experiences were specific to the type of vocalization playback associated with the experience, or whether either experience had a more generalized effect on responses to all vocalization playback, as suggested by the broad physiological effects of mating or restraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leuner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The interaction between ACh and DA is thought to shape motor responses to external stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lester et al., 2010</xref>). Our results support the view that a balance of DA and ACh may regulate the proper behavioral response to appetitive and aversive auditory cues. For instance, increased reward-seeking behavior (rearing and locomotion) in EXP males during mating vocalizations playback may result from the differential release of the two neuromodulators—decreased ACh and increased DA. Furthermore, the lack of this differential release may be the underlying cause for the lack of such responses in INEXP male mice. This supports the role of experience in tuning interactions of these two neuromodulators throughout the BLA, for shaping appropriate behaviors. Overall, the behavioral changes orchestrated by the BLA in response to emotionally salient stimuli are most likely the result of the interaction between previous emotional experiences, hormonal state, content of sensory stimuli, and sex of the listening animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Northeast Ohio Medical University (protocol 18-09-207).

The location of the probe was then visualized in adjacent cleared and Nissl-stained sections (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, insets). Sections were photographed using a SPOT RT3 camera and SPOT Advanced Plus imaging software (version 4.7) mounted on a Zeiss Axio Imager M2 fluorescence microscope. Adobe Photoshop CS3 was used to adjust brightness and contrast globally. Animals were included in statistical analyses only if ≥75% of the probe membrane was located within the BLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>For neurochemical analyses, the total numbers of animals used were <italic>N</italic><sub>EXP</sub> = 31 and <italic>N</italic><sub>INEXP</sub> = 22. Only mice with usable neurochemical data were further evaluated for behaviors. This included 46 mice: (<italic>N</italic><sub>EXP</sub> = 25 and <italic>N</italic><sub>INEXP</sub> = 21). Note that some animals used in neurochemical analyses were not included in the behavioral analyses because their behavioral data were unavailable. Since only one INEXP female was in a non-estrus stage during the playback session, our analysis of the effect of experience included only estrus females and males. Furthermore, one INEXP female without detectable DA levels was removed from the INEXP group neurochemical analysis.</p><p>Only the following 10-min sample collection windows were used for statistical analysis: Pre-Stim, Stim 1, and Stim 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The purpose of the two collection windows during vocal playback was to allow detection of different epochs of neurochemical release, as may occur in ACh release into the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitta-Aho et al., 2018</xref>). All neurochemical data were normalized to the background level, obtained from a single pre-stimulus sample immediately preceding playback. This provided clarity in representations and did not result in different outcomes of statistical tests compared to use of three pre-stimulus samples. The fluctuation in all background samples was ≤20%. The percentage change from background level was calculated based on the formula: % change from background = (100 × stimulus sample concentration in pg)/background sample concentration in pg<italic>.</italic> Values are represented as mean ± one standard error unless stated otherwise. Raw neurochemical values are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1 fig3sdata2 fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 1–3</xref> for ACh,DA, and 5-HIAA, respectively.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS (IBM, V. 26 and 27). To examine vocalizations in different stages of mating, we used a linear mixed model to analyze the changes of interval and duration (dependent variables) of vocalizations based on mating interaction intensity (fixed effect). For behavioral and neurochemical analyses in playback experiments, we initially compared the output using a linear mixed model and a generalized linear model (GLM) with a repeated measure for neurochemical data. Since both statistical methods resulted in similar findings, we chose to use the GLM for statistical comparisons of the neurochemicals and behaviors. Where Mauchly’s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity.</p><p>To further clarify the differences observed between groups for every comparison in the GLM repeated measure, multivariate contrast was performed. All multiple comparisons were corrected using Bonferroni post hoc testing. 95% confidence intervals were used to compare values between timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Julious, 2004</xref>).</p><p>For both microdialysis and behavioral data, we tested the hypotheses that the release of neurochemicals into the BLA and the number of behaviors is differently modulated by the vocal playback type (mating and restraint) in male mice, by estrous stage of females or sex of the animals during mating vocal playback, and by previous experience in any of these groups. In the GLM model for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, context of vocalizations was defined as the fixed factor and time (Stim 1 and Stim 2) as the within-subject factor. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> tested the effect of sex and estrous state as a nested variable within sex as fixed factors, which were considered in the model design (design = intercept + sex + estrous (sex)). The GLM model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> tested sex, context, and experience as fixed factors with the interaction terms of sex*experience and context*experience. Here, we avoided using a full factorial model due to the absence of females in the restraint group, as that would have made the model unbalanced (design = intercept + sex + context + experience + sex*experience + context*experience). Furthermore, estrous state was not tested in examining the experience effect due to lack of INEXP non-estrus females. Dependent (response) variables included the normalized concentration of ACh, DA, 5-HIAA in Stim 1 and Stim 2 or the numbers of behaviors in Pre-Stim, Stim 1, and Stim 2 as previously described in the behavioral analysis section.</p><p>Throughout the figures, the distributions of data points are visualized by box plots, computed using the ‘inclusive median’ formula in Excel. The box indicates first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles with the median line between the two. The whiskers normally stretch between minimum and maximum values, but this computation sometimes shows data points outside of the whiskers. Excel identifies these values as outliers in the boxplot function. However, our GLM statistical analysis includes these values because there was no compelling reason to exclude them. The mean value is marked with an ‘<italic>x</italic>’.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in accordance with recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The introduction does a better job contextualizing the data, and the additional details in the results and Methods sections help readers digest the material. I continue to think the topic is interesting and the manuscript is potentially impactful. However, I continue to be concerned about their analytical approaches and other aspects of the revised manuscript.</p><p>(a) Normalization</p><p>In my original review I wrote: &quot;The normalization of neurochemical data seems unnecessary given the repeated-measures design of their analysis and could be problematic; by normalizing all data to the baseline data (p. 24), one artificially creates a baseline period with minimal variation (all are &quot;0&quot;; Figures 2, 3 &amp; 5) that could inflate statistical power.&quot; I continue to feel that an analysis of normalized data that includes the baseline data is inappropriate because of the minimal variation in the normalized data for the baseline period. When the normalized data for the baseline period is included in the analysis, there is clearly variation in the extent of variability within each of the time periods (no variability at baseline, variability during periods 1 &amp; 2; analogous to heteroscedasticity). For example, when analyzing the RAW DATA about the change in ACh release in experienced males listening to restraint vocalizations (thank you for releasing the raw data), there was a non-significant effect of time (baseline, period 1, and period 2; linear mixed effects model; F(2,12)=3.2, p=0.0793). However, when the normalized data for this dataset was analyzed (with baseline values being set at 100% for each mouse), there was a statistically significant effect (F(2,12)=4.5, p=0.0352). This example is just to illustrate how normalization can affect (e.g., inflate) statistical power.</p><p>That being said, I do think that it is reasonable to analyzed normalized data if the period used for normalization is NOT included in the analysis (see Figure 3 of one of the paper the authors listed in their response to reviewers: Galvez-Marquez et al., 2022). However, from the reading of this manuscript, it does seem like normalized baseline data are analyzed to assess how stimuli affect neurochemical concentrations.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point on the difference in variance caused by including the 100% baseline values in the analysis. After consulting with our statistician, we chose one of the two approaches suggested by the reviewer. Specifically, we reran the analysis to exclude the baseline and focus only on the playback windows and the group differences. The text in the results, the significance signs in the figures, and the discussion are corrected accordingly. Despite these changes, our major conclusions remains as before. We have included some descriptive statistics in the text because we think these are informative.</p><p>We decided to take this approach because the inter-individual variability in the raw data levels, caused by non-experimental factors, is too great to be useful. As we have stated before, these values are affected by probe placement, collection process, or differences in the HPLC or LC/MS runs. These effects are widely recognized in the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is worth pointing out a few things about the papers listed by the authors. Li et al. (2023) does depict normalized microanalysis data but it isn't clear that any analysis of the normalized data is conducted. The same can be said about Holly et al. (2016). Further, in Bagley et al (2011), the authors depict normalized data in the figures but conduct analyses on the raw data (&quot;After chronic morphine treatment, systemic naloxone injection increased GABA outflow in PAG by 41% from 24.6 ± 2.9 nM to a peak of 34.8 ± 3.8 nM, n = 6, P = 0.016), but did not alter GABA levels after vehicle treatment (39.8 ± 8.3 to 38.6 ± 7.4 nM with naloxone at matched peak time, n = 4; Fig. 3a)&quot;. This latter approach (analyzing raw data in a repeated-measures manner and depicted normalized data) seems reasonable for the authors of the current study.</p><p>(b) Clarification and modification of statistical models</p><p>When analyzing the effect of experience on neuromodulator release, the authors analyze the experienced and inexperienced mice independently (e.g., figure 3 vs. 6). The ideal way to assess the effects of experience is to create a factorial model. For example, one could analyze a full factorial model with experience (exp vs. inexp), stimulus time (mating vs. restraint) and time (baseline, period 1 vs period 2, assuming raw data are used). If one wanted to exclude the baseline period because group differences in baseline are not informative, conducting a factorial analysis of normalized data with just the data from period 1 and 2 seems fine. I believe an analysis like this will help increase the legitimacy of the analysis. For example, when analyzing the normalized data (periods 1 and 2) of experienced and inexperienced males in response to mating or restraint vocalizations, you find a significant interaction between experience and stimulus type. Finding an effect of experience in an analysis that includes both experienced and inexperienced mice is ideal from an analytical framework.</p><p>In Figure 6, it is not clear what the statistical model is and what the interactions mean. For example, in the figure legend for figure 6, the authors report time*context and time*sex interactions. However, in this analysis there are two groups of inexperienced males (males that are listening to restraint vocalizations, males that are listening to mating vocalizations) and one group of females (females that are listening to mating vocalizations); in other words, this is an unbalanced analysis. So, when the authors indicate a time*context interaction, does that mean they are comparing the male-restraint group to the combination of males and females listening to mating vocalizations? And when they talk about a time*sex interaction, are they analyzing how males listening to either mating or restraint vocalizations differ from females listening to a mating vocalization? This all seems peculiar to me.</p><p>- A similar set of questions could be raised about interaction effects depicted in Figure 4.</p><p>Overall, I would like this manuscript to be reviewed by a statistician to provide additional input on how best to analyze the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestions to clarify the statistical model in studying the experience effect. After further consultation with the statistician, we reran the analysis on experience effect, including all the groups of EXP and INEXP animals together.</p><p>Design: Intercept + Sex +Context + Experience+ Sex* Experience + Context* Experience.</p><p>The model is not full factorial as recommended by the statistician, because we don’t have females in the restraint group and that would make an unbalanced design. Therefore, running GLM based on the above model and included factors, as advised by the statistician, is the best way of approaching the analysis for the current dataset.</p><p>We have corrected text in the figure captions, results, discussion, and data analysis sections of the manuscript related to the effect of experience and its interactions. The GLM models are clarified for all the figures in the “data analysis” section of the manuscript. We have clarified that the major effect of experience on neuromodulators was seen in the ACh data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) Analysis of post-stimulus period</p><p>I agree with Reviewer 3 that analyzing the post-stimulus period would be useful. As mentioned in the original review, these data could serve as an opportunity to show that the neurochemical levels returned to baseline and add further support for the model described in Figure 6. In addition, these data could help reveal the link between neurochemical release, auditory responses, and behavior. If neurochemical changes reflect auditory responses, then these should back to baseline during the post-stimulus period. In addition, if behavioral variation (e.g., between mice hearing mating vs. restraint stimuli) persists following the termination of playback, then one could similarly assess whether neurochemical variation persists following playback. If the latter is the case, then the neurochemical release could be more related to the behavior than to the playback stimulus itself.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not change this analysis. Our response to Reviewer 3’s comment is shown below.</p><p>“We decided not to include analyses of the post-stimulus period because this period is subject to wider individual and neuromodulator-specific effects and because it weakens statistical power in addressing the core question—the change in neuromodulator release DURING vocal playback. We agree that the general question is of interest to the field, but we don’t think our study is best designed to answer that question.”</p><p>This was accepted by Reviewer 3. We also note that release patterns have multiple time courses (e.g., Aitta-aho et al., 2018 for ACh), and thus may not support an assumption that levels should return to baseline shortly after playback offset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Page 7, line 15: I suggest changing &quot;vocalization-dependent&quot; to &quot;stimulus-dependent&quot; because the former could connote patterns of release related to the animal itself vocalizing.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed to: “There were also distinct patterns of ACh and DA release into the BLA depending on the type of vocalization playback (Fig 3C,D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion section: The authors should point out a few caveats with their experiments in the Discussion section. First, experienced animals received both mating (social) and restraint experiences, and it is not clear to what degree each type of experience affected neural and behavioral responses (i.e., specificity of experience effects). For example, mating experience can lead to a wide range of physiological changes, including a resilience to stress (e.g., Leuner et al., PLoS One, 2010; Arnold et al., Hormones and Behavior, 2019), so it is possible that mating experiences by themselves could have induced these changes. Or it could be that experiencing restraint stress affects responses to mating stimuli. This could be added to the first paragraph in page 16. (The authors could also discuss which aspects of the sexual encounters might be most important for the behavioral and neural plasticity.)</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text to raise this issue, stating that it is unknown wither the experience effects are specific and citing the above references concerning the generalized effects of certain experiences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion section: It would also be useful for the authors to discuss the extent to which behavior might be driving the neurochemical changes. Some of the analyses suggest that the release is independent of the behavior (e.g., reflects a sensory responses) but this could be emphasized more in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that we have addressed this issue sufficiently in our previous response to related issues raised by this reviewer. As we note, there are limitations in the time resolution of microdialysis data that render the suggested discussion highly speculative. We plan to use other methods to assess this in future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2, legend: Please note that the text above the images describes the stimulus played back to these animals and their hormonal state, and not the type of experienced they underwent (i.e., clarify the titles)</p></disp-quote><p>Changed as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also agree with Reviewer 3 that &quot;mating experience&quot; is a misnomer for this manuscript. &quot;Social experience with a female&quot; is a more accurate descriptor. If they wanted to specifically provide mating experience, males should have only been tested with estrus (receptive females). I don't think this wording change detracts from their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not changed this term. As noted in our previous response to Reviewer #3, we stated: “In the mating experience, mounting or attempted mounting was required for the animal to be included in subsequent testing.” Due to this requirement, the term “mating behavior” is informative and appropriate. In our view, “Social experience with a female” does not adequately describe our inclusion criterion or the experience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The work by Ghasemahmad et al. has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of how neuromodulators provide internal-state signals to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) while an animal listens to social vocalizations.</p><p>Ghasemahmad et al. made changes to the manuscript that have significantly improved the work. In particular, the transparency in showing the underlying levels of Ach, DA, and 5HIAA is excellent. My previous concerns have been adequately addressed.
