complex 1 (mTORC1). Abnormal mTORC1 activation has been implicated in several developmental neurological disorders, including Angelman syndrome (AS), which is caused by maternal deficiency of the ubiquitin E3 ligase UBE3A. Here we report that Ube3a regulates mTORC1 signaling by targeting p18, a subunit of the Ragulator. Ube3a ubiquinates p18, resulting in its proteasomal degradation, and Ube3a deficiency in the hippocampus of AS mice induces increased lysosomal localization of p18 and other members of the Ragulator-Rag complex, and increased mTORC1 activity. p18 knockdown in hippocampal CA1 neurons of AS mice reduces elevated mTORC1 activity and improves dendritic spine maturation, long-term potentiation (LTP), as well as learning performance. Our results indicate that Ube3a-mediated regulation of p18 and subsequent mTORC1 signaling is critical for typical synaptic plasticity, dendritic spine development, and learning and memory.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Angelman syndrome</kwd><kwd>arc</kwd><kwd>LTP</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>proteasome</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS104078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baudry</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15MH101703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bi</surname><given-names>Xiaoning</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new mechanism linking lysosomes to mTOR regulation and synaptic plasticity involves p18 ubiquitination by Ube3a, and underlies some of the pathology observed in Angelman syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein kinase complex, which plays important roles in cell survival, growth, and metabolism. mTOR, consists of two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, which integrate extracellular signals (growth factors, neurotransmitters, nutrients, etc.) with intracellular energy levels and cellular stress status to regulate many important cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takei and Nawa, 2014</xref>). Not surprisingly, abnormal mTOR signaling has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders and neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa-Mattioli and Monteggia, 2013</xref>). Recent evidence indicates that amino acid-induced lysosomal recruitment of mTORC1 is essential for its full activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jewell et al., 2013</xref>). In the presence of amino acids, mTORC1 is activated by binding to heterodimers consisting of Rag small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) RagA/B in their GTP-bound status, and RagC/D in their GDP-bound status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ham et al., 2016</xref>). Lysosomal localization of Rag dimers is maintained through their binding to the Ragulator complex, which consists of p18 (also known as LAMTOR1), p14 (LAMTOR2), MP1 (LAMTOR3), C7orf59 (LAMTOR4), and HBXIP (LAMTOR5) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>); acylation of p18 is essential for anchoring the Ragulator complex to endosomal/lysosomal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nada et al., 2009</xref>). Although it has been shown that lysosomal localization and interaction with Rag GTPases are essential for p18 to regulate mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>), little is known regarding the regulation of p18 levels. A previous study combining single-step immuno-enrichment of ubiquitinated peptides with high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that p18 was ubiquitinated at residues K20 and K31 in HEK cells and MV4-11 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). However, the E3 ligase responsible for p18 ubiquitination was not identified. Furthermore, it is not known whether the Ragulator-Rag complex regulates mTORC1 in the central nervous system (CNS) in a way similar to that in peripheral tissues.</p><p>UBE3A, an E3 ligase in the ubiquitin-proteasomal system, plays important roles in brain development and normal function, as UBE3A deficiency results in Angelman syndrome (AS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Williams et al., 1990</xref>), while UBE3A over-expression increases the risk for autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cook et al., 1997</xref>). We recently reported that imbalanced signaling of the mTOR pathway, with increased mTORC1 and decreased mTORC2 activation, can result in motor dysfunction and abnormal dendritic spine morphology of Purkinje neurons in AS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2015a</xref>). Similar abnormal mTOR signaling is critically involved in Ube3a deficiency-induced impairment in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and fear-conditioning memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin treatment not only reduced mTORC1 activity but also normalized mTORC2 activity, suggesting that mTORC1 over-activation is the trigger for alterations in mTOR signaling in AS mice. However, it remains unknown how Ube3a deficiency results in mTORC1 over-activation. The present study investigated the potential regulation of p18 levels by Ube3a. We demonstrate that Ube3a directly ubiquitinates p18 and targets it for proteasomal degradation, which normally limits mTORC1 signaling and activity-dependent synaptic remodeling. In the absence of Ube3a, p18 accumulates in neurons, resulting in mTORC1 over-activation, abnormal synaptic morphology, and impaired synaptic plasticity and learning. These findings reveal a previously unidentified regulatory mechanism for mTORC1 activation and suggest potential therapeutic targets for cognitive disorders associated with abnormal mTORC1 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>p18 is a Ube3a substrate</title><p>Although it has been shown that p18 plays essential roles in mTOR and MAP kinase signaling and other cellular functions, very little is known regarding its biosynthesis and degradation. We first determined whether Ube3a could regulate p18 levels in heterologous cells. Western blot analysis showed that Ube3a knockdown (KD) in COS-1 cells by siRNA resulted in increased p18 levels, as compared with scrambled control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Sequence analysis revealed the presence of six lysine residues in p18, which could represent ubiquitination sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To assess whether p18 could be a Ube3a substrate, we first determined whether these two proteins exhibited direct interactions. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using extracts from COS-1 cells transfected with Ube3a and Flag-p18 showed that p18 could bind to Ube3a in an E3 ligase activity-independent manner, as p18 could also bind to an inactive form of Ube3a with a mutation in its catalytic site, Ube3a-C833A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumar et al., 1999</xref>) (referred to as ΔUbe3a hereafter) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In vitro ubiquitination assays using purified recombinant p18 and a Ube3a ubiquitination assay kit showed that p18 ubiquitination was only observed in the presence of Ube3a, ubiquitin, E1, E2, and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We then determined whether Ube3a could ubiquitinate p18 in intact cells using His-ubiquitin pull-down assay. COS-1 cells were co-transfected with p18 and His-ubiquitin plus an empty vector, or Ube3a or ∆Ube3a. Ubiquitinated proteins were extracted by Co<sup>2+</sup>-affinity chromatography and analyzed by Western blot. Co-transfection with Ube3a, but not ΔUbe3a, resulted in massive p18 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, transfection with Ube3a, but not ΔUbe3a, resulted in decreased p18 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating that Ube3a-mediated regulation of p18 levels depends on its E3 ligase activity and p18 ubiquitination. Finally, to confirm that Ube3a-mediated p18 ubiquitination was taking place on lysine residues, we simultaneously mutated all lysine residues into arginine (ΔK) in Flag-p18. COS-1 cells were first transfected with either Ube3a siRNA or a scrambled control siRNA, followed by transfection with Flag-p18 or Flag-p18∆K and His-ubiquitin. His-ubiquitin pull-down assay showed that levels of p18-immunopositive high molecular weight bands, that is, ubiquitinated p18, were significantly reduced following Ube3a siRNA KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and the degree of reduction (100.0 ± 1.8 vs. 66.8 ± 3.7, n = 4, p&lt;0.001) corresponded to the extent of Ube3a down-regulation (100.0 ± 2.4 vs. 60.9 ± 5.2, n = 4, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, p18 ubiquitination was abolished by K-R mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). ∆K mutations did not significantly affect the interaction between p18 and Ube3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results confirmed that p18 is ubiquitinated by Ube3a at lysine residues. To further clarify which lysine residue(s) of p18 might be ubiquitinated, we engineered proteins with individual lysine to arginine substitution (K20R, K31R, K60R, K103/104R, and K151R). His-ubiquitin pull-down assays indicated that K20R, K31R, and K151R had little effect on p18 ubiquitination levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, K60R and K103/104R greatly reduced p18 ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). These results suggest that residues K60, K103, and K104 are more likely to be ubiquitinated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37993.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>p18 is a Ube3a substrate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis using anti-Ube3a, p18, or β-actin antibodies of lysates from COS-1 cells transfected with scrambled siRNA or Ube3a siRNA.

Our results showed for the first time that, in hippocampal neurons, p18 is essential for lysosomal localization of other Ragulator members and Rag GTPases, as p18 KD markedly reduced the lysosomal localization of these proteins, which is in agreement with that reported in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nada et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sancak et al., 2010</xref>). We further showed that lysosomal localization of the Ragulator-Rag complex is essential for mTORC1 activation in hippocampal neurons. Additionally, we showed that lysosomal localization and mTORC1 activation depends on Ube3a-mediated regulation of p18 levels, as a Ube3a deficiency-induced increase in p18 levels enhanced lysosomal recruitment of the Ragulator-Rag complex, leading to mTORC1 over-activation. Our results also support the idea that the Ragulator functions not only as a platform but also as a Rag GTPase GEF to facilitate mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar-Peled et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, p18 KD reversed Ube3a deficiency-induced increase in mTORC1 activation and decrease in mTORC2 activation. Collectively, our results indicate that Ube3a-mediated p18 ubiquitination and degradation are critical for maintaining an optimal level of lysosome-anchored Ragulator-Rag complex and mTORC1 activation in hippocampal neurons.</p><p>What could be the functional roles of lysosome-based/p18-dependent regulation of mTOR signaling in hippocampal neurons? In contrast to the classical notion that lysosomes are mostly localized in neuronal soma and function merely as a ‘recycling device’, recent studies have shown that lysosomes are enriched in dendrites and that activity-dependent release of lysosomal hydrolases plays important roles in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goo et al., 2017</xref>). We showed here that p18 was not only co-localized with lysosome markers, but was also present in the vicinity of or co-localized with PSD95-labeled synapses in apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. This localization enables p18 to rapidly assemble or disassemble lysosome-based platforms for mTORC1 activation, and to possibly regulate other enzymes (e.g. MARK), in the vicinity of synapses, thereby regulating synaptic plasticity. Our results also underscored the importance of maintaining optimal p18 levels, as both ‘too much’ and ‘too little’ p18 resulted in abnormal spine structure and synaptic plasticity. Specifically, we showed that Ube3a deficiency-induced increase in p18 levels was associated with increased mTORC1 activation, decreased spine maturation, and impaired LTP and learning performance, all of which were reversed by p18 KD. On the other hand, p18 KD in WT mice resulted in an increased number of immature spines, LTP impairment, and reduced learning performance, possibly because of decreased mTORC1 signaling, as an mTORC1 activator rescued p18 KD-induced LTP impairment. Different levels of mTORC1 inhibition could also explain why in our previous study rapamycin treatment improved LTP and spine maturation in AS mice, but did not affect either LTP or spine morphology in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Along this line, work from the Costa-Mattioli lab clearly indicated that a low concentration of rapamycin has no effect on LTP, while a high concentration of rapamycin impairs LTP in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoica et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, it has been reported that although ErbB inhibitors enhanced contextual fear memory in AS mice, they impaired long-term memory in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaphzan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Several downstream mechanisms could account for the effects of different levels of p18-mTORC1 signaling in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). First, activation of mTORC1-dependent local protein synthesis could account for the increased levels of the immediate-early gene product, Arc in AS mice reported by us and other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). p18 KD reduced Arc immunoreactivity in CA1 pyramidal neurons, possibly through inhibition of the mTORC1-S6K1 pathway, as was the case with rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2016</xref>). Arc is known to induce AMPAR endocytosis, which dampens LTP expression and favors LTD induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chowdhury et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rial Verde et al., 2006</xref>). Related to this, both NMDAR-dependent and mGluR-dependent LTD in hippocampus are enhanced in AS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pignatelli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2015b</xref>). Increased Arc levels have been found to impair TrkB-PSD95 signaling in AS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, inhibition of mTORC1 activity could also inhibit spine maturation, as mTORC1 activation has been shown to interact with other local synaptic events to promote spine enlargement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Henry et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Second, ample evidence has indicated that the dynamic properties of actin networks are crucial for synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity; LTP consolidation is accompanied by increased levels of F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kramár et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2005</xref>). mTORC2 activity, which is reduced by mTORC1-mediated feedback inhibition in AS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2015a</xref>), has been shown to be crucial for actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">He et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomanetz et al., 2013</xref>). LTP impairment in AS mice was associated with reduced TBS-induced actin polymerization, compared with WT mice, and this reduction could be ameliorated by either a positive AMPAR modulator or a SK2 channel blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baudry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2015b</xref>). Both compounds increase NMDAR activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, thereby activating signaling proteins (e.g. CamKII, PKA, Rho), which facilitate F-actin formation. Similarly, reducing inhibitory inputs to CA1 pyramidal neurons using an ErbB inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaphzan et al., 2012</xref>), could also facilitate the activation of these signaling pathways and spine remodeling. p18 KD increased mTORC2 activity, resulting in actin polymerization and spine maturation, albeit through different downstream signaling pathways (activation of PKCα and Akt, etc.). Conditional deletion of <italic>Rictor</italic> in the postnatal murine forebrain greatly reduced mTORC2 activity and dendritic spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, p18 has been shown to directly interact with p27 (kip1), thereby regulating RhoA activity and actin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoshino et al., 2011</xref>), and autophagic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zada et al., 2015</xref>). Whether these mTOR-independent p18 functions play any role in synaptic plasticity and brain development remains to be determined. Of note, baseline synaptic transmission and paired-pulse facilitation were not altered by p18 KD in both WT and AS mice, indicating that changes in synaptic plasticity resulting from p18 KD are likely a result of postsynaptic modifications related to processes that promote actin filament assembly during the minutes following TBS. Our results also indicated that, while there was a significant reduction in the frequency of mEPSCs in AS mice, mEPSC amplitude was not different from that found in WT mice, a result in agreement with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greer et al. (2010)</xref>, but not that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaphzan et al. (2012)</xref>. This pattern would be consistent with a loss of mature spines and the existence of a relatively normal AMPA receptor density in the remaining intact spines of pyramidal neurons of AS mice.</p><p>Deregulation of mTOR signaling has been identified as a phenotypic feature common to various forms of ASD, including fragile X syndrome, and mutations in tuberous sclerosis complex 1 and 2 (<italic>TSC1/2</italic>), neurofibromatosis 1, and phosphatase and tensin homolog (<italic>PTEN</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huber et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to our findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al. (2014)</xref> recently reported that over-activation of mTORC1 in <italic>TSC2<sup>+/-</sup></italic> ASD mice resulted in increased spine density because of inhibition of the autophagy that underlies postnatal spine pruning. However, to date there is no report indicating that there is decreased autophagy in AS mice, suggesting the existence of different mechanisms downstream of mTORC1 in these two different mouse models. Although mTOR signaling is increased in Fragile X mouse models, a recent report showed that chronic rapamycin treatment did not reverse behavioral phenotypes and had adverse effects on sleep and social behavior in both control and <italic>Fmr1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saré et al., 2017</xref>). These results strengthen the notion that further understanding of the mTOR pathway and its upstream and downstream regulation is needed.</p><p>Although we propose that Ube3a-mediated regulation of the p18-mTOR pathway is crucial in the pathogenesis of AS, our work by no means intends to conclude that p18 is the sole Ube3a target implicated in AS. Rather, our results indicate that the newly identified regulation of mTORC1 activation by lysosome-located p18 is present in the brain and plays important roles in synaptic plasticity, and document the existence of another layer of regulation in the already complex mTOR pathway, namely the regulation of p18 levels by Ube3a. Importantly, while UBE3A deficiency results in AS, UBE3A over-expression results in increased ASD risk. Increased density of dendritic spines with immature morphology has been reported in brains of ASD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hutsler and Zhang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al., 2014</xref>). In our study, reducing p18 levels in WT mice resulted in similar changes in spine properties. It is therefore tempting to propose that UBE3A over-expression might induce ASD phenotypes, at least in part, by down-regulating p18 levels. It is also noteworthy that abnormal mTOR signaling has been implicated in a number of diseases. Therefore, results from our studies shed new light on a broad range of normal brain functions, and on several neurological/neuropsychiatric disorders, including AS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">B6.129S7-Ube3a<sup>tm1Alb</sup>/J</td><td valign="top">The Jackson <break/>Laboratory <break/>PMID: 9808466</td><td valign="top">MGI: J:50811</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background</td><td valign="top">Control shRNA Lentiviral <break/>Particles</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">sc-108080</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">P18 shRNA Lentiviral <break/>Particles</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">sc-108727-V</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background</td><td valign="top">copGFP Control Lentiviral <break/>Particles</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology</td><td valign="top">sc-108084</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background</td><td valign="top">Scrambled AAV9 siRNA <break/>Control Virus</td><td valign="top">Applied Biological <break/>Materials</td><td valign="top">iAAV01509</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">P18 AAV9 siRNA Pooled <break/>Virus</td><td valign="top">Applied Biological <break/>Materials</td><td valign="top">iAAV04811709</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background</td><td valign="top">Scrambled AAV9 shRNA <break/>Control Virus</td><td valign="top">VectorBuilder</td><td valign="top">SP1001276</td><td valign="top">Custom</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">P18 AAV9 shRNA Virus</td><td valign="top">VectorBuilder</td><td valign="top">SP1001275</td><td valign="top">Custom;

Briefly, frozen hippocampus tissue was homogenized in ice-cold HEPES-buffered sucrose solution (0.32 M sucrose, 4 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors. Homogenates were centrifuged at 900 g for 10 min to remove large debris (P1). The supernatant (S1) was then centrifuged at 11,000 g for 20 min to obtain crude membrane (P2) and cytosolic (S2) fractions. P2 pellets were sonicated in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). For whole homogenates, tissue was homogenized in RIPA buffer. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).</p><p>Lysosome-enriched fractions were prepared from cultured neurons or isolated hippocampus using the lysosome enrichment kit (Pierce). The purity of the fractions was assessed using antibodies against cathepsin B (lysosomes) and COXIV (mitochondria). Cultured hippocampal neurons from WT mice were transfected with Accell p18 siRNA or Accell Non-targeting siRNA (GE Dharmacon) at DIV 7, and were used 4 d after transfection.

Briefly, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 3% BSA for 1 h, membranes were incubated with specific antibodies overnight at 4°C followed by incubation with secondary antibodies (IRDye secondary antibodies) for 2 hr at room temperature. Antibody binding was detected with the Odyssey family of imaging systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunoprecipitation and denaturing immunoprecipitation</title><p>For immunoprecipitation, all procedures were carried out at 4°C. COS-1 cells transfected with the indicated cDNAs or cultured hippocampal neurons were lysed with lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 25 mM pH 7.4, NaCl 150 mM, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 5% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor cocktail). After a brief centrifugation to remove insoluble material, the supernatant was precleared with an aliquot of agarose beads. For immunoprecipitation of Flag-p18 or Flag-p18∆K in COS-1 cells, extracts were incubated overnight with anti-Flag agarose beads, washed with lysis buffer, followed by elution of bound proteins by heating at 95°C for 10 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For immunoprecipitation of p18 in hippocampal neurons, extracts were incubated with anti-p18 antibodies overnight and immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A/G Agarose. For immunoprecipitation of RagA in mouse hippocampus, rabbit anti-RagA antibodies were incubated with hippocampal lysates and precipitated with Protein A/G-conjugated beads. Inputs and precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. All studies were performed in three to five independent experiments.</p><p>For immunoprecipitation of ubiquitin from hippocampal crude membrane fractions under denaturing conditions, P2 pellets were resuspended and heated in denaturing lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 2 µg/ml leupeptin, 15 U/ml DNase I) and diluted in nine volumes of ice-cold non-denaturing lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM PMSF, 2 µg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 30 min at 4°C and cleared with protein A/G Agarose beads. Pre-cleared lysates were then incubated with anti-ubiquitin antibodies coupled to protein A/G Agarose beads overnight at 4°C, followed by four washes with ice-cold wash buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) and elution in 2 x SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against p18 and ubiquitin. Relative p18 ubiquitination refers to the ratio of ubiquitinated p18 over total p18, and was normalized to the average value of the WT group. At least three independent experiments were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vitro ubiquitination assay</title><p>His-p18 proteins were purchased from CUSABIO (Wuhan, China). For in vitro ubiquitination experiments, we used the E6AP (UBE3A) Ubiquitin Ligase Kit (Boston Biochem), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, purified His-p18 proteins were incubated for 90 min at 37°C under constant shaking with E1 enzyme, E2 enzyme (UBE2L3), His<sub>6</sub>-E6AP, ubiquitin, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-ATP, and reaction buffer. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and samples were boiled, and proteins separated with 14% SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with p18, ubiquitin, and His antibodies.

Ube3a siRNA-treated COS-1 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg Flag-p18 or p18∆K and 2.5 μg His-ubiquitin 48 hr after siRNA treatment. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lysed, and His-ubiquitin-conjugated proteins were purified as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2015b</xref>). Briefly, cells were harvested in 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell suspension was divided into two parts; 100 μl were lysed using 1 x SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer containing 10% DTT, and 900 μl were lysed in Buffer A (6 M guanidine HCl, 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>/NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol, pH 8.0) and sonicated. The guanidine lysates were incubated with 30 μl of equilibrated Talon resin at 4°C for 4 hr to bind His-tagged ubiquitinated proteins. Beads were then washed one time with Buffer A, followed by four washes with Buffer B (8 M urea, 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>/NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol, pH 8.0). The protein conjugates were eluted in 30 µl of 2 X laemmli/imidazole (200 mM imidazole) and boiled. Eluates were analyzed by Western blotting using either p18 or ubiquitin antibody. At least three independent experiments were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Acute hippocampal slice preparation</title><p>Adult male mice (2–4 month-old) were anesthetized with gaseous isoflurane and decapitated.

Hippocampal transversal slices (400 μm-thick) were prepared using a McIlwain-type tissue chopper and transferred to i) an interface recording chamber and exposed to a warm, humidified atmosphere of 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> and continuously perfused with oxygenated and preheated (33 ± 0.5°C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (in mM): 110 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.24 KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 D-glucose, 27.4 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, perfused at 1.4 ml/min (electrophysiology); or ii) a recovery chamber with a modified aCSF medium, containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 D-glucose, and saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1 hr at 37˚C (biochemical assays).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>After 1.5 hr incubation at 33 ± 0.5°C in the recording chamber, a single glass pipette filled with 2 M NaCl was used to record field EPSPs (fEPSPs) elicited by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral pathway with twisted nichrome wires (single bare wire diameter, 50 µm) placed in CA1 stratum radiatum. Stimulation pulses were generated using a Multichannel Systems Model STG4002 Stimulator (Reutlingen, Germany). Responses were recorded through a differential amplifier (DAM 50, World Precision Instruments, USA) with a 10 kHz high-pass and 0.1 Hz low-pass filter. Before each experiment, the input/output (I/O) relation was examined by varying the intensity of the stimulation. Paired-pulse facilitation was tested at 20–300 ms interval. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced using theta burst stimulation (10 bursts at 5 Hz, each burst consisting of four pulses at 100 Hz, with a pulse duration of 0.2 ms). For LTP and paired-pulse facilitation experiments, the stimulation intensity was regulated to a current which elicited a 40% of maximal response. Data were collected and digitized by Clampex, and the slope of fEPSP was analyzed. MHY1485 (2 µM) was applied to slices for 60 min before theta-burst stimulation (TBS). Some of the slices were processed for Western blots. All data are expressed as means ± SEM, and statistical significance of differences between means was calculated with appropriate statistical tests as indicated in figure legends.</p><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recording was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vogel-Ciernia et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, hippocampal slices were prepared on the horizontal plane at a thickness of 370 μm from 2- to 4-month-old male mice with a Leica vibrating tissue slicer (Model: VT1000S). Slices were placed in a submerged recording chamber and continuously perfused at 2–3 mL/min with oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>) aCSF at 32°C. Whole-cell recordings (Axopatch 200A amplifier: Molecular Devices) were made with 4–7 MΩ recording pipettes filled with a solution containing (in mM): 130 CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 CsCl, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.2 EGTA, 5 QX-314, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na-GTP. Osmolarity was adjusted to 290–295 mOsm and pH 7.4. Spontaneous mEPSCs were recorded at a holding potential of –70 mV in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 μM) and picrotoxin (50 μM). Data were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 1–5 kHz, stored on a computer, and analyzed off-line using Mini Analysis Program (Synaptosoft), Origin (OriginLab) and pCLAMP 7 (Molecular Devices) software. Statistical significance was determined by pooling events from cells of the same genotype and running a Student’s t-test on the pooled data. p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Cultured hippocampal neurons were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/10% sucrose for 15 min at 37˚C, transferred to 0.05% Triton X-100/PBS for 5 min at 4˚C, and then 0.02% Tween-20/PBS for 2 min at 4˚C. Coverslips were washed twice with ice cold PBS and incubated 1 hr in 3% BSA/PBS at room temperature. For staining of F-actin, Rhodamine-Phalloidin (Invitrogen) was incubated in 1% BSA/PBS overnight at 4˚C. For staining of p18, LAMTOR4, RagA, and LAMP2, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-p18 (1:200, Sigma), rabbit anti-LAMTOR4 (1:500, CST), rabbit anti-RagA (1:100, CST), rat anti-LAMP2 (1:200, Abcam) respectively in 3% BSA/PBS overnight at 4˚C. Coverslips were then washed twice with ice cold PBS for 10 min each and then incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor-594 anti-rabbit, 1:200; Alexa Fluor-594 anti-rat, 1:200; and Alexa Fluor-633 anti-mouse, 1:200) for 2 hr at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed four times with ice cold PBS for 10 min each, and mounted on glass slides using VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 880 confocal laser-scanning microscope. The staining was visualized in GFP-expressed neurons. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated over a specific region of interest, and background staining of the sections was measured and subtracted from the total signal to obtain the specific signal.</p><p>Hippocampal slices were collected 40 min after TBS and fixed in 4% PFA for 1 hr and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 1 hr at 4˚C, and sectioned on a freezing microtome at 20 μm. Sections were blocked in 0.1 M PBS containing 5% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100, and then incubated in primary antibody mixture including chicken anti-GFP (1:500) and rabbit anti-p18 (1:200, Sigma) in 0.1 M PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 overnight at 4˚C. Sections were washed three times (10 min each) in PBS and incubated in Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-chicken IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit IgG for 2 hr at room temperature. All images were taken in CA1 stratum radiatum between the stimulating and recording electrodes. The threshold for the GFP fluorescence was set to make sure that the control slices from naive mice or mice with AAV infection but without GFP reporter were considered GFP-negative.</p><p>For immunofluorescence with brain tissue section, deeply anesthetized animals were perfused and brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight followed by sequential immersion in 15% and 30% sucrose for cryoprotection. Brains were then sectioned (20 μm) and stained as described above. The following primary antibodies were used: p18 (1:200, Sigma), LAMTOR4 (1:500, CST), RagA (1:100, CST), p14 (1:100, CST), MP1 (1:100, CST), RagB (1:100, CST) mTOR (1:100, CST), p-mTOR (1:100, CST), LAMP2 (1:200, Abcam), and PSD95 (1:200, Thermo). The hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell soma and apical dendrites were randomly selected for colocalization analysis by Manders’ coefficients. The apical dendrites in hippocampal CA1 stratum radiatum were also randomly selected for puncta analysis. The puncta number of p18/PSD95 was quantified and the percentage of p18 and PSD95 dually stained synapses was also analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Intrahippocampal AAV injection</title><p>We employ a dual convergent promoter system (U6 and H1 promoters) in which the sense and antisense strands of the siRNA are expressed by two different promoters rather than in a hairpin loop to avoid any possible recombination events. Stereotaxic AAV injection into CA1 region of the hippocampus was performed in 8-week-old mice. Animals were allocated into the experimental/control groups in a randomized manner. Under isoflurane anesthesia, AAV p18 siRNA or AAV scrambled siRNA constructs in 2 µl solution were injected bilaterally into CA1 regions at two sites: 1.94 mm posterior to bregma, 1.4 mm lateral to the midline and 1.35 mm below the dura and 2.2 mm posterior to bregma, 1.8 mm lateral to the midline and 1.5 mm below the dura. The solution was slowly injected over 30 min and the needle was left in place for an additional 10 min. The needle was then slowly withdrawn and the incision closed. AAV-injected mice were used for experiments after 4 weeks, a period determined in pilot studies to be necessary for sufficient expression of viral mediated gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Image analysis and quantification</title><p>Images were acquired using a Nikon C1 or a Zeiss LSM 880 with Airyscan confocal laser-scanning microscope with a 60 X objective. Images for all groups in a particular experiment were obtained using identical acquisition parameters and analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH). All immunostaining studies were performed in three to five independent experiments. In all cases the experimenter was blinded regarding the identity of the transfected constructs and the genotypes during acquisition and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Dendritic spine analysis</title><p>Four weeks after AAV injection, mice were deeply anesthetized using gaseous isoflurane and then decapitated. The brain was rapidly removed and Golgi impregnation was performed according to our published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sun et al., 2016</xref>) and outlined in the FD Rapid GolgiStain Kit (FD Neurotechnologies, Ellicott, MD). The number of spines located on randomly selected dendritic branches was counted manually by an investigator blinded to genotype and injection. Spine density was calculated by dividing the number of spines on a segment by the length of the segment and was expressed as the number of spines per µm of dendrite. Spine types were determined on the basis of the ratio of the width of the spine head to the length of the spine neck and classified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Risher et al., 2015</xref>). Five to seven dendritic branches between 10 and 20 µm in length were analyzed and averaged to provide a section mean.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Fear conditioning</title><p>AS mice and their WT littermates were randomly assigned to either control or p18 siRNA groups and blinded to the examiner. Four weeks after AAV injection, mice were placed in the fear-conditioning chamber (H10-11M-TC, Coulbourn Instruments). The conditioning chamber was cleaned with 10% ethanol to provide a background odor. A ventilation fan provided a background noise at ∼55 dB. After a 2 min exploration period, three tone-footshock pairings separated by 1 min intervals were delivered. The 85 dB 2 kHz tone lasted 30 s and co-terminated with a footshock of 0.75 mA and 2 s. Mice remained in the training chamber for another 30 s before being returned to home cages. Context test was performed 1 day after training in the original conditioning chamber with 5 min recording. On day 3, animals were subjected to cue/tone test in a modified chamber with different texture and color, odor, background noise, and lighting. After 5 min recording, mice were exposed to a tone (85 dB, 2 kHz) for 1 min. Mouse behavior was recorded with the Freezeframe software and data were analyzed using the Freezeview software (Coulbourn Instruments). Motionless bouts lasting more than 1 s were considered as freezing. The percent of time animal froze was calculated and group means with SEM were analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Error bars indicate standard error of the mean.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the conceptual premise of the manuscript, as you may have uncovered a previously unappreciated mechanism. However, there are experimental and conceptual (i. e. how the molecular process is linked to the LTP phenotype) issues that were raised by all reviewers. Thus, there is a significant amount of work that is required be performed to render this work acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. For example, you should examine Arc more closely rather than bringing it up in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Sun et al. investigated a novel mechanism regulating mTORC1 activity via Ube3a-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p18 (LAMTOR1) and implicate this regulatory axis in proper hippocampal morphology and function. Previous studies have demonstrated the physiological role of lysosomal recruitment and activation of mTORC1 via the Rag-Ragulator complex. The upstream mechanisms, however, remain poorly defined especially in the brain. To this end, the authors first demonstrate that UBE3A, an E3 ligase, interacts with and ubiquitinates p18 in vitro and in hippocampal cells. Loss of UBE3A (as in the Angelman syndrome (AS) mouse model) or inhibiting the proteasome causes aberrant lysosomal accumulation of hippocampal p18. This effect coincides with increased lysosomal localization of RagA and mTOR and elevated mTORC1 activity. Importantly, reducing elevated levels of p18 in the AS mouse brain rescues impaired spine maturation and LTP.</p><p>1) The authors claim that AAV siRNA-mediated p18 downregulation in AS mice restored LTP to wild type control levels, yet the same treatment in wild-type mice engendered a significant reduction in LTP. These findings are hard to reconcile, since mTOR activity is reduced by knockdown of p18 in both wild type and AS mice neurons. An explanation for this discrepancy is required.</p><p>2) Figure 2C. The amount of GFP in the shScrambled versus shP18 groups appears different. Is this due to different image exposure times or different transfection efficiency? This is problematic vis-à-vis the accuracy quantification of p18 in the treatment group.</p><p>3) Figure 4H. The authors claim that in Ube3a-deficient neurons, excessive mTORC1 is localized to the lysosome resulting in enhanced activity. Is it possible that both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are being localized to the lysosome under these conditions? How can the authors distinguish between these complexes given their data?</p><p>4) Figure 5D. Treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with shP18 in wild-type mice causes an increase in the number of spines but in Figure 7B, wild type mice treated with siP18 show a reduction in the number of mature spines.

This group has previously reported that mTORC1 activity is increased in the cerebellum and hippocampus of Ube3a knockout mice and that Inhibition of mTORC1 with rapamycin improved motor and learning phenotypes these mice. How Ube3a loss results in mTORC1 overactivation has been a mystery. This current manuscript article provides evidence that this is mediated through p18 (LAMTOR1) ubiqiutination. Loss of Ube3a ubiquitination of p18 (LAMTOR1) results in defects associated with synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine development. The authors suggest that this is related to increased lysosomal localization of p18 and resulting increased mTORC1 activation. Taken together, this study provides a novel mechanism of regulation of p18 by Ube3a ubiquitination. The authors should be commended on a comprehensive evaluation of the implications of this finding. However, there are a few questions that remain to be answered as described below.</p><p>1) Figure 1—figure supplement 1A: It seems like p18 protein levels are dramatically reduced with His-ubiquitin expression, even in the absence of Ube3a expression. How do the authors interpret this?</p><p>2) Figure 1E and Figure 3C: y-axes are labeled as relative p18 ubiquitination. How is that calculated? Is it the ratio of ubiquitinated p18 over total p18?</p><p>3) Figure 3D: p18 protein levels are increase with MG132 treatment even in Ube3a KO mice. What is the explanation for this increase?</p><p>4) In the Results (subsection, “4. Increased p18 levels in AS mice are associated with increased lysosomal localization of the Ragulator-Rag complex and mTOR”), the authors study the localization of &quot;p-mTOR, the active isoform of mTOR.&quot; I believe they are using Ser2448 phospho-mTOR antibody for that purpose. There is some controversy about the role of Ser2448 phosphorylation on mTOR activity. Substitution of Ser2448 with alanine does not affect mTOR activity (Sekulic et al., 2000). If there is good evidence that this phospho-specific antibody correlates with mTOR activity, it should be included in this section.</p><p>5) S6 ribosomal protein can get phosphorylated at Ser235/236 by S6Ks; however, S6K1/2 are not the only enzymes that are able to phosphorylate these sites. The contribution of S6K1/2 in S6 phosphorylation was addressed using S6K1/S6K2 double knock-out animals, which were found to display no phosphorylation of S6 at Ser240/244, but persistent phosphorylation at Ser235/236 (Pende et al., Mol. Cell., 2004). Kinases other than S6K can phosphorylate Ser235/236. They should investigate whether phosphorylation of S6 at Ser240/244 is affected by p18.</p><p>6) Quantification method for both imaging and western blotting should be further described:</p><p>a) Specifically, for imaging quantification how was mean fluorescence intensity calculated, over the entire image field or a specific region of interest?</p><p>b) I cannot figure out how Figure 2F was generated. I assume the authors combined quantification of different double-staining experiments. This should be clarified. It should also be clarified what the n refers to in the figure legend regarding Figure 2F.</p><p>c) The ideal figure to include in Figure 2 would be one where are representative images of p18 staining and LAMP staining simultaneously of neurons treated with p18 shRNA or control shRNA. I could not find such a figure in the manuscript.</p><p>7) The authors show that knockdown of p18 results in loss of lysosomal localization of the Ragulator complex and Rag in hippocampal neurons by immunofluorescence. This is an important finding. Another way to make this assertion more robust would be to prepare lysosomal fractions and demonstrate these findings biochemically.</p><p>8) Figure 4: Do AS hippocampi have more lysosomes?

Is that meant to show phospho-PKC?</p><p>11) Along the same lines, Figure 5 p-mTOR and p-S6 are modest and probably the least convincing data of the paper. It would be good to include other direct targets substrates of mTOR as markers of mTOR activation (e.g. p70/S6K and 4EBP1).</p><p>12) A previous paper by Tang et al.

This argument has some holes. In their previous publication for example, these authors showed that rapamycin treatment decreased Arc levels in WT hippocampal slices, but did not affect LTP or spine morphology in WT mice (Sun et al., 2016).

As we were anticipating these questions, we have performed these experiments, and the new results address these two points and further support our argument regarding the novel function of p18 in synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. We believe that these new data should satisfy the reviewers, as well as the Editors, and make the paper now suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors claim that AAV siRNA-mediated p18 downregulation in AS mice restored LTP to wild type control levels, yet the same treatment in wild-type mice engendered a significant reduction in LTP. These findings are hard to reconcile, since mTOR activity is reduced by knockdown of p18 in both wild type and AS mice neurons. An explanation for this discrepancy is required.</p></disp-quote><p>That the same p18 knockdown (KD) treatment in AS and WT mice resulted in different outcomes is most likely due to different basal p18 levels and mTORC1 activity in the two genotypes. AS mice have higher than normal basal levels of p18 and mTORC1 activity. As shown in Figure 6, p18 KD in WT mice induced a larger reduction in p18 levels than in AS mice. Correspondingly, p18 KD also induced a larger reduction in levels of Arc, a downstream protein of the p18-mTORC1 pathway, in WT mice than in AS mice. Work from the Costa‐Mattioli lab has clearly indicated that a low concentration of rapamycin has no effect on LTP in WT mice, while a high concentration of rapamycin impairs LTP (Stoica et al., 2011). Thus, it is conceivable that p18 KD impairs LTP in hippocampus from WT mice, due to its over‐inhibition of mTORC1 activity. To further address this point, we investigated the effect of MHY1485, an mTOR activator, on TBS-induced LTP in hippocampal slices from p18 KD WT mice. The results showed that acute activation of mTORC1 could improve TBS‐elicited LTP in these slices, indicating that a tightly controlled p18 level is critical for normal p18‐mTORC1 signaling and synaptic plasticity. These data have been shown in Figure 7 and we have expanded our discussion on this topic in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2C. The amount of GFP in the shScrambled versus shP18 groups appears different. Is this due to different image exposure times or different transfection efficiency? This is problematic vis-à-vis the accuracy quantification of p18 in the treatment group.</p></disp-quote><p>The shP18 AAV we use showed very good and consistent knockdown efficiency with GFP as a reliable marker and most of the infected neurons showed similar levels of GFP, which is now better shown in higher magnification images. Therefore, high magnification images of neurons with comparable GFP expression are used in the new Figure 2C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4H. The authors claim that in Ube3a-deficient neurons, excessive mTORC1 is localized to the lysosome resulting in enhanced activity. Is it possible that both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are being localized to the lysosome under these conditions? How can the authors distinguish between these complexes given their data?</p></disp-quote><p>Recent studies have reported that mTORC1 is localized to the lysosome while mTORC2 is localized to mitochondria‐associated ER membrane (see review from Betz and Hall, 2013). However, we investigated the location of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in our study. We performed double staining of Raptor, which is specific for mTORC1, and Rictor, which is specific for mTORC2, with LAMP2. Raptor, but not Rictor, was clearly co‐localized with LAMP2 in CA1 pyramidal neurons in both WT and AS mice, and more Raptor/LAMP2 double‐stained puncta were detected in AS mice than in WT mice, suggesting that mTORC1 but not mTORC2 is localized to the lysosome under these conditions. These new data have been included in the Figure 4—figure supplement 2B‐D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5D. Treatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with shP18 in wild-type mice causes an increase in the number of spines but in Figure 7B, wild type mice treated with siP18 show a reduction in the number of mature spines. A rationale for this discrepancy should be included in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>P18 knockdown increased total spine density in <italic>both</italic> cultured WT hippocampal neurons (Figure 5C‐D) and in vivo (Figure 8—figure supplement 1A). P18 KD also decreased the proportion of mature spines in vivo (Figure 8A‐B and Figure 8—figure supplement 1B). The proportion of mature spines does not always correlate with total spine density; p18 KD‐induced increase in total spine density in AS mice was associated with increased proportion and number of mature spines, while in WT mice, it was associated with increased number and density of immature spines. Here again, we postulate that differences in p18 levels and mTORC1/mTORC2 signaling are responsible for these differences. As discussed in the manuscript, UBE3A deficiency results in AS, while its overexpression increases risks for autism spectrum disorder. Whether spine maturation plays any roles in UBE3A over‐expression‐induced ASD is an interesting question to be addressed in future studies.

The result showed that Raptor was clearly co‐localized with LAMP2 in CA1 pyramidal cell soma of adult mice, and more Raptor/LAMP2 double‐stained puncta were detected in AS than in WT mice (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B and D).

We believe that there are a few not mutually exclusive mechanisms, which could impair LTP in AS mice.
