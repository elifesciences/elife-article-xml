Such journalism shapes the public’s view of the current state of science and legitimizes experts. Journalists can only cite and quote a limited number of sources, who they may discover in their research, including recommendations by other scientists. Biases in either process may influence who is identified and ultimately included as a source. To examine potential biases in science journalism, we analyzed 22,001 non-research articles published by Nature and compared these with Nature-published research articles with respect to predicted gender and name origin. We extracted cited authors’ names and those of quoted speakers. While citations and quotations within a piece do not reflect the entire information-gathering process, they can provide insight into the demographics of visible sources. We then predicted gender and name origin of the cited authors and speakers. We compared articles with a comparator set made up of first and last authors within primary research articles in Nature and a subset of Springer Nature articles in the same time period. In our analysis, we found a skew toward quoting men in Nature science journalism. However, quotation is trending toward equal representation at a faster rate than authorship rates in academic publishing. Gender disparity in Nature quotes was dependent on the article type. We found a significant over-representation of names with predicted Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with a predicted East Asian origin in both in extracted quotes and journal citations but dampened in citations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>science journalism</kwd><kwd>gender disparity</kwd><kwd>name origin disparity</kwd><kwd>natural language processing</kwd><kwd>web scraping</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GBMF 4552</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greene</surname><given-names>Casey S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99HG012945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Natalie R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Those quoted and mentioned in stories in Nature News mostly have names associated with men and are much less likely to have names associated with East Asia.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Science journalism is an indispensable part of scientific communication and provides an accessible way for everyone from researchers to the public to learn about new scientific findings and to consider their implications. However, it is important to identify the ways in which its coverage may skew toward particular demographics. Coverage of science shapes who is considered a scientist and field expert by both peers and the public. This indication of legitimacy can either help recognize people who are typically overlooked due to systemic biases or intensify biases. Journalistic biases in general-interest, online and printed news have been observed by journalists themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">French, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">LaFrance, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">LaFrance, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yong, 2018</xref>), as well as by independent researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ross and Carter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Layton and Shepard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Who Makes the News, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Holman et al., 2018</xref>). Researchers found a gap between men and women subjects or sources, with independent studies finding that between 17% and 40% of total subjects were women across multiple general-interest printed news outlets between 1985 and 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Who Makes the News, 2024</xref>). One study found 27–35% of total subjects in international science and health-related news were women between 1995 and 2015, and 46% in print, radio, and television in the United States in 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Who Makes the News, 2024</xref>). While gender disparities in news coverage have been extensively researched, our research is different because it focuses on science journalism and comparing it against the demographics of actively publishing scientists. Additionally, our work focuses on research into disparities with respect to name origins, a focus which is currently lacking in the literature.</p><p>It should be noted that scientific news coverage is confounded by the existing differences in gender and racial demographics within the scientific field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">NSF - National Science Foundation, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Iwasaki, 2019</xref>). However, we are interested in quantifying disparities with respect to observed demographic differences in the scientific field, using academic authorship as an estimate for the existing demographics. This is similar to other studies that have quantified gender or racial disparities in science as observed in citation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">King et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Larivière et al., 2013</xref>) and funding rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stevens et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Erosheva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoppe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ley and Hamilton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ginther et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In researching a story, a journalist will typically interview multiple sources for their opinion, potentially asking for additional sources, thus allowing individual unconscious biases at any point along the interview chain to skew scientific coverage broadly. In addition, the repeated selection of a small set of field experts or the approach a journalist takes in establishing a new source may intensify existing biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">LaFrance, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yong, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selby, 2016</xref>). While disparities in representation may go unnoticed in a single article, analyzing a large corpus of articles can identify and quantify these disparities and help guide institutional and individual self-reflection. In the same vein as previous media studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ross and Carter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Layton and Shepard, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Who Makes the News, 2024</xref>), we sought to quantify differences in representation across predicted of gender and name origin beyond the existing demographic differences in the scientific field. Our study focused solely on science journalism, specifically content published by <italic>Nature</italic>. Since <italic>Nature</italic> also publishes primary research articles, we used these data to determine the demographics of the expected set of possible sources. This is not a perfect comparator since journalists will not cover every research article presented in the journal. However, we assume it is a reasonable baseline and that large deviations are worthy of investigation as reflecting potential journalistic biases. For clarity, throughout this manuscript we will refer to journalistic articles as <italic>news</italic> and academic, primary research articles as <italic>papers</italic>. Furthermore, when we refer to ‘authors’ we mean authors of academic papers, not journalists. In our analysis, we identified quoted and cited people by analyzing the content and citations within all news articles from 2005 to 2020, and compared this demographic to the academic publishing demographic by analyzing first and last authorship statistics across all <italic>Nature</italic> papers during the same time period.</p><p>Through our analysis of 22,001 news articles, we were able to identify &gt;88,000 quotes and &gt;15,000 citations with sufficient speaker or author information. We also identified first and last authors of &gt;10,000 <italic>Nature</italic> papers. We then identified possible differences in predicted gender or name origin using the extracted names. The extracted names were used to generate three data types: quoted, mentioned, and cited people. We used computational methods to predict gender and identified a trend toward quotes from people predicted to be men in news articles when compared to both the general population and authors predicted to be men in papers. Within the period that we examined, the proportion of quotes predicted to be attributed to men in news articles went from initially higher to currently lower than the proportion first and last authors predicted to be men in <italic>Nature</italic> papers. Furthermore, we found that the quote difference was dependent on article type; the ‘Career Feature’ column achieved gender parity in quoted speakers.</p><p>We also used computational methods to predict name origins of quoted, mentioned, and cited people. Through our analysis, we found a significant over-representation of names with predicted Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with a predicted East Asian origin in both quotes and mentions. To our knowledge, our work is the first to identify a substantial under-representation of names with a predicted East Asian origin in scientific journalism.</p><p>While we focused on news from <italic>Nature</italic>, our software can be repurposed to analyze other text. We hope that publishers will welcome systems to identify disparities and use them to improve representation in journalism. Furthermore, our approach is limited by the features we were able to extract, which only reflects a portion of the journalistic process. Journalists could additionally track all sources they contact to self-audit. However, auditing is only part of the solution; journalists and source recommenders must also change their source gathering patterns. To help change these patterns, there exist guides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selby, 2016</xref>), databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Women’s Media Center, 2024</xref>), and affinity groups that can help us all expand our vision of who can be considered a field expert.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Creation of an annotated news dataset</title><p>We have analyzed the text of 22,001 news-related articles hosted on ‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/">https://www.nature.com/</ext-link>’ that span 15 years from 2005 to 2020. Our primary focus is on 16,080 articles written by journalists which include the following five article types: ‘Career Feature’, ‘News’, ‘News Feature’, ‘Technology Feature’, and ‘Toolbox’. ‘Career Feature’ generally focuses on the career-related aspects of being a scientist. ‘News’ and ‘News Feature’ focuses on current events related to science as well as new scientific findings. It should be noted that the types of articles contained in ‘News’ changed over time which may induce content shifts in a subset of the articles within our corpus. ‘Technology Feature’ also covers current events and scientific findings, but additionally focuses on how science intersects with technology, such as apps, methodologies, tools, and practices. Lastly, ‘Toolbox’ is similar to ‘Technology Feature’, but is more centered on technology, especially the tools used to perform science. We also include one analysis of the scientist-written news articles, ‘Career Column’ and ‘News and Views’, as an additional set of 5921 articles. ‘Career Column’ is similar to ‘Career Feature’, except it is not written by journalists, but individuals in the scientific field. ‘News and Views’ is similar to a review article, where a field expert writes an article relating to a recently written article within Nature.</p><p>The top 3 observed article frequencies are ‘Research’ (including ‘Letters‘ and ‘Articles’), ‘News’, and ‘News Feature’. Since <italic>Nature</italic> merged ‘Letters’ and ‘Research’ papers in 2019, we combined them in our analysis. We observed substantial variability in the number of <italic>Nature</italic> news articles by type between 2005 and 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The changing classification of article types partially explains temporal changes in the frequency of news articles within each category. Over time, the frequency of ‘News’ articles decreased; however, more specific news-related article types increased, including the introduction of the new categories ‘Career Feature’, ‘Toolbox’, and ‘Career Column.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Data and processing pipeline overview.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>), left, depicts an example news article and the type of data extracted from the text.

Quoted names are any names that were attached to a quote within the article. Mentioned names are any names that were stated within the article.

A summary of frequencies for each data type at each point of processing is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1 table2 table3 table4">Tables 1–4</xref>. We scraped the text using the web-crawling framework Scrapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scrapy developers, 2020</xref>), processed, and ran it through the coreNLP pipeline (Methods). To identify quotes and speakers, we used the coreNLP quote extraction and attribution annotator. We performed multiple name formatting processes (Methods) to identify the speaker’s full name for gender and name origin prediction. All names where we could identify two name parts, assumed to be a first and last names exclusive of titles, were used for gender prediction and checked against the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genderize.io/">genderize.io</ext-link> database. Since names used in the name origin analysis were computationally analyzed and not checked for existence in an existing database, we used additional filters (Methods). All names excluded from the name origin analysis of quotes and mentions are provided on our github in the file ‘data/author_data/all_mentioned_fullname_excluded.tsv’ and ‘data/author_data/all_speaker_fullname_excluded.tsv’. We found that most names were excluded because two name parts, assumed to be a first and last names exclusive of titles, were not found. We scraped the citations using an independent scraper to the text scraper, but still utilizing the Scrapy framework. All identified DOI’s were queried using the <italic>Springer Nature</italic> API to attain all authors’ names, positions, and affiliations.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Breakdown of quotes at major processing steps.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Processing step</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Frequency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Total quotes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">105,457</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Quotes with a full name or pronoun associated</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">96,620</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Quotes with a gender prediction</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">96,390</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Quote with a full name</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">88,535</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Quotes with a name origin prediction</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">100,457</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Breakdown of citations at major processing steps.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Writer of article</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Total citations</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Total Springer Nature citations</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">First author citations with a full name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Last author citations with a full name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">First author citations with a name origin prediciton</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Last author citations with a name origin prediciton</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Journalist</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">15,713</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">5736</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4452</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4464</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4449</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">4447</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Scientist</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">40,707</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">14,597</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">11,276</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">11,170</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">11,276</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">11,152</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Breakdown of all Springer Nature papers at major processing steps.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Processing step</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Frequency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"># Springer Nature articles</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">38,400</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"># First + last authors with a full name in Springer Nature articles</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">55,370</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"># First + last authors with a gender prediction in Springer Nature articles</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">51,686</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"># First + last authors with a name origin prediction in Springer Nature articles</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">55,197</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Breakdown of all Nature papers at major processing steps.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Processing step</th><th align="left" valign="top">Frequency</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top"># Nature articles</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">13,414</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"># First + last authors with a full name in Nature articles</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">21,996</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"># First + last authors with a gender prediction in Nature articles</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">21,173</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"># First + last authors with a name origin prediction in Nature articles</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">21,996</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparator datasets</title><p>Next, we determined if the quoted speakers and cited authors in news articles have a similar demographic makeup as the scientists who publish their primary research in <italic>Nature</italic>. To make this determination, we used all authors’ names, positions, and affiliations of papers published by <italic>Nature</italic> over the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, dark orange box). The author metadata of <italic>Nature</italic> papers from 2005 to 2020 totaled 13,414. To more broadly represent overall science authorship, we also separately analyzed 38,400 <italic>Springer Nature</italic>-published papers from English-language journals over the same time. It should be noted that extracted quotes may come from multiple types of people, such as academic scientists, clinicians, the broader scientific community, politicians, and more. However, through anecdotal observation we believe that most sources come from either academic scientists or those actively involved in science. Similarly, author names were uniformly processed and then used to predict both gender and name origin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Quoted speakers and primary research authors in <italic>Nature</italic> are more often men</title><p>To quantify and compare the gender demographic of quoted people and authors, we analyzed their names. While we could have analyzed the proportion of unique predicted men speakers, we were interested in measuring the overall participation rates by gender and analyzed the proportion of total quotes, e.g. a single speaker may have more than one quote in an article. Furthermore, we assume that a majority of quoted speakers are typically involved in scientific research and therefore primary research authors is a comparable demographic. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows an overview of the process and example input data for this analysis: (1) quotes and quoted speakers (blue box) and (2) first and last authors’ names of papers published by <italic>Nature</italic> (dark orange box). These analyses relied upon accurate gender prediction of both authors and speakers. To predict the gender of the speaker or author, we used the package genderizeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wais, 2016</xref>), an R package wrapper to access the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genderize.io/">genderize.io</ext-link> API (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Demografix ApS, 2024</xref>) to get binary gender predictions for each identified first name. We unfortunately cannot identify non-binary gender expression with the tools we used. Performance of binary prediction was evaluated on a benchmark dataset of 30 randomly selected news articles, 10 from each of the following years: 2005, 2010, and 2015 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Quote frequencies vary by article type. We compared the number of quotes from predicted men to the number of predicted first and last author men published in <italic>Nature</italic>. The total number of authors with a gender prediction was 10,601 first authors and 10,572 last authors across a total of 11,161 publications. As denoted by the red line, we found that the predicted genders of authors and source quotes were far from gender parity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). We found this result consistent for articles written by either a predicted man or woman journalist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a and b</xref>). Additionally, we observed a difference in the predicted genders between first and last authors, with the last authors more frequently predicted to be a man. In our supplemental analyses, we provide an additional comparator, a selection of articles from English-language journals published by <italic>Springer Nature</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The predicted gender gap between first and last authors was larger in our selection of <italic>Springer Nature</italic> papers; however, both first and last authors were predicted to be closer to parity than for <italic>Nature</italic> authors. Overall, predicted men were more frequently quoted than predicted women in <italic>Nature</italic> news articles and first and last authors in <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>Springer Nature</italic> papers over the same time period.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Career feature articles reach gender parity</title><p>The gender proportions of authorship were relatively stable over time for both <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>Springer Nature</italic> papers. In contrast, we found that the rate of quotes predicted to be from men noticeably decreased over time. In 2005, the fraction of quotes predicted to be from men was 87.09% (5291/6075), whereas in 2020 it was 68.86% (2870/4168). We identified that a large decrease occurred in <italic>Nature</italic> between 2017 and 2018. We explored the possible reasons for this decrease. First, we looked at the authorship position of speakers who were quoted about their published paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We identified 6545 quotes with an associated citation (2871 first author and 3674 last author quotes). We found that quotes are slightly biased toward last authors from 2005 to 2020, but because the fraction of last authors predicted to be men remained stable over time both for <italic>Nature</italic> and the selection of <italic>Springer Nature</italic> papers, which likely does not explain the downward trend. We then analyzed the breakdown of gender in quotes by article type. Interestingly, one article type, ‘Career Feature’, achieved gender parity in its quotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). In this article type, we identified a total of 898 quotes (449 predicted women’s and 449 predicted men’s quotes), which only slightly pulled the overall quote gender ratio closer to parity from 2018 onward. In general, we found that each article type independently trended toward gender parity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Predicted Celtic English name origins are over-represented in quoted and mentioned people, while predicted East Asian name origins are under-represented</title><p>To identify possible disparities with respect to name origin, we again used the extracted names of quoted speakers from <italic>Nature</italic> news articles and last authors of published papers in <italic>Nature</italic>. In addition, we also identified the last authors of all papers cited by a <italic>Nature</italic> news article. All processed names were then input into Wiki2019-LSTM and assigned one of 10 possible name origins (Methods). In our analysis, we use name origin to estimate the perceived ethnicity of a primary source by a journalist or fellow scientists who might recommend the individual as a source. Our prediction is not intended to assign ethnicity to an individual, but to be used broadly as a tool to quantify representational differences in a journalist’s sociologically constructed perception of a primary source’s ethnicity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> shows an overview of the process and example input data for this analysis: (1) quotes and quoted speakers (blue box), (2) names of cited first and last authors in news articles (green), and (3) first and last authors’ names of papers published by <italic>Nature</italic> (dark orange box). We divided our analysis into three parts: firstly, quantifying the proportions of predicted name origins of first and last authors cited in <italic>Nature</italic> news articles. Secondly, calculating the proportion of quotes from speakers with a predicted name origin. Thirdly, calculating the proportion of unique names mentioned within an article with a predicted name origin. As a comparator set, we again used the first and last author names in <italic>Nature</italic> papers for all three analyses.

When we compare against first and last authorships in <italic>Nature</italic> across all predicted name origins, we find that for all other name origins except for East Asian and Celtic/English, the quote rates closely match the predicted name origin rate of first and last authors in <italic>Nature</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>, dark gray and light blue lines compare to the purple lines).</p><p>To further understand the source of Celtic/English over-representation and East Asian under-representation, we selected a subset of quotes from people whose works were also cited in the news article. The purpose of this additional comparison of quoted speakers versus quoted <italic>and</italic> cited speakers was to reveal source gathering patterns beyond cited works. We found that the proportion of predicted East Asian name origins was closer to the expected rate after considering only quoted speakers with citations, more closely matching the analysis on citations alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a and b</xref>). This indicates that expert opinions gathered beyond manuscript authors are responsible for a large proportion of the observed name disparities.</p><p>Next, we sought to determine if predicted journalist name origin had any effect on quote disparities. We found that journalists with a predicted East Asian name origin had a higher rate of East Asian quoted speakers (24.3%) in comparison to journalists with Celtic/English (3.8%) or European (8.6%) predicted name origins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8">Table 8</xref>). To examine if this was again driven by source gathering beyond manuscript authors we again subsetted the quotes by adding two constraints: (1) the quotes must be from a cited first or last author in the same news article (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9">Table 9</xref>) and (2) that the cited article must have a US affiliation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table10">Table 10</xref>). We found that differences between journalists with different predicted name origins was nearly eliminated when restricting to quoted and cited speakers, and with the additional restriction of US-affiliated citations, as evidenced in the predicted East Asian column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10">Table 10</xref>. The differences between <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8">Table 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9 table10">Tables 9 and 10</xref> indicate that the predicted name origin of a journalist has some association with sources gathered outside of directly cited works.</p><table-wrap id="table8" position="float"><label>Table 8.</label><caption><title>Quoted speaker name origin, by

we did in the previous citation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d</xref>, green and purple lines). In addition, we find an under-representation of predicted Hispanic, South Asian, and Hebrew name origins when comparing against the predicted name origin rate of first and last authors in our <italic>Springer Nature</italic> set.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>News mention rates are over-represented for predicted Celtic English and under-represented for East Asian name origins</title><p>Since many journalists use additional sources that are not directly quoted, we also analyzed likely paraphrased speakers, e.g. a case in which the person was a source and mentioned in the story but not directly quoted. To do this, we identified all unique names that appeared in an article, which we term <italic>mentions</italic>. We found the same pattern of over-representation for predicted Celtic/English name origins and under-representation for East Asian name origins when comparing against both <italic>Nature</italic> and <italic>Springer Nature</italic> first and last authorships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d, e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3e, f</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7">Table 7</xref>). Similar to the quote analysis, we selected a subset of mentions from people that were also cited in the news article. We again found that the disparity was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4c, d</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Science journalism is the critical conduit between the academic and public spheres and consequently shapes the public’s view of science and scientists. However, as observed in other forms of recognition in science, biases may shift coverage away from the known demographics within science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jan, 2022</xref>). Ideally, scientific journalism is representative of academic papers. Though it would be best for news coverage to promote equitable representation, at a minimum, quotes and citations would ideally match the predicted name origin and gender demographics of scientific academia. To examine this last point, we analyzed 22,001 news articles published in <italic>Nature</italic>, to identify quoted, mentioned, and cited people. We then compared this to the authorship statistics from <italic>Nature</italic>’s papers and a subset of <italic>Springer Nature</italic>’s English-language papers.</p><p>We first looked at possible gender differences in quotes and found a large, but decreasing, gender gap when compared to the general population in all but one article type. Additionally, this result was consistent in articles written by journalists predicted to be women or men. We found that one column, ‘Career Feature’, has an equal number of quotes from both genders, showing that gender parity is possible in science journalism. This finding, coupled with the near equal number of articles written by journalists predicted to be men or women, argues for more diversity in topical coverage. ‘Career Feature’ articles highlight current topics relevant to working scientists and frequently highlight systemic issues with the scientific environment. This column allows space for marginalized people to critique the current state of affairs in science or share their personal stories. This type of content encourages the journalist to seek out a diverse set of primary sources. Including more content that is not primarily focused on recent publications, but all topics surrounding the practice of science, can serve as an additional tool to rapidly achieve gender parity in journalistic recognition. However, we note that not all forms of recognition are the same; researchers may prefer to have their work featured instead of personal stories or critiques of the scientific environment.</p><p>When considering the relative proportion of authors and speakers predicted to be men, we only find a slight over-representation of men. This over-representation is dependent on the authorship position and the year. Before 2010, quotes predicted as from men are over-represented in comparison to both first and last authors, but between 2010 and 2017 quotes predicted from men are only over-represented in comparison for first authors. In 2020, we find a slight over-representation of quotes predicted to be from women relative to first and last authors, but still severely under-represented when considering the general population. The choice of comparison between first and last authors can reveal different aspects of the current state of academia. While this does not hold in all scientific fields, first authors are typically early career scientists and last authors are more senior scientists. It has also been shown that early career scientists tend to be more diverse than senior scientists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bankston et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nikaj et al., 2018</xref>). Since we find that quotes are only slightly more likely to come from a last author, it is reasonable to compare the relative rate of predicted quotes from men to either authorship position. Comparison with last authorships may reveal more how gender bias currently exists whereas comparison with early career scientists may reveal bias in comparison to a future, more possibly diverse academic environment. We hope that increased representation and recognition of women in science, even beyond what is observed in authorship, can increase the proportion of women first and last authors such that it better reflects the general population.</p><p>To further our analysis of possible coverage disparities, we looked at differences in predicted name origins of quoted and cited authors across all the processed news articles. Our use of name origins is a proxy for a journalist’s or referring scholarly peer’s potential perceptions of the ethnicity of a primary source as signaled by an individual’s name. We do not intend to assign an identity to an individual, but to generate a broad metric to measure possible bias for particular ethnicities during journalists’ primary source gathering. Our findings provide additional support for previous studies that identified under-citation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertolero et al., 2020</xref>) and under-recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jan, 2022</xref>) of East Asian people. Interestingly, we found under-citation of people with predicted East Asian name origins to be much less pronounced than under-quotation. We do not believe that the under-quotation is driven by paraphrasing sources, which may occur more frequently with non-native English speakers. We also found that the disparity observed in quotes and mentions was almost eliminated when only considering people who were additionally cited within the same article. This suggests that the source of the disparity may lie in the search for additional expert opinions.</p><p>Either way, the clear disparity of predicted East Asian researcher quotes and mentions argues for including a broader set of voices when seeking opinions beyond the academic papers being covered in the article. One solution could be to have region-specific journalists. While we were not directly able to examine the regions journalists lived in, this potential strategy is supported by our analysis of journalists with a predicted East Asian name origin. When considering quotes from people with a predicted East Asian name origin, we found that journalists who themselves have a predicted East Asian name origin include a higher proportion of these quotes than journalists with European or Celtic/English predicted names. When considering only people who were both quoted and cited, the effect of the predicted name origins of journalists was substantially dampened. We are unable to identify if this is a geographic bias of the reporters in this analysis, since we do not know the location of the journalist at the time of writing the article. As a proxy for measuring possible geographical bias of a journalist, we attempted to identify if there was any geographical bias of cited authors. To do this, we identified the affiliation of each cited author and identified their affiliated country. Unfortunately, we could not robustly extract a large enough number of cited authors from different countries to make any conclusive statements. Expanding our work to other science journalism outlets could help identify possible ways in which geographic region, genders, and perceived ethnicity interact and affect scientific visibility of specific groups. While we are unable to identify that journalists have a specific geographical bias, having reporters explicitly focused on specific regional sources will broaden coverage of international opinions in science.</p><p>In our analysis, we also find that there are more first authors with predicted East Asian name origin than last authors. This is in contrast to predicted Celtic/English and European name origins. Furthermore, we see that the amount of first author people with predicted East Asian name origins is increasing at a much faster rate than quotes are increasing. If this mismatched rate of representation continues, this could lead to an increasingly large erasure of early career scientists with East Asian name origins. As noted before, focusing on increasing engagement with early career scientists can help to reduce the growing disparity of public visibility of scientists with East Asian name origins.</p><p>Through our comprehensive analysis, we were able to quantify how recognized persons in news journalism vary by name origin and gender, then compare it to scientific publishing background rates. While we found a significant gender disparity compared to the general population, the rate of women’s representation in scientific news is increasing and outpacing first and last authorships on scientific papers. Furthermore, we identified a significant reduction of quotes from scientists with a predicted East Asian name origin when compared to paper authorship and a significant but smaller reduction of cited authors with a predicted East Asian name origin in news content.</p><p>Computational tools enabled us to automatically analyze thousands of articles to identify existing disparities by gender and name origin, but these tools are not without limitations. Our tools are unable to identify non-binary people and rely on gender predictors that are known to have region-specific biases, with the largest decrease in performance on names of an Asian origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Santamaría and Mihaljević, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sebo, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, name origin is only a proxy for externally perceived racial or ethnic origins of a source or author and is not as accurate as self-identified race or ethnicity. Self-identification better captures the lived experience of an individual that computational estimates from a name can not capture. This is highlighted in our inability to distinguish between Black and White people from the United States by their names. As the collection of demographic data by publication outlets grows, we believe this will enable a more fine-grained and accurate analysis of disparities in scientific journalism.</p><p>Previous anecdotal studies from journalists have shown that awareness of their bias can help them to reduce it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">LaFrance, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">LaFrance, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yong, 2018</xref>). Once a bias is identified an individual can seek resources to help them find and retain diverse sources, such as utilizing international expert databases like gage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gage, 2024</xref>) and SheSource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Women’s Media Center, 2024</xref>). Additional tips for journalists to achieve and maintain a diverse source pool is described by Christina Selby in the Open Notebook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Selby, 2016</xref>).</p><p>It should also be mentioned that we were only able to analyze the data provided through scraping ‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/">https://www.nature.com/</ext-link>’. This is a major limitation, because the only measures that we have of demographics of sources are people who have their name mentioned or research cited within the article. Journalists do not quote or mention all of the sources that they interviewed or cite all of the papers that they read when researching an article. For example, a person may not be mentioned or quoted in the article because of length limitations, because they do not want to be named, or if they provide information that is not directly quotable but that still shapes the content of the article. A more accurate reflection of journalists’ sources would be a self-maintained record of people they interview. Our work examines disparities with respect to recognition within articles, which can be measured by mentions, quotes, or citations of people.</p><p>Furthermore, the news articles present on ‘<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/">https://www.nature.com/</ext-link>’ are intended for a very specific readership that may not be reflective of more broad scientific news outlets. In a separate analysis, we took a cursory look into a comparison with <italic>The Guardian</italic> and found similar disparities in gender and name origin. However, it is not clear which publications should be used as a comparator for science-related articles in <italic>The Guardian</italic>, and difficult to compare relative rates of representation. While other science news outlets may not have a direct comparator, it would be useful to take a broad comparison across multiple science news outlets to compare against one another. Our existing pipeline could be easily applied to other science news outlets and identify if there exists a consistent pattern of disparity regardless of the intended readership.</p><p>Another major limitation of our study is that we only used articles published by <italic>Nature</italic> or <italic>Springer Nature</italic> as a comparator. Not all papers are interesting to the general public and likely to be covered by journalists. In this work, we assume that the demographics of scientists publishing work that is likely to be covered by journalists matches the demographics of all scientists publishing articles in <italic>Nature</italic>, <italic>Springer Nature</italic>, or other publishers. Our work could be extended to include additional publishers and pre-print servers. To reveal more scientific-field-specific biases, analyses could be performed on individual topics versus our aggregate analysis.</p><p>Furthermore, many journalists are limited by who responds to their requests for an interview or recommendations from prominent scientists. Scientists fielding reporter inquiries can also audit themselves to examine the extent to which there are disparities in the sets of experts they recommend. Journalists and the scientists they interview have a unique opportunity to shape the public and their peers’ perspectives on who is a scientific expert. Their choice of coverage topics and interviewees could help to reduce disparities in the outputs of science-related journalism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data acquisition and processing</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Text scraping</title><p>We scraped all text and metadata from <italic>Nature</italic> using the web-crawling framework Scrapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scrapy developers, 2020</xref>. Scrapy is a tool that applies user-defined rules to follow hyperlinks on webpages and return the information contained on each webpage. We used Scrapy to extract all web pages containing news articles and extract the text. We created four independent scrapy web spiders to process the news text, news citations, journalist names, and paper metadata. News articles were defined as all articles from 2005 to 2020 that were designated as ‘News’, ‘News Feature’, ‘Career Feature’, ‘Technology Feature’, and ‘Toolbox’. Using the spider ‘target_year_crawl.py’, we scraped the title and main text from all news articles. We character normalized the main text by mapping visually identical Unicode codepoints to a single Unicode codepoint and stripping many invalid Unicode characters. Using an additional spider defined in ‘doi_crawl.py’, we scaped all citations within news articles. For simplicity, we only considered citations with a DOI included in either text or a hyperlink in this spider. Other possible forms of citations, e.g. titles, were not included. The DOIs were then queried using the <italic>Springer Nature</italic> API. The spider ‘article_author_crawl.py’ scraped all articles designated ‘Article’ or ‘Letters’ from 2005 to 2020. We only scraped author names, author positions, and associated affiliations from research articles, which we refer to as <italic>papers</italic>. It should be noted that ‘News’ article designations changed over time and partially explain the changing frequency of news articles within each category. The frequency of ‘News’ articles decreased, but more specific news-related article types increased. Additionally, scraping for journalist names was performed months after the initial scraping of the text, and some aspects of the <italic>Nature</italic> website changed. Website changes caused us to lose unique file mappings between the scraped journalist name and other article metadata for 137 articles. Less than 30 articles per year were impacted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>coreNLP</title><p>After the news articles were scraped and processed, the text was processed using the coreNLP pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Manning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Manning et al., 2020</xref>). The main purpose for using coreNLP was to identify named entities related to mentioned and quoted speakers. We used the standard set of annotators: tokenize, ssplit, pos, lemma, ner, parse, coref, and additionally the quote annotator. Each of which, respectively, performs text tokenization, sentence splitting, part of speech recognition, lemmatization, named entity recognition, division of sentences into constituent phrases, co-reference resolution, and identification of quoted entities. We used the ‘statistical’ algorithm to perform co-reference resolution for speed. Each of these aspects is required in order to identify the names of quoted or mentioned speakers and identify any of their associated pronouns. All results were output to json format for further downstream processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title><italic>Springer Nature</italic> API</title><p>Springer Nature was chosen over other publishers and search engines for multiple reasons: (1) ease of use; (2) it is a large publisher, second only to Elsevier; (3) it covers diverse subjects, in contrast to PubMed, which focuses on the biomedical and life sciences literature; (4) its API has a large daily query limit (5000/day); and (5) it provided more author affiliation information than found in Elsevier. We generated a comparative background set for supplemental analysis with the <italic>Springer Nature</italic> API by obtaining author information for papers cited in news articles. We selected a subset of papers to generate the <italic>Springer Nature</italic> background set. These papers were the first 200 English-language ‘Journal’ papers returned by the <italic>Springer Nature</italic> API for each month, resulting in 2400 papers per year from 2005 through 2020. These papers are the first 200 papers published each month by a <italic>Springer Nature</italic> journal, which may not be completely random, but we believe to be a reasonably representative sample. Furthermore, the <italic>Springer Nature</italic> articles are only being used as an additional comparator to the complete set of all <italic>Nature</italic> research papers used in our analyses. To obtain the author information for the cited papers, we queried the <italic>Springer Nature</italic> API using the scraped DOI. For both API query types, the author names, positions, and affiliations for each publication were stored and are available in ‘all_author_country.tsv’ and ‘all_author_fullname.tsv’.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Name formatting</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Name formatting for gender prediction in quotes or mentions</title><p>We first pre-filter articles that have more than 25 quotes, which results in the removal of 2.69% (433/16,080) of the total articles. This was done to ensure no single article is over-represented and to avoid spuriously identified quotes due to unusual article formatting. To identify the gender of a quoted or mentioned person, we first attempt to identify the person’s full name. Even though genderizeR, the computational method used to predict the name’s gender, only uses the first name to make the gender prediction, identifying the full name gives us greater confidence that we correctly identified the first name. To identify the full name, we take the predicted speaker by coreNLP. Unfortunately, this is not always the full name and is only either the first or last name, with the full name occurring somewhere else in the article. In order to get the full name for all names that coreNLP is unable to identify, we match the coreNLP-identified partial name to the longest matching name within the same article. We match names by finding the longest mentioned name in the article with minimal edit (Levenshtein) distance. The name with the smallest edit distance, where character deletions have zero cost, is defined as the matching name. Character deletion was assigned a zero cost because we would like exact substring matches. For example, the calculated cost, including a cost for character deletion, between John and John Steinberg is 10; without character deletion, it is 0. Compared with the distance between John and Jane Doe, with character deletion cost, it is 7; without it is 2. If we are still unable to find a full name, or if coreNLP cannot identify a speaker at all, we also determine whether or not coreNLP linked a gendered pronoun to the quote. If so, we predict that the gender of the speaker is the gender of the pronoun. We ignore all quotes with no name or partial names and no associated pronouns. A summary of processed gender predictions of quotes at each point of processing is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Name formatting for gender prediction of authors</title><p>Because we separate first and last authors, we only considered papers with more than one author. Roughly 7% of all papers were estimated to be single authors and removed from this analysis: 1113/15,013 for cited Springer articles, 2899/42,155 for random Springer articles,and 955/12,459 for Nature research articles. As for quotes, we needed to extract the first name of the authors. We cast names to lowercase and processed them using the R package humaniformat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oliver Keyes, 2016</xref>). humaniformat is a rule-based program that uses character markers to identify if names are reversed (Lastname, Firstname), find middle names and titles. This processing was not required for quote prediction because names written in news articles did not appear to be reversed or abbreviated. Since many last or first authorships may be non-names, we additionally filtered out any identified names if they partially or fully match any of the following terms: ‘consortium’, ‘group’, ‘initiative’, ‘team’, ‘collab’, ‘committee’, ‘center’, ‘program’, ‘author’, or ‘institute’. Furthermore, since many papers only contain first name initials (e.g. ‘N. Davidson’), we remove any names less than four letters (length includes punctuation) and containing a ‘.’ or ‘-’, then strip out all periods from the first name. This ensures that hyphenated names are not changed, e.g. Julia-Louise remains unchanged, but removes hyphenated initials, e.g. J-L. A summary of processed author gender predictions at each point of processing is provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2 table3 table4">Tables 2–4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Name formatting for name origin prediction</title><p>In contrast to the gender prediction, we require the entire name in all steps of name origin prediction. For names identified in the <italic>Nature</italic> news articles, we use the same process as described for the gender prediction; we again try to identify the full name. For author names, we process the names as previously described for the gender prediction of authors. For all names, we only consider them in our analyses if they consist of two distinct parts separated by a space and excluding titles (e.g. Mrs., Prof., Dr., etc.). All names that were filtered out in the analysis of quotes and mentions are provided on our github in the file ‘data/author_data/all_mentioned_fullname_excluded.tsv’ and ‘data/author_data/all_speaker_fullname_excluded.tsv’.

In some cases, coreNLP could not identify an associated speaker’s name but instead assigned a gendered pronoun. In these instances, we used the gender of the pronoun for the analysis. The R package genderizeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wais, 2016</xref>), a wrapper for the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genderize.io/">genderize.io</ext-link> API (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Demografix ApS, 2024</xref>), predicted the gender of authors and speakers. We predicted a name as indicating a man if the first name was predicted by genderizeR to come from a man with at least a probability of 50%. To reduce the number of queries made to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genderize.io/">genderize.io</ext-link>, a previously cached gender prediction from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le et al., 2020</xref> was also used and can be found in the file ‘genderize.tsv’. All first name predictions from this analysis are in the file ‘genderize_update.tsv’. To estimate the gender gap for the quote gender analyses, we used the proportion of total quotes, not quoted speakers. We used the proportion of quotes to measure speaker participation instead of only the diversity of speakers. The specific formulas for a single year are shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2">Equations 1 and 2</xref>.

In addition, we also consider all authors cited in a <italic>Nature</italic> news article. In contrast to the gender prediction, we need to use the full name to predict name origin. We submitted all extracted full names to Wiki-2019LSTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Le et al., 2020</xref>) to predict one of 10 possible name origins: African, Celtic/English, East Asian, European, Greek, Hispanic, Hebrew, Arabic/Turkish/Persian, Nordic, and South Asian. While a full description of Wiki-2019LSTM is outside the scope of this paper, we describe it here breifly. Wiki-2019LSTM is trained on name and nationality pairs, using 3-mers of the characters in a name to predict a nationality. To ensure robust predictions, nationalities were grouped together as described in NamePrism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ye et al., 2017</xref>). NamePrism chose to exclude the United States, Australia, and Canada from their country groupings and were therefore excluded during training of Wiki-2019LSTM. This choice was justified by NamePrism in stating that these countries had a high level of immigration. The treemap of country groupings defined in the NamePrism manuscript is found in figure 5 of the publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ye et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>After running the pre-trained Wiki-2019LSTM model, we used the probability origin for each name instead of a hard assignment to a single class. Hard assignment was not used because it has been shown to reproduce biases due to the underreporting of Black and overprediction of White individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kozlowski et al., 2022</xref>). Similar to the gender analyses, quote proportions were again directly compared against publication rates, except using the probability of assignment instead of the count of hard assignments. For citations, quotes, and mentions, we calculated the proportion for a given year for each name origin. This is shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref> to, for example, calculate the citation rate for last authors with a Greek name origin for a single year.<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Prop.

Below we summarize our responses to each concern in addition to the edits within the manuscript.</p><p>We would also like to add a clarification to the eLife assessment, it states “This important bibliometric analysis shows that authors of scientific papers whose names suggest they are female or East Asian get quoted less often in news stories about their work.” We show that individuals with names predicted to be from women or East Asian name origins are less likely to be quoted or mentioned in Nature’s scientific news stories than expected by publication demographics. In this study, we did not compare the level of coverage of a scientific article by the demographics of the authors of the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p><p>The article is not so clearly structured, which makes it hard to follow. A better framing, contextualization, and conceptualization of their analysis would help the readers to better understand the results. There are some unclear definitions and wrong wording of key concepts.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adapted our wording in the text and added a more detailed discussion which hopefully makes the paper easier to comprehend. These changes are described in the context of your reviewer's suggestions and addressed in the next section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Language use: Male/Female refers to sex, not to gender.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated the language throughout the text. Thank you for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regional disparities are not the same as names' origin. While the first might relate to the academic origin of authors, inferred from their institutional belonging, the latter reflects the authors' inferred identity. Ethnic identities and the construction of prejudice against specific populations need proper contextualization.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added better contextualization in the manuscript and reworded the section in our results and discussion to clarify that we are analyzing disparities related to perceived ethnicity and not regions. We also added the following text to the results section “In our analysis, we use name origin as an estimate for the perceived ethnicity of a primary source by a journalist. Our prediction is not intended to assign ethnicity to an individual, but to be used broadly as a tool to quantify representational differences in a journalist's sociologically constructed perception of a primary source's ethnicity.” We also added the following text to our Discussion: “Our use of name origins is a proxy for a journalist's or referring scholarly peer’s potential perceptions of the ethnicity of a primary source as signaled by an individual's name. We do not intend to assign an identity to an individual, but to generate a broad metric to measure possible bias for particular ethnicities during journalists' primary source gathering.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful to have a clear definition of what are quotes, mentions, and citations. For me, it was not so clear and made understanding the results more difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following text to the results section Extracted Data Used for Analysis: “Quoted names are any names that were attached to a quote within the article. Mentioned names are any names that were stated within the article. Cited names are all author names of a scientific paper that was cited in the news article.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comparison against Nature published research articles is not perfect because journalists will also cover articles not published in Nature. If for example, the gender representation in the quoted articles is not the same between Nature journals and other journals, then this source of inequality would be missing (e.g. if the journalists are biased against women, but not as much when they published in Nature, because they are also biased towards Nature articles). Also, the gender representation among Nature authors could not be the same as in general. Nevertheless, this seems to be a fair benchmark, especially if the authors did not have access to other more comprehensive databases. But a statement of limitations including these potential issues would be good to have.</p></disp-quote><p>To add better context to the generalizability of our work, we added the following text to our discussion: “Furthermore, the news articles present on &quot;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/">https://www.nature.com/</ext-link>&quot; are intended for a very specific readership that may not be reflective of more broad scientific news outlets. In a separate analysis, we took a cursory look into a comparison with The Guardian and found similar disparities in gender and name origin. However, it is not clear which publications should be used as a comparator for science-related articles in The Guardian, and difficult to compare relative rates of representation. While other science news outlets may not have a direct comparator, it would be useful to take a broad comparison across multiple science news outlets to compare against one another. Our existing pipeline could be easily applied to other science news outlets and identify if there exists a consistent pattern of disparity regardless of the intended readership.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;we select the highest probability origin for each name as the resultant assignment&quot;. Threshold based approaches for race/ethnicity name-based inference have been criticized by the literature as they might reproduce biases (see Kozlowski, D., Murray, D. S., Bell, A., Hulsey, W., Larivière, V., Monroe-White, T., &amp; Sugimoto, C. R. (2022). Avoiding bias when inferring race using name-based approaches. Plos one, 17(3), e0264270.). The authors could use the full distribution of probabilities over names instead of selecting one. The formulae proposed (3-5) could be easily adapted to this change.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the author for pointing this out. We have updated our analysis to use the probabilities instead of hard assignments. Figure 3 and formulae 3-5 have been updated. While we observe a slight shift in the calculated values, the overall trends are unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible to make an analysis that intersects both name origin and gender? I am not sure if the sample size would allow for this, but if some other dimensions were collapsed, it would be very important to show what happens at the intersection of these two dimensions of discrimination.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that identifying any differences in quotation patterns at the intersection of gender and name origin would be very useful to identify. To address this, we added supplemental table 5. This table identifies the number of quotes per predicted name origin and gender over all years and article types. In this table, we don’t see a significant difference in gender distribution across predicted name origins.</p><p>Given a larger sample size, we would be able to better identify more subtle differences, but at this sample size, we cannot make more detailed inferences. Additionally, this also addresses a QC-issue, where predicted gender accuracy varies by name origin, specifically East Asian name origin. From our data, we don’t see a large difference in proportions across any name origin. We added the following text to the results section to incorporate this analysis:</p><p>“However, it should be noted that the error rate varies by name origin with the largest decrease in performance on names with an Asian origin [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.156;@doi:10.5195/jmla.2021.1252]. In our analysis, we did not observe a large difference in names predicted to come from a man or woman between predicted East Asian and other name origins (Table 5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of vocabulary should be more homogeneous. For example, in page 13 the authors start to use the concepts of over/under enrichment, which appeared before in a title but was not used.</p></disp-quote><p>The text has been updated to remove all mentions of “over/under enrichment” with “over/under representation”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussions section, it would be important to see as a statement of limitations the problems that automatic origin and gender inference have.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added the following paragraph to our discussion.</p><p>Computational tools enabled us to automatically analyze thousands of articles to identify existing disparities by gender and name origin, but these tools are not without limitations. Our tools are unable to identify non-binary people and rely on gender predictors that are known to have region-specific biases, with the largest decrease in performance on names of an Asian origin[@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.156;@doi:10.5195/jmla.2021.1252]. Furthermore, name origin is only a proxy for externally perceived racial or ethnic origins of a source or author and is not as accurate as self-identified race or ethnicity. Self-identification better captures the lived experience of an individual that computational estimates from a name can not capture. This is highlighted in our inability to distinguish between Black and White people from the US by their names. As the collection of demographic data by publication outlets grows, we believe this will enable a more fine-grained and accurate analysis of disparities in scientific journalism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 2a and 3a show that the affiliations of authors and their countries was going to be used in this analysis. Yet, this section is not present in the article. I would encourage the authors to add this to the analysis as it would show important patterns, and to intersect the dimensions of gender, name origin and country.</p></disp-quote><p>We were interested in using this analysis in our work, but unfortunately the sample size of cited works in each country was too small to make inferences. If this work was extended to larger scientific outlets to include larger corpora such as The Guardian or New York Times, we think one could be able to make more robust inferences. Since our work only focuses on Nature, we decided not to include this analysis. However, we do include a section in our discussion for future work.</p><p>“As a proxy for measuring possible geographical bias of a journalist, we attempted to identify if there was any geographical bias of cited authors. To do this, we identified the affiliation of each cited author and identified their affiliated country. Unfortunately, we could not robustly extract a large enough number of cited authors from different countries to make any conclusive statements. Expanding our work to other science journalism outlets could help identify possible ways in which geographic region, genders, and perceived ethnicity interact and affect scientific visibility of specific groups. While we are unable to identify that journalists have a specific geographical bias, having reporters explicitly focused on specific regional sources will broaden coverage of international opinions in science.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not clear at that point what column dependence means.</p></disp-quote><p>The abstract has been updated to state, “Gender disparity in Nature quotes was dependent on the article type.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their very detailed and insightful suggestions regarding our analysis and the key caveats that needed better contextualization in our analysis. We went through each major point the reviewer brought up below and included any additional text that was needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In some cases, the manuscript lacks consistency in terminology, and uses word choice that is strange (e.g., &quot;enrichment&quot; and &quot;depletion&quot; when discussion representation).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the review for pointing this out, we have removed all instances of depletion/enrichment for over/under-representation</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Caveats to Claim 1. So while Claim 1 holds, it does not hold for all comparator sets and for all years. I don't think this is critical of the paper-the authors do discuss the trend in Claim 2-but interpretation of this claim should take care of these caveats, and readers should consider the important differences in first and last authorship.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their detailed feedback on this section. We have added the missing contextualization of our results. In the results section, I changed the figure caption to: “Speakers predicted to be men are sometimes overrepresented in quotes, but this depends on the year and article type.” Added the following paragraph “When considering the relative proportion of authors and speakers predicted to be men, we only find a slight over-representation of men. This overrepresentation is dependent on the authorship position and the year. Before 2010, quotes predicted as from men are overrepresented in comparison to both first and last authors, but between 2010 and 2017 quotes predicted from men are only overrepresented in comparison for first authors. In 2020, we find a slight over-representation of quotes predicted to be from women relative to first and last authors, but still severely under-represented when considering the general population. The choice of comparison between first and last authors can reveal different aspects of the current state of academia. While this does not hold in all scientific fields, first authors are typically early career scientists and last authors are more senior scientists. It has also been shown that early career scientists tend to be more diverse than senior scientists [@doi:10.7554/eLife.60829; @doi:10.1096/fj.201800639]. Since we find that quotes are only slightly more likely to come from a last author, it is reasonable to compare the relative rate of predicted quotes from men to either authorship position. Comparison with last authorships may reveal more how gender bias currently exists whereas comparison with early career scientists may reveal bias in comparison to a future, more possibly diverse academic environment. We hope that increased representation and recognition of women in science, even beyond what is observed in authorship, can increase the proportion of women first and last authors such that it better reflects the general population.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Generalizability to other contexts of science journalism:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their feedback on the generalizability of our work. We have now added the following text to our discussion to provide the reader with a better context of our results:“To articles presented on &quot;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/">https://www.nature.com/</ext-link>&quot; are intended for a very specific readership that may not be reflective of more broad scientific news outlets.

We have now added several sections to our Discussion. To address gender parity, we have added the following text: “This finding, coupled with the near equal number of articles written by journalists predicted to be men or women, argues for more diversity in topical coverage. &quot;Career Feature&quot; articles highlight current topics relevant to working scientists and frequently highlight systemic issues with the scientific environment. This column allows space for marginalized people to critique the current state of affairs in science or share their personal stories. This type of content encourages the journalist to seek out a diverse set of primary sources. Including more content that is not primarily focused on recent publications, but all topics surrounding the practice of science, can serve as an additional tool to rapidly achieve gender parity in journalistic recognition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Representation in quotations varies by first and last author, most certainly as a result of the academic division of labor in the life sciences. However, what does it say about the scientific quotation that it appears first authors are more often to be quoted? Does this mean that the division of labor is changing such that the first authors are the lead scientists? Or does it imply that senior authors are being skipped over, or giving away their chance to comment on a study to the first author?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for asking bringing up these important questions. We have added better context to our first author analysis in our discussion. We have included the following two sections to address this. Also, we want to state that we find last authors to be slightly more quoted than first authors, as depicted in Fig. 2d., with first author quotation percentage largely appearing below the red line. We included this text in a response above and include it again here for convenience.</p><p>“Before 2010, quotes predicted as from men are overrepresented in comparison to both first and last authors, but between 2010 and 2017 quotes predicted from men are only overrepresented in comparison for first authors.

This is in contrast to predicted Celtic/English and European name origins. Furthermore, we see that the amount of first author people with predicted East Asian name origins is increasing at a much faster rate than quotes are increasing. If this mismatched rate of representation continues, this could lead to an increasingly large erasure of early career scientists with East Asian name origins. As noted before, focusing on increasing engagement with early career scientists can help to reduce the growing disparity of public visibility of scientists with East Asian name origins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What might be the downstream impacts on the public stemming from the under-representation of scientists with East Asian names? According to Figure 3d, not only are East Asian namesunder-represented in quotations, but they are becoming more under-represented over time as they appear as authors in a greater number of Nature publications; Those with European names are proportionately represented in quotations given their share of authors in Nature. Why might this be, especially seeing as Anglo names are heavily over-represented?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have added the following text to our discussion: “In our analysis, we also find that there are more first authors with predicted East Asian name origin than last authors.
