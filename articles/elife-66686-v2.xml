animals must detect and learn salient information. The anterior insular cortex (aIC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are heavily implicated in salience and novelty processing, and specifically, the processing of taste sensory information. Here, we examined the role of aIC-mPFC reciprocal connectivity in novel taste neophobia and memory formation, in mice. Using pERK and neuronal intrinsic properties as markers for neuronal activation, and retrograde AAV (rAAV) constructs for connectivity, we demonstrate a correlation between aIC-mPFC activity and novel taste experience. Furthermore, by expressing inhibitory chemogenetic receptors in these projections, we show that aIC-to-mPFC activity is necessary for both taste neophobia and its attenuation. However, activity within mPFC-to-aIC projections is essential only for the neophobic reaction but not for the learning process. These results provide an insight into the cortical circuitry needed to detect, react to- and learn salient stimuli, a process critically involved in psychiatric disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>novel</kwd><kwd>taste</kwd><kwd>insula</kwd><kwd>mPFC</kwd><kwd>BLA</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>isf 946/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenblum</surname><given-names>Kobi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>isf 258/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenblum</surname><given-names>Kobi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>aIC to mPFC connections are correlative and necessary both for taste novelty behavior and learning while the reciprocal connection from mPFC to aIC is correlative and necessary for novelty behavior.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Determining salient stimuli from the continuously perceived sensory input is a key component for effective learning that has been shaped throughout evolution. The term ‘salient’ is used in psychology and neuroscience to denote a particularly distinct or important stimulus, or an aspect of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yantis and Hillstrom, 1994</xref>). Attributing salience to a given cue or stimulus, can be affected by genetics, previous experiences, current psychological and motivational state, stress response, goals and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Puglisi-Allegra and Ventura, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberg et al., 2006</xref>). Numerous studies have identified cortical and subcortical brain structures that are involved in the detection of salient stimuli, with the insular cortex (IC) being a key node of the salience network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gogolla, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Livneh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uddin, 2015</xref>). In particular, the IC is believed to have a critical role in the bottom-up detection of salient events and attention allocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Menon and Uddin, 2010</xref>). Thus, when a salient stimulus is detected, the insula assists in targeting other brain structures that enable access to attention and working memory resources.</p><p>Salient experiences are comprised of several dimensions, which include novelty amongst others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Modinos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schultz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Winton-Brown et al., 2014</xref>). Experiencing a new taste therefore represents a salient experience of novel sensory information, and the memory for this event is dependent on the functionality of the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yiannakas and Rosenblum, 2017</xref>). Taste recognition, upon which novelty and salience detection inversely depend, relies on a combination of instinctive responses (genetic elements) and brain processes involved in recalling past experiences to help animals cautiously avoid poisonous food, while taking advantage of food that is deemed safe. Therefore, when animals encounter a taste that is completely new to them, they approach it with cautiousness, a phenomenon called taste neophobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). This neophobic response is the first line of defense, and therefore an important and evolutionarily conserved behavior, manifesting in reluctance to consume the novel taste, for fear of potentially adverse outcomes. Following this tentative consumption of the novel taste, and in the absence of any proceeding aversive visceral consequences, a memory for a safe taste is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Osorio-Gómez et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the consumption of this taste gradually increases in the following encounters, a phenomenon called attenuation of neophobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barot and Bernstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Green and Parker, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morón and Gallo, 2007</xref>). This is an example in which a salient, novel stimulus (1) increases attention which affects the preliminary response, and then (2) initiates incidental encoding for a memory of the new experience as to subsequently prime future adaptive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borsook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McGaugh, 2006</xref>). Thus, acting when the sensory information is new, and then learning the new stimulus (familiarization), are both crucial but different components in the process of behavior to a salient, novel stimulus.</p><p>The process by which a novel taste becomes a familiar one is partially subserved by the IC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bermudez-Rattoni, 2014</xref>), and the gustatory cortex, located within the medial portion of the anterior IC (aIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gehrlach et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rolls, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yiannakas and Rosenblum, 2017</xref>). The aIC plays a critical role in the formation and retrieval of novel taste memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kayyal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lavi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yiannakas and Rosenblum, 2017</xref>). Inhibition of protein synthesis or lesions to the IC cause impairment in novel taste learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rosenblum et al., 1993</xref>). Several molecular changes occur in the IC following novel taste learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gal-Ben-Ari and Rosenblum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gould et al., 2020</xref>), including increased phosphorylation-activation of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK). Phosphorylated ERK (pERK) levels are increased in the IC following novel taste consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berman et al., 1998</xref>) and inhibition of MEK, an upstream kinase of ERK in the IC, impairs novel taste learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berman et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Although an accumulating body of work has been directed toward understanding the aIC and the molecular mechanisms by which novel taste memory is formed and retrieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adaikkan and Rosenblum, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merhav et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yefet et al., 2006</xref>), the cellular and circuit mechanisms are yet to be deciphered.</p><p>Additionally to the aIC, the mPFC is another region that plays a prominent component of the novelty network that is engaged following an encounter with a novel taste stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morici et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takehara-Nishiuchi et al., 2020</xref>). Lesions of the mPFC result in impaired learning of novel tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Devito and Eichenbaum, 2011</xref>), including taste learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzalez et al., 2015</xref>). The mPFC is reciprocally connected with the IC, however, whether and how their connectivity contributes to novel taste learning has not been comprehensively examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gabbott et al., 2003</xref>). Hence, we set out to assess the involvement of aIC-mPFC functional connectivity in the neophobic response evoked during novel taste exposure, as well as novel taste learning. To do so, we measured the correlation between the number of activated, pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons within the general aIC and mPFC populations, and specifically within aIC-to-mPFC or mPFC-to-aIC projecting neurons. We found that experiencing a novel taste causes a significant increase in reciprocal aIC-mPFC neuronal activity as measured by pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 1999</xref>). From an electrophysiological perspective, we identify a correlation between taste novelty and increased excitability in aIC-to-mPFC projecting neurons. In order to ascertain behavioral causality of the molecular and electrophysiological correlations we identified, we inhibited the activity of each pathway during the reaction to- or the learning of- a novel taste. We found that chemogenic inhibition of the aIC-to-mPFC pathway resulted both in impaired neophobic response, as well as impaired taste learning and memory. In contrast, inhibition of the opposite, reciprocal, mPFC-to-aIC pathway, caused impairment to the neophobic response only, but not to the learning process.</p><p>Our results show that activation of the aIC-mPFC circuit is correlative and necessary for both the neophobic response to novel tastants, as well as memory formation, with functionally discrete reciprocity. This provides part of a functional map of the broader salience system that is yet to be described, as well as providing a guideline for setting the existing molecular knowledge to reveal the unexplored circuit framework.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animals used were 8-to 12-week-old wild type (WT) adult (C57BL/6) male mice. Mice were kept in the local animal resource unit at the University of Haifa in an environment that is temperature-controlled and under a 12 hr dark/light cycle. Water and chow pellet were available ad libitum. All experiments and procedures conducted were approved by the University of Haifa Animal Care and Use committee under Ethical license 554/18 and were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for ethical treatment of animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Surgery and viral injections</title><p>For all surgeries, naive adult male mice were used as detailed. Mice received i.p. injections of norocarp (0.5 mg/kg), 30 min before surgery and 24 hr later, to minimize pain. Animals were anesthetized by i.p. injection of ketamine and Dormitor (0.5 mg/kg) and then placed in a stereotaxic device (a Model 963 Kopf Instruments stereotaxic injection system). After exposing the scalp, and using bregma and lambda as relevant alignment points, holes were drilled (0.4 nm) in both hemispheres. Mice were injected with AAV construct at the IC (A-P: +0.86; D-V-4; M-L: ±3.4) and/or the mPFC (A-P: 2.34; D-V: −2; M-L:±0.3) or the basolateral amygdala (BLA) (A-P: −1.6; D-V-4.8; M-L: ±3.375), as stated in each experiment. All AAV constructs used in this study were obtained from the viral vector facility of the University of Zurich (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vvf.uzh.ch">http://www.vvf.uzh.ch</ext-link>). All mice used in our studies were injected with 0.25 ul/site/hemisphere of said AAV constructs (physical titer: 4.5 x 10E12 vg/ml) as defined in each experiment. Viral constructs were injected at a rate on 0.1 µl/min, while the syringe was kept in the injection site for 5 min prior and 10 min following delivery, to ensure efficient distribution of the virus. The skin was closed using Vetbond glue, and mice were given 4 weeks of recovery to guarantee viral expression. After recovery, mice were split into individual cages for behavioral experimental purposes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry and quantification</title><p>For perfusion, mice that underwent behavioral experimentation were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane. When the mice were completely anesthetized, they were perfused transcardially using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1M PBS solution (PBS, MFCD00131855, Sigma-Aldrich).</p><p>After perfusion, brains were placed in falcon tubes containing 4% formaldehyde solution overnight at 4°C. On the following day, the solution was replaced with 30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and brains were incubated for another 48 hr. Afterwards, brains were stored at −80°C. Coronal sections (40 mm thickness) were then collected from the IC (Bregma: 1.10 mm to 0.26 mm) or the mPFC (Bregma 1.94 mm to 1.54 mm) utilizing a Leica cryostat CM 1950. Following sectioning, slices were washed using PBS for three times, and then blocked for 1 hr using a 0.3% bovine serum albumin (10775835001, Sigma-Aldrich), 0.3% triton X-100 (MFCD00128254, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% fetal bovine (MFCD00132239, Sigma-Aldrich) solution in PBS. After washing three times with PBS, slices were incubated at 4°C with primary antibodies against rabbit phospho-ERK (1:200 D13.14.4E Cell Signaling) and mouse NeuN (1:500 MAB377 MERCK) in blocking solution. On the next day, the primary antibody solution was removed, and slices were washed three times with PBS.

The IC displays high connectivity with other brain regions, and these reciprocal interactions facilitate integration of sensory information, valence and reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yiannakas and Rosenblum, 2017</xref>). Previously, we identified a correlation between an aversive taste valence and activation of aIC-to-BLA projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lavi et al., 2018</xref>). We also proved that activity of these projections is necessary for the acquisition and retrieval of an aversive taste memory, but not for attenuating a neophobic response to a novel, non-aversive taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kayyal et al., 2019</xref>). Given that mPFC activity is crucial for novel taste memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzalez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Uematsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mickley et al., 2007</xref>) and is correlated with learning novel experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Euston et al., 2012</xref>), we examined the role of aIC-mPFC reciprocal projections in novel taste learning. Toward that end, WT mice were injected with a retrograde virus containing an mCherry construct in the mPFC, labeling neurons in the IC that project to the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). As ERK activation is necessary for taste learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elkobi et al., 2008</xref>), we used pERK, as an indicator of activated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sweatt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adaikkan and Rosenblum, 2012</xref>). We quantified the number of pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons in 24 aIC slices (bregma 1.10 mm- 0.26 mm) of these mice following novel (one exposure, n=3) or familiar (eight exposures, n=5) taste experiences involving the same taste, saccharin (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,h</xref>). Quantification of pERK<sup>+</sup> cells across the aIC demonstrated novel saccharin consumption to be associated with an increased number of activated, pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons compared to familiar saccharin, in agreement with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berman et al., 1998</xref>) (unpaired t-test: p=0.0002, t=3.883, DF=114; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The aIC itself is comprised of three major subregions: the agranular (AIC), dysgranular (DIC), and granular IC (GIC) with the 4<sup>th</sup> cortical layer persisting only in the dorsal portion of the GIC (Figure 7). Within these subregions, experiencing novel saccharin increased the number of pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons in the AIC (p=0.04, t=2.094, DF=67; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and the DIC (unpaired t-test: t=3.749, p=0.0003, DF=94; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), but not the GIC (unpaired t-test: t=1.340, p=0.184, DF=92; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) compared to familiar saccharin. Different cortical layers play different roles in sensory information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dikecligil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</xref>). Hence, we examined the expression of pERK in the outer (1,2,3 combined) and inner (5,6 combined) layers. We found that both in outer (unpaired t-test: p=0.0002, t=3.897, DF=70; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) and inner layers (unpaired t-test; p=0.002, t=3.121, DF=89; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) of the entire aIC, there is a significant increase in pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons following novel saccharin experience, compared to the familiar saccharin group. Extensive reciprocal connectivity exists between the IC (mainly the AIC and DIC) and the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gabbott et al., 2003</xref>), and this may be analogous to the salience network in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uddin, 2015</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that aIC-to-mPFC projections have a vital role in novel taste behavior. We quantified pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons in the AIC and DIC that co-localized with retrograde-virus labeling, originating from the mPFC. We found a significant increases in the percentage of mPFC-projecting aIC neurons that are pERK<sup>+</sup> following consumption of a novel-compared to familiar taste (unpaired t-test: t=3.301, p=0.0015, DF=69; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>).

The detection and proper reaction to a novel stimulus, and the ability to form a stable memory of it, are two distinct facets of novelty behavior. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these centrally important processes, which are critical for animal survival, have been the subject of much research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mishkin and Murray, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schomaker and Meeter, 2015</xref>). As a result, numerous studies have explored the role of distinct brain areas and molecular or cellular processes within them that are crucial for salience and novelty detection and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Peters et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Kesteren et al., 2012</xref>). Although studies conducted in humans show a correlation between several brain structures and novelty detection, little is yet known of the detailed novelty network and directionality in the brain, resulting from causative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore important to understand how functionally relevant, distal brain regions act as a circuit to define salience and encode unfamiliar sensory information within a wider salience system.</p><p>In the present study, we causally demonstrate that reciprocal activity between the aIC and mPFC, or the BLA, conveys novelty related gustatory information, in one such novelty circuit. Specifically, we show that general neuronal activation in the aIC, as denoted by pERK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thiels and Klann, 2001</xref>), is increased following novel taste experience. This is in line with previous studies, showing that ERK phosphorylation in the aIC allows the formation of a memory trace of the safe taste, and is correlated with taste novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sweatt, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gutkind, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelleher et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomas and Huganir, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yiannakas and Rosenblum, 2017</xref>). Importantly, our results indicate pERK is increased specifically in the AIC and the DIC subregions of the aIC, which have previously been implicated in processing chemosensory, somatosensory visceral and limbic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yokota et al., 2011</xref>), emphasizing their relevance in novel taste learning.</p><p>Extensive reciprocal connections exist between the IC and the mPFC, that are thought to be an essential component in salience processing both in humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uddin, 2015</xref>). Here too, our results show a correlation between the number of activated, pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons within reciprocal aIC-mPFC projections following novel taste experience, suggesting plasticity related changes in aIC-mPFC neurons are initiated following taste learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Impey et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Philips et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Purcell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosenblum et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, in the aIC this was particularly apparent in the AIC, while in the mPFC the spread of pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons was more generalized, being detected across the PrL, InfrL and Cg. The projections of the aIC to the mPFC mainly originate from the AIC (compared to the DIC or GIC), which could be a possible explanation for the specific subregion-effect.</p><p>Recent reports indicate the capability of PrL neurons to form ensemble codes for novel stimulus associations within minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takehara-Nishiuchi et al., 2020</xref>). This ability seems to underlie the necessity of the mPFC to rapidly detect and selectively encode novel experiences, although our data suggest a role for all mPFC subregions and layers in novel taste processing and learning. Whether and how mPFC subregions, as well as the emerging local circuitry of the aIC are involved in novel taste learning via cell- and subregion-specific mechanisms, on a molecular and cellular level across different phases of learning, will be the subject of future research.</p><p>We found that ERK activation within aIC-to-PFC projections correlated with taste novelty, and given ERK involvement in maintaining long-term memory-relevant excitability changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen-Matsliah et al., 2007</xref>), we assessed the intrinsic properties of these projections subsequent to novel taste consumption. In line with the pERK results, we found that aIC-to-mPFC neurons display distinct electrophysiological properties following novel taste consumption. This is in agreement with previous studies in other modalities, showing that novel stimuli and learning of associative experience differentially affect intrinsic properties of neurons in cortical and subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaczorowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sehgal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sehgal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Song et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Song et al., 2015</xref>). The increased excitability of aIC-to-mPFC neurons following novel taste experience was observed only in the deep layer of the aIC. Limbic and gustatory information converge in the deep layers of the entire IC, and the main output source of the IC to other cortical and subcortical regions lies within these layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kobayashi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krushel and van Der Kooy, 1988</xref>). In addition, the percentage of taste-coding neurons is higher in the deep layers of the aIC in comparison with the superficial layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dikecligil et al., 2020</xref>). Our results further strengthen the involvement of the deep layers of the aIC in processing and transmitting taste-related information to other cortical regions, suggesting that these specific molecular and intrinsic changes of aIC-to-mPFC neurons of the deep layers of the aIC allow the formation of a familiar and safe taste memory trace.</p><p>Importantly, even though the correlated increase in pERK and in excitability of aIC-mPFC projections following a novel taste demonstrate the involvement of this circuit in novel taste processing, it does not differentiate between the two components of novel taste behavior: novel taste response, or novel taste learning. We thus evaluated if indeed there is a functional aIC-mPFC circuit, by using chemogenetic inhibition to causally examine the reciprocal role of both components, the aIC and the mPFC, in novel taste expression or learning. We found that inhibition of aIC-to-mPFC projecting neurons during novel taste exposure resulted in impaired neophobic responses and novel taste learning. In contrast, inhibiting mPFC-to-aIC projections impaired the expression of neophobia, but not taste memory formation.</p><p>This indicates that the mPFC plays a major role in novelty gating, while the detection of novelty and storage of familiar taste memories are both mediated by the aIC. We show that aIC-to-mPFC projections need to be activated during novel taste exposure in order to form a safe taste memory trace, while aIC activation from the mPFC is necessary in order to evoke appropriate behavioral responses to novelty. We thus causally demonstrate that specific connectivity within the aIC and the mPFC allows the identification, the learning and reaction to novel taste stimuli with the memory being formed in the aIC. However, this does not exclude the involvement of other additional stimuli or other circuits that were not the focus of the current study.</p><p>The entire IC is an integrative hub for saliency processing. We recently demonstrated that the reciprocal connectivity with the BLA underlies aversive valence processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kayyal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lavi et al., 2018</xref>). The BLA is an essential structure for encoding salient stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontanini and Katz, 2009</xref>) and reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fontanini et al., 2009</xref>), and its signals to the aIC transmit palatability related information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Piette et al., 2012</xref>), while facilitating the acquisition and recall of sensory information related to body states, as well as the processing of valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gogolla, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haley and Maffei, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tye, 2018</xref>). Although we have previously shown that activity within aIC-to-BLA projecting neurons is not necessary for novel taste learning, we did not test if it is necessary for the expression of taste neophobia. Here, we show that activity within aIC-to-BLA projecting neurons is essential for the expression of neophobic responses. This goes along with previous data showing that inactivation of the BLA impairs the neophobic response but does not affect the process of attenuation of neophobia, and therefore learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shinohara and Yasoshima, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Together, our findings suggest that aIC connectivity to different brain areas differentially conveys the novelty state (aIC-to-mPFC/BLA), while following learning-induced plasticity, a now modified circuit state underlies the encoding of the familiarized taste (aIC-to-mPFC but not to BLA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A functional reciprocal connectivity exists between the BLA and the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yizhar and Klavir, 2018</xref>), that is of great importance in relation to drinking behavior and water intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>).

Hence, our results do not exclude the possibility of mPFC-BLA activity during novel taste experience and/or learning, but rather suggest a triage of IC, BLA and mPFC participation in novel taste behavior.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for the circuits involved in novel taste expression and learning.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66686-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Detecting, responding and remembering salient information is a vital property of animal behavior. We show here, for the first time, that the interplay between the aIC and the mPFC in the mammalian brain grasps within it novelty related data, as part of a salience network. Both aIC-mPFC and aIC-to-BLA reciprocal connections are necessary for exhibiting a neophobic response; however, the aIC-mPFC is necessary also to form a memory for a familiar safe taste. In addition, the acquisition and retrieval of learned associations between novel taste and aversive visceral information requires the activity of aIC-to-BLA projecting neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kayyal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lavi et al., 2018</xref>). Together, it places the insula as an integrator of two facets of taste saliency; the novel/familiar axis and aversive/appetitive axis. In addition to the necessity of aIC-mPFC interaction in taste novelty behavior and learning, a recent study reported a prominent role of mPFC-to-AIC in learning of novel olfactory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). However, it is yet to be defined if and how the IC-mPFC circuitry encodes saliency for other modalities.</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence showing that impairment in entire IC-mPFC circuitry is found in schizophrenia, addiction, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cisler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Penner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Samara et al., 2018</xref>), raising the importance for further investigation of this circuit and its dysfunction in patients. Defining the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which salience of sensory or innate information is processed and defined remains a key question in basic and clinical neuroscience. Our results suggest that while the mPFC plays a critical role in reacting to a novel cue, the aIC is essential both in reacting and in learning of the novel stimulus. This suggests that proposed non-invasive treatments for schizophrenia or addiction (such as transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy) could benefit from regiments that target the IC and/or other salience network components, while the integrity of these networks could be of particular pathognomonic value in the developing and adult brain.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all current members of the Rosenblum lab for their help and support, to the veterinary team headed by Barak Carmi and Corina Dollingher and technical team headed by Yair Bellehsen.

By combining both correlational (functional neuroanatomy and electrophysiology) and causal techniques (chemogenetics), the authors show that mPFC-projecting neurons in the IC are required for both novel taste expression (neophobia) and taste learning whereas IC-projecting neurons in the mPFC are only involved in the former process. The authors show that consumption of a novel taste increases (1) the number of pERK<sup>+</sup> neurons in mPFC-projecting neurons in IC and IC-projecting neurons in mPFC, and (2) the excitability of mPFC-projecting neurons in IC, which is also shown to be ACh-dependent. Finally, using a dual-virus chemogenetic approach to target projection-defined neurons, the authors show that inhibition of the IC-to-mPFC pathway hinders both the expression of taste neophobia and its attenuation (i.e., learning). By contrast, the mPFC-to-IC pathway attenuates only the expression of neophobia but not its attenuation. Demonstrating a differential involvement of reciprocally connected cortical regions is innovative and is likely to be of interest to a fairly broad audience in the field of learning and memory.</p><p>One of the major strengths of this manuscript is its use of several complementary approaches that, together, inspire a high level of confidence in the results. The authors also include several behavioural and anatomical controls. For instance, the specificity of the IC-to-mPFC in appetitive taste learning is further supported by comparing the involvement of this pathway to the IC-to-BLA pathway, which is shown to be required for taste neophobia but not attenuation of neophobia (i.e., appetitive taste learning).</p><p>Overall, the conclusions are well-supported by the data but there are some weaknesses. Most importantly, the extent to which these results are generalizable to other salient stimuli remains unclear and the visual representation and control of the viral expression (for cre-dependent DREADD virus and retro-AAV) is insufficient.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>1. The authors have not sufficiently addressed whether the involvement of this cortical circuitry in salience and novelty processing is strictly limited to taste. The extent to which the reciprocal interactions between mPFC and IC are also needed to &quot;detect, react to, and learn about&quot; other (non-taste related) sensory stimuli remains unclear. While it is understandable that the authors focus their discussion on interactions between IC and mPFC, there is also no discussion (or mention) of the possible involvement of an mPFC-BLA pathway in novel taste behaviour, particularly in the initial expression of a neophobic response. This seems important given the results with quinine (an innately aversive yet still novel taste) indicate that the involvement of the mPFC-IC reciprocal pathways in novel taste behaviour is not ubiquitous.</p><p>2. There is no demonstration of the cre-dependency of the AAV construct expressing DREADD at this titre. Also, the visual representation/quantification of the virus expression (both injection sites and retrograde labelling) is insufficient. For example, the injection site of the retro-AAV in Figure 1i appears to predominately target PL but the full extent of the injection site is unclear (same comment for Figure 5a, where M2 also appears to have been targeted). In Figure 4, magnified images of mPFC are shown but we are not provided with a ROI on the map image (Figure 4i). It is also impossible to assess the number of IC projecting neurons in the subregions (PL, Cg, IL). The image provided (Figure 4i) does not actually show IL at this anteroposterior level and there appears to be very little labelling in Cg (although it is difficult to see at this magnification).</p><p>3. While an explicit CNO control group is lacking in this paper, any concerns regarding the effect of CNO per se on taste behaviour are somewhat alleviated by the demonstration that CNO injection (inhibition of aIC-mPFC pathway) does not impair taste recognition and retrieval of a familiar taste. Indeed, mice injected with CNO (n=11) but not saline (n=10) show an impaired neophobic response on day 1 (unfamiliar taste) and an increase in the neophobic response on the next (CNO-free) day. When tested on day 7 (when the taste is now familiar), CNO has no effect indicating that recognition and retrieval of a familiar taste is intact. However, on day 7, the group sizes have been reduced to CNO (n=6) and control (n=5). Why are these group sizes different if the same animals were tested? And if these are different mice, why?</p><p>4. ACh release in IC is increased following consumption of an unfamiliar taste. The authors showed that novel taste consumption increased excitability in mPFC-projecting neurons in the IC and this excitability was reduced in scopolamine injected mice. However, the authors did not test the mPFC-to-IC pathway. I imagine that the authors would not expect increased excitability in this pathway if its role is limited to expression of neophobia and not learning. But, unfortunately, without this complementary experiment, it remains unclear. Following the same logic, it is unknown if this reduction in excitability is specific to blocking ACh receptors, even if one might expect that it would be ACh-dependent (and NMDA-independent for example) if the increased excitability truly reflects a learning process.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>While I am in general enthusiastic about this paper, I have several suggestions that I believe might strengthen the manuscript and provide some clarifications regarding the research topic:</p><p>1. The key question is related to the overall interpretation that focuses on salience/novelty detection. I found it difficult to delineate whether the effective circuit manipulations affect the detection of the novel taste or anxiety associated with presentation of this taste, or both. I know that these may not be easy to detangle, but I think that consideration of all of these interpretations is needed to fully understand the behavioral effects during expression of neophobia. This can be addressed to some extent by providing additional behavioral data, for example on latency to approach the new taste, number of approaches or total time spent sniffing the bottle, which would indicate novelty detection (or lack thereof) independently of saccharose consumption. Or with a control group receiving a familiar taste (water) in a novel bottle, etc. The authors may already have performed such control experiments, and if so, I would suggest presenting such data to facilitate interpretation. This issue is especially relevant in view of the findings that impaired &quot;expression of neophobia&quot; can nevertheless result in taste memory formation (mPFC to AIC projection results).</p><p>2. I would also find it useful to show the baseline levels of pErk (naïve mice) and after water deprivation only in the AIC and mPFC because some areas have elevated baseline activity or could be sensitive to the deprivation protocol. It would also be helpful to see the total numbers of AAV+ cells /layer (in addition to the pErk/AAV %). This will help estimate the variability of labeling between different animals and the overall number of mPFC-projecting neurons.</p><p>3. The first figures need to have clear indication of the layers and areas used for quantification.</p><p>4. It would be helpful to demonstrate (and validate) the CNO effects in slices.</p><p>5. I found two aspects of the work underdeveloped: scopolamine and BLA. I would suggest removing the BLA data from this report because all of it is in the supplement and then suddenly shows in the main Figure denoting the circuit. Strengthening the AIC-mPFC circuit model would suffice in my view. The cholinergic aspect would need much more work to integrate because the slice data are very interesting, yet there are no supporting behavioral or circuit data deepening the understanding of the AIC inner layer cholinergic system in the observed effects. If such link is not easy to establish, I would also tend to omit these data and maybe replace them with the retrieval findings. Alternatively, the discussion on cholinergic mechanisms needs to be much stronger and in tighter connection with the demonstrated circuit.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The Rosenblum lab has conducted an important series of experiments to dissect the causal influence of the aIC-to-mPFC connection in distinct aspects of novel taste learning and its adaptive attenuation with subsequent repeated exposure (familiar taste learning). They have used a combination of retrograde labeling to enable visualization of bidirectional monosynaptic connectivity between IC and mPFC, together with pERK labeling to infer in vivo neuronal activation, ex vivo whole cell electrophysiological recordings, and DREADD manipulations to establish the causality of defined connections at distinct cognitive phases during novel taste learning and the subsequent transition to neophobic attenuation with repeated exposure. Overall, the results make an important contribution to our understanding of the cognitive function and plasticity this important neural circuit.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but a few aspects could be further clarified:</p><p>1. AAV8-EF1a and rAAV-hSyn1 promotors for reciprocal aIC-to-mPFC connectivity studies. The EF1a and hSyn1 promoters drive overlapping expression in a broad diversity of neuronal cell types, which leaves open the possibility that distinct classes projection neuron types may be involved. This is particularly relevant for interpretation of the result of the pERK labeling and DREADD inhibition experiments.</p><p>2. An alternative explanation for the results in Figure 2 of the novel vs. familiar electrophysiological comparison is that familiar saccharin exposure might decrease intrinsic excitability. Similarly, an alternative explanation for the scopolamine results in Figure 3 is that mAchR activation is required at baseline for maintaining intrinsic properties of aIC neurons. This is especially relevant because although the F/I curves for novel vs. familiar compared to saline vs. scopolamine are remarkably similar, the underlying physiological mechanism appears divergent, given the relative discordances in RMP, rheobase, input resistance, and AP half-width (Figures 2/3 and S2/S3).</p><p>3. Previous reports have documented the potential confound on behavioral studies with the use of CNO. Therefore, it would be helpful to confirm whether potential actions of CNO on endogenous neurobiology – independent of its function as a ligand for the DREADD receptor – may be influencing results of key experiments in the manuscript. In particular, it is notable that administration of CNO is associated with a consistent decrease in expression of neophobia across multiple experimental conditions (Figures 5, 6 and S5).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66686.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In response to these important points raised by the reviewers, we performed additional experiments.</p><p>In order to address how CNO administration by itself affect classical neophobia or its attenuation, control mice (injected with retro-Cre AAV construct at the mPFC, and AAV8_hEF1a-dlox-mCherry (rev)-dlox-WPRE-hGHp (A), an mCherry construct without DREADD receptor, at the IC.) were prepared, and similar behavioral taste-tests were performed. There was no difference in aversion towards novel tastant (or its attenuation) following CNO administration in control-virus injected mice and the saline injected group (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1a). This result indicates no effect of CNO in taste behavior (in the concentration we used).</p><p>Regarding cell-specificity of infected cells: Indeed, different neuronal populations (excitatory and inhibitory) might have been targeted by our viral vector containing the synapsin promoter. However, from the literature (Baker et al., 2018; Gehrlach et al., 2020; Greig et al., 2013; Molyneaux et al., 2007; Parnavelas, 2000), we know that most cortical projections (&gt;95%) are excitatory neurons. In addition, and in parallel, this is also notable in our electrophysiological measurements by which all neurons patched show a pyramidal-neuron-like properties. Hence, the probability of targeting inhibitory neurons is low to nothing.</p><p>As for the concern regarding potential leakage of transgene expression without Cre: we have used all cre-dependent virus -double inverted floxed (AAV8_hEF1a-dlox-hM4D(Gi)_mCherry(rev)-dlox-WPRE-hGHp(A), aiming for high specificity to cre recombination and less likely to the leakage. The expression of the target gene is specific in cells that express Cre recombinase protein. (Tervo et al., 2016; Zerbi et al., 2019).</p><p>Following the reviewers' comment and in order to further clarify the aIC-mPFC anatomical connectivity, we measured and provided data for total numbers of rAAV<sup>+</sup> cells in the different subregions/layers (Figure 1—figure supplementary 1a-d).

The image provided (Figure 4i) does not actually show IL at this anteroposterior level and there appears to be very little labelling in Cg (although it is difficult to see at this magnification).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important issue. We agree that electrophysiological demonstration and quantification of the effects of CNO in slices expressing inhibitory DREADDs is fundamental to the credibility of the results outlined in the manuscript. We have previously shown a proof of concept for our viral tools in a study published previously (Kayyal et al., 2019) using the rAAV Cre and the cre-dependent DREADDs in IC-to-BLA projecting neurons.</p><p>As recommended by the reviewer, we have included overlays confirming that our injection was confined within the aIC or mPFC (Figure 1 and Figure 3), in inhibitory DREADD as well as in correlative pERK experiments. We believe that the above indeed improves the clarity of the presented images as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While an explicit CNO control group is lacking in this paper, any concerns regarding the effect of CNO per se on taste behaviour are somewhat alleviated by the demonstration that CNO injection (inhibition of aIC-mPFC pathway) does not impair taste recognition and retrieval of a familiar taste. Indeed, mice injected with CNO (n=11) but not saline (n=10) show an impaired neophobic response on day 1 (unfamiliar taste) and an increase in the neophobic response on the next (CNO-free) day. When tested on day 7 (when the taste is now familiar), CNO has no effect indicating that recognition and retrieval of a familiar taste is intact. However, on day 7, the group sizes have been reduced to CNO (n=6) and control (n=5). Why are these group sizes different if the same animals were tested? And if these are different mice, why?</p></disp-quote><p>Though we used a concentration of CNO considered to be specific, we thank the reviewers for this constructive comment and preform an additional experiment to validate it. Hence, we added a control group, in which mice were injected with retro-Cre AAV construct at the mPFC, and AAV8_hEF1a-dlox-mCherry (rev)-dlox-WPRE-hGHp (A), an mCherry construct without DREADD receptor, at the aIC. Animals were injected with CNO prior to novel taste procedure (Figure 4—figure supplementary 1a) to control for CNO effects. We observed no difference between the control-virus injected mice that were treated with CNO and the aIC-to-mPFC inhibitory DREADDs-injected mice. This rules out the possible involvement of CNO itself on the measured taste behavior.</p><p>Regarding the changes in number of mice in the different procedures- The first experiment was done with an n number of (CNO=5, saline=5), without testing the effect on retrieval of familiar taste. In the second batch, we used another set of animals (CNO=6, saline=5), where we wanted to increase the n number of our experiment, keeping in mind we wanted to control this time for taste <italic>recognition</italic>. Since, there is no difference between the groups, we did not repeat this test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. ACh release in IC is increased following consumption of an unfamiliar taste. The authors showed that novel taste consumption increased excitability in mPFC-projecting neurons in the IC and this excitability was reduced in scopolamine injected mice. However, the authors did not test the mPFC-to-IC pathway. I imagine that the authors would not expect increased excitability in this pathway if its role is limited to expression of neophobia and not learning. But, unfortunately, without this complementary experiment, it remains unclear. Following the same logic, it is unknown if this reduction in excitability is specific to blocking ACh receptors, even if one might expect that it would be ACh-dependent (and NMDA-independent for example) if the increased excitability truly reflects a learning process.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Accordingly, we have removed all the scopolamine data from the manuscript. The manuscript is now better focused on the main hypothesis and take-home messages are clearer.</p><p>It would have been interesting to explore the changes occurring in the mPFC following novel taste experience, however, it is not within the scope of our study. The main focus in our paper was to better understand the changes in the aIC and the circuits involving it, in novel taste experience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>While I am in general enthusiastic about this paper, I have several suggestions that I believe might strengthen the manuscript and provide some clarifications regarding the research topic:</p><p>1. The key question is related to the overall interpretation that focuses on salience/novelty detection. I found it difficult to delineate whether the effective circuit manipulations affect the detection of the novel taste or anxiety associated with presentation of this taste, or both. I know that these may not be easy to detangle, but I think that consideration of all of these interpretations is needed to fully understand the behavioral effects during expression of neophobia. This can be addressed to some extent by providing additional behavioral data, for example on latency to approach the new taste, number of approaches or total time spent sniffing the bottle, which would indicate novelty detection (or lack thereof) independently of saccharose consumption. Or with a control group receiving a familiar taste (water) in a novel bottle, etc. The authors may already have performed such control experiments, and if so, I would suggest presenting such data to facilitate interpretation. This issue is especially relevant in view of the findings that impaired &quot;expression of neophobia&quot; can nevertheless result in taste memory formation (mPFC to AIC projection results).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their important feedback and for bringing this issue to our attention.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s comment, we sought to test the effect of the aIC-mPFC inhibition on anxiety levels. We targeted aIC-mPFC pathway, and tested the open-field behavior when the pathway is manipulated similarly to other experiments in the manuscript. The amount of time spent in the center or corners of the chamber provide us a measurement of stress and anxiety levels during inhibition of aIC-mPFC circuitry (new Figure 6—figure supplementary 2a-c). Furthermore, we tested the latency towards the novel tastant during aIC-mPFC inhibition as suggested by the reviewer. Our results show that inhibiting aIC-mPFC circuit does not affect anxiety levels as measured in the open field test nor in latency towards the novel taste tested (new Figure 6—figure supplementary 2a-e).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I would also find it useful to show the baseline levels of pErk (naïve mice) and after water deprivation only in the AIC and mPFC because some areas have elevated baseline activity or could be sensitive to the deprivation protocol. It would also be helpful to see the total numbers of AAV+ cells /layer (in addition to the pErk/AAV %). This will help estimate the variability of labeling between different animals and the overall number of mPFC-projecting neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestions aimed to extend our analysis.</p><p>Indeed, drinking following water restriction affects gene expression such as Arc and cFos in the IC (Inberg et al., 2016). However, in order to control the baseline levels of pERK, both novel and familiar taste groups were water restricted equally during the behavioral paradigm. Also, mice were provided with an equal amount (1 ml) of saccharin in order to prevent variability in volumes consumed in the last day. This ensures the equal effect of dehydration/drinking in both groups and allows comparison of the familiarity-novelty axis only.</p><p>Following the reviewers' comment and in order to further clarify the aIC-mPFC anatomical connectivity, we performed quantification of rAAV<sup>+</sup> neurons in the aIC and the mPFC and provided the data as a supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement1) to better clarify the variability of labeling between the groups. Number of rAAV+ neurons in the aIC and the mPFC was similar both in novel and familiar saccharin groups, indicating no variability in injections/labeling between the groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The first figures need to have clear indication of the layers and areas used for quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanking the reviewers for the comment. We amended the figures to improve clarity as proposed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It would be helpful to demonstrate (and validate) the CNO effects in slices.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point. We agree that electrophysiological demonstration and quantification of the effects of CNO in slices expressing inhibitory DREADDs is fundamental to the credibility of the results. We have previously shown and validated the effect of CNO in slices (Kayyal et al., 2019) in aIC-to-BLA projecting neurons, using <italic>the same</italic> viral vectors (rAAV-Cre at the BLA and Cre-dependent DREADDs in aIC).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I found two aspects of the work underdeveloped: scopolamine and BLA. I would suggest removing the BLA data from this report because all of it is in the supplement and then suddenly shows in the main Figure denoting the circuit. Strengthening the AIC-mPFC circuit model would suffice in my view. The cholinergic aspect would need much more work to integrate because the slice data are very interesting, yet there are no supporting behavioral or circuit data deepening the understanding of the AIC inner layer cholinergic system in the observed effects. If such link is not easy to establish, I would also tend to omit these data and maybe replace them with the retrieval findings. Alternatively, the discussion on cholinergic mechanisms needs to be much stronger and in tighter connection with the demonstrated circuit.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing this idea to our notice. To improve the flow and clarity of the paper, BLA data was incorporated to the main text as suggested by the reviewers. Additionally, scopolamine data was removed from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The Rosenblum lab has conducted an important series of experiments to dissect the causal influence of the aIC-to-mPFC connection in distinct aspects of novel taste learning and its adaptive attenuation with subsequent repeated exposure (familiar taste learning). They have used a combination of retrograde labeling to enable visualization of bidirectional monosynaptic connectivity between IC and mPFC, together with pERK labeling to infer in vivo neuronal activation, ex vivo whole cell electrophysiological recordings, and DREADD manipulations to establish the causality of defined connections at distinct cognitive phases during novel taste learning and the subsequent transition to neophobic attenuation with repeated exposure. Overall, the results make an important contribution to our understanding of the cognitive function and plasticity this important neural circuit.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but a few aspects could be further clarified:</p><p>1. AAV8-EF1a and rAAV-hSyn1 promotors for reciprocal aIC-to-mPFC connectivity studies. The EF1a and hSyn1 promoters drive overlapping expression in a broad diversity of neuronal cell types, which leaves open the possibility that distinct classes projection neuron types may be involved. This is particularly relevant for interpretation of the result of the pERK labeling and DREADD inhibition experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree with this comment, while hSyn1 promoter is directed only to neuronal population, EF1a directs a broader cell population. However, in the causative experiments in which we inhibited either aIC-to-mPFC or mPFC-to-aIC circuit, we used a retro-Cre AAV construct: rAAV-hSyn1-chI-EGFP_2A_iCre-WPRE-SV40p(A). meaning the targeting eventually was similar (hSyn1 promoter) both in the correlative and the causative studies.</p><p>We know from the literature (Baker et al., 2018; Gehrlach et al., 2020; Greig et al., 2013; Molyneaux et al., 2007; Parnavelas, 2000) that cortical and subcortical projecting neurons are mostly excitatory and not inhibitory neurons (&gt;95%). In addition, our electrophysiological studies show that all neurons patched have pyramidal-neuron-like properties. Hence, the probability of us targeting inhibitory neurons is very small.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. An alternative explanation for the results in Figure 2 of the novel vs. familiar electrophysiological comparison is that familiar saccharin exposure might decrease intrinsic excitability. Similarly, an alternative explanation for the scopolamine results in Figure 3 is that mAchR activation is required at baseline for maintaining intrinsic properties of aIC neurons. This is especially relevant because although the F/I curves for novel vs. familiar compared to saline vs. scopolamine are remarkably similar, the underlying physiological mechanism appears divergent, given the relative discordances in RMP, rheobase, input resistance, and AP half-width (Figures 2/3 and S2/S3).</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this important point raised by the reviewer, we have performed an additional experiment to examine the directionality of novel/familiar taste experience upon aIC-to-mPFC projecting neurons by adding a home-caged group of mice (Figure 2; Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Our results show a similar excitability levels between home-caged group and familiar saccharin group that are different from novel saccharin group, meaning the effect is derived from the novelty of the taste (increase excitability in aIC-to-mPFC projections).</p><p>In addition, the scopolamine data was removed as suggested by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Previous reports have documented the potential confound on behavioral studies with the use of CNO. Therefore, it would be helpful to confirm whether potential actions of CNO on endogenous neurobiology – independent of its function as a ligand for the DREADD receptor – may be influencing results of key experiments in the manuscript. In particular, it is notable that administration of CNO is associated with a consistent decrease in expression of neophobia across multiple experimental conditions (Figures 5, 6 and S5).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important concern.</p><p>Doses of CNO used in all experiments were chosen based on recent publications demonstrating that higher chronic doses of the ligand are metabolized into clozapine, which can affect behavior (Gomez et al., 2017).</p><p>To directly address whether CNO administration by itself affect classical neophobia or its attenuation, we performed an additional experiment. Control mice (injected with control virus without DREADDs expression at the IC) were prepared, and similar behavioral taste-tests were performed. Our results indicate that the expression of neophobia is unchanged by CNO administration when using control virus (which does not harbor the receptor). This rule out the possibility that the measured behavior was affected by the CNO itself (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a).</p><p>References:</p><p>Baker, A., Kalmbach, B., Morishima, M., Kim, J., Juavinett, A., Li, N., and Dembrow, N.
