Previous studies showed that increasing adult neurogenesis reduced neuronal damage after these seizures. Because the damage typically is followed by chronic life-long seizures (epilepsy), we asked if increasing adult-born neurons would prevent epilepsy. Adult-born neurons were selectively increased by deleting the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>Bax</italic> from Nestin-expressing progenitors. Tamoxifen was administered at 6 weeks of age to conditionally delete <italic>Bax</italic> in Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><italic>Bax</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Six weeks after tamoxifen administration, severe seizures (status epilepticus; SE) were induced by injection of the convulsant pilocarpine. After mice developed epilepsy, seizure frequency was quantified for 3 weeks. Mice with increased adult-born neurons exhibited fewer chronic seizures. Postictal depression was reduced also. These results were primarily in female mice, possibly because they were more affected by <italic>Bax</italic> deletion than males, consistent with sex differences in <italic>Bax</italic>. The female mice with enhanced adult-born neurons also showed less neuronal loss of hilar mossy cells and hilar somatostatin-expressing neurons than wild-type females or males, which is notable because loss of these two hilar cell types is implicated in epileptogenesis. The results suggest that selective <italic>Bax</italic> deletion to increase adult-born neurons can reduce experimental epilepsy, and the effect shows a striking sex difference. The results are surprising in light of past studies showing that suppressing adult-born neurons can also reduce chronic seizures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>BAX</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>seizure</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS081203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scharfman</surname><given-names>Helen E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004866</institution-id><institution>New York State Office of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LaFrancois</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name><name><surname>Scharfman</surname><given-names>Helen E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS126529</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scharfman</surname><given-names>Helen E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG055328</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scharfman</surname><given-names>Helen E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Increasing adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus reduces neuronal loss and chronic seizures in female mice using a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It has been shown that neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) during the adult life of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Taupin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gage et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Altman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kempermann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kazanis, 2013</xref>).

Upon maturation, newborn neurons migrate to the granule cell layer (GCL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cameron et al., 1993</xref>), develop almost exclusively into GCs, and integrate into the DG circuitry like other GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ramirez-Amaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kempermann et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Prior studies suggest that the immature adult-born GCs can inhibit the other GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ash et al., 2023</xref>) especially when they are up to 6-weeks-old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Drew et al., 2016</xref>). By inhibition of the GC population, young adult-born GCs could support DG functions that require GCs to restrict action potential (AP) discharge, such as pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sahay et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sahay et al., 2011b</xref>).

Thus, strong excitation of GCs can cause excitotoxicity of hilar neurons, area CA1 pyramidal cells, and area CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Scharfman and Schwartzkroin, 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Scharfman and Schwartzkroin, 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Sloviter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Scharfman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Sloviter et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, increasing adult-born neurons protects hilar neurons, and CA3 from neuronal loss 3 days after severe seizures are induced by the convulsant pilocarpine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The seizures induced by kainic acid or pilocarpine are severe, continuous, and last several hours, a condition called <italic>status epilepticus</italic> (SE). The neuronal injury in the hippocampus after SE has been suggested to be important because it is typically followed by chronic seizures (epilepsy) in rodents and humans, and has been suggested to cause the epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Falconer et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Sloviter, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cavalheiro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Herman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mathern et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dudek and Staley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dingledine et al., 2014</xref>). Chronic seizures involve the temporal lobe, so the type of epilepsy is called temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In the current study, we asked if increasing adult -born neurons can protect from chronic seizures in an animal model of TLE. We used a very common method to induce a TLE-like syndrome, which involves an injection of the muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine at a dose that elicits SE. Several weeks later, spontaneous intermittent seizures begin and continue for the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Scorza et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Botterill et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Lévesque et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Whitebirch et al., 2022</xref>). Seizure frequency, duration, and severity were measured by continuous video-EEG with 4 electrodes to monitor the hippocampus and cortex bilaterally.</p><p>It is known that SE increases adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Parent and Kron, 2012</xref>). SE triggers a proliferation of progenitors in the week after SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Parent et al., 1997</xref>). Although many GCs that are born in the days after SE die in subsequent weeks by apoptosis, some survive. Young neurons that arise after SE and migrate into the GCL may suppress seizures by supporting the inhibition of GCs because adult-born GCs in the normal brain inhibit GCs when they are young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Drew et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ash et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, after SE, the newborn GCs in the GCL can exhibit low excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Jakubs et al., 2006</xref>). However, some neurons born after SE mismigrate to ectopic locations such as the hilus (hilar ectopic GCs), where they can contribute to recurrent excitatory circuits that promote seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Scharfman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Parent and Lowenstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Scharfman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Scharfman and Hen, 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Parent and Murphy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Scharfman and McCloskey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Zhan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Myers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Althaus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Since the hilar ectopic GCs are potential contributors to epileptogenesis, we also studied whether enhancing adult-born neurons would alter the number of hilar ectopic GCs.</p><p>Mossy cells are a major subset of glutamatergic hilar neurons which are vulnerable to excitotoxicity after SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Scharfman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Sloviter et al., 2003</xref>). During SE, mossy cells may contribute to the activity that ultimately leads to widespread neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Botterill et al., 2019</xref>). However, surviving mossy cells can be beneficial after SE because they inhibit spontaneous chronic seizures in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bui et al., 2018</xref>). Another large subset of vulnerable hilar neurons co-express GABA and somatostatin (SOM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sloviter, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">de Lanerolle et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Freund et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Sun et al., 2007</xref>) and correspond to so-called HIPP cells (neurons with <bold><italic><underline>hi</underline></italic></bold>lar cell bodies and axons that project to the terminal zone of the <bold><italic><underline>p</underline></italic></bold>erforant <bold><italic><underline>p</underline></italic></bold>ath; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Han et al., 1993</xref>). HIPP cells are important because they normally inhibit GCs and have the potential to prevent seizures. Therefore, we studied mossy cells and SOM cells in the current study.</p><p>The results showed that increasing adult-born neurons protects mossy cells and hilar SOM cells and reduces chronic seizures. Remarkably, the preservation of hilar mossy cells and SOM cells, and the reduction in chronic seizures, was found in females primarily. The sex difference may have been due to a greater ability to increase adult-born neurons in females than males, consistent with sex differences in <italic>Bax</italic>- and caspase-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Forger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Siegel and McCullough, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The results are surprising because prior studies that suppressed neurogenesis reduced chronic seizures. Therefore, taken together with the results presented here, both increasing and suppressing adult-born neurons appear to reduce chronic seizures. How could this be? Past studies suggested that suppressing adult-born neurons led to a reduction in chronic seizures because there were fewer hilar ectopic granule cells. In the current study, increasing adult-born neurons may have reduced chronic seizures for another reason. Regardless, the present data suggest a novel and surprising series of findings which, taken together with past studies, suggest that adult-born neurons can be targeted in multiple ways to reduce chronic seizures in epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increasing adult-born neurons reduced the duration of pilocarpine-induced SE</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>General approach</title><p>The first experiment addressed the effect of increasing adult-born neurons on pilocarpine-induced SE in Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup><italic>Bax<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (called ‘Cre+,’ below).

Therefore, we examined the severity of the first seizure. These analyses were conducted only with mice implanted with electrodes because only with the EEG can one determine if a seizure is non-convulsive. A non-convulsive seizure was defined as an EEG seizure without movement.

The results were the same in dorsal and ventral DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>).

In a different set of mice, pilocarpine was used to induce epileptogenesis. The chronic seizures, measured 4–7 weeks after pilocarpine, were reduced in frequency by about 50% in females. Therefore, increasing young adult-born neurons before the epileptogenic insult can protect against epilepsy. However, we do not know if the protective effect was due to the greater number of new neurons before SE or other effects. Past data would suggest that increased numbers of newborn neurons before SE lead to a reduced SE duration and less neuronal damage in the days after SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>). That would be likely to lessen the epilepsy after SE. However, there may have been additional effects of larger numbers of newborn neurons prior to SE.</p><p>Increasing young adult-born neurons has been shown to protect the hippocampus from SE-induced neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>) which is a major contributor to epileptogenesis. Therefore, by protecting against SE-induced neuronal loss the young adult-born neurons could have reduced the severity of epilepsy. Indeed, we showed that the Cre+ female mice that had reduced chronic seizures had preservation of hilar mossy cells and SOM cells, two populations that are lost in SE-induced epilepsy and considered to contribute to epileptogenesis.</p><p>There were major surprises in the current study. First, the results are unexpected because suppressing adult-born neurons was shown to reduce chronic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cho et al., 2015</xref>). Here, increasing adult-born neurons did not have the opposite effect.</p><p>It was also unanticipated that only females with <italic>Bax</italic> deletion showed a significant increase in young adult-born neurons and a significant reduction in chronic seizures. The larger effect of increasing adult-born neurons in female mice may be attributable to sex differences in Bax (discussed below). The other remarkable finding relates to hilar ectopic GCs. These GCs have been suggested to promote epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Scharfman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Jung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Scharfman et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Parent and Murphy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hester and Danzer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cho et al., 2015</xref>), but hilar ectopic GCs increased in females with reduced seizures. The association of more hilar ectopic GCs with fewer chronic seizures was unexpected.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Effects of <italic>Bax</italic> deletion on SE</title><p>In past studies, suppressing adult-born neurons made kainic acid-induced SE worse, and pilocarpine-induced SE was also worse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, SE was affected also. The duration of SE was reduced in Cre+ mice. In the Cre+ females, however, it was unclear. Nevertheless, the first seizure after pilocarpine injection was often less severe in Cre+ females, and power showed a tendency to be reduced during SE. Therefore, SE might have been less severe in the Cre+ females, and this could have contributed to reduced neuronal loss and chronic seizures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Chronic seizures</title><p>It is remarkable that increasing adult-born neurons for 6 weeks was sufficient to reduce seizures long-term. It is consistent with the idea that normally the young adult-born neurons inhibit other GCs, which supports the DG gate function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hsu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Drew et al., 2016</xref>). This gate has been suggested to be an inhibitory barrier to entry of seizures from cortex into hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Coulter and Carlson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hsu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2015</xref>). That entry is deleterious because seizures that pass from entorhinal cortex to the GCs and then CA3 are likely to continue to CA1 and back to cortex, causing reverberatory (long-lasting, severe) seizures. The reason for the relatively ease of reverberation once past the DG gate is that the synapses between GCs and CA3, CA1, and cortex are excitatory. Also, the GCs have especially powerful excitatory synapses on CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Henze et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Scharfman and MacLusky, 2014</xref>), although these are normally mitigated by GABAergic circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acsády et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>These data are consistent with the demonstration that adult-born neurons protect against other pathological conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Choi and Tanzi, 2019</xref>). However, it is important to note that all effects are unlikely to be mediated only by the DG. The olfactory bulb and other areas also have adult-born neurons and they could contribute to epilepsy, especially those epilepsy syndromes with mechanisms that are extrahippocampal.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Clusters of seizures</title><p>There were fewer days with &gt;3 seizures in Cre+ female mice which is another way that Cre+ females were protected from chronic seizures.

The reason is that the interval between clusters increased in some mice so they only had one cluster in 3 weeks. Thus intercluster interval appeared to lengthen in Cre+ females but animals with only one cluster had to be excluded. In the end, the results were not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sex differences</title><p>Females showed more of an effect of conditional <italic>Bax</italic> deletion than males. Insight into this sex difference came when the same assessments were made before SE because at that time there was no sex difference. Cre+ females had more adult-born neurons than Cre- females and Cre+ males had more than Cre- males. In addition, the levels of DCX were similar in Cre+ females and Cre+ males.</p><p>However, after epilepsy developed, there was a sex difference. Cre- females had less DCX than Cre-males. One explanation is that cell birth during epileptogenesis was greater in males because it is in the developing hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sisk et al., 2016</xref>) and SE has been suggested to rekindle developmental programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ben-Ari and Holmes, 2006</xref>).

A final possibility is that cell death during epileptogenesis is <italic>Bax</italic>-dependent in females but <italic>Bax</italic>-independent in males. Support for this idea comes from studies of ischemic cell death, which is caspase-dependent in females but not males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Siegel and McCullough, 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Hilar ectopic GCs</title><p>In the normal brain, adult-born neurons in the DG are thought to arise mainly from the SGZ and migrate to the GCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Kempermann, 2012</xref>).

When epileptiform activity occurs in CA3 in slices of epileptic rats, CA3 evokes discharges in hilar ectopic GCs that in turn excite GCs in the GCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Scharfman et al., 2000</xref>). Consistent with the idea that hilar ectopic GCs promote seizures, the numbers of hilar ectopic GCs are correlated with chronic seizure frequency in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McCloskey et al., 2006</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hester and Danzer, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, suppressing hilar ectopic GC formation reduces chronic seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Jung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Hosford et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Notably, this is the first study to our knowledge showing that increased hilar ectopic GCs were found in mice that had reduced seizures. One potential explanation is that SE-induced hippocampal damage was reduced in Cre+ females with high numbers of hilar ectopic GCs. Therefore, the circuitry of the DG would be very different compared to past studies of hilar ectopic GCs where a neuronal loss was severe . The presence of mossy cells is one way the circuitry would be different. MCs normally support the young adult-born GCs that migrate to the GCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Piatti and Schinder, 2018</xref>). Mossy cells provide an important activator of newborn GCs when they are young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chancey et al., 2014</xref>). Mossy cells also innervate hilar ectopic GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pierce et al., 2007</xref>). Another possibility is that there was protection against chronic seizures in female Cre+ mice by increasing adult-born neurons <italic>in the GCL</italic>. The reason to suggest this possibility is that prior studies showed that young adult-born neurons in the GCL primarily inhibit GCs in the normal brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Drew et al., 2016</xref>) and are relatively quiescent in the epileptic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Jakubs et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Additional considerations</title><p>This study is limited by the possibilities of type II statistical errors in those instances where we divided groups by genotype and sex, leading to comparisons of 3–5 mice/group.

Here, we show that the opposite - enhancing adult-born neurons before SE and increased hilar ectopic GCs - does not necessarily reduce seizures. We suggest instead that protection of the hilar neurons from SE-induced excitotoxicity was critical to reducing seizures. The reason for the suggestion is that the survival of hilar neurons would lead to the persistence of the normal inhibitory functions of hilar neurons, protecting against seizures. However, this is only a suggestion at the present time because we do not have data to prove it. Additionally, because protection was in females, sex differences are likely to have played an important role. Regardless, the results show that enhancing-born neurons of young adult-born neurons in Nestin-Cre+ mice had a striking effect in the pilocarpine model, reducing chronic seizures in female mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>General information</title><p>Animal care and use was approved in Protocol #AP2016-557 by the Nathan Kline Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and met the regulations of the National Institute of Health and the New York State Department of Health.

Tamoxifen was administered from a stock solution (20 mg/ml in corn oil, containing 10% absolute alcohol; Cat# C8267, Sigma-Aldrich). Tamoxifen is light-sensitive so it was stored at 4 °C in an aluminum foil-wrapped container for the duration of treatment (5 days).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Pilocarpine-induced SE</title><p>Six weeks after the last dose of tamoxifen injection, mice were injected with pilocarpine to induce SE. Methods were similar to those used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>). On the day of pilocarpine injection, there were 2 initial injections of pre-treatments and then one injection of pilocarpine. The first injection of pre-treatments was a solution of ethosuximide (150 mg/kg of 84 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, s.c.; Cat# E;7138, Sigma-Aldrich). Ethosuximide was used because the background strain, C57BL6/J, is susceptible to respiratory arrest during a severe seizure and ethosuximide decreases the susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>). The second injection of pre-treatments was a solution of scopolamine methyl nitrate (1 mg/kg of 0.2 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution, s.c.; Cat# 2250, Sigma-Aldrich) and terbutaline hemisulfate (1 mg/kg of 0.2 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution, s.c.; Cat# T2528, Sigma-Aldrich). Scopolamine is a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist and when injected as methyl nitrate it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, scopolamine decreased peripheral cholinergic side effects of the pilocarpine without interfering with the central actions of pilocarpine. Terbutaline was used to keep airways patent during severe seizures, minimizing mortality. Ethosuximide had to be administered separately because it precipitates when mixed with scopolamine and terbutaline.</p><p>Thirty minutes after the pre-treatments, pilocarpine hydrochloride was injected (260–280 mg/kg of 50 mg/ml in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution, s.c.; Cat# P6503; Sigma-Aldrich). Different doses were used because different batches of pilocarpine had different abilities to elicit SE.</p><p>The severity of SE was decreased by administering the benzodiazepine diazepam (10 mg/kg of 5 mg/ml stock solution, s.c.; NDC# 0409-3213-12, Hospira, Inc) 2 hr after pilocarpine injection. In females, diazepam was injected earlier, 40 min after the onset of the first seizure, because in the first group of females in which diazepam was injected 2 hr after pilocarpine, there was severe brain damage. While sedated with diazepam, animals were injected with warm (31 °C) lactated Ringer’s solution (s.c.; NDC# 07-893-1389, Aspen Veterinary Resources). At the end of the day, mice were injected with ethosuximide using the same dose as before pilocarpine. For the next 3 days, chow was provided that was moistened with water.

Prior to surgery, the analgesic Buprenex (Buprenorphine hydrochloride; NDC# 1296-0757-5; Reckitt Benckheiser) was diluted in sterile saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution) to yield a 0.03 mg/ml stock solution and 0.2 mg/kg was injected s.c.

A midline incision was made to expose the skull with a sterile scalpel. To implant subdural screw electrodes (0.10’ stainless steel screws, Cat# 8209, Pinnacle Technology), six holes were drilled over the exposed skull. The coordinates were: right occipital cortex (anterior-posterior or AP −3.5 mm from Bregma, mediolateral or ML, 2.0 mm from the midline); left frontal cortex (Lt FC, AP −0.5 mm; ML −1.5 mm); left hippocampus (AP −2.5 mm; ML −2.0 mm) and right hippocampus (AP −2.5 mm; ML 2.0 mm).

Seizures were rated as convulsive if an electrographic seizure was accompanied by a behavioral convulsion (observed by video playback), defined as stages 3–5 using the Racine scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Racine, 1972</xref>) where stage 3 is unilateral forelimb clonus, stage 4 is bilateral forelimb clonus with rearing, and stage 5 is bilateral forelimb clonus followed by rearing and falling.

For mice without EEG, SE was defined by stage 3–5 seizures that did not stop with a resumption of normal behavior. Often stage 3–5 seizures heralded the onset of SE and then occurred intermittently for hours. In between convulsive behavior mice had twitching of their body, typically in a prone position.</p><p>SE duration was defined in light of the fact that the EEG did not return to normal after the initial period of intense activity. Instead, intermittent spiking occurred for at least 24 hr, as we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>) and has been described by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mazzuferi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Bumanglag and Sloviter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). We, therefore, chose a definition that captured the initial, intense activity. We defined the end of this time as the point when the amplitude of the EEG deflections were reduced to 50% or less of the peak deflections during the initial hour of SE. Specifically, we selected the time after the onset of SE when the EEG amplitude in at least three channels had dropped to approximately two times the amplitude of the EEG during the first hour of SE, and remained depressed for at least 10 min (Fig S2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>).

First, sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides (1% porcine gelatin in ddH2O; Cat# G1890, Sigma-Aldrich) and dried on a hot plate at 50–55°C for 1 hr. Then slides were placed in a staining rack and immersed in a 100% ethanol solution for 5 min, then in 70% ethanol for 2 min, followed by a 1 min wash in ddH2O.</p><p>Slides were then incubated in 0.06% potassium permanganate (Cat# P-279, Fisher Scientific) solution for 10 min on a shaker (described above) with gentle agitation, followed by washes in ddH2O (2×1 min). Slides were then incubated for 20 min in a 0.0002% solution of FJ in ddH2O with 0.1% acetic acid in the dark. The stock solution of FJ was 0.01% in ddH2O and was stored at 4 °C for up to 3 months. To prepare a working solution, 6 ml of stock solution was added to 294 mL of 0.1% acetic acid (Cat# UN2789, Fisher Scientific) in ddH2O and used within 10 min of preparation. Slides were subsequently protected from direct light. They were washed in ddH2O (3×1 min) and dried overnight at room temperature. On the next day, slides were cleared in Xylene (2×3 min) and coverslipped with DPX mounting medium (Cat# 44581, Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were photographed with an epifluorescence microscope (Model BX51; Olympus of America) and images were captured with a digital camera (Model Infinity3-6URC, Teledyne Lumenera).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Procedures for analysis</title><p>We measured the FJ in the cell layers of CA1 and CA3. Manual counting of FJ-positive (FJ+) cells was not possible in these cell layers because there could be so many FJ+ cells that were overlapping. Instead, FJ staining in cell layers was quantified by first outlining the cell layer as a ROI at 10×magnification in ImageJ as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To outline the CA1 cell layer, the border with CA2 was defined as the point where the cell layer changed width, a sudden change that could be appreciated by the background in FJ-stained sections and confirmed by cresyl violet-stained sections. The border of CA1 and the subiculum was defined as the location where the normally compact CA1 cell layer suddenly dispersed. To outline CA3, the border with CA2 and CA3 was defined by the point where the stratum lucidum of CA3 terminated. This location was distinct in its background in FJ-stained sections. The border of CA3 and the hilus was defined according to zone 4 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Amaral, 1978</xref>. This location was also possible to detect in FJ-stained sections because the background in the hilus was relatively dark compared to area CA3.</p><p>After defining ROIs, a threshold fluorescence level was selected so that all cells that had very bright immunofluorescence were above the threshold but other cells that were similar in fluorescence to background staining were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Iyengar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jain et al., 2019</xref>). ImageJ was then used to calculate the area within the ROI and this measurement is referred to as the area fraction in the Results and expressed as a percent. For a given animal, the area fraction was determined for three coronal sections in the dorsal hippocampus between AP −1.94 and −2.06 mm and 3–4 horizontal sections in the ventral hippocampus between DV 0.84 and 1.08 mm, with sections spaced 300 μm apart. These area fractions were averaged so that a mean area fraction was defined for each animal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data availability and statistical analyses</title><p>Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).

Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Robust regression and the Outlier removal (ROUT) method was used to remove outliers with ROUT coefficient Q set at 1%. Parametric tests were used when data fit a normal distribution, determined by the D’Agostino and Pearson or Shapiro-Wilk’s normality tests, and there was homoscedasticity of variance (confirmed by an F-test). A Student’s unpaired two-tailed t-test was used to assess differences between the two groups. A Welch’s test was used instead of a Student’s t-test when there was heteroscedasity of variance. One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), two-way ANOVA, and three-way ANOVA were performed when there were multiple groups and were followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison post-hoc test. The main factors for two-way ANOVA were genotype and sex; region was added as another factor for three-way ANOVA. Interaction between factors is reported in the Results if it was significant. A Fisher’s exact test was used for comparing the proportions of binary data (yes/no). Pearson’s Correlation was used to assess the association between two variables.</p><p>For data that did not follow a normal distribution, typically some data had a 0 value. In these cases, non-parametric tests were selected. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare two groups, and a Kruskal-Wallis test followed by post-hoc Dunn’s test was used for multiple groups comparison.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The work by Jain et al., demonstrates that increasing adult-born neurons (not increasing adult neurogenesis because BrdU birthdating was not performed in this study) before status epilepticus (SE) leads to a suppression in chronic seizures in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This work is potentially interesting because previous studies showed suppressing adult-born neurons led to reduced chronic seizures.</p><p>To increase adult-born neurons, the authors conditionally delete the pro-apoptotic gene Bax using a tamoxifen inducible Nestin-CreERT2 which has been previously published to increase proliferation and survival of adult-born neurons by Sahay et al. (although this was not shown in this study). After 6 weeks of tamoxifen injection, the authors subject male and female mice to pilocarpine induced SE. In the first study, at 2 hours after pilocarpine, the authors examine latency to the first seizure, severity and total number of acute seizures, and power during SE. In the second study in a separate group of mice, the authors examine chronic seizure number and frequency, seizure duration, postictal depression, and seizure distribution/cluster seizures for 3 weeks after pilocarpine. Overall, the study concludes that increasing adult-born neurons in the normal adult brain can reduce epilepsy in females specifically.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The study is sex matched and reveals differences in response to increasing adult-born neurons in chronic seizures between male and females.</p><p>(2) The EEG recording parameters are stringent, and analysis of chronic seizures is comprehensive. In two separate experiments, the electrodes were implanted to record EEG from cortex as well as hippocampus. The recording is done for 10 hours post pilocarpine to analyze acute seizures, and for 3 weeks continuous video EEG recording was done to analyze chronic seizures.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Increased DCX alone (without birthdating with BrdU) could indicate increased survival of adult-born neurons, not proliferation or birth of newborn neurons per se. While prior work has demonstrated that tamoxifen injection in adult mice showed an increase in dentate gyrus neurogenesis based on studies of BrdU, Ki67, and DCX (Sahay et al., 2011), the dynamics of adult-born neurons (proliferation, differentiation, and/or survival) could be different in epileptic (pilocarpine-treated) animals. Other stages, e.g., proliferation of neural precursors or maturation of adult-born dentate granule cells, was not examined. Analysis of additional stages of adult neurogenesis may reveal additional cellular understanding and add impact of the work on the field.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90893.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>Swati</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Orangeburg</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>LaFrancois</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Orangeburg</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gerencer</surname><given-names>Kasey</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Orono</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Botterill</surname><given-names>Justin J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Saskatchewan</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Saskatoon</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Scharfman</surname><given-names>Meghan Kennedy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">ORANGEBURG</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Scharfman</surname><given-names>Chiara Criscuolo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">ORANGEBURG</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Scharfman</surname><given-names>Helen E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nathan Kline Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Orangeburg</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>As adult-born granule neurons have been shown to play diverse roles, both positive and negative, to modulate hippocampal circuitry and function in epilepsy, understanding the mechanisms by which altered neurogenesis contributes to seizures is important for future therapeutic strategies. The work by Jain et al. demonstrates that increasing adult neurogenesis before status epilepticus (SE) leads to a suppression of chronic seizures in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. This work is potentially interesting because previous studies showed suppressing neurogenesis led to reduced chronic seizures.</p><p>To increase neurogenesis, the authors conditionally delete the pro-apoptotic gene Bax using a tamoxifen-inducible Nestin-CreERT2 which has been previously published to increase proliferation and survival of adult-born neurons by Sahay et al. After 6 weeks of tamoxifen injection, the authors subjected male and female mice to pilocarpine-induced SE. In the first study, at 2 hours after pilocarpine, the authors examine latency to the first seizure, severity and total number of acute seizures, and power during SE. In the second study in a separate group of mice, at 3 weeks after pilocarpine, the authors examine chronic seizure number and frequency, seizure duration, postictal depression, and seizure distribution/cluster seizures. Overall, the study concludes that increasing adult neurogenesis in the normal adult brain can reduce epilepsy in females specifically. However, important BrdU birthdating experiments in both male and female mice need to be included to support the conclusions made by the authors. Furthermore, speculative mechanisms lacking direct evidence reduce enthusiasm for the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two suggestions. First, BrdU birthdating of newborn neurons is important to add to the paper so that there is support for the conclusions. Second, speculative text reduced enthusiasm. In response, we clarified the conclusions. We do not think that the clarified conclusions require BrdU birthdating (discussed further below). We also removed two schematics (and associated text) that we think the reviewer was referring to when speculation was mentioned.</p><p>We also want to point out something minor -that the times of injections listed above are not correct.</p><p>a. Seizures were not measured 2 hrs after pilocarpine; that is when the anticonvulsant diazepam was administered to males.</p><p>b. Seizures were not measured 3 weeks after pilocarpine; the duration of recording was 3 weeks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) BrdU birthdating is required for conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the Reviewer was suggesting birthdating because we were not clear about our conclusions, and we apologize for the confusion. The Reviewer stated that we concluded: “conditionally deleting Bax in Nestin-Cre+ cells leads to increased neurogenesis and hilar ectopic granule cells, thereby reducing chronic seizures.” (Note this is a quote from the review).</p><p>However, we did not intend to conclude that. We intended to conclude that conditionally deleting Bax in Nestin-Cre+ mice reduced chronic seizures in the mouse model of epilepsy that we used. Also, that conclusion only pertained to females. Please note we did not conclude that hilar ectopic granule cells led to reduced seizures. We also concluded that Bax deletion increased neurogenesis in female mice. We have revised the text to make the conclusions clear.</p><p>Abstract, starting on line 67:</p><p>The results suggest that selective Bax deletion to increase adult neurogenesis can reduce experimental epilepsy, and the effect shows a striking sex difference.</p><p>Results, starting on line 448:</p><p>Because Cre+ epileptic females had increased numbers of immature neurons relative to Cre- females at the time of SE, and prior studies show that Cre+ females had less neuronal damage after SE (Jain et al., 2019), female Cre+ mice might have had reduced chronic seizures because of high numbers of immature neurons. However, the data do not prove a causal role.</p><p>Starting on line 477:</p><p>...we hypothesized that female Cre+ mice would have fewer hilar ectopic GCs than female Cre- mice. However, that female Cre+ mice did not have fewer hilar ectopic GCs.</p><p>Discussion, starting on line 563:</p><p>The chronic seizures, measured 4-7 weeks after pilocarpine, were reduced in frequency by about 50% in females. Therefore, increasing young adult-born neurons before the epileptogenic insult can protect against epilepsy. However, we do not know if the protective effect was due to the greater number of new neurons before SE or other effects. Past data would suggest that increased numbers of newborn neurons before SE leads to a reduced SE duration and less neuronal damage in the days after SE. That would be likely to lessen the epilepsy after SE. However, there may have been additional effects of larger numbers of newborn neurons prior to SE.</p><p>Conclusions, starting on line 745:</p><p>In the past, suppressing adult neurogenesis before SE was followed by fewer hilar ectopic GCs and reduced chronic seizures. Here, we show that the opposite - enhancing adult neurogenesis before SE and increased hilar ectopic GCs - do not necessarily reduce seizures. We suggest instead that protection of the hilar neurons from SE-induced excitotoxicity was critical to reducing seizures. The reason for the suggestion is that the survival of hilar neurons would lead to persistence of the normal inhibitory functions of hilar neurons, protecting against seizures. However, this is only a suggestion at the present time because we do not have data to prove it. Additionally, because protection was in females, sex differences are likely to have played an important role. Regardless, the results show that enhancing neurogenesis of young adult-born neurons in Nestin-Cre+ mice had a striking effect in the pilocarpine model, reducing chronic seizures in female mice.</p><p>The Reviewer is correct that it would be interesting to know when the increase in adult neurogenesis occurred that was critical to the effect. For example, was it the initial increase following Bax deletion but before pilocarpine-induced SE, or the increase in neurogenesis following SE, or increased adult neurogenesis in the chronic stage of epilepsy. It also might be that related aspects of neurogenesis played a role such as the degree that maturation was normal in adult-born neurons. We have not pursued the experiments to identify these aspects of neurogenesis because of how much work it would entail. Also, approaches to conclude cause-effect relationships are going to be difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Speculation.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the text and supplemental figures with schematics that we think were the overly speculative parts of the paper the Reviewer mentioned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The study is sex-matched and reveals differences in response to increasing adult neurogenesis in chronic seizures between males and females.</p><p>(2) The EEG recording parameters are stringent, and the analysis of chronic seizures is comprehensive. In two separate experiments, the electrodes were implanted to record EEG from the cortex as well as the hippocampus. The recording was done for 10 hours post pilocarpine to analyze acute seizures, and for 3 weeks continuous video EEG recording was done to analyze chronic seizures.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Cells generated during acute seizures have different properties to cells generated in chronic seizures. In this study, the authors employ two bouts of neurogenesis stimuli (Bax deletion dependent and SE dependent), with two phases of epilepsy (acute and chronic). There are multiple confounding variables to effectively conclude that conditionally deleting Bax in Nestin-Cre+ cells leads to increased neurogenesis and hilar ectopic granule cells, thereby reducing chronic seizures.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, with a clarification of our conclusions we think we have addressed the concern. We believe that we conditionally deleted Bax in Nestin-expressing cells. We believe we found that female mice had reduced loss of hilar mossy cells and somatostatin-expressing neurons after SE, and fewer chronic seizures after SE. While it makes sense that increased neurogenesis caused the reduced seizures, we acknowledge it was not proved.</p><p>We do not make conclusions about the role of hilar ectopic granule cells. However, we note that they appear to have been similar in number across groups, which suggests they played no role in the results. This is very surprising and therefore adds novelty.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Related to this is the degree of neurogenesis between Cre+ and Cre- mice and the nature of the sex differences. It is crucial to know the rate/fold change of increased neurogenesis before pilocarpine treatment and whether it is different between male and female mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that if sex differences in adult neurogenesis could be shown by a sex difference in rate, fold change, maturation, and other characteristics. However, sex differences can also be shown by a change in doublecortin (DCX), which is what we did. We respectfully submit that we do not see an exhaustive study is critical.</p><p>As a result, we have clarified DCX was studied either before SE or in the period of chronic seizures:</p><p>Results, starting on line 406:</p><p>III. Before and after epileptogenesis, Cre+ female mice exhibited more immature neurons than Cre- female mice but that was not true for male mice.</p><p>Starting on line 446:</p><p>Therefore, elevated DCX occurred after chronic seizures had developed in Cre+ mice but the effect was limited to females.</p><p>Discussion, starting on line 592:</p><p>This study showed that conditional deletion of Bax from Nestin-expressing progenitors increased young adult-born neurons in the DG when studied 6 weeks after deletion and using DCX as a marker of immature neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors observe more hilar Prox1 cells in Cre+ mice compared to Cre- mice. The authors should confirm the source of the hilar Prox1+ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question but it is unclear that it is critical to the seizures since both sexes showed more hilar Prox1 cells in Cre+ mice but only the females had fewer seizures than Cre- mice. This is the additional text to describe the results (starting on Line 493):</p><p>In past studies, hilar ectopic GCs have been suggested to promote seizures (Scharfman et al., 2000; Jung et al., 2006; Cho et al., 2015). Therefore, we asked if the numbers of hilar ectopic GCs correlated with the numbers of chronic seizures. When Cre- and Cre+ mice were compared (both sexes pooled), there was a correlation with numbers of chronic seizures (Fig. 6D1) but it suggested that more hilar ectopic GCs improved rather than worsened seizures. However, the correlation was only in Cre- mice, and when sexes were separated there was no correlation (Fig. 6D3).</p><p>When seizure-free interval was examined with sexes pooled, there was a correlation for Cre+ mice (Fig. 6D2) but not Cre- mice. Strangely, the correlations of Cre+ mice with seizure-free interval (Fig. 6D2, D4) suggest ectopic GCs shorten the seizure-free interval and therefore worsen epilepsy, opposite of the correlative data for numbers of chronic seizures. In light of these inconsistent results it seems that hilar ectopic granule cells had no consistent effect on chronic seizures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The biggest weakness is the lack of mechanism. The authors postulate a hypothetical mechanism to reconcile how increasing and decreasing adult-born neurons in GCL and hilus and loss of hilar mossy and SOM cells would lead to opposite effects - more or fewer seizures. The authors suggest the reason could be due to rewiring or no rewiring of hilar ectopic GCs, respectively, but do not provide clear-cut evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>As we mention above, we removed the supplemental figures with schematics because they probably were what seemed overly speculative.</p><p>We acknowledge that mechanism is not proven by our study. However, we would like to mention that in our view, showing preservation of hilar mossy cells and SOM cells, but not PV cells, does add mechanistic data to the paper. We understand more experiments are necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Jain et al explore whether increasing adult neurogenesis is protective against status epilepticus (SE) and the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures (chronic epilepsy) in a mouse pilocarpine model of TLE. The authors increase adult neurogenesis via conditional deletion of Bax, a pro-apoptotic gene, in Nestin-CreERT2Baxfl/fl mice. Cre- littermates are used as controls for comparisons. In addition to characterizing seizure phenotypes, the authors also compare the abundance of hilar ectopic granule cells, mossy cells, hilar SOM interneurons, and the degree of neuronal damage between mice with increased neurogenesis (Cre+) vs Cre- controls. The authors find less severe SE and a reduction in chronic seizures in female mice with pre-insult increased adult-born neurons. Immunolabeling experiments show these females also have preservation of hilar mossy cells and somatostatin interneurons, suggesting the pre-insult increase in adult neurogenesis is protective.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The finding that female mice with increased neurogenesis at the time of pilocarpine exposure have fewer seizures despite having increased hilar ectopic granule cells is very interesting.</p><p>(2) The work builds nicely on the group's prior studies.</p><p>(3) Apparent sex differences are a potentially important finding.</p><p>(4) The immunohistochemistry data are compelling.</p><p>(5) Good controls for EEG electrode implantation effects.</p><p>(6) Nice analysis of most of the SE EEG data.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) In addition to the Cre- littermate controls, a no Tamoxifen treatment group is necessary to control for both insertional effects and leaky expression of the Nestin-CreERT2 transgene.</p></disp-quote><p>About “leaky” expression, we have not found expression to be leaky. We checked by injecting a Cre-dependent virus so that mCherry would be expressed in those cells that had Cre. The results were published as Supplemental Figure 9 in Jain et al. (2019).</p><p>In the revised manuscript we also mention a study that examined three Nestin-CreERT2 mouse lines (Sun et al., 2014). One of the mouse lines was ours. The leaky expression was not in the mouse line we use. We have added these points to the revised manuscript:</p><p>Methods, section II starting on line 791:</p><p>Although Nestin-Cre-ERT2 mouse lines have been criticized because they can have leaky expression, the mouse line used in the present study did not (Sun et al., 2014), which we confirmed (Jain et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors suggest sex differences; however, experimental procedures differed between male and female mice (as the authors note). Female mice received diazepam 40 minutes after the first pilocarpine-induced seizure onset, whereas male mice did not receive diazepam until 2 hours post-onset. The former would likely lessen the effects of SE on the female mice. Therefore, sex differences cannot be accurately assessed by comparing these two groups, and instead, should be compared between mice with matching diazepam time courses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a shorter delay between pilocarpine and diazepam would be likely to lead to less damage. However, the latency from pilocarpine to SE varied, making the time from the onset of SE to diazepam variable. Most of the variability was in females. By timing the diazepam injection differently in males and females, we could make the time from the onset of SE to diazepam similar between females and males. We had added a supplemental figure to show that our approach led to no significant differences between females and males in the latency to SE, time between SE and diazepam injection, and time between pilocarpine and diazepam injection. We also show that Cre+ females and Cre- females were not different in these times, so it could not be related to the neuroprotection of Cre+ females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the authors state that female mice that received diazepam 2 hours post-onset had severe brain damage. This is concerning as it would suggest that SE is more severe in the female than in the male mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret that our language was misleading. We intended to say females had more morbidity and mortality than males (lack of appetite and grooming, death in the days after SE) when we gave DZP 2 hrs after Pilo. We actually don’t know why because there were no differences in severity of SE. We think the females had worse outcome when they had a short latency to SE. These females had a longer period of SE before DZP than males, probably leading to worse outcome. To correct this we gave DZP to females sooner. Then morbidity and mortality was improved in females.</p><p>Interestingly, after we did this we saw females did not always have a short latency to SE. We maintained the same regimen however, to be consistent. As the new supplemental figure (above) shows, there were significant sex differences in the latency to SE, time between SE and DZP, and time between pilocarpine and DZP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Some sample sizes are low, particularly when sex and genotypes are split (n=3-5), which could cause a type II statistical error.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have noted this limitation in the Discussion:</p><p>Additional considerations, starting on line 739:</p><p>This study is limited by the possibilities of type II statistical errors in those instances where we divided groups by genotype and sex, leading to comparisons of 3-5 mice/group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Several figures show a datapoint in the sex and genotype-separated graphs that is missing from the corresponding male and female pooled graphs (Figs. 2C, 2D, 4B).</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful to the Reviewer for pointing out the errors. They are corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In Suppl Figs. 1B &amp; 1C, subsections 1c and 2c, the EEG trace recording is described as the end of SE; however, SE appears to still be ongoing in these traces in the form of periodic discharges in the EEG.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct. It is a misconception that SE actually ends completely. The most intense seizure activity may, but what remains is abnormal activity that can last for days. Other investigators observe the same and have suggested that it argues against the concept of a silent period between SE and chronic epilepsy. We had discussed this in our prior papers and had referenced how we define SE. In the revised manuscript we add the information to the Methods section instead of referencing a prior study:</p><p>Methods, starting on line 899:</p><p>SE duration was defined in light of the fact that the EEG did not return to normal after the initial period of intense activity. Instead, intermittent spiking occurred for at least 24 hrs, as we previously described (Jain et al., 2019) and has been described by others (Mazzuferi et al., 2012; Bumanglag and Sloviter, 2018; Smith et al., 2018). We therefore chose a definition that captured the initial, intense activity. We defined the end of this time as the point when the amplitude of the EEG deflections were reduced to 50% or less of the peak deflections during the initial hour of SE. Specifically, we selected the time after the onset of SE when the EEG amplitude in at least 3 channels had dropped to approximately 2 times the amplitude of the EEG during the first hour of SE, and remained depressed for at least 10 min (Fig. S2 in Jain et al., 2019). Thus, the duration of SE was defined as the time between the onset and this definition of the &quot;end&quot; of SE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In Results section II.D and associated Fig.3, what the authors refer to as &quot;postictal EEG depression&quot; is more appropriately termed &quot;postictal EEG suppression&quot;. Also, postictal EEG suppression has established criteria to define it that should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We find suppression is typical in studies of ECT or humans (Esmaeili et al., 2023; Gascoigne et al., 2023; Hahn et al., 2023; Kavakbasi et al., 2023; Langroudi et al., 2023; Karl et al., 2024; Vilan et al., 2024; Zhao et al., 2024) and animal research uses the term postictal depression(Kanner et al., 2010; Krishnan and Bazhenov, 2011; Riljak et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2012; Carballosa-Gonzalez et al., 2013; Kommajosyula et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2018; Uva and de Curtis, 2020; Medvedeva et al., 2023). Therefore we think depression is a more suitable term.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The example traces in Fig. 3A and B should also be expanded to better show this potential phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded traces in Fig. 3 as suggested.

However, to quantify adult-born neurons, DCX immunoreactivity is used as the sole metric to determine neurogenesis. This is insufficient as changes in DCX-expressing cells could also be an indicator of altered maturation, survival, and/or migration, not proliferation per se. To claim that increasing adult neurogenesis is associated with a reduction of chronic seizures, the authors should perform a pulse/chase (birth dating) experiment with BrdU and co-labeling with DCX.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that increased DCX does reflect increased adult neurogenesis. However, we agree that one does not know if it was due to increased proliferation, survival, etc. We also note that this mouse line has been studied thoroughly to show there was increased neurogenesis with BrdU, Ki67 and DCX. We mention that paper in the revised text:</p><p>Methods, starting on line 786:</p><p>It was shown that after tamoxifen injection in adult mice there is an increase in dentate gyrus neurogenesis based on studies of bromo-deoxyuridine, Ki67, and doublecortin (Sahay et al., 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) As mentioned above, analysis of DCX staining alone months after TAM injections is limited. Instead, the cells could be labelled by BrdU prior to TAM injection, following which quantification of BrdU+/Prox1+ cells at 6 weeks post TAM injection should be performed in Cre+ and Cre- mice (males and females) to yield the rate of neurogenesis increase.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree that birthdating cells is critical. Using DCX staining just before SE, we know the size of the population of cells that are immature at the time of SE. This is what we think is most important because these immature neurons are those that appear to affect SE, as we have already shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) To confirm the source of the hilar Prox1+ cells, a dual BrdU/EdU labeling approach would be beneficial. BrdU injection could be given before TAM injection and EdU injection before pilocarpine to label different cohorts of neural stem cells. Co-staining with Prox1 at different time points will help in identifying the origin of hilar ectopic cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the ideas of the Reviewer.
