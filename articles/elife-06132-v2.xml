tumor regression but it is invariably followed by drug resistance. In characterizing early transcriptional changes following drug treatment of mutant EGFR-addicted cells, we identified the stem cell transcriptional regulator SOX2 as being rapidly and specifically induced, both in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of SOX2 sensitizes cells to erlotinib-mediated apoptosis, ultimately decreasing the emergence of acquired resistance, whereas its ectopic expression reduces drug-induced cell death. We show that erlotinib relieves EGFR-dependent suppression of FOXO6, leading to its induction of SOX2, which in turn represses the pro-apoptotic BH3-only genes <italic>BIM</italic> and <italic>BMF</italic>. Together, these observations point to a physiological feedback mechanism that attenuates oncogene addiction-mediated cell death associated with the withdrawal of growth factor signaling and may therefore contribute to the development of resistance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06132.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06132.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06132.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tumors can form when cells gain mutations in genes that enable them to grow and divide rapidly. In some human lung cancers, genetic mutations are found in a gene that makes a protein called EGFR. This protein encourages cells to divide and the mutations can lead to the cancer cells producing more EGFR, or producing a form of the protein that is more active.</p><p>Treating these cancers with a drug called erlotinib inhibits EGFR and makes the tumors shrink dramatically, but the tumors will usually re-grow because any tumor cells that survive often become resistant to the drug. There are several ways that the tumor cells can become resistant, which makes the task of developing a solution to this problem more difficult. It has been suggested that the tumor cells may enter a temporary ‘drug-tolerant’ state that helps them to survive and makes it more likely that they will develop resistance to the drug. However, it is not clear how this drug-tolerant state might work.</p><p>To address this question, Rothenberg et al. examined which genes are switched on (or ‘expressed’) in tumor cells with a mutant version of EGFR after they were treated with the erlotinib drug. The experiments show that a gene called <italic>SOX2</italic> is expressed in these cells. Cells that had lower levels of <italic>SOX2</italic> expression were more sensitive to the effects of the drug and fewer cells developed resistance. On the other hand, cells that had higher levels of <italic>SOX2</italic> expression were less sensitive to the drug and resistance was more likely to develop.</p><p>A protein called FOXO6—which is usually suppressed by EGFR—activates the <italic>SOX2</italic> gene in these cells. Therefore, using erlotinib to inhibit EGFR to kill the cancer cells increases the activity of FOXO6, which in turn promotes the survival of some of the cells by activating the <italic>SOX2</italic> gene. A better understanding of the ways in which cancer cells adapt to erlotinib and other drugs may help us to design more effective treatments with better outcomes for patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06132.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06132.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>targeted cancer therapy</kwd><kwd>EGFR mutation</kwd><kwd>SOX2</kwd><kwd>resistance</kwd><kwd>lung cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haber</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 CA207186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haber</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08DE020139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothenberg</surname><given-names>S Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SOX2 causes resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in EGFR-mutant lung cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The invariable development of drug resistance presents a critical challenge to the success of targeted cancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jänne et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Hare et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poulikakos and Rosen, 2011</xref>). Several mechanisms leading to such acquired resistance have been identified in patients with <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with small molecule EGFR inhibitors such as erlotinib. Following dramatic initial tumor shrinkage, tumor regrowth is most frequently associated with the emergence of a secondary genetic change, the T790M ‘gatekeeper’ mutation within the EGFR kinase domain, which restores ATP binding in the presence of drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yun et al., 2007</xref>). In other cases, amplification of related receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., <italic>MET</italic>) or mutational activation of downstream kinases (e.g., <italic>BRAF, PIK3CA</italic>) may bypass the effect of EGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engelman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sequist et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ohashi et al., 2012</xref>). Different drug resistance mechanisms may coexist within different metastatic lesions of individual patients. Recently, clinical trials involving rebiopsy of tumor lesions at the earliest sign of drug resistance have also revealed phenotypic conversions that may contribute to drug resistance, including activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the remarkable trans-differentiation of lung cancers from adenocarcinoma to small cell histologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Witta et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sequist et al., 2011</xref>). While some well-defined resistance mechanisms, such as the T790M-EGFR gatekeeper mutation and <italic>MET</italic> amplification, may be addressed using second line targeted drugs, the plasticity of cancer cell adaptation to disrupted oncogenic signaling poses a major challenge to the long-term success of these promising therapies.</p><p>In vitro modeling of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors has raised the possibility that a transient so-called ‘drug-tolerant’ state may precede the development of mutationally defined, heritable drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). By analogy with bacterial models of antibiotic resistance, such an intermediate state may be unstable, but enable treated cells to survive in the presence of drug long enough to acquire mutations that ultimately confer sustained drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>). In PC9 mutant, EGFR-addicted lung cancer cells, EGFR inhibition triggers apoptosis in the vast majority of cells in vitro, uncovering approximately 0.3% that are drug tolerant, quiescent, and expressing the stem cell marker CD133 and the histone H3K4 demethylase KDM5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). These drug tolerant cells readily revert to a drug-sensitive state following removal of the EGFR inhibitor, and their emergence in vitro is suppressed by treatment with an EGFR inhibitor combined with inhibitors of either histone deacetylases (HDACs) or the IGF-1 receptor. While this intermediate resistance mechanism remains to be validated in the clinical setting, it raises the possibility of suppressing pre-conditions that favor the acquisition of drug resistance, in order to circumvent the challenge of treating multiple established drug-resistant pathways.</p><p>Beyond the selection of cancer cell populations with transient drug-resistant phenotypes, recent studies of targeted cancer drugs have defined more rapid signaling feedback loops that modulate the cellular response to growth factor inhibition. For instance, acute loss of ERK signaling triggered by RAF or MEK inhibitors in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant melanoma cells relieves ERK-dependent inhibition of RAS and CRAF, whose activation through ErbB receptor signaling may lead to paradoxical proliferative signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pratilas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paraiso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lito et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>BRAF</italic> mutant colorectal cancers, feedback activation of EGFR-dependent signaling attenuates the consequences of mutant BRAF inhibition, suppressing the apoptotic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corcoran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prahallad et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to signaling feedback loops, transcriptional outputs that generally limit cell proliferation have also been implicated following disruption of EGFR activity, including the expression of transcriptional repressors, regulators of mRNA stability and microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amit et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we screened for early, unique transcriptional changes following erlotinib treatment in mutant EGFR-addicted cells, identifying highly specific induction of SOX2, a master transcriptional regulator required for embryonic stem cell maintenance. SOX2 represses the expression of pro-apoptotic molecules that mediate death following oncogene withdrawal in these cells. The induction of SOX2 results from the activation of FOXO6, a forkhead family transcription factor, following EGFR inhibition. Knockdown or ectopic expression of SOX2 modulates the degree of apoptosis observed following oncogene withdrawal and promotes drug resistance, pointing to a novel homeostatic mechanism that may contribute to cellular adaptation to the withdrawal of growth factor signaling, which underlies most approaches to targeted cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SOX2 is specifically induced in <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutated lung cancer cells following treatment with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib</title><p>To interrogate the transcriptional response to EGFR inhibition, we used HCC827 lung cancer cells, harboring an amplified mutated <italic>EGFR</italic> allele (in-frame deletion of 15 nucleotides in exon 19) and displaying exquisite sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. Cell cultures were treated in triplicate with 1 µM erlotinib for 6 hr, followed by mRNA isolation and whole transcriptome analysis (Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 expression arrays) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibi39">Rothenberg, 2015</xref>)<italic>.</italic> A total of 35 genes showed &gt;fourfold change in expression (FDR &lt;0.05), including 22 downregulated and 13 upregulated transcripts (represented by 48 unique probe sets; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Among induced transcripts, SOX2 was unique in the specificity and rapidity of its induction following EGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, SOX2 was strongly induced in three mutant EGFR-addicted lung cancer cell lines (HCC827, PC9, H3255) following treatment with physiologically relevant concentrations of erlotinib (0.1 µM), but not when these cells were treated with comparably effective doses of cytotoxic chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). SOX2 was also not induced in other oncogene-dependent models, such as <italic>ALK</italic>-translocated lung cancer cells treated with crizotinib, <italic>HER2</italic>-amplified breast cancer cells exposed to lapatinib or <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant melanoma cells treated with AZD6244 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Consistent with its dependence on suppression of mutant EGFR signaling in the context of EGFR ‘addiction’, SOX2 was not induced following erlotinib treatment of H1975 cells, which harbor both an EGFR activating mutation and the T790M gatekeeper mutation that confers resistant to erlotinib; or in H1650 cells with mutated EGFR that are relatively resistant to the effects of EGFR inhibition in part through genetic loss of <italic>PTEN</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sos et al., 2009</xref>). However, treatment of H1975 cells with the L858R/T790M mutation-selective inhibitor WZ4002 resulted in SOX2 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, right) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). In cells that show erlotinib-mediated induction of SOX2, siRNA-mediated knockdown of EGFR also led to strong induction of SOX2 (in the absence of erlotinib), confirming the specificity of the drug effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Simultaneous treatment of cells with actinomycin D and erlotinib suppressed the induction of SOX2, consistent with a primary effect of EGFR inhibition in increasing SOX2 transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06132.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SOX2 transcript is specifically induced by erlotinib in EGFR-mutant and addicted lung cancer cell lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell lines were treated with an inhibitor of the driving oncogenic lesion for 24 hr (erlotinib for <italic>EGFR</italic>-mutant, lapatinib for <italic>HER2</italic>-amplified and crizotinib for <italic>ALK</italic>-translocated cells), followed by isolation of total RNA and quantitative PCR for SOX2 transcript.

The best studied isoform, FOXO1, is highly expressed in ES cells and has been implicated in the maintenance of pluripotency through activation of SOX2 transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). All FOXO proteins bind to similar DNA sequences, with isoform-specific activity presumably conferred by cellular and promoter context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furuyama et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, all four FOXO isoforms are expressed in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells, transcriptionally induced following EGFR inhibition and phosphorylated at homologous Serine residues, yet only FOXO6 regulates SOX2 in these cells. Given variability in knockdown efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, column 6), we cannot exclude some contribution from the other FOXO family members on SOX2 expression, but FOXO6 has the dominant effect in the cells tested. Activation of FOXO6 may occur through both AKT dependent and independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobs et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van der Heide et al., 2005</xref>), and indeed we observed that treatment with PI3K inhibitors alone is insufficient for induction of SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

In contrast to the latter, BMF binds with significant affinity to a subset of BCL-2 family members (BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuwana et al., 2005</xref>), yet it clearly contributes to the apoptotic response to erlotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The direct binding by SOX2 of the <italic>BIM</italic> and <italic>BMF</italic> genes is consistent with the ability of the four reprogramming factors (SOX2, OCT-4, KLF-4, and c-MYC) to bind to the promoters of several anti-apoptotic genes (including BMF) which are induced early during the reprogramming process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soufi et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, control of SOX2 expression and its modulation of apoptosis may differ in EGFR-mutant lung cancer, compared with other forms of NSCLC. In a recent study of lung cancers with wild-type EGFR, the activation of EGFR upregulated SOX2, thereby decreasing apoptosis through BCL2L1, a phenomenon that was notably absent in EGFR-mutant lung cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2013</xref>). A similar pathway was reported in a prostate cancer cell line, also with wild-type EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rybak and Tang, 2013</xref>). Thus, an EGFR-SOX2-BCL2L1 pathway may be implicated in cancer cells with wild-type EGFR, whereas the EGFR-FOXO6-SOX2-BIM/BMF pathway we describe is specific for cells that are dependent on mutant EGFR signals for their survival.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Heterogeneity of SOX2 induction and implications for targeted therapy</title><p>The heterogeneous induction of SOX2 within a clonally derived cell population could reflect the existence of an intrinsic subpopulation with heritable traits, as recently proposed in medulloblastoma and skin carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boumahdi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vanner et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, it could result from stochastic variation between cells in the activity of cellular signaling pathways. We favor the latter model, given the absent coexpression of SOX2 with putative stem cell markers, the failure to enrich for SOX2 positive cells following repeated erlotinib treatments, and the regeneration of heterogeneous SOX2 inducibility following single cell cloning experiments. A stochastic cell killing model for TRAIL-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells was recently described, in which naturally occurring cell-to-cell variation in the levels or activity of upstream signaling proteins leads to differential induction of mitochondrial membrane permeability and apoptosis only in some cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spencer et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Critically, the ability of siRNA targeting SOX2 to substantially decrease the number and rate at which resistant subclones of EGFR-mutant cells emerge following continuous erlotinib treatment suggests that, despite its heterogeneous, transient, and stochastic expression, SOX2 contributes to the emergence of stably acquired resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In these respects, our observations are reminiscent of transient drug-tolerant persister cells (DTPs), also observed following erlotinib treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>). However, there are also significant differences between the mechanisms underlying DTPs and those observed here. DTPs emerge following longer erlotinib exposure at much higher concentrations, and they constitute a lower percentage of cells within the population. Their expression of the stem cell marker CD133 and the chromatin remodeling protein KDM5A was not reproduced by SOX2+ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—figure supplements 2, 6</xref>). Furthermore, DTPs are detectable in many cancer cell lines following treatment with multiple cytotoxic and targeted agents, whereas induction of SOX2 appears to be strictly limited to targeted EGFR inhibition in cells addicted to mutant EGFR signaling. SOX2 induction may thus be a specific and early signaling response to EGFR withdrawal, which contributes to increased cell survival, thus enhancing the likelihood of epigenetic events leading to DTPs and ultimately to stable genetic mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. Our results with HCC2935 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) further suggest that in a subset of cases, high basal SOX2 may even blunt the initial signaling response to EGFR inhibitors.</p><p>In summary, the rewiring of cellular signaling pathways driven by a dominant mutationally activated kinase underlies oncogene addiction in cancer, providing powerful opportunities for targeted therapy. At the same time, feedback pathways that attenuate these signaling readouts may play a major role in enhancing the development of drug resistance. The EGFR-FOXO6-SOX2 signaling pathway regulating expression of the BIM and BMF apoptotic factors thus identifies a feedback loop that may attenuate the effectiveness of anti-EGFR therapy in cancer and contribute toward the ultimate development of drug resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

SOX2 staining was visualized with appropriate Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Ki-67 costaining was performed with antibody to Ki-67 conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Epitomics). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of SOX2 on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tumor tissue was performed according to the antibody manufacturer's suggested protocol by the Specialized Histopathology Laboratory of the Massachusetts General Hospital using the SignalStain Boost IHC detection reagent (Cell Signaling Technology). All IF/IHC samples were imaged and quantitated using the Vectra Automated Multispectral Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA). Images were initially scanned at 4× magnification and then multiple high-powered fields were automatically acquired. The emission spectra of each fluorophore/IHC stain was computationally unmixed by preparing matched single stained samples. Unmixed images were segmented to identify individual cell nuclei based on DAPI or hematoxylin signal, and the mean nuclear signal for each fluorophore/IHC stain was calculated using inForm Advanced Image Analysis Software (PerkinElmer). For some samples, in addition to analyzing the mean signal for each stain on every cell analyzed, individual nuclei were scored as positive or negative for SOX2 using the scoring function in inForm to set a fixed threshold for SOX2 signal based on the presence or absence of any degree of SOX2 staining. For fluorescence images, when samples to be compared were acquired using different exposure times, data were normalized to exposure time using the normalized counts setting/function in inForm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Toxicity assays</title><p>Cells were plated in multiple replicate wells at 2500 cells per well in 96-well format, treated 24 hr after plating and analyzed 72 hr later.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Charles Sawyers (Senior editor) and 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers.</p><p>The comments of the reviewers are listed below. A critical issue noted by the reviewers was that your study fails to make a direct connection between SOX2 and drug resistance. As a result, we are returning your manuscript. The current manuscript will not be considered further for publication. However, if new data are obtained that directly address this criticism we would be pleased to consider a new manuscript for publication. Please note that a new submission would be subject to full editorial review.</p><p>Targeted cancer therapies can lead to the development of drug resistance. The mechanisms that cause drug resistance need to be understood if we are to improve the efficacy of cancer treatment. This study, which seeks to understand resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy, is therefore significant. The authors explored gene expression changes induced by erlotinib that might contribute to the development of resistance. The authors report that a FOXO6 - Sox2 pathway represses expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins BIM and BMF to in a sub-set of cells confer survival. The authors propose that this survival pathway provides the tumor cells with the opportunity to accumulate mutations that drive drug resistance. This conclusion, which is not tested, is interesting and potentially important for the design of cancer therapies.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) The authors do not establish whether their observations regarding SOX2 are relevant to any important clinical observation or outcomes. The paper is introduced with a discussion of resistance, but the reported study does not address resistance. Does modulation of SOX2 have effects on drug resistance?</p><p>2) To further relate the findings to drug resistance, the authors should determine what occurs following a repeat challenge with erlotinib. The authors show that SOX2 induction is transient. Does the proportion of cells that can increase SOX2 following erlotinib exposure increase in the surviving cells (i.e. does erlotinib select for cells with this phenotype)? If not, then these data may be describing some form “fractional kill” or stochastic resistance, akin to that shown in Spencer et al., Nature, 2009. This would also be interesting, but not really related to the clinically observed problem of acquired resistance to erlotinib and other similar inhibitors.</p><p>3) The data presented show that SOX2 expression is not only heterogeneous, but also very rare. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, for example, it appears that &lt; 20% (maybe less than 10%) of cells express SOX2 after erlotinib exposure. Thus, it is unclear why removing SOX2 from ∼10-20% of cells would have the pronounced effects on erlotinib-mediated death that are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>. The dose of erlotinib used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is very low. Will the proportion of cells with SOX2 induction increase as a function of erlotinib dose?</p><p>4) At least 70% of patients who acquire resistance to EGFR inhibition do so on the basis of identifiable new mutations in EGFR or MET. I know the authors discuss a sort-of resistant state that SOX2. The authors should examine whether modulation of SOX2 affects selection for mutants in vivo.</p><p>5) BIM is identified as a key player in SOX2 signaling based on SOX2 over-expression assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, SOX2 siRNA causes very small effects on BIM protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Since erlotinib causes major loss of ERK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), this would be anticipated to cause BIM stabilization. One interpretation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> is therefore that SOX2 is not very important for BIM protein expression in this system. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> using SOX2 over-expression would appear to support this conclusion (although in that experiment, it is not clear why SOX2 is not induced by erlotinib in the control cells, but oddly is induced in the SOX2 over-expressing cells, which appear not to express SOX2 at time = 0).</p><p>6) BIM and BMF are identified as SOX2 target genes. Evidence to support this conclusion is required (e.g. ChIP assays).</p><p>7) The conclusion that FOXO6, but not other FOXO family members, mediates effects of erlotinib on SOX2 expression is not fully established. First, redundancy of FOXO isoforms is not considered, this is especially a problem since the efficiency of FOXO1/3a/4 knockdown is not presented. Second, ChIP assays are required to test the chromatin interactions of these FOXO proteins in the cells employed in this study. The connection to FOXO6 would be strengthened if it were shown that FOXO6 function was heterogeneous and matched SOX2 expression.</p><p>8) There are a number of technical concerns with the analysis presented. First, the siRNA studies are poorly described, for example, the siRNA are not defined. Second, important controls are missing. Only one siRNA is presented for each knockdown and no rescue studies were performed. Evidence that the siRNA caused a knockdown is missing; for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In other cases the extent of knockdown appears limited (e.g. FOXO6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Since the study is highly dependent on the use of siRNA approaches, these questions limit the impact of the study.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, “Inhibition of mutant EGFR in lung cancer cells triggers SOX2-FOXO6 dependent survival pathways”, for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been assessed by Detlef Weigel and Charles Sawyers in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. We consider that the manuscript has been improved by the inclusion of new data and revisions to the text. However, there are a number of points in the original review that were not adequately addressed, specifically:</p><p>5) Effect of SOX2 on BIM protein expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>) shows that the large increase in SOX2 expression does not appear to cause major changes in BIM expression. Moreover, why is BIM expression in lane 5 slightly greater than in lane 1? These data do not make a strong case for a role of SOX2 in the regulation of BIM protein expression. This is consistent with the modest effects of SOX2 knockdown to increase BIM protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref>). The authors need to clarify the experimental basis for their conclusion that BIM protein contributes to the effects of SOX2.</p><p>7) The conclusion that FOXO6 mediates the effects of erlotinib on SOX2 expression is not well supported by the data, because it appears that the RNAi data presented is confounded by off-target effects. Thus, siFOXO6 causes decreased expression of all other FOXO mRNA tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and siFOXO1/3a/4 causes decreased FOXO6 mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These data do not allow the authors to distinguish between the roles of different FOXO proteins (and raise questions concerning what other genes might be affected). The authors do present additional data to address this point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) by using more than the single siRNAs employed elsewhere; but no controls for off-target effects on other FOXO proteins are presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06132.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors do not establish whether their observations regarding SOX2 are relevant to any important clinical observation or outcomes. The paper is introduced with a discussion of resistance, but the reported study does not address resistance. Does modulation of SOX2 have effects on drug resistance?</italic></p><p>We now show new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, demonstrating that transient siRNA-mediated knockdown of SOX2, coincident with erlotinib exposure, decreases the subsequent development of stable, acquired resistance to erlotinib. While continuous culture of control PC9 cells in erlotinib for two weeks leads to the emergence of erlotinib-resistant clones, the number of resistant colonies is significantly decreased when SOX2 induction by erlotinib is prevented with siRNA.</p><p><italic>2) To further relate the findings to drug resistance, the authors should determine what occurs following a repeat challenge with erlotinib. The authors show that SOX2 induction is transient. Does the proportion of cells that can increase SOX2 following erlotinib exposure increase in the surviving cells (i.e. does erlotinib select for cells with this phenotype)? If not, then these data may be describing some form “fractional kill” or stochastic resistance, akin to that shown in Spencer et al., Nature, 2009. This would also be interesting, but not really related to the clinically observed problem of acquired resistance to erlotinib and other similar inhibitors</italic>.</p><p>We undertook the requested retreatment experiments and we show in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for HCC827 cells (and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4A</xref> for PC9 cells) that re-challenge with erlotinib after a period of recovery from two prior treatments (75-90% cell killing for each treatment), does not increase the proportion of cells with SOX2 inducible expression. Instead, SOX2 expression returns to basal levels in the absence of drug, and re-treatment re-induces SOX2 to similar levels and with similar cell distribution as with the prior treatment. These data are consistent with a stochastic model of SOX2 induction. As noted by the reviewer, a similar stochastic cell killing model was described in Spencer et al, Nature, 2009 with respect to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, this in no way suggests absence of clinical significance, since (as shown in Point #1 above), the transient expression of SOX2 itself enhances the subsequent emergence of stably resistant colonies. Progressively increasing fractions of SOX2 inducible cells following each erlotinib treatment are not expected in this model.</p><p>We also now show in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4B</xref>, that in PC9 cells that have developed acquired resistance following <italic>long-term</italic>, continuous erlotinib treatment, stochastic induction of SOX2 still occurs but only at the much higher doses of erlotinib required to inhibit EGFR in these resistant cells.</p><p>Taken together, these data support the heterogeneous, transient and stochastic induction of SOX2 following erlotinib treatment as a precursor to the development of stable acquired drug resistance.</p><p><italic>3) The data presented show that SOX2 expression is not only heterogeneous, but also very rare.

Will the proportion of cells with SOX2 induction increase as a function of erlotinib dose?</italic></p><p>In our experiments, the fraction of SOX2+ cells varies from 17-24% for HCC827 cells and 18-32% for PC9 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the threshold for immunofluorescence detection, it is likely that our immunofluorescence assay <italic>underestimates</italic> the number of cells with SOX2, and as such we propose a heterogeneous range of expression, rather than a truly rare and unique subset of the population. It is also difficult to determine precisely what level of SOX2 expression in an individual cell is required for a measurable effect on cell survival. We note that unlike the single cell data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows an immunoblot assay using total cell lysates, which obscures the contribution of individual cells to the apoptotic effect of SOX2 knockdown.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we also increased the dose of erlotinib beyond that initially tested. We show in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, that further increasing the dose of erlotinib beyond that required for full inhibition of EGFR signaling to 1.0μM does not substantially increase the fraction of SOX2+ HCC827 cells (Increased cell death in PC9 cells at the highest concentration precludes acute SOX2 induction analysis).</p><p><italic>4) At least 70% of patients who acquire resistance to EGFR inhibition do so on the basis of identifiable new mutations in EGFR or MET. I know the authors discuss a sort-of resistant state that SOX2. The authors should examine whether modulation of SOX2 affects selection for mutants in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers bring up the important point that stably acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors can take many forms, from secondary gatekeeper mutations within EGFR, to induction of MET or other “bypass tracks”, to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and even lineage switching from non-small cell to small cell histology. All of these complex mechanisms are noted in patients after prolonged treatment with erlotinib, but only few of these are well recapitulated using the standard cell line models, which tend to favor the gatekeeper mutation mechanism (even MET amplification is very rare in vitro). There are ample previous publications in this area. Given its complexity, we feel that defining the precise mechanism of long-term resistance in various PC9 and HCC827 clones, and the extent to which the various frequencies might be altered in the rare colonies that do ultimately emerge despite SOX2 suppression, would be beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) BIM is identified as a key player in SOX2 signaling based on SOX2 over-expression assays (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>).

Our data suggest transcriptional regulation by SOX2 as an additional mechanism that contributes to BIM regulation, but it is clearly not the only one (for example, the loss of MAPK pathway activity following erlotinib treatment likely leads to stabilization of the pool of previously transcribed BIM, that would be unaffected by SOX2 modulation of new BIM transcription). However, the effect of manipulating SOX2 levels on the degree of apoptosis clearly demonstrates that in certain cellular contexts, SOX2 can have an important, functional role.</p><p>We have replaced <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> with the blot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> (previously a supplemental figure in the original manuscript), so as to remove any confusion about how the experiment was performed. In this experiment, doxycycline was added for two hours to induce exogenous SOX2 and then removed prior to the addition of erlotinib for 24 hours, followed by preparation of lysates and immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. Here, both induction of physiologic levels of exogenous, epitope-tagged (and slower migrating) SOX2 by doxycycline, and induction of endogenous SOX2 by erlotinib, can be clearly appreciated, still resulting in decreased apoptotic PARP and Caspase-3 cleavage. We have moved the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref> and clarified how the experiment was done in the accompanying legend.</p><p><italic>6)</italic> BIM <italic>and</italic> BMF <italic>are identified as SOX2 target genes. Evidence to support this conclusion is required (e.g. ChIP assays)</italic>.</p><p>As requested by the reviewers we have performed ChIP assays. In the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, we use CHIP seq and ChIP qPCR to demonstrate erlotinib-induced binding of endogenous SOX2 to upstream regions of both the <italic>BIM</italic> and <italic>BMF</italic> genes.</p><p><italic>7) The conclusion that FOXO6, but not other FOXO family members, mediates effects of erlotinib on SOX2 expression is not fully established. First, redundancy of FOXO isoforms is not considered, this is especially a problem since the efficiency of FOXO1/3a/4 knockdown is not presented. Second, ChIP assays are required to test the chromatin interactions of these FOXO proteins in the cells employed in this study. The connection to FOXO6 would be strengthened if it were shown that FOXO6 function was heterogeneous and matched SOX2 expression</italic>.</p><p>The efficiency of knockdown for all FOXO siRNAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> using qPCR. For all FOXO family members where good quality antibodies are available, we have also added Western blot assays (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2B</xref>). We agree with the reviewer’s comment about the redundancy of FOXO isoforms, and this is shown in multiple FOXO knockdown experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, the triple knockdown of FOXO 1, FOXO3a and FOXO4 does not decrease SOX2 induction like single FOXO6 knockdown.</p><p>To further support the role of FOXO6 alone, we use four different siRNAs to confirm that its down regulation suppresses SOX2 induction by erlotinib in both HCC827 and PC9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>As requested by the reviewers, we show in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref> that FOXO6 expression is heterogeneous, and correlated with SOX2 expression.</p><p>We were unfortunately unable to demonstrate binding of FOXO6 to the promoter of SOX2 by chromatin immunoprecipitation, most likely due to the poor quality of available antibodies, since ChIP seq tracks for FOXO6-bound chromatin were inadequate across the genome.</p><p><italic>8) There are a number of technical concerns with the analysis presented. First, the siRNA studies are poorly described, for example, the siRNA are not defined. Second, important controls are missing. Only one siRNA is presented for each knockdown and no rescue studies were performed. Evidence that the siRNA caused a knockdown is missing; for example in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>. In other cases the extent of knockdown appears limited (e.g. FOXO6 in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref><italic>). Since the study is highly dependent on the use of siRNA approaches, these questions limit the impact of the study</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for these omissions. siRNA target sequences are now clearly defined in the Methods sections of the manuscript. The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> demonstrates dramatic rescue of the apoptotic effect of the most potent siRNA targeting SOX2 by a siRNA resistant, exogenous SOX2.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> also now demonstrates that four independent siRNA that effectively target FOXO6 decrease erlotinib-induced induction of SOX2 (shown above under point 7).</p><p>The degree of FOXO6 knockdown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> at the protein level is 50% (despite 80-90% knockdown at the mRNA level), which may be due technical issues related to the antibodies used (see Discussion about ChIP for FOXO6 above), or to the relatively long half-life of the protein (we waited up to 96 hours after siRNA transfection to assay for knockdown). Consistent with some residual FOXO6 protein remaining after knockdown, we observed significant, though incomplete suppression of SOX2 induction by erlotinib (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>We consider that the manuscript has been improved by the inclusion of new data and revisions to the text. However, there are a number of points in the original review that were not adequately addressed, specifically:</italic></p><p><italic>5) Effect of SOX2 on BIM protein expression.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref> <italic>(now</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1"><italic>Figure 5</italic>–<italic>figure supplement 1B</italic></xref><italic>) shows that the large increase in SOX2 expression does not appear to cause major changes in BIM expression. Moreover, why is BIM expression in lane 5 slightly greater than in lane 1? These data do not make a strong case for a role of SOX2 in the regulation of BIM protein expression. This is consistent with the modest effects of SOX2 knockdown to increase BIM protein expression (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4"><italic>Figure 5</italic>–<italic>figure supplement 4</italic></xref><italic>). The authors need to clarify the experimental basis for their conclusion that BIM protein contributes to the effects of SOX2</italic>.</p><p>The critical point about BIM is its <italic>relative induction compared to baseline</italic>, rather than a comparison of basal levels across two panels. As we show quantitatively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref> (together with the relevant protein bands from the referenced supplementary figure), the levels of each BIM isoform are clearly increased by 12 hours of treatment with erlotinib in the absence of ectopic SOX2 (blue lines). The erlotinib-mediated increase in BIM is clearly <italic>suppressed</italic> over the same time period by the simultaneous addition of erlotinib and ectopic SOX2 induction (red lines). The slightly increased basal BIM levels at time zero in lane 5 versus lane 1 noted by the reviewer are most likely due to experimental variation and are not relevant to the apoptotic effects observed.</p><p>This quantitation is now included with the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>. In addition, we in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1C</xref> a different experiment using tagged, ectopic SOX2 and extend the time of treatment to 24 hours. Here, the levels of ectopic SOX2 induction (lanes 5-6) are comparable to endogenous SOX2 induction by erlotinib (lane 2-3); decreased BIM levels are clearly apparent (the use of a lower percentage acrylamide gel does not permit BIM L and S to be distinguished from EL).</p><p>To address the question of large changes in SOX2 expression leading to smaller changes in BIM expression, we would not expect a linear relationship between arbitrary “levels” of SOX2 versus BIM. What is important here is the functional consequence of BIM and BMF induction (and of preventing their induction by siRNA or ectopic SOX2), which we clearly demonstrate.</p><p>As to the major data relating to SOX2 and BIM, we note the following: in our manuscript, we claim that the transient induction of SOX2, following acute suppression of mutant EGFR signaling, reduces induction of <italic>two</italic> pro-apoptotic proteins, BIM and BMF, thereby reducing cell death and setting the stage for acquired drug resistance to EGFR inhibitors. This is based on several lines of evidence:</p><p>(1) Potent suppression of BIM and BMF by ectopic SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and its associated figure supplement 1, together with the new data above).</p><p>(2) Increased BIM following SOX2 knockdown in the presence of erlotinib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5–figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>(3) Direct, erlotinib-dependent binding of endogenous SOX2 to both BIM and BMF regulatory regions by ChIP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A and B</xref>).</p><p>(4) The functional consequences of this SOX2-mediated effect is demonstrated by the cooperative suppression of erlotinib-induced apoptosis, when both BIM and BMF induction are prevented using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) The conclusion that FOXO6 mediates the effects of erlotinib on SOX2 expression is not well supported by the data, because it appears that the RNAi data presented is confounded by off-target effects. Thus, siFOXO6 causes decreased expression of all other FOXO mRNA tested (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B</italic></xref><italic>) and siFOXO1/3a/4 causes decreased FOXO6 mRNA expression (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B</italic></xref><italic>). These data do not allow the authors to distinguish between the roles of different FOXO proteins (and raise questions concerning what other genes might be affected). The authors do present additional data to address this point (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7D</italic></xref><italic>) by using more than the single siRNAs employed elsewhere; but no controls for off-target effects on other FOXO proteins are presented</italic>.</p><p>Our critical finding is that <italic>only</italic> knockdown of FOXO6 significantly decreases SOX2 induction by erlotinib. Given the reviewer’s concern about possible nonspecific effects of the siRNA pool targeting FOXO6, we have now added data on different FOXO isoform levels for each of the four individual siRNAs that comprised the FOXO6 pool (see the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2C</xref>). Two different siRNA duplexes (-01 and -02) are uniquely targeting FOXO6, without effect on other FOXO family members. Two other siRNAs within the pool (-03 and -04) do have some off-target effect on FOXOs1, 3a and 4. Note in the new figure that with 24 hours of erlotinib treatment, FOXO6 is induced by erlotinib to a much greater degree than the other FOXOs in both HCC827 and PC9 cells, hence these off-target effects are less impressive than the on-target effect on FOXO6. This new data suggests that the nonspecific effects of the FOXO6 siRNA pool on other FOXOs are likely due to duplexes -03 and -04.</p><p>In addition to <italic>two independent siRNAs</italic> (-01, -02) being highly specific in knocking down FOXO6 and reducing SOX2 expression, <italic>it is key to also note that we have tested the other FOXO family members directly for their effect on SOX2 expression (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7B</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. siRNAs that effectively knock down either FOXO1, FOXO3a or FOXO4 have no significant effect on SOX2. Hence, the off target effects of FOXO siRNAs -03 and -04 on other FOXOs are not responsible for suppression of SOX2 expression.</p><p>In addition to addressing the reviewers’ concern regarding siRNA off-target effects, the role for FOXO6 is further supported by our demonstration of FOXO6 co-localization with SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>), as requested by the reviewers of our initial submission. With respect to other pathways, we used multiple approaches to test several other (e.g. non-FOXO) pathways implicated in SOX2 regulation, including FGF, WNT and NKX2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7–figure supplement 4</xref>), and none of these affected SOX2 induction by erlotinib. Therefore, our conclusion, that FOXO6 is the <italic>primary</italic> mediator of erlotinib’s effect on SOX2 expression, is well supported by the data.</p><p>We thank the reviewer/editors for this opportunity to address the remaining concerns from our resubmitted manuscript. Together with the extensive additional data and edits provided in our revised manuscript, we provide multiple lines of evidence that SOX2 induction contributes to upfront and acquired resistance to erlotinib in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells. These include:</p><p>(1) Enhancement of acute erlotinib-induced apoptosis and suppression of long-term acquired resistance, when SOX2 induction is prevented with siRNA (an effect that is completely rescued by a SOX2 construct that is resistant to siRNA targeting).</p><p>(2) Detailed analysis of the heterogeneous, transient and stochastic nature of SOX2 induction in multiple EGFR-mutant cell lines, xenografts and patient-derived models.</p><p>(3) A proposed mechanism for both mutant EGFR’s regulation of SOX2 through FOXO6, and SOX2’s regulation of apoptosis through BIM and BMF.</p><p>(4) A demonstration of the functional importance of high basal SOX2 for upfront erlotinib resistance, in addition to acquired drug resistance.</p><p>The critical importance of acute and transient signaling feedback pathways for the development of resistance to targeted anti-cancer therapies has been established for several oncogene-addicted cancers (primarily mutant BRAF-driven melanoma and colorectal cancer). We show that similar pathways are involved in EGFR<italic>-</italic>mutant lung cancer. These studies, by their very nature, may be different from well-characterized developmental roles of FOXO and SOX genes, but their adaptation in cancer cells and their contribution to acquired resistance to signaling inhibitors is of significant biological interest and high clinical relevance. Given the scope of our observations and the readily addressed points raised by this secondary review, we are most grateful for your consideration.</p></body></sub-article></article>
