is an exciting new vertebrate model for aging studies. A significant challenge for any model organism is the control over its diet in space and time. To address this challenge, we created an automated and networked fish feeding system. Our automated feeder is designed to be open-source, easily transferable, and built from widely available components. Compared to manual feeding, our automated system is highly precise and flexible. As a proof of concept for the feeding flexibility of these automated feeders, we define a favorable regimen for growth and fertility for the African killifish and a dietary restriction regimen where both feeding time and quantity are reduced. We show that this dietary restriction regimen extends lifespan in males (but not in females) and impacts the transcriptomes of killifish livers in a sex-specific manner. Moreover, combining our automated feeding system with a video camera, we establish a quantitative associative learning assay to provide an integrative measure of cognitive performance for the killifish. The ability to precisely control food delivery in the killifish opens new areas to assess lifespan and cognitive behavior dynamics and to screen for dietary interventions and drugs in a scalable manner previously impossible with traditional vertebrate model organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Nothobranchius furzeri</italic></kwd><kwd>African killifish</kwd><kwd>turquoise killifish</kwd><kwd><italic>N. furzeri</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Brain Rejuvenation Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wyss-Coray</surname><given-names>Tony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Stanford Graduate Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKay</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bedbrook</surname><given-names>Claire N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1AG057334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunet</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG063418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brunet</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>61-1762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jingxun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An automated feeding system to precisely control feeding in the killifish opens new areas to explore vertebrate lifespan, cognitive decline, dietary interventions, and drug screening in a high-throughput manner.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The African turquoise killifish, <italic>Nothobranchius furzeri</italic>, is a new genetically tractable model organism that has been developed for the study of aging and ‘suspended animation’ (embryonic diapause) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cellerino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harel and Brunet, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu and Brunet, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Platzer and Englert, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poeschla and Valenzano, 2020</xref>).

A genetic and genomic toolkit has been developed for the killifish, including sequencing of its genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reichwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Valenzano et al., 2015</xref>), Tol2-based transgenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartmann and Englert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Valenzano et al., 2011</xref>), and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harel et al., 2015</xref>).

A proper diet is important for robust growth and fertility in colony maintenance and genetic manipulations. A controlled feeding regimen is also critical for lifespan studies, given the impact of dietary restriction – and more generally diet – on lifespan in a wide variety of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fontana and Partridge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Green et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Longo and Anderson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mair and Dillin, 2008</xref>), including worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Houthoofd and Vanfleteren, 2007</xref>), flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Partridge et al., 2005</xref>), killifish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Terzibasi et al., 2009</xref>), stickleback fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Inness and Metcalfe, 2008</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mitchell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weindruch et al., 1986</xref>), rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodrick et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Swindell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Turturro et al., 1999</xref>), and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mattison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mattison et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, food is not only essential for growth, fertility, and survival, but it can also serve as a reward. Indeed, several cognitive tests rely on the ability of associating food with a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flagel and Robinson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jarrard, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Olton and Samuelson, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rudy and Sutherland, 1989</xref>).</p><p>In the wild, adult African turquoise killifish primarily feed upon small crustaceans and insect larvae (‘bloodworms’) that are present in their ephemeral ponds in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polacik and Reichard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reichard and Polačik, 2019</xref>). In laboratory settings, African killifish are often fed using bloodworms, either live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hartmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reichwald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Terzibasi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wendler et al., 2015</xref>), frozen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Genade et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Terzibasi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Valenzano et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zupkovitz et al., 2018</xref>), or lyophilized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Valenzano et al., 2015</xref>). However, feeding with live bloodworms can introduce pathogens in the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Broza and Halpern, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moore et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rouf and Rigney, 1993</xref>), and the nutrition values of live bloodworms can vary depending on the lot and supplier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fard et al., 2014</xref>). To alleviate these issues, dry food pellets have been recently adopted for killifish, either alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zak et al., 2022</xref>) or in combination with live food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matsui et al., 2019</xref>). But a main challenge of dry fish food – and fish food in general – is that it needs to be delivered for each feeding, otherwise it loses its appeal to fish and remains uneaten in the tanks. Regardless of the type of food used in the laboratory, feeding fish is largely based on manual feeding. Hence, food delivery is a limiting factor: it is hard to perform in a consistent manner, to scale up, and to schedule at any time of the day or night. These features hamper the testing of different feeding regimens and other interventions. Control over food delivery will help the development of the killifish as a scalable model for lifespan and other traits and to allow interventions.</p><p>To address these challenges and develop the scalability of the killifish as a model system, we have created an automated feeding system for killifish feeding. We provide evidence that this system is precise and reliable, and that it allows controlled and tunable feeding throughout the day or night. Using this new flexible feeding system, we explore the parameters of diet in the killifish and identify a dietary restriction regimen that extends the lifespan of killifish and modulates liver transcriptome in a sex-specific manner. Interestingly, our automated feeders also allow us to design a novel associative learning assay to test cognitive function in the African killifish. This automated feeding system will help the development of the killifish as a high-throughput model for lifespan and will allow scalable intervention or drug screening.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A wireless networked automated feeding system</title><p>Controlling feeding automatically is a critical component for the development and scalability of a model organism. Automated feeders have been developed for fish, but they are rarely used due to their imprecision (e.g., hobbyist feeding systems) or prohibitive costs (e.g., scientific-grade feeding systems, such as Tritone from Tecniplast). While systems developed for zebrafish have solved some of these constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doyle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lange et al., 2021</xref>), they are either not scalable to hundreds of animals simultaneously being fed or cannot easily be added onto commercial water systems. Thus, there is still a need for high-precision and programmable feeders compatible with commonly used water systems.</p><p>To address the main limitations with current feeding methods, we developed a wireless networked automated feeding system for the African turquoise killifish. We created a system in which different components function independently to confer robustness and avoid single points of failure that affect the overall feeding scheme. This is particularly important when feeding needs to happen over a lifespan. The automated feeder that we designed and built is placed on top of each animal’s 2.8 L tank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and drops dry food (e.g., Otohime fish diet) from a small feed hopper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) directly into the tank (which houses one individual fish). The feeder is powered by an attached battery, and the food pellets are automatically segregated from the hopper by a rotating acrylic disc, with the resulting pieces of food dropping onto the water through a 3-mm diameter opening cut out in the supporting acrylic plate below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). The 3-mm opening rotates from under the feed hopper, collects food, and travels to the drop site above the tank opening. Each rotation delivers a fixed volume of food, averaging around 5 mg in mass, and multiples of 5 mg can be programmed to increase food amount per feeding. Feedings are also fully programmable to any frequency or time of day by the user, and each feeder operates independently of one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), allowing flexibility in feeding schedule (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An automated 3D-printed feeding system for the African turquoise killifish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Side view of an individual automated feeding unit placed on the top front of a 2.8 L fish tank supplied by Aquaneering.

Step 1, at the programmed feeding time, the feeder wakes up from idle and receives the operation instruction from the network. The 3-mm hole turns toward the hopper. Step 2, the 3-mm hole collects 5 mg of dry food from the hopper. Step 3, the 3-mm hole sits on top of the photoresistor. Because the food blocks the green light-emitting diode (LED) light from reaching the photoresistor, a high value of photoresistance is recorded on the network. Step 4, the 3-mm hole carries the food toward the food drop site. Step 5, the 3-mm hole arrives at the food drop site and drops food. Then it returns to the photoresistor. Step 6, after food drops, the green LED light is no longer blocked, and a low value of photoresistance is recorded on the network. Then the 3-mm hole moves back to the resting position until next feeding. The change in photoresistance between steps 3 and 6 indicates that the food has been dropped.

Dietary restriction regimens encompass restricting overall food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mattison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mattison et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weindruch et al., 1986</xref>) or restricting the time of feeding during the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mitchell et al., 2019</xref>) or over longer periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandhorst et al., 2015</xref>). In killifish, dietary restriction has been done by every other day feeding because it is difficult to do otherwise with manual feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Terzibasi et al., 2009</xref>). A dietary restriction regimen is expected to reduce growth and fertility (especially when applied early in adulthood) compared to an ad libitum feeding regimen. In contrast, overfeeding has negative consequences on health, and it is expected to increase growth but to reduce fertility compared to an ad libitum regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Magwere et al., 2004</xref>). To define different dietary regimens in the African turquoise killifish, we fed individually housed male and female killifish – starting in young adults (1 month of age) – and varied both the amount and timing of feedings throughout the day using our programmable automated feeders. For ‘ad libitum’ (AL, blue), we fed 35 mg of dry food per day, in seven feedings of 5 mg evenly spaced over 12 hr of the day, for a total of 245 mg per week (roughly similar to manual feeding) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For ‘dietary restriction’ (DR, orange), we fed 15 mg per day (~57% restriction), in three feedings of 5 mg over 2 hr, for a total of 105 mg per week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This DR regimen is both amount- and time-restricted (achieving amount restriction without time restriction would not be possible in current settings because of the minimum 5 mg delivery amount of automated feeder, see above). This DR regimen led to smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>) and less fertile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) animals than the AL regimen, consistent with what is expected under dietary restriction. Importantly, at seven feedings of 5 mg a day (AL), animals were not overfed because they could be fed more (twelve feedings of 5 mg a day) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and this extra feeding increased size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>) but decreased fertility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Hence, a favorable feeding regimen, at least under these husbandry conditions, is around seven feedings per day and 35 mg of food per day for the African killifish. Together, these experiments define diets that optimize growth and fertility in the African killifish (for these husbandry conditions), and they identify a dietary restriction regimen in this species.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Automated feeding enables the definition of different diets for the African killifish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme to compare two automated feeding schedules for killifish: feeding seven times a day evenly over 12 hr (5 mg Otohime fish diet per feeding, 35 mg total per day) and feeding three times a day within a 2 hr period in the morning (5 mg Otohime fish diet per feeding, 15 mg total per day).

The DR regimen was initiated in young adults (1 month of age) and lasted until death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, males fed the DR diet (orange) lived longer than those fed the AL diet (blue; 16.6% median lifespan extension for cohort 1 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>], 22.1% median lifespan extension for cohort 2 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>]). In contrast, females fed the DR diet did not live significantly longer than those fed the AL diet in either cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Animals fed a DR diet exhibited lifespan differences between sexes, with male living significantly longer than females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). The sex-specific effect of DR on killifish lifespan was also supported using Cox proportional hazards in a factorial design (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata3">Figure 4—source data 3</xref>), where the interaction term between sex and dietary regimen was found to be significant (p=0.045). Furthermore, fitting the survival data of male killifish into a Gompertz distribution resulted in an estimated reduced slope for males in DR conditions. These results suggest that this DR regimen reduces the ‘rate of aging’ in male killifish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), in line with the effect of intermittent feeding on lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Terzibasi et al., 2009</xref>).

We tracked individual fish trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). An association was defined as ‘successful’ when a fish initiated a surface-bound trajectory after the red light turned on (2 s after the video recording started) but before the food dropped to the water surface (7 s after the light turned on, so 9 s after the recording started) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods’). An association was defined as ‘unsuccessful’ when a fish did not initiate a surface-bound trajectory within this window of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, top, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>). Qualitative comparisons of the trajectory traces of individual fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) or compass plots to display trajectory directionality of all fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) both suggest that individual fish initiates a surface-bound trajectory more prominently in later trials than in earlier ones. To quantify this surface-bound trajectory, we established an automated pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We first calculated velocity (i.e., pixels traversed per second) for each fish and assessed the ‘bursts’ of velocity (yellow regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) for each animal in each trial (see ‘Materials and methods’). We then used this metric to plot, for each fish, the time of the first trajectory toward the water surface (t<sub>1</sub>) to reflect ‘initiation of surface-bound trajectory’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). For stringent quantification, we only scored the videos of fish that ate during the assay (13 fish out of 16 total) because a successful eating behavior indicates that the fish could see the food at the surface and was motivated enough to move (see ‘Materials and methods’). The average time of the first surface-bound trajectory for these 13 fish was significantly shorter in the last seven trials than in the first seven trials (p=0.0005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). The percentage of successful trials in the last seven trials was also significantly higher than that in the first seven trials (p=0.030) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). These results were confirmed by manual quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), with a correlation of 0.80 for t<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, after several trials, killifish move toward the food delivery after the light turns on but before the food drops, consistent with a positive association between red light and food.</p><p>We next compared the association performance between young and old animals (grouping both sexes). We verified that the average velocity of young and old fish did not exhibit overt differences, suggesting that old fish could overall move (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Old animals (n = 8 males and females, 119–130 days of age) tended to have slightly poorer association performance compared to young ones (n = 5 males and females, 47–70 days of age) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–K</xref>). Old animals also tended to have a lower ‘learning index’ – defined as the inverse of the first trial number needed for an animal to achieve two consecutive successes (see ‘Materials and methods’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). However, at this sample size, the differences between ages were not statistically significant whether animals were binned into young and old categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J–L</xref>) or not (regression, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>). To detect the observed effect size between young and old (Cohen’s d = –0.786) at a p-value of 0.05 and power of 80%, we estimated that 28 animals per age group would be needed when using learning index (and 27 and 132 animals per age group when using average time of first surface-bound trajectory and percentage of success, respectively). Collectively, these results indicate that the automated feeders can be used to determine associative conditioning, a measure of cognitive fitness that could be adapted for future aging studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The automated feeding system presented here provides a valuable resource to the killifish community to consistently and reproducibly control the critical factor of feeding. Our system also offers an increased resolution on diet’s impact on lifespan in a vertebrate model of aging. The automated feeders improve the precision of food dropped compared to manual feeding, which could reduce variability in experiments (e.g., lifespan studies) and deliver a well-defined diet. Compared to feeding approaches that risk introducing infection (live food) or are labor intensive (manual feeding), our feeding system is a safe and modular solution to feeding not only killifish and other teleost model organisms such as medaka, stickleback, or zebrafish. Furthermore, the tunable frequency and quantity of feedings that can be programmed opens up an experimental space (e.g., night feeding) previously infeasible with conventional feeding approaches. Our design also allows each tank to have its own food hopper and allows straightforward nutrient and drug testing, such as high-fat diets, ketogenic diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Newman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roberts et al., 2017</xref>), or dosing of animals with drug-encapsulated food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Valenzano et al., 2006b</xref>). While there are still areas for optimization, including improved battery life and a simplified user interface, the performance of our automated feeding system is beyond that of manual feeding or several other automated feeding systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doyle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Manabe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2019</xref>) in terms of combining precise amount of food dropped, modularity, and scalability. Compared to other recently developed scalable designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lange et al., 2021</xref>), our automated feeders can be added to any tank, including tanks from commercial water systems, allowing flexibility in experimental design.</p><p>Using the automated feeding system, we explore dietary parameters and identify a feeding regimen close to an ad libitum diet, as well as a daily dietary restriction diet for the African killifish. We note that the median and maximum lifespan of the killifish in ad libitum conditions in the experiments presented in this study are shorter than some previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2020</xref>), though longer than others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Terzibasi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Valenzano et al., 2006b</xref>). These differences might be linked to food amount or supply differences or other husbandry differences, and ‘ad libitum’ conditions may in fact vary depending on animal facilities. We also show that the amount- and time-restricted diet we used (~57% dietary restriction) extends the lifespan of male, but not female killifish. Gompertz analysis confirms that dietary restriction reduces the rate of aging in males only. This sex difference in lifespan extension is likely independent of killifish social dynamics, as all animals were housed individually. Lifespan differences between sexes in response to DR are also observed in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bronikowski et al., 2022</xref>). In mice, extreme DR (40%) extends lifespan in males, but not in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>), though milder DR leads to a greater lifespan extension in females than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonkowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitchell et al., 2016</xref>). Different strains of mice exhibit more lifespan extension in response to DR in males than in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liao et al., 2010</xref>). In flies, DR has also been shown to impact lifespan differently between the sexes, with female flies enjoying the maximum lifespan benefits from DR at higher calorie levels than male flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Magwere et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, DR is more beneficial in hermaphrodites than in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honjoh et al., 2017</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that sexes respond differently to various DR regimens and that females may not tolerate extreme DR regimens.</p><p>We also examine the gene expression changes associated with the sex-specific response to DR in the African turquoise killifish. We find that amount- and time-restricted DR downregulates fatty acid synthesis genes in the liver in females, more so than in males. In mice, DR also downregulates lipid metabolic genes (e.g., <italic>ACYL</italic>, <italic>AACS</italic>) in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn et al., 2017</xref>), which has been proposed to protect older animals from visceral fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuhla et al., 2014</xref>) and hepatic insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that in female killifish, the decrease in lipid enzyme expression in the liver in response to the amount- and time-restricted DR regimen is too pronounced and not compatible with sustained metabolic function. DR also upregulates protein folding and ER stress response pathways in female but not male killifish. This was not observed in female mice upon DR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hahn et al., 2017</xref>), and this may reflect a response to extreme DR to meet higher secretory demand or protein misfolding stress. Finally, DR downregulates inflammation-related pathways in female killifish, but less prominently than in males. DR was also able to reduce inflammation in female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Swindell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Swindell, 2009</xref>), and this decreased inflammation may contribute to delay the aging process in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hunt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maeso-Díaz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Swindell, 2009</xref>). But in killifish, the blunted ability of DR to reduce inflammation in females compared to males may also contribute to the lack of lifespan extension by this DR regimen in females. It is possible that the DR regimen defined here is too severe to provide lifespan benefits to females, and AL and DR regimens would likely need to be optimized differently in males and females.</p><p>Using the killifish feeding system, we establish a proof-of-concept, positive association learning assay (classical conditioning) that couples food with a red LED light. Combining video cameras with feeders allows many animals to be conditioned simultaneously, at any time, with the ability to collect a wealth of information about animal behavior without investigator-induced disturbance. A positive association learning assay is advantageous over a negative one because it is less stressful for the animal and could be done in conjunction with a lifespan assay without inducing additional perturbation. However, food amounts dispensed for the assay itself would need to be carefully accounted for in the total amount, to avoid inadvertently affecting the overall diet and the lifespan of the animal.</p><p>The current version of the positive association assay has limitations. First, it only uses one camera for recording fish behavior, and three-dimensional (3D) behaviors are not fully captured. This assay would therefore be enhanced by using other deep learning methods that better predict 3D poses from monocular (2D) video footage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gosztolai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karashchuk et al., 2021</xref>) or by incorporating multiple cameras calibrated to enable 3D-pose triangulation from multiple perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>). Second, while we used a common design for our positive association assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colwill, 2019</xref>), other designs such as the ‘t<sub>1</sub>-t<sub>2</sub>’ paradigm, in which animals are first exposed to a stimulus (t<sub>1</sub>) and learning is then assessed in a testing phase (t<sub>2</sub>) could improve the assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colwill, 2019</xref>). Such a paradigm can guard against behavioral changes due to fluctuations unrelated to the stimulus, including changes in water parameters, animals’ motivation, or circadian activities. Lastly, we verified that older animals were able to eat food (indicating that they could generally see and move) and that there was no significant difference in average velocity between young and old animals. However, we cannot exclude that more nuanced issues with sight or movement ability may contribute to the reduced performance of older animals. Future studies would need to control for these variables and increase the number of animals when examining the effect of age on learning. Overall, our automated feeding system opens the door to use the killifish as a scalable model to screen for genes or compounds that counter aging and age-related cognitive decline.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Automated fish feeding system</title><p>We designed and built an automated fish feeding system that comprises individual battery-powered wireless automated feeders (‘feeders’), a co-located server (‘local server’), and a cloud-based server (‘cloud server’).</p><p>We designed and built the feeders so that they can be placed on individual 2.8 L tanks supplied by Aquaneering, Inc (San Diego, CA), which are commonly used for killifish and zebrafish husbandry, and fit into the tank lid’s two foremost holes. The feeders can precisely deliver a fixed amount of dry fish food (Otohime fish diet, Reed Mariculture, Otohime C1) repeatedly each day on a highly flexible schedule. They are composed of 3D printed parts (Hatchbox PLA, 1.75 mm), transparent 1/16-inch-thick laser-cut acrylic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</ext-link>), nylon screws and nuts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</ext-link>), a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</ext-link>), a Wemos D1 mini ESP8266-based development board (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon.com</ext-link>), and a custom-printed circuit board (PCB) of a design ordered through OSH Park (Portland, OR). The design incorporates a green LED and corresponding photoresistor that measures food dropped and allows for automatic calibration. The 3D-printed and laser-cut components were designed in Autocad (Autodesk), and PCBs were designed using Eagle software (Autodesk). We assembled feeders in house and programmed the ESP8266 microcontrollers using MicroPython language.</p><p>Feeders running MicroPython use the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) communication protocol to connect to the local server, which acts as the MQTT broker, and obtain the current time and feeding regime. Each feeder can be programmed with separate and independent feeding regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For example, for the AL regimen, the feeder was programmed to deliver seven times per day between 7 am and 7 pm (every 2 hr) and to drop 5 mg of food each time. For the DR regimen, the feeder was programmed to deliver three times per day evenly between 7 am and 9 am and to drop 5 mg of food each time. When several feeders were used in parallel (one for each fish), each of the feeders was programmed independently on the server. Feeders remain in deep sleep power-saving mode until their designated feeding, at which point they rotate their acrylic feeding disc using the onboard stepper motor from under the food hopper, in between the green LED and photoresistor array, and over the drop site, before returning to the food hopper. This releases 5 mg of food per feeding while measuring the resistance of the photoresistor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, steps 3–6), providing a reportable confirmation of food delivery. The photoresistor readings for each individual device are recorded on a feeding log on the server, confirming that food has dropped, or that there has been a missed feeding. Missed feedings can occur for a variety of reasons, including low levels of food in the hopper or the loss of communication of the feeder with the server. The feeding log records feedings associated with the unique ID of a feeder, so the researcher can be alerted to the issue and rectify it.</p><p>After feeding, a confirmation is relayed from the feeder to the local server, using the MQTT protocol, and the confirmation is uploaded to the cloud server via an MQTT bridge. The cloud server acts as the orchestrating database, receiving commands from the user via a Julia language-based command line interface that communicates with the underlying MQTT protocol, the SQLite database of feeder orders, the logs of feeding confirmations, and checked-in feeders. This cloud server exists as an Amazon Web Service EC2 instance and relays changes from users back through the MQTT bridge to the local server and back to individual feeders, while running maintenance scripts that provide status updates on all feeders.</p><p>An overview of the system and links to the components (also listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) is available in a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/amckay1/KilliFeeder">GitHub repository</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">McKay, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>African turquoise killifish husbandry</title><p>All experiments were performed using the GRZ strain of the African turquoise killifish species <italic>N. furzeri</italic>.

After 24 hr, the trays were collected, and embryos were separated from the sand by sieving. Collected embryos were placed in Ringer’s solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 96724) with 0.01% methylene blue at 26°C in 60 mm × 15 mm Petri dishes (E and K Scientific, EK-36161) at a density between 10 and 50 embryos per plate. After 2 weeks of monitoring, embryos were transferred to moist autoclaved coconut fiber (Zoo Med Eco Earth Loose Coconut Fiber) lightly packed in Petri dishes (E and K Scientific, EK-36161) at the same density as per the previous 2 weeks and then incubated for another 2 weeks at 26°C. After 2 weeks on moist coconut fiber, hatching was induced by placing embryos in chilled (4°C) 1 g/L humic acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich, 53680) and incubating them in that solution overnight at room temperature. The fry were transferred to 0.8 L tanks at two fry per tank for the first 2 weeks and then one fry per tank for the final 2 weeks on the circulating system (26°C). Fry were fed freshly hatched brine shrimp (Brine Shrimp Direct, BSEP6LB) twice per day for the duration of the first 4 weeks post-hatching. After 4 weeks, adult animals that had inflated swim bladders (identified by the ability to float) were individually housed in 2.8 L tanks where they were fed Otohime fish diet (Reed Mariculture, Otohime C1). Animals were sexed at 4 weeks by visual inspection: males exhibit vivid tail fin colors whereas females do not. Animals were placed on the automated feeding system starting at 4 weeks of age, with the exception of feeder-naïve animals used for the behavioral assays. The animals on feeders were fed for the entirety of the experiments using different regimens including AL (7 feedings of 5 mg per feeding spread throughout the day), DR (3 feedings of 5 mg per feeding in the morning), and overfeeding (12 feedings of 5 mg per feeding spread throughout the day). For behavior experiments, feeder-naïve animals were fed twice a day 20 mg between 8 am and 11 am in the morning and between 2 pm and 5 pm in the afternoon during the week and once 20 mg per day between 8 am and 5 pm during weekends until they were used for the behavioral experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Comparison between automated and manual feeding</title><p>To compare automated feeding with manual feeding, automated feeders were programmed to drop a total of 40 mg Otohime fish diet (eight rotations of the feeding mechanism with 5 mg per rotation).

The mass of each manual feeding was measured using a scale to 1 mg precision. The measurement was repeated 9 times per individual and a total of 19 times across four different automated feeders.

To measure the fish size, fish were placed in a clear plastic crossing tank (Aquaneering, ZHCT100T) with a water depth of 3 cm and a reference ruler underneath. Images were taken using a fixed-position digital camera. Analysis of size was carried out by measuring the length of the animals in pixels and converting to length based upon the reference ruler’s size in pixels. After animals had died (the day of death or the next day), dead animals were placed on a ruler and their length measured directly using a digital camera. The difference in length divided by the time between the first measurement and death was then reported as the fish growth rate. To accurately compare animal growth rates despite different times of death, only animals that died before 4 months were compared.</p><p>Growth rates were compared between conditions using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a significance threshold alpha of 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fertility experiments and analysis</title><p>Fish from the same hatching date at 4 weeks of age (AL and DR comparison) or 8 weeks of age (AL and overfeeding comparison) were paired in 2.8 L tanks, with one male and one female. Each animal was given the same feeding regime prior to enrollment: brine shrimp as described above for the first 28 days post-hatching then manual feeding of Otohime C1 fish diet up until the beginning of the enrollment on automated feeders. At the beginning of the enrollment, pairs of males and females were crossed in the afternoon with sand trays and uncrossed ~24 hr later. Pairs were crossed and uncrossed weekly on the same day and crossed until one of the pairs died. Sand trays with embryos were removed at that time and sieved as described above to isolate embryos, which were then rinsed and counted. The total number of embryos produced and the number of fertilized embryos (indicated by separation of the chorion from the yolk membrane) were recorded and reported for each pair for that week.</p><p>Fertility was analyzed between feeding conditions by treating each pairing as an independent data point and using two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test with a significance threshold alpha of 0.05. Animals used for fertility assessment were part of an independent cohort from that used for the lifespan and growth rate evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Lifespan experiments and analysis, including Gompertz curve estimation</title><p>Embryos for lifespan experiments were produced as described above. Briefly, GRZ males and females were bred overnight, with embryos placed in Ringer’s solution for 2 weeks at 26°C and on coconut fiber for another 2 weeks at 26°C before being hatched in humic acid. Any animals that did not hatch were removed from the experiment. Fry that hatched were transferred to 0.8 L tanks and split on the strict timescale previously described: two fry per 0.8 L tank for the first 2 weeks post-hatching, and then one fry per 0.8 L tank for the subsequent 2 weeks post-hatching. After 4 weeks post-hatching, adult individuals were individually placed in 2.8 L tanks for the remainder of their lives. When placed in 2.8 L tanks, animals were transferred to feeding with Otohime C1 fish diet using an automated feeder. Both males and females were used for lifespan experiments unless otherwise stated, and sex was determined by the bright coloring of the male tail fins. Animals were checked daily and animals that died were recorded as dying on the day found. Two cohorts in total were aged, with animals from each cohort being from the same breeding pairs and enrolled into the cohort based upon hatch date. Any animals whose automated feeders stopped performing due to damage to the feeder were censored (noted as ‘0’ in the ‘Observed’ column in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>Statistical analysis of lifespan experiments was conducted using the log-rank test with a significance threshold alpha of 0.05. We also analyzed lifespan data with the Cox proportional hazard model controlling for hatch date (with a significance threshold of 0.05). Gompertz curves were calculated using the combined males from both cohorts 1 and 2. Briefly, males on dietary restriction or ad libitum feeding regimes were pooled and a Gompertz distribution fitted to the two groups using the R flexsurv library and the flexsurvreg function with a ‘Gompertz’ distribution. The resulting estimated parameters for the intercept and slope of the Gompertz curve were then plotted in Julia using a custom script. Estimates for the hazard rate were assessed by calculating the hazard function based upon 3-week binning of mortality rates for the two groups, DR males or AL males. Gompertz curve parameter estimates are reported with estimated 95% confidence levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fish cohort and tissue dissection for RNA-seq experiment</title><p>All fish were raised from embryos collected from 15 male–female pairs, when these breeders were 9–10 weeks of age (within their reproductive peak). Collected embryos were treated with mild iodine (0.2%, diluted from Povidone-iodine solution [10% w/v, 1% w/v available iodine, RICCA #3955–16]) on day 1 to reduce contamination, incubated in embryo solution with 0.01% methylene blue (Kordo, #37344), and then placed on moist coco fiber on the 14th day after collection. After 2 weeks on coco fiber, fish were hatched in ~1-cm-deep cold 1 g/L humic acid solution, at room temperature. For the next 4 days, the fish were housed on the countertop of the animal facility at 25°C. System water was added to the hatching containers, and fish were fed live brine shrimp daily. For the following 2 weeks, fish were housed at a density of four fish per 0.8 L tank and fed with brine shrimp daily. In the following 2 weeks, housing density was reduced to two fish per 0.8 L tank and fish were fed as before. Each fish was first imaged from the top using a digital camera at a fixed position and then transferred to a 2.8 L tank. Lastly, an automatic feeder was put on each tank, and either AL or DR feeding regime was assigned randomly to each fish. Feeders were programmed according to this random assignment.

Fish were randomly assigned to a harvest batch, with each batch having two fish from each condition (AL-Male, DR-Male, AL-Female, DR-Female). On harvest day, the automatic feeders were first removed from the tank. Next, 1.5 hr after the room light turned on, for AL treatment, fish were manually fed 17.5 mg of dry food; and for DR treatment, fish were fed 7.5 mg of dry food. This quantity of food corresponded to half of the total daily food amount and maintained the differential ratio of food intake for the two diet regimens. From 12 pm to 3 pm, eight fish were euthanized on ice, and organs were extracted and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. All organs were stored at –80°C until RNA isolation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA isolation, cDNA library generation, and sequencing</title><p>We isolated RNA from liver and brain using QIAGEN RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, #74106) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The processing order of each organ was randomized. The tissues were transferred to the 1.2 mL Collection Microtubes (QIAGEN, #19560) on dry ice in a 4°C cold room to reduce tissue thawing. Next, an autoclaved metal bead (QIAGEN, #69997) and 700 µL of QIAzol (QIAGEN, #79306) were added to each tube. Two rounds of tissue homogenization were performed on the TissueLyserII machine (QIAGEN, #85300) at 25 Hz, 5 min each, at room temperature. The lysate was transferred to new 1.5 mL tubes, 140 µL chloroform (Fisher Scientific, #C298-500) was added, and the tubes were vortexed for 15 s. After incubation at room temperature for 2–3 min, lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 15 min. The aqueous phase was mixed with 350 µL ethanol (200 Proof, Gold Shield Distributors, #412804) by inverting the tubes 10 times.

Briefly, 10 ng of RNA from each sample was incubated with 1 µL of 10× Reaction Buffer and 2 µL of CDS primer IIA in a 12.5 µL reaction, at 72°C, for 3 min. Next, each sample was mixed with 7.5 µL RT Master Mix (4 µL 5× Ultra Low First-Strand Buffer, 1 µL SMART-Seq v4 48 µM Oligonucleotide, 0.5 µL 40 U/µL RNAse inhibitor, and 2 µL SMARTScribe II Reverse Transcriptase), incubated at 42°C for 90 min and then 70°C for 10 min. To amplify the cDNA, each sample was mixed with 30 µL of PCR Master Mix (25 µL SeqAmp PCR Buffer, 1 µL PCR Primer II A, 3 µL nuclease-free water, and 1 µL SeqAmp DNA Polymerase) and PCR-amplified for a total of eight cycles. The amplified cDNA (a total of 30–50 µL) was purified using 54-90 µL Beckman Coulter AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, #A63880) following the manufacturer’s guideline, including two washes of 200 µL 80% ethanol (200 Proof, Gold Shield Distributors, #412804; diluted in nuclease-free water), and elution in 40 µL of nuclease-free water (Invitrogen, #10977023).

Each reaction was incubated at 55°C for 4 min and then cooled to 10°C. To stop the tagmentation reaction, 5 µL of NT buffer was added immediately and incubated with the reaction mixture at room temperature for 5 min. The Illumina Nextera XT Index Kit v2 (Illumina, #131-2001) was used for library indexing. The cDNA library was indexed and amplified for a total of 13 cycles in a PCR reaction that contained the 20 µL of tagmented DNA, 5 µL of i7 adaptor, 5 µL of i5 adaptor, and 15 µL NPM buffer.

The read alignment was performed using STAR v2.7.1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) with the default parameters. Out of 32 RNA-seq samples, 15 samples had &gt;90% of reads mapped to the genome; 10 samples, 80–90% reads mapped; and 7 samples, 75–80% mapped. Next, we used samtools v1.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2009</xref>) to remove the reads that map to multiple genomic regions, using the parameters of MAPQ &lt; 255 (‘samtools view -q255 -b’).

For the brain samples, one AL sample was located 3 standard deviations away from the rest of the samples in PC1. We thus excluded this sample from the PCA plots.</p><p>To identify the diet differentially expressed genes (diet DEGs) for the liver, we used the tissue-subsetted ‘dds’ object created above (‘design = ~Condition’) and extracted the DEGs between the AL (reference) and DR samples, separately for males and females, using the ‘contrast’ parameter of the ‘results’ function in DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata2">Figure 5—source data 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>).

A positive log2-transformed fold change (log2FC) occurs when the ratio of DR/AL is higher in males than in females; a negative log2FC occurs when the ratio of DR/AL is lower in males than in females. There were 12 significant diet–sex interaction genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata10">Figure 5—source data 10</xref>).

First, we removed the genes with an ‘NA’ value for the p.adjust in any dataset, and then we created a contingency table (for males and females separately) by counting the genes that satisfied the following categories: (1) group 1: genes differentially expressed by both sex and diet (i.e., sex DEGs with p.adjust&lt;0.05 and diet DEGs with p.adjust&lt;0.05); (2) group 2: genes differentially expressed only by sex (i.e., sex DEGs, p.adjust&lt;0.05) and not by diet (i.e., diet DEGs, p.adjust⪰0.05); (3) group 3: genes differentially expressed only by diet (i.e., diet DEGs, p.adjust&lt;0.05) and not by sex (i.e., sex DEGs, p.adjust⪰0.05); and (4) group 4: genes not differentially expressed by diet or sex (i.e., diet DEGs with p.adjust⪰0.05 and sex DEGs with p.adjust⪰0.05). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>, the enrichment was defined as the ratio of group 1 gene number over the number of diet DEGs (i.e., (group 1)/(group 1 + group 3)). Because the two sexes were analyzed separately in the DESeq2 analysis, two contingency tables were created: one for male diet DEGs and one for female diet DEGs. A two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate the statistical significance of the enrichment.</p><p>Non-diet DEG control gene sets (one for either sex) were generated to control for any bias in gene expression distribution and gene group size of the diet DEGs. To do so, for each diet DEG, we identified all the non-diet DEGs that were within 2% of the diet DEG’s average expression level (average across all samples). When the expression threshold was set at 1%, one diet DEG had no associated control gene; thus, an expression threshold of 2% was selected. These genes constituted the ‘non-diet DEG control group’ for a given diet DEG. Next, we randomly selected one gene from each non-diet DEG control group, for all 221 of the female diet DEGs and 70 for the male diet DEGs. These randomly selected genes comprised the control gene set, which had the same number of genes as the diet DEGs. To perform a boostrapped analysis, we generated 1000 control gene sets and tested each of them for sex DEG enrichment by a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. We plotted the median enrichment and the median p-value (Fisher’s exact test) of these 1000 iterations. All pie charts were plotted in R v4.1.0.

First, for a given gene list (male diet DEGs and female diet DEGs), we sorted all transcripts in descending order based on their ranked scores, which were calculated by multiplying the -log10(p-value) with log2FC. Genes without p-values reported from DESeq2 analysis were removed. Next, we identified the human ortholog name for each killifish gene via protein blast (best hit protein with BLASTp E-value&gt;1e-3). If multiple killifish paralogs were blasted to the same human gene, the average of the ranked scores was calculated and assigned to this human gene name. If no human ortholog was found, this killifish gene was removed from the gene list. Lastly, we ran the enrichment analysis via clusterProfiler v4.0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) and the Bioconductor annotation data package (org.Hs.eg.db v3.13.0) and GOstats package v2.58.0.

The resulting four gene lists were individually used for the hypergeometric test implemented in GOstats v2.58.0. For the sex DEGs identified in AL and those identified in DR, we separated these two sex DEG lists based on upregulation or downregulation in males. Each of the four gene lists was used for the hypergeometric test. The background genes (‘universe’) were defined as all of the genes with a non-NA value for p.adjust for a given comparison.

In contrast, lipid metabolism (e.g., ‘fatty acid biosynthetic process’) GO terms were enriched in the female diet DEGs downregulated in DR. For males, intracellular trafficking GO terms (e.g., ‘regulation of protein secretion’) were also significantly enriched in the diet DEGs upregulated in DR, but the enrichment score was lower than for females. Lipid metabolism GO terms were also enriched in the diet DEGs downregulated in DR in males, but both the enrichment score and the statistical significance were lower than for females. Thus, the specific upregulation of protein homeostasis pathways in female DR livers and the downregulation of lipid metabolism in female DR livers (to a greater extent than in males) are consistent with the GSEA results.</p><p>Lastly, GO analysis on the sex DEGs identified in AL showed that the genes more highly expressed in AL male livers were enriched in cellular amino acid catabolic processes and gluconeogenesis pathways. In contrast, genes more highly expressed in AL female livers were enriched in estrogen response, humoral immune response, and female sex differentiation. GO analysis on the sex DEG identified in DR showed that while most GO terms were similar to those for the AL sex DEGs, protein homeostasis pathway (e.g., ‘ER stress response’) was uniquely enriched in the genes more highly expressed in DR female livers. This observation is consistent with our results from GSEA and GO analysis on the diet DEGs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Heatmap</title><p>Heatmaps were generated using Pheatmap v1.012.

First, we calculated the mean and standard deviation (SD) across all the replicates (n = 4 for AL; n = 4 for DR) of the selected gene. Next, we scaled each normalized count value (x<sub>i</sub>) by z<sub>i</sub> = (x<sub>i</sub> - mean)/SD and used z<sub>i</sub> as the input for heatmaps.

After sexual maturity, fish were individually housed in 2.8 L tanks. For these experiments, fish were manually fed as previously described (‘feeder-naïve’) and consisted of males (n = 17) and females (n = 10) with age ranging from 36 days to 130 days post-hatching.

The tanks on the behavior rack received recirculating water from the system as did the home tanks.</p><p>Each experiment consisted of 17 trials conducted across three consecutive days, with 7 trials for the first 2 days and 3 trials on day 3. On day 0 (the day before the first trial), animals were placed in individual behavior tanks in the afternoon after receiving their afternoon manual feeding. Each automated feeder used for the behavioral assay had an additional red LED light that served as the conditioned stimulus and was installed adjacent to the feeding hole. This red LED light is programmed to turn on and off by the same Julia language-based command line interface that communicates with MQTT protocol that sends feeding commands to each feeder. We programmed the automatic feeders to initiate the first session of stimulus presentation and feeding on day 1 at 7 am. For the sessions on days 1–3, the feeders were programmed to run the sessions autonomously. On day 4, animals were removed from behavior tanks and placed in their home tanks, and normal feeding and care resumed.</p><p>Videos were recorded using an ESP32-CAM module from the anterior of the tank. The sequence of events recorded was as follows: (1) camera turned on, (2) on the 2nd second, the red LED light turned on, (3) on the 9th–11th second, the food arrived at the water surface, and (4) camera remained on during feeding and ended &gt;10 s after food dropping. In sum, animals were trained with a conditioned stimulus (red light) delivered 7 s before the unconditioned stimulus (food, 5 mg dropped at a time). Videos were analyzed by manual scoring and automated tracking. Out of the 27 fish tested in this assay, 11 fish were excluded due to technical issues (camera failed to record all 17 trials for 5 fish, and feeders failed to drop food for 6 fish). Three fish displayed eating behavior in fewer than three trials, and they often stayed at the bottom of the tanks and rarely moved. We considered that these fish potentially had underlying health issues, lacked motivation for food, and/or failed to adapt to the videotaping tanks. Thus, we excluded these animals from our analysis. Altogether, a total of 13 animals were analyzed (nine males and four females).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Automated analysis of the associative behavior assay using DeepLabCut</title><p>Automated tracking was performed by DeepLabCut 2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>), an open-source deep-learning tracking software, and the output data were analyzed using custom R and Julia scripts. Briefly, the DeepLabCut software was trained on representative annotated training video frames (20 frames/s; the given number of videos annotated was set by the default setting in DeepLabCut) using a transfer learning approach as follows: superficial layers of the neural network were updated while the core ResNet-50 layers were left untouched, resulting in relatively rapid training of the network. All killifish training videos were processed using this network. DeepLabCut results were exported as CSV files, providing the x- (side-to-side in tank) and y- (top-to-bottom in tank) coordinates and likelihood values for fish snouts, fish tails, the food drop site, and the red training light. Tracked videos varied slightly in length, but minimally were 18 s long (360 frames).</p><p>Several prefiltering steps were performed on these positional values as follows: (1) first, fish head likelihood values were selected if they passed the threshold of 0.999, meaning that the coordinates for the frames with likelihood values &lt;0.999 were set to ‘NA’ (leading to exclusion of 41,623 frames). (2) Second, of the selected coordinates, the Euclidean distance between the x,y positions from contiguous frames was calculated for all frames and for all videos. If the Euclidean distance between any two contiguous frames was in the top 5% of all distances calculated, this was considered an anomaly. The coordinates of the second frame of the two contiguous frames were set to ‘NA’ (after this step, 10,051 additional frames were filtered out). (3) Lastly, given that the previous filtering steps led to missing positional values in the data (‘NA’), the final processing step was interpolation. We performed interpolation using the na.spline function in the zoo R package (version 1.8–10). The na.spline function performs cubic spline interpolation, which involves finding low-degree polynomial curves that connect data points and results in smooth, continuous values and matching first and second derivatives where the polynomial curves meet. We did not perform any extrapolation, so some ‘NA’ values did remain where an unknown value was not preceded or followed by a known value, for example, in cases where there were long stretches of ‘NA’ in the beginning or the end of a video. The resulting data were used for velocity calculations and plotting of movement trajectories. All the unfiltered raw trajectory data can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata2">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>, and the filtered and interpolated trajectory data with kinematics calculations can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata3">Figure 6—source data 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Automated scoring and trajectory analysis</title><p>The prefiltered and interpolated coordinates were used to calculate the instantaneous velocity in the y-direction (up-down in the tank) for each frame. Rolling averages of the instantaneous velocities were calculated over 20 frames using the zoo package, and then the raw velocity of each frame was adjusted to the 20-frame rolling average. This adjustment allowed us to better visualize the regions of increased activity. We plotted the velocities as heatmaps. For the velocity heatmap, the top 7% and bottom 10% of velocities are set as the extremes on the heatmap color scale. We also used the coordinates to determine the Euclidean distance of the fish from the coordinates of where food drops for each frame. For each fish, the location of where food drops on the water surface was determined by taking the average of the highest likelihood food drop coordinates across all videos for that animal.</p><p>We calculated t<sub>1</sub> by (1) determining the beginning and end times of the ‘bursts’ of velocity activity (yellow regions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) for each animal in each trial and (2) determining the times during each trial when the fish was ‘arriving at the surface.’ We set the threshold for a high-velocity burst for each animal as approximately the top 25% of the velocity range and the threshold for arriving at the surface was defined as 100–150 pixels away from the food drop location (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata4">Figure 6—source data 4</xref>). The t<sub>1</sub> values were calculated by finding the closest velocity burst to a time of arrival at the surface and using the beginning time of the velocity burst as the t<sub>1</sub>. If the fish never arrived at the surface during a trial, the t<sub>1</sub> would be set to 18 s. If the fish began the trial at the surface, the t<sub>1</sub> would be set to 0 s. In three trials (out of 221 trials for all fish), the velocity thresholds were set slightly too high, and the velocity bursts were determined by inspecting the velocity heatmap manually (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata4">Figure 6—source data 4</xref> for details). Finally, we calculated the Pearson correlation between the automated t<sub>1</sub> values and the manual t<sub>1</sub> values using Prism v.9.3.1.</p><p>Fish x-y trajectories (in pixel space) were plotted using the fish head coordinates and were shown relative to the locations of food delivery (calculated as the average of all the high-likelihood locations) and the red light (calculated as the average of all the high-likelihood locations). The trajectory of the fish was colored by time, with the blue representing the fish location at 2 s and yellow, at 9 s. The trajectories from trials 4 and 17 for fish 3 were plotted. Plots were made using the ‘geom_path()’ function in R. All the data related to automatic quantification can be accessed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata4">Figure 6—source data 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Compass plot</title><p>A compass plot displays the angle of a velocity vector, showing the fish’s direction of movement between the initial position (when the light turns on at 2 s) and the final position (when the food drops at 9 s). The compass plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref> are the frequency distribution of the angular coordinates (see below) for all the velocity vectors that were annotated for all the fish in the first seven trials or annotated for all the fish in the last seven trials. To generate these plots, we first determined the initial position of the fish after the red light turned on (2 s) and the final position of the animal when the food was dropped (9 s). Next, we converted these positions from Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). Lastly, we converted the angular coordinate (θ) of the vector (from the initial position to the final position) from radians to degrees. The angular coordinates (θ) from the first seven trials (or the last seven trials) for all the fish were pooled and then binned to create a frequency distribution (bin size = 20°, histograms centered on the midpoint of each bin) that could then be plotted as a compass graph using the ‘coord_polar()’ function in R. Each ‘wedge’ on the compass plot represents a bin. The wedge is directed toward the angle (out of 360°) that corresponds to the midpoint of the bin, and has a radius that indicates the frequency of angles in the bin (larger radius indicating that more velocity vectors fallen into that bin). All the velocity-vector bins have the same origin. All plots were generated using ggplot2 in R. All data for input into the compass plots can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata5">Figure 6—source data 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Manual analysis of the associative behavior assay</title><p>For manual analysis, each video (one trial) was analyzed second-by-second, and three metrics were tracked for each second: (1) Did the midpoint of the fish have a positive y-axis displacement during this second? A score of ‘1’ was given if the y-axis displacement was greater than 0 (i.e., the fish moved toward the water surface); otherwise, a score of ‘0’ was given (i.e., the fish moved away from the water surface or stayed at the same water level). (2) Was the fish at the water surface? A score of ‘1’ was given if the fish’s snout was within ~0.5 cm of the water surface (the fish’s reflection was visible); otherwise, a score of ‘0’ was given. (3) Was the fish eating the food? If so, ‘eating’ was noted for this second.</p><p>For each fish, we graphed metric 1 and 2 scores against time, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We identified the first time at which the fish reached the water surface, and then we backtracked when the fish initiated a continuous trajectory toward the surface (i.e., identifying when the string of ‘1’ in the y-axis displacement plot began). This initiation time of the first surface-bound trajectory is defined as ‘t<sub>1</sub>.’ Sometimes, the fish would stop moving for ≥1 s during its ascent to the surface. In this case, we disregarded this first part of ascension and reported t<sub>1</sub> to be the initiation time of the second part of the ascent, during which the fish had a continuous upward trajectory and ultimately reached the surface. Our measurement in this scenario is likely conservative, and it is possible that the fish moved toward the water surface earlier than what we reported here.</p><p>To measure how robust our method is for determining t<sub>1</sub>, three researchers (EKC, JC, RCK) independently analyzed the same set of 17 videos from one fish. The results were consistent across all three researchers, with a Pearson correlation of &gt;0.95 for any pair-wise comparison, suggesting that this analysis method is robust against the subjective judgment of observers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Quantification of successful association</title><p>We defined a successful trial to be when the fish initiated its surface-bound trajectory (t<sub>1</sub>) before food drop. Thus, a successful trial would be the one with 2 ≤ t<sub>1</sub> ≤ 9, where ‘2’ corresponded to when the light turned on at 2 s, and ‘9’ corresponded to when the food arrived on the water surface at 9 s. We noted that there was some variability to when the food arrived (the food was set to dropped at 5 s, but there were network and mechanical delays), ranging from 9 to 11 s. Thus, the window of success (2–9 s) should be considered conservative.</p><p>To quantify successful association, we calculated the average t<sub>1</sub> for the first seven trials (‘early trials’) and the last seven trials (‘late trials’) for each fish. The average t<sub>1</sub> values for all the fish, or for young and old fish, were plotted as a dot plot overlaid on a box plot, where each fish was denoted as a unique symbol. In the automated quantification method, for two animals (fish 13 and 14), the t<sub>1</sub> of trial 7 was not calculated due to low-likelihood position values, and the average t<sub>1</sub> of the early trials was calculated using the first six trials.</p><p>In another metric to measure successful association, we calculated the number of successful t<sub>1</sub>, which fell in the range of 2–9 s (including 2 and 9) for the early and late trials, respectively, for each fish. The percentage of success was calculated as the number of successful t<sub>1</sub> divided by 7. The values of the average t<sub>1</sub>, as well as the percent success, for the early trials and the late trials for the same fish were considered as a matched pair for the two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-paired signed-rank test. All the graphs and statistics were performed in Prism v9.3.1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Learning index</title><p>We defined the ‘learning index’ as the inverse of the first trial number needed for an animal to achieve a given number of consecutive successes. This metric treats the trials as dependent on one another to reflect that the prior experiences of an animal can influence future performance. We took the inverse of this first trial number to make ‘faster association’ be a higher learning index value. As an example, for fish 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), its learning index corresponded to the first trial when two consecutive successful trials occurred. In this case, trial 4 was the first time when 2 ≤ t<sub>1</sub> ≤ 9 for two consecutive trials (both trials 4 and 5 were successful). Thus, the ‘learning index’ would be 1/4 (0.25). Most of the killifish (85%) can achieve two consecutive successes, while only 54 and 38% can achieve three or four consecutive successes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata6">Figure 6—source data 6</xref>, ‘learning index_3’ and ‘learning index_4’). Thus, the number of consecutive successful trials reveals the fish-to-fish variation in the association performance across trials, a useful metric for examining the behavior stability of individual fish.</p><p>Prism v.9.3.1 was used to generate all dot plots, scatterplots, and Pearson correlation calculation. All the data related to manual quantification can be accessed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata6">Figure 6—source data 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata7">Figure 6—source data 7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata8">Figure 6—source data 8</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Average velocities for young vs. old fish</title><p>To calculate the average velocities for each fish, we used the calculated 20-frame rolling average velocities for each frame (see details above). We set the top and bottom 15% of velocities for a given animal to one of two boundary values – the top 15% percentile velocity or the lowest 15% percentile, respectively. Thus, the values outside of the middle 70% were capped to the boundary values. This thresholding prevents the average values from being skewed by poor velocity estimation from the frames with low likelihood values. We used the average of all the 20-frame rolling average velocities across all the frames and all trials for a given animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Cohen’s d effect size calculation</title><p>We calculated the standardized mean difference (Cohen’s d = (mean x1 – mean x2) / standard deviation), cohen.d() and 95% confidence intervals in R.

for killifish that allows high precision control of feeding amount and schedule on a per-tank basis. The system is open-source, utilizing 3D-printed and off-the-shelf components and due to this emphasis on open software and hardware, the system can be built by individual research groups and the approach therefore appears highly scalable. The authors demonstrate the value of precise control of food intake by investigating sex-specific lifespan effects and associated transcriptome responses to DR in killifish. The resources described in this paper will be a major step in killifish husbandry and management to facilitate its use as a model of longevity studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69008.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04g9wch13</institution-id><institution>Yale-NUS College</institution></institution-wrap><country>Singapore</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04g9wch13</institution-id><institution>Yale-NUS College</institution></institution-wrap><country>Singapore</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Muthuru</surname><given-names>Ajay</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04g9wch13</institution-id><institution>Yale-NUS</institution></institution-wrap><country>Singapore</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.03.30.437790">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.30.437790v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

This is a great suggestion. To address this main point, we have now used the automated feeders to identify the molecular pathways associated with the sex-differences in the longevity response of males and females to DR. Specifically:</p><p>– We have now generated transcriptomic datasets for 2 key organs (liver and brain) from male and female killifish fed an ad libitum (AL) and DR regimen for 5 weeks, using the automated feeders (new Figure 5A). Analysis of these RNA-seq datasets showed that the liver (but not the brain) exhibited strong transcriptional sexual dimorphism already in the AL conditions, and that this sexual dimorphism was even further enhanced in the DR condition (new Figure 5B, new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-C).</p><p>– Interestingly, we find that DR leads to sexually dimorphic changes in the liver in genes and pathways involved in inflammation, lipid metabolism, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis (new Figure 5C, D, new Figure 5—figure supplement 1D). These sexspecific changes triggered by DR in the liver could underlie at least part of the different longevity response to DR in males and females and some of them are also observed in mammals. The identification of specific genes with strong sex-specificity in response to DR could extend to other species.</p><p>Intriguingly, we find that sexually dimorphic genes are enriched among the genes responding to DR (new Figure 5E, new Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). This enrichment points to an interesting relationship between sex and diet, with DR preferentially modulating sexually dimorphic genes.</p><p>Thus, sex-specific transcriptomic responses may contribute to the different lifespan response to DR in killifish (a differential that is also observed in other species). We believe that these new transcriptomic studies broaden the scope of our manuscript beyond the killifish, because they propose molecular pathways that are sexually dimorphic and particularly affected by DR which could apply to other species.</p><p>2) The Reviewers also had several methodological and technical comments that needed be addressed, particularly on behavioral analyses. To address these, we have bolstered our behavioral analysis by generating a new automated pipeline and benchmarking it on thorough manual analysis. Specifically, we have (1) generated a robust pipeline for unbiased quantification of positive association behaviors by measuring the fish velocity in successive trials (new Figure 6B-E, new Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B); (2) calculated different automated metrics of success for associative behavior and validated them by manual scoring (new Figure 6F-L, new Figure 6—figure supplement 1C-F); (3) better defined how we calculated a “learning index”; (4) plotted the learning index as a continuum of different ages and sexes, in addition to binning (Figure 6M); (5) performed power analyses to determine the optimal number of animal to use for well-powered behavior experiments. We have also addressed all remaining points by changes in the figures and/or text. Together, we believe that these new experiments and analyses have significantly enhanced our manuscript and broadened the scope of our study. We thank the Editorial team and the Reviewers for suggesting them.</p></body></sub-article></article>
