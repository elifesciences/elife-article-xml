fails to predict complications in humans, especially when the drug targets the immune system. Here, we show the unprecedented capability of two human Organs-on-Chips to evaluate the safety profile of T-cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) targeting tumor antigens. Although promising for cancer immunotherapy, TCBs are associated with an on-target, off-tumor risk due to low levels of expression of tumor antigens in healthy tissues. We leveraged in vivo target expression and toxicity data of TCBs targeting folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) to design and validate human immunocompetent Organs-on-Chips safety platforms. We discovered that the Lung-Chip and Intestine-Chip could reproduce and predict target-dependent TCB safety liabilities, based on sensitivity to key determinants thereof, such as target expression and antibody affinity. These novel tools broaden the research options available for mechanistic understandings of engineered therapeutic antibodies and assessing safety in tissues susceptible to adverse events.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>organs-on-chips</kwd><kwd>t-cell bispecifics</kwd><kwd>cancer immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>preclinical safety</kwd><kwd>alveolar biology</kwd><kwd>intestinal biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel human models of the lung and intestine are described and validated as preclinical in vitro tools for predictive profiling of T-cell-bispecific antibodies with expected on-target off-tumor risk.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer immunotherapy has received intense attention over the past two decades owing to the promise of delivering durable cures by harnessing the cytotoxic potential of the immune system against tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gong et al., 2018</xref>). However, although impressive improvement in long-term survival has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hodi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schadendorf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wolchok et al., 2017</xref>), only a fraction of patients responds. Furthermore, the systemic immunomodulation mediated by these drugs often elicits immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including skin and liver toxicity, colitis, and pneumonitis, limiting their broad clinical application in battling cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Champiat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Naidoo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kennedy and Salama, 2020</xref>).</p><p>T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies (TCBs) are a novel class of cancer immunotherapeutic agents that have the potential to improve on the clinical efficacy and safety of traditional immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clynes and Desjarlais, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Labrijn et al., 2019</xref>). TCBs exert their anti-tumor activity by simultaneously binding to a cancer surface antigen and the CD3 T-cell receptor, thereby both activating the latter and physically crosslinking it to target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacac et al., 2016a</xref>). This synthetic immunity approach is particularly favorable for targeting less immunogenic, neo-antigen-lacking tumors, as T cells can be recruited and activated independently of their T-cell receptor specificity. This strictly tumor-targeted immunomodulation is also expected to reduce the systemic inflammatory toxicities associated with traditional immunotherapies. The therapeutic potential of TCBs is exemplified by the large number of molecules targeting solid and blood tumors, which are currently in various stages of clinical evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishiguro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goebeler and Bargou, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although TCBs hold the promise for a safer therapeutic option, they are not risk free. The antigens targeted are rarely exclusive to the tumor, but are also often expressed, albeit at lower levels, in normal tissues, rendering TCBs subject to ‘on-target, off-tumor’ safety liabilities. This is particularly true for epithelial tumor antigens as they are frequently targeted in solid tumor indications. For example, a Bispecific T-cell Engager (BiTE) targeted to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) produced severe liver and kidney toxicities in non-human primates, in line with EGFR expression in these organs, and led to the termination of the animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lutterbuese et al., 2010</xref>). Clinical adverse events were reported in a recent Phase I study evaluating an epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-targeted BiTE as a therapy for a variety of epithelial carcinomas. Consistent with the expression of EpCAM in the gastrointestinal tract, the molecule triggered severe diarrhea and ultimately prevented escalation to efficacious doses and the identification of a therapeutic window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kebenko et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trabolsi et al., 2019</xref>). Reliable human TCB safety evaluations at the preclinical stage are therefore of vital importance to ensure that well-tolerated and efficacious therapeutics reach patients.</p><p>Traditional rodent-based preclinical models are often ill-suited for predicting some cancer immunotherapy-mediated adverse events in humans in part because of the fundamental differences in the immunological responses between the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjornson-Hooper et al., 2019</xref>). In the EpCAM example mentioned above, the severity of the diarrhea elicited by the treatment was not predicted by preclinical studies in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brischwein et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, an increasing number of TCBs target human-specific antigens that lack expression in animals, rendering preclinical animal studies uninformative for safety and efficacy assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bacac et al., 2016a</xref>). Indeed, the development of preclinical models that better translate to human immunity is regarded as one of the top current challenges of cancer immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hegde and Chen, 2020</xref>).</p><p>While human-relevant cell-based models of tissues and organs promise to bridge this gap, conventional in vitro two-dimensional (2D) models fail to provide the complexity required to model the biological mechanisms of immunotherapeutic effects. Furthermore, their reductive microenvironment, devoid of essential cellular, biochemical, and biophysical factors found in the native organ, precludes the expression of TCB targets at physiologically relevant levels and patterns, crucial for capturing TCB pharmacology and safety liabilities.</p><p>Organ-on-Chip models aim to overcome these limitations by combining micro-engineering with cultured primary human cells to recreate the complex multifactorial microenvironment and functions of native tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huh et al., 2010</xref>). The tissue microenvironment in vivo provides the external signals that help drive cellular differentiation toward mature phenotypes. Organs-on-Chips model key functional aspects of tissue-level physiology such as epithelial and microvascular tissue-tissue interfaces, and physiologically relevant mechanical forces, have been shown to more accurately capture in vivo-relevant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasendra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasendra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gayer and Basson, 2009</xref>). The enhanced tissue maturation promoted by Organs-on-Chips could help ensure organ-specific expression of TCB targets, while the modularity of these devices and the possibility for controlled circulation of molecules and immune cells could better capture the functional interactions between TCBs, immune cells, and target-expressing cells that occur in patients. Motivated by these advantages, we set out to evaluate Organs-on-Chips as platforms for the assessment of on-target, off-tumor TCB safety risks in human organs, using a panel of targeting and non-targeting molecules, and leveraging in vivo target expression and toxicity data. We found that these systems could reproduce and predict target-dependent TCB safety liabilities, showing sensitivity to key determinants thereof, such as target expression and antibody affinity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>As a starting point for our method development and validation, we used molecules under current preclinical development. We focused on a T-cell bispecific antibody generated to bring Folate Receptor 1 (FOLR1) expressing tumor cells in close proximity to CD3 expressing cytotoxic T-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geiger et al., 2020</xref>). FOLR1 is overexpressed in many solid, epithelial-derived tumors including ovarian, lung, and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scaranti et al., 2020</xref>), but is also expressed to a lower degree on normal epithelial cells as found in the lung and kidneys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parker et al., 2005</xref>). While a high-affinity FOLR1-TCB (FOLR1(Hi) TCB) was efficacious in human breast cancer patient-derived xenograft models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), severe on-target toxicity in the lung of cynomolgus monkey was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AMea, 2016</xref>). Clinical signs of severe respiratory inflammation appeared as early as 24 hr post-dosing, and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-2, and IL-8 were elevated in the blood of affected animals, and importantly coincided with an increase of inflammation markers. Histopathology assessment revealed leukocytic infiltrates in lung tissue indicative of immune-mediated toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Further immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>) indicated low relative expression (compared to high FOLR1 expression in the ovarian carcinoma cell line, HeLa) of the FOLR1 target antigen in lung alveolar epithelial cells of cynomolgus lung tissue suggesting an adverse event largely driven by on-target toxicity. Importantly, IHC analysis of FOLR1 expression in the human lung revealed similar levels and patterns of the antigen as in the cynomolgus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), extending the threat of safety liabilities to patients in the clinical setting. Bearing in mind the toxicological profile of FOLR1(Hi) TCB in cynomolgus and the expression of FOLR1 in both species lung tissue, we identified the lung as an at-risk organ in patients and accordingly set out to evaluate a human Alveolus Lung-Chip model as a platform for FOLR1(Hi) TCB toxicology assessment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FOLR1 expression in the alveolar epithelium of cynomolgus and humans underlies on-target off-tumor toxicities of FOLR1-TCB and can be recreated in a human alveolus lung-chip.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IHC of pre-clinical, cynomolgus lung tissue 24 hr after intravenous single-dose administration of high-affinity FOLR1-TCB (FOLR1(Hi), 10 µg/kg), demonstrating leukocytic infiltration (dark purple cells) and inflammation.

A mature Alveolus Lung-Chip model was obtained after 5 days of liquid–liquid culture (LLI) followed by establishment of an air–liquid–culture (ALI) for a further 5 days. To evaluate FOLR1 expression in chips, we combined RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses. FOLR1 gene expression was even over time as shown by quantification of RNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). We also confirmed FOLR1 protein expression in mature chips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Flow cytometry-mediated quantification allowed us to estimate the cell surface expression of FOLR1 within the Alveolus Lung-Chip at an average of ~10,000 molecules expressed per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). For comparison, the high FOLR1 expressing ovarian carcinoma HeLa cell line displayed an average of ~450,000 molecules per cell when cultured on chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), confirming the difference observed in IHC between healthy and tumor cells.</p><p>To render the device immunocompetent and capable of simulating on-target TCB-mediated immunomodulation, we added peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC) isolated from human whole blood to the epithelial channel in direct contact with the mature alveolar epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Introduction of T cells is required to engage the CD3 arm of FOLR1(Hi) TCB thereby allowing its mode of action. The sequence of events we aimed to reproduce in chips are the crosslinking of T cells to the FOLR1 expressing target cells mediated by the TCB, subsequent T-cell activation and cytolytic synapse formation resulting in cytotoxic granules release (granzymes and perforin) and consequent target cell apoptosis. Early T-cell cytokine release (TNFα, IFNγ) should be followed by later cytokine release from epithelial cells and monocytes (IL-6, IL1β, IL-8) combined with strong physical attachment of immune cells to the FOLR1-expressing lung epithelium via the TCB. Thus, we selected and optimized experimental readouts that would enable us to monitor these steps in the Alveolar Lung-Chip.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows representative brightfield and fluorescent images of the Alveolus Lung-Chip at 48 hr after the administration of immune cells.

Quantification of the immune cell presence in fixed chips confirmed increased attachment of both T cells and non CD3<sup>+</sup> cells to the target epithelium in the FOLR1(Hi) TCB condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), which is consistent with the TCB mode of action, whereby immune cells are crosslinked to target cells. Together, these data suggest that the Alveolus Lung-Chip successfully replicates aspects of the FOLR1 (Hi) TCB-mediated toxicity observed in cynomolgus, and suggests that the human lung would be subject to similar safety liabilities.</p><p>In light of the toxicity risk predicted above, and hoping to define a potential therapeutic window of FOLR1(Hi) TCB, we performed the same study with chips seeded with the high FOLR1 expressing ovarian carcinoma cell line, HeLa, previously used to assess drug efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Geiger et al., 2020</xref>). Although no effects were seen at the lowest concentration, all concentrations starting from 2 ng/mL induced significant T-cell activation (measured at 48 hr), cancer cell apoptosis (from 24 hr onwards) and strong cytokine release, as expected from the high level of FOLR1 expression in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we efficiently killed tumor cells at a much lower concentration than that needed to induce damage to the healthy alveolar epithelial cells. Of note, FOLR1(Hi) TCB EC50 was estimated at 1.1 pM, which was close to the value obtained from standard 2D in vitro killing experiments (2.2 pM).</p><p>Although the data described above suggested that a therapeutic window for FOLR1(Hi) TCB could be determined, we leveraged the chip to instead identify a safer molecule. In particular, we utilized an antibody with lower monovalent affinity for the FOLR1 target, referred to as FOLR1(Lo) TCB making use of avidity mediated selectivity gain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). As a result of that design, FOLR1(Lo) TCB presented a lower binding to FOLR1-expressing HeLa cells while retaining a potent killing activity in coculture assays and an in vivo tumor control efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). We profiled the two TCBs, FOLR1(Hi) and FOLR1 (Lo), in the immunocompetent Alveolus Lung-Chip following the workflow and readouts described above, and found that FOLR1(Hi) TCB induced a significant increase in all the readouts starting at the 0.2 μg/mL concentration whereas FOLR1(Lo) TCB showed a response only at the highest concentration of 20 μg/mL and to a much lower magnitude than the high-affinity molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results demonstrated that the cellular responses on the platform are sensitive to differences in antibody affinity and recapitulates the biology associated with the mode of action of TCBs. Following these in vitro observations, the lower affinity FOLR1 TCB was tested in a cynomolgus toxicology study and none of the animals experienced the lung inflammation observed with FOLR1(Hi) TCB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), confirming the safer profile predicted by the Alveolus Lung-Chip.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dose–response and TCB affinity-dependent effects displayed in immunocompetent Alveolus Lung-Chips.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry analysis of PBMC harvested from epithelial channel and assessed for CD69<sup>+</sup> activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (n=4 approx. 10,000 cells per chip).

In the transwell environment, quantification of TCB-dependent immune cell attachment and apoptosis did not show differences between the control and FOLR1 TCB treatment conditions. T-cell activation and T-cell-specific cytokines were elevated, possibly due to prolonged interactions of the immune cells with the epithelium and static media supply. Also, the transwell version did not capture differences between FOLR1 antibodies: FOLR1(Lo) TCB led to a higher amount of granzyme B and IFNγ release than the chips, which is inconsistent with the absence of toxicity observed in vivo. Given the higher concordance of the results produced by the Alveolar Lung-Chip compared with the transwell counterpart, we propose that the novel immunocompetent Alveolus Lung-Chip platform can faithfully evaluate TCB on-target, off-tumor risks and presents a superior value to the existing alternatives.</p><p>To demonstrate the broad applicability of the model for testing target-mediated TCB safety risks, we extended the methodology to a second target and a second Organ-Chip model. In this example, we focused on TCBs targeting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is overexpressed in a range of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hammarström, 1999</xref>). We have created TCBs binding to CEA with high or low affinity – CEA(Hi) and CEA(Lo) TCB, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and are currently evaluating them as therapies for a range of solid tumors. Indeed, we have found that CEA(Hi) and CEA(Lo) TCB are potent mediators of tumor cell lysis and T-cell activation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), and exhibit robust anti-tumor activity in humanized mice engrafted with CEA-expressing tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Aside from solid tumors, however, CEA is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benchimol et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 1993</xref>). Immunohistochemistry analysis of primary human intestinal samples confirmed high expression of CEA in the colon, whereas small intestinal expression was lower. In both tissues, CEA was enriched on the apical surface of the barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The substantial target presence in the gastrointestinal tract implicates this system as an at-risk organ, motivating us to assess potential intestinal toxicities triggered by CEA-engaging TCBs. Our antibodies recognize a human-specific epitope within the CEA protein,, making mice and cynomolgus preclinical toxicology models unsuitable for the assessment of toxicities caused by CEA-targeting TCBs. Indeed, our antibodies showed lack of cross-reactivity to cynomolgus monkey CEA, which underscores the need for human-relevant models in addressing this question (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Immunofluorescence analysis revealed robust expression of CEA in the Colon Intestine-Chip epithelium, whereas expression in the Duodenum Intestine-Chip appeared weaker and localized to the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Flow cytometry-mediated quantification verified the cell surface expression of CEA within the Intestine-Chip and confirmed the higher target abundance in the Colon-Chip compared with the Duodenum-chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), in line with the regional differences observed in vivo. Based on previous data suggesting that CEA-targeting TCBs trigger immune cell activation and cancer cell killing above a threshold of 10,000 CEA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bacac et al., 2016b</xref>), we expect to detect on-target TCB toxicity in the Intestine-Chip. To our surprise, colon and duodenum organoids cultured in the conventional 3D format featured target expression levels similar to those measured in the chips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Nonetheless, despite the similarity in target abundance, we believe that the Intestine-Chip is more suitable for the assessment of on-target TCB toxicities, given the more physiologically accurate CEA expression patterns compared with those observed in organoids. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed the familiar apical enrichment of CEA in the Colon-Chip (strong) and Duodenum-chip (weak) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>), whereas CEA appeared to be junctional and non-polarized in colon organoids. Indeed, the incorporation of microenvironmental cues, including flow and peristalsis, has shown to lead to enhanced maturation within the Intestine-Chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kasendra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasendra et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, immunohistochemistry analysis of a commercial 2D model comprising primary intestinal epithelial cells showed patchy CEA expression, which appeared weaker than that observed in the native colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Consistently, we estimated an average of about 2000 CEA surface binding sites per cell in this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>), which is dramatically lower than the expression recorded in the Colon Intestine-Chip.</p><p>Next, we evaluated the Intestine-Chip for its ability to capture the toxic effects CEA(Hi) and CEA(Lo) TCB, and expected differences therein, owing to differential binding affinity. We focused first on the Colon Intestine-Chip, bearing in mind the higher levels of target in the native organ and the chip model. To render the Intestine-Chips capable of simulating an immune response, we took an approach analogous to that of the Lung-Chip: PBMC and TCBs were introduced using the top fluidic channel of the Colon Intestine-Chip, affording direct contact with the epithelium and enabling engagement with the target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Epithelial cell death, immune cell attachment, and activation were monitored as readouts of on-target TCB safety liabilities. Unlike the Alveolus Lung-Chip, TCB treatment did not lead to increased epithelial cell killing. Nonetheless, we did observe significant changes in all of the other readouts of TCB-mediated toxicity. Both CEA(Hi) and CEA(Lo) TCB induced dose-dependent increase in PBMC attachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and activation, as evidenced by CD69 upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including granzyme B, IFNγ, and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). As expected, CEA(Hi) TCB triggered higher PBMC attachment, activation and cytokine release compared with CEA(Lo) TCB, confirming that the model is sensitive to differences in antibody affinity, which would be expected to translate into differential toxicity outcomes in the clinic. Importantly, we observed no activation upon treatment with an antibody that engages the CD3 receptor on T cells but cannot bind to CEA (NT TCB). Likewise, the CEA-targeting TCBs failed to induce activation of PBMC only, in the absence of target tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Together, these data confirm that the effects observed in the chips are target dependent and mode of action dependent, ruling out non-specific PBMC activation and cytokine release mediated by CD3 engagement only.</p><p>We then took advantage of the Duodenum Intestine-Chip, which faithfully mimics the lower CEA expression observed in the native small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>), to explore whether the system is sensitive to variations in target expression. Indeed, we observed differences in on-target toxicity governed by target abundance: CD69 expression and cytokine release induced by both TCBs were significantly attenuated in the Duodenum Intestine-Chip, in line with the lower target expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). The reduction was more extensive in the case of CEA(Lo) TCB, which induced minimal increase in CD69 expression and no cytokine release, relative to the non-targeting TCB. CEA(Hi) TCB induced PBMC activation and cytokine release which, while lower than those observed in the Colon Intestine-Chip, were significantly elevated compared with the non-targeting control, suggesting that the high-affinity molecule may pose safety risks even in tissues with low target expression as described for the high-affinity FOLR1 molecule in the lung.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we describe an Organs-on-Chips based approach for the assessment of TCB toxicity in the lung and the intestine. We demonstrate that the Alveolus Lung-Chip successfully recapitulated FOLR1 TCB-mediated lung toxicities observed in cynomolgus monkeys and instructed the design of a second-generation molecule, whose favorable lung safety profile predicted by the chip model was verified in vivo. The Intestine-Chip model captured the liabilities of a TCB targeting a human-specific antigen, thus filling the gap left by the lack of cross-reactivity in animals and suitable animal models overall. The model likewise displayed sensitivity to TCB affinity and predicted differential, target expression-dependent toxicity outcomes between different intestinal regions. Both models were able to shed light into the toxicity mechanisms of the molecules, clearly decoupling target-mediated effects from T cell activation through CD3 engagement only, which has been shown to be an additional mode of TCB-induced adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Segal et al., 1999</xref>). It is worth mentioning that both the Lung-Chip and the Intestine-Chip demonstrated an advantage over conventional models for this application: the Alveolus Lung-Chip was found to report more specific TCB-responses and provide additional important readouts compared with transwell-based approaches, whereas the Intestine-Chip supported more physiologically relevant target expression, compared with both 3D organoids and primary intestinal barrier grown in transwells.</p><p>Owing to the absence of predictive early-stage assays, ‘on-target, off-tumor’ TCB safety liabilities have in some cases been only detected either in late-stage preclinical models (non-human primates) or as life-threatening adverse events in the clinic. Advanced human cellular models that capture the immunopathology of TCB-induced adverse events would aid the iterative antibody design at the early stage, thus ensuring favorable safety profiles before entering clinical trials, reducing attrition rates, and ultimately expediting the application of these potentially life-saving therapies. Importantly, the mechanistic insights into on-target, off-tumor toxicities and design opportunities afforded by these platforms are not restricted to T-cell engagers like TCBs, but also apply to chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cell therapy, bearing in mind their similar modes of action. For instance, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) CART therapy, intended to treat a patient with colorectal cancer, led to lethal toxicity through off-tumor cardiopulmonary targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morgan et al., 2010</xref>). To improve its efficacy-safety profile, this therapy was affinity-tuned to detect tumor cells with a high density of surface antigens, while sparing normal cells with lower antigen expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). A mouse model expressing human Her2 was used to confirm the safer profile of the low-affinity CART (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castellarin et al., 2020</xref>). Using the Lung- and Intestine-Chips, we similarly identified a reduced risk of healthy tissue targeting with a low-affinity TCB for both the FOLR1 and CEA targets. However, in contrast to the humanized mouse models, these in vitro tools are fully human, applicable to various targets and faster to generate, making them a promising alternative for antibody/CART preclinical safety testing, format selection, and optimization.</p><p>Furthermore, the immune-competent Organs-Chips described here can bridge preclinical research to clinical application, by aiding the discovery of early predictive biomarkers of TCB/CART toxicity in patients, which would certainly help to anticipate and manage life-threatening adverse events. While no universally predictive markers of adverse events associated with these therapies are currently accepted and validated, the phenotypic outcomes observed in the chips closely match some of the few clinical indicators that have been proposed. For example, early elevation of specific serum cytokines, including IFN-γ and IL-6, was found to precede the development of severe cytokine release syndrome in response to CART therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Teachey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hay, 2018</xref>). The release of IFN-γ and IL-6 was consistently observed in both the Alveolus Lung and Colon Intestine-Chip upon treatment with high-affinity FOLR1 and CEA TCB, which led to on-target toxicity. The detection of such clinically relevant biomarkers exemplifies the translational value of our platform. Going forward, the system could be coupled with, for example, unbiased proteomic analyses of chip supernatants and transcriptomic dissection of the effector and target cell pools and used to uncover early novel predictors or TCB-mediated adverse events. It may also be of interest to other types of molecules such as super agonist CD28 antibodies, which induced a severe cytokine storm in the clinics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hünig, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Another attractive future development of our platform is its use to evaluate the therapeutic window of a therapy. We tested the same molecule in a healthy Lung-Chip versus a cancer-Chip and found a 1000-fold difference in the concentration of TCB required to kill target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As a next step, an all-in-one platform could combine a healthy population with a tumor one in the same chip as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hassell et al., 2017</xref>), thus capturing safety liabilities triggered by tumor lysis itself. Although efficacy–safety interactions are clinically relevant, these two aspects are often evaluated independently prior to phase I clinical studies, owing largely to the absence of fitting preclinical tools. We believe that using a chip comprising only healthy tissue is a reasonable safety evaluation approach in the case when the organ of concern is different from the cancer-affected organ. However, the tumor microenvironment and anti-tumor efficacy effects might influence the toxicity outcome when the target-expressing organ and the tumor co-localize, and should therefore be taken into account. For example, treating colorectal cancer with CEA-targeting TCBs may lead to an increased risk of intestinal toxicities, taking into consideration that tumor cell lysis may lead to the release of inflammatory cytokines and tumor antigens, thus further potentiating immune cell activation and cytotoxicity. The coupling of healthy and tumor biopsy-derived organoids with immunocompetent Organ-Chip technology may provide the ideal setup for a combined efficacy and safety assessment. Aside from safety questions, the presence of a relevant tumor compartment would open possibilities for tuning of compound pharmacology and efficacy testing. For example, a matrix layer below a tumor cell layer could be used to better recapitulate the immunosuppressive tumor environment via the introduction of regulatory T cells and tumor-associated macrophages or fibroblasts, taking it into account when designing therapies.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe novel human immunocompetent models of the lung and intestine and validate them as platforms for TCB safety profiling, outlining how these systems could reduce the reliance on animal-based safety assessments, enable educated antibody format selection, shed light into the mechanistic underpinnings of toxicities, and support the identification of clinical biomarkers. Going forward, the concepts we introduced here can be expanded to address the persisting gap in modeling immune-related toxicities, associated with, for example, immune checkpoint blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brahmer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramos-Casals et al., 2020</xref>). Considering their systemic and multifactorial immunopathology, modeling these processes accurately would likely require the incorporation of resident immune cells and lymphoid structures, as well as modalities that support the simulation of T-cell trafficking and tissue infiltration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Human Primary Alveolar Epithelial Cells</td><td>CellBiologics</td><td>Cat# H-6053</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Human Pulmonary Alveolar Epithelial Cells</td><td>Accegen</td><td>Cat# ABC-TC3770</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Human Lung Microvascular Endothelial Cells</td><td>Lonza</td><td>Cat# CC-2527</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Human Large Intestine Microvascular Endothelial Cells</td><td>Cell Systems</td><td>Cat# ACBRI 666</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HeLa</td><td>ATCC</td><td>Cat# CCL-2, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0030">CVCL_0030</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MKN45</td><td>DSMZ</td><td>Cat# ACC-409, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0434">CVCL_0434</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>Cat# CRL-11268, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1926">CVCL_1926</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>QIFIKIT</td><td>Agilent</td><td>Cat# K007811-8</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Cell Tracker green</td><td>ThermoFisher</td><td>Cat# C7025</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>NucView405 Caspase-3 Enzyme</td><td>Biotium</td><td>Cat# 10407</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>ProcartaPlex multiplex immunoassays</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat# PPX-12-MXNKRV6</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism</td><td>GraphPad</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Fiji</td><td/><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Construction of FOLR1- and CEA-targeted molecules</title><p>FOLR1 and CEA-targeted TCB molecules were generated in the 2+1 format (two target binding Fabs and one CD3 binding Fab).

Note that since a strand-specific library preparation was performed, the reads were strand-specifically counted. Using the gene hit counts and the corresponding gene lengths we calculated the FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million reads mapped) gene expression levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Live staining and imaging</title><p>For timepoints T = 24 and 48 hr after PBMC-TCB administration, effluents were collected for further analysis and pod inlets were aspirated.

Recombinant biotinylated monomeric Fc fusions of human and cynomolgus Folate Receptor 1 (FOLR1-Fc, produced in house) were directly coupled on a SA chip using the standard coupling instruction (Biacore, Cytiva). The immobilization level was about 200–300 RU. The anti-FOLR1 T-cell bispecifics were passed at a concentration range from 11.1 to 900 nM with a flow of 30 μL/min through the flow cells over 180 s. The dissociation was monitored for 240 or 600 s. The chip surface was regenerated after every cycle using a double injection of 30 s 10 mM glycine–HCl pH 1.5. Bulk refractive index differences were corrected for by subtracting the response obtained on reference flow cell immobilized with recombinant biotinylated murine IL2R Fc fusion (unrelated Fc fused receptor). The binding curves resulting from the bivalent binding of the T-cell bispecifics were approximated to a 1:1 Langmuir binding (even though it is a 1:2 binding) and fitted with that model to get an apparent KD representing the avidity of the bivalent binding.

Plotting the expected concentration of the standards against the mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) generated by each standard, the software generated the best curve fit and calculated the concentrations of the unknown samples (in pg/mL). The data were then exported in Excel and plotted in Graphpad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s4-35"><title>Statistics</title><p>Experiments were performed with at least triplicates for each chip sample per group. Brightfield images of chips were collected including at least three fields of view per chip at various points throughout the co-culture area of the Intestine-Chips. All graphs are plotted as group means (individual points displayed if n &lt; 10 samples per group) ± SEM. Statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) was determined via one-way or two-way ANOVA using Tukey’s multiple comparisons unless specified otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-36"><title>Immunohistochemistry human tissues</title><p>Immunohistochemical staining for CEA expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human intestinal tissues was carried out on a Discovery Ultra automated slide stainer using a rabbit anti-human monoclonal antibody for CEA (Clone T84.66, Roche Glycart AG, Switzerland) at 2.23 µg/mL after antigen retrieval with CC1 (Ventana Medical Systems Inc) on tissues. A secondary antibody was used a donkey anti-rabbit biotinylated polyclonal IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Lab, cat: 711-065-152) at 5 µg/mL, and DAB Map Kit (Ventana 760–124) was used as detection system.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Donald Ingber, Pablo Umaña, Alex Phipps, Thierry Lave, Amy Lambert, Wolfgang Richter, Elisabeth Husar, Ulrike Hopfer, and Lorna Ewart for useful scientific discussions; Nikolai Kaschau for his commitment and guidance on intellectual property; Antonio Varone, Ionnis Moriannis, David Conegliano, and Lian Leng for their contributions to developing the Alveolus Lung-Chip model; Magdalena Kasendra, Raymond Luc, and Athanasia Apostolou for their contributions to developing the Colon Intestine-Chip model; Robin Friedman, Alicia J Stark, Abhishek Shukla, and José Fernandez-Alcon for their contributions to image analysis; Gurpreet Brar for her contributions to flow-cytometry analysis; and Lorna Ewart for her critical review of the manuscript.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>Is a current employee of and hold equity interests or options to obtain equity interests in (Emulate Inc).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ping-Chih Ho as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Betty Diamond as Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Developing platforms for better evaluating actions and safety of immunotherapy is a critical task for translational application; however, this is largely hampered due to the differential expression of target proteins in mouse models and human subjects and the intrinsic differences in T cells from murine and human subjects.

It demonstrated that organ-chip system provides improved or otherwise not available human tumor models for immune-oncology studies particularly involving T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies. The key point that these organ chips captures on-target toxicities of such therapies better than other existing models is mostly well supported with few improvements.</p><p>In the current manuscript, the authors explored organ chips as a cancer immunotherapy research model to evaluate the safety of tumor antigen-targeting T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies. Using two independent human organ chip systems (lung and intestine), and tumor antigens (FOLR1 and CEA), the authors demonstrated that organ chips enabled toxicity evaluation of T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies (TCBs) that would otherwise not be possible in xenograft or non-human primate model systems. The manuscript also sought to compare the organ chip system to the other ex vivo model systems such as 2D transwell and 3D organoid cultures. The main conclusions of this paper are supported while some experiments need to be clarified, extended or discussed.</p><p>The comparison of average FOLR1 expression levels between alveolar chips and Hela cells might be misleading due to the difference in heterogeneity of the primary cells and cell line. As shown in Figure 1I and Figure S3A, only a subset of alveolar cells express FOLR1 while Hela cells uniformly express high levels of FOLR1. However, in Figure 1E healthy human lung IHC, FOLR1 expression seemed quite uniform along the alveoli. Can the authors provide an explanation for this difference between the chip and native tissues? Also, what's the molecular density of FOLR1 on the FOLR1+ chip cells? Is it still lower than Hela or at similar levels?</p><p>Analysis for the immune cells needs to be refined for the current study.</p><p>1. The flow cytometry analysis of the merely CD69+CD8<sup>+</sup>% is very limited to evaluate the true effects of these TCBs on seeded PBMCs. More analysis of the T cell populations should be presented to give the readers a more complete pictures of the T cell activation in the chips. For example, was the % of the total T/CD4/CD8 populations increased in PBMCs recovered from the chips treated with TCBs? Or was merely the activation status alternated.</p><p>2. It's hard to tell in Figure 2A this type of imaging analysis whether the Casp3/7+ cells are epithelial cells or PBMCs. An orthogonal approach to evaluate the actual killing (live versus dead cells) of epithelial cells upon TCB treatment is highly recommended to support the conclusion.</p><p>3. Are the PBMC attached to the epithelium T cells? A co-staining with CD3 can be very helpful.</p><p>The authors made a solid point that toxicity against FOLR1+ alveolar epithelial cells could be lowered by using a FOLR1(LO) TCB. What the authors haven't shown as the CEA case is whether this low affinity antibody still possesses sufficient in vivo tumor control efficacy?</p><p>4. As the PBMCs introduced in the &quot;chip&quot; haven't been exposed to the tumor micro-environment the authors should tempered down their conclusions. Therefore, the authors should either expose the immune cells/PBMCs into the tumor condition media or introduce tumor cells into the chip or dedicate a paragraph in the Discussion section in order to provide more clarity of how their conclusions may or not differ in the presence of the TME. In addition, the level of T cell activation/exhaustion will be different in the presence of the TME. It would be interesting to examine the effect of the TMB across T cells with different activation status (naïve, activated/effector, exhausted etc). All the above should be discussed in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>5. The authors should provide all the in vitro evidence on how they validated the control (non-tumor targeted) TCBs.</p><p>6. The authors described that a 48h incubation time is sufficient to capture changes in the cytokine secretion profile. Indeed, their data do support this finding. Is this the optimal time point and would this time point be optional for all TCBs or conventional bivalent antibodies? Have the authors performed a time course experiment? The reason because several discrepancies have been described in the literature where a super-agonist CD28 antibody in cynomolgus monkeys failed to predict cytokine release syndrome (CRS) at 24 and 48h, and its subsequent catastrophic effect in healthy individuals. Others, have shown that after CD28 super-agonist administration in cynomolgus monkeys, cytokines were detected at earlier times points (5h) could detect cytokines production. The authors should discuss how these findings may affect their conclusions/thinking process.

In cynomolgus studies, FOLR1(Hi) pulmonary toxicity was observed at 10 µg/kg single i.v. injection within 24 hours after injection and the Cmax at that dose was calculated to be 0.34 µg/mL. We observed that FOLR1(Hi) showed toxicity in the Alveolus Lung-chip starting from 0.2 µg/mL and 24h time point whereas it took 20 µg/mL for the FOLR1(Lo) antibody to induce alveolar epithelial cell killing. The 0.2 µg/mL concentration is very close to the 0.33 µg/mL measured as an in vivo blood concentration in the preclinical cynomolgus study but should however be taken with a lot of caution since we do not know the antibody concentration reached in the local pulmonary alveolar region upon treatment in animals and in humans.</p><p>For the anti-tumor activity of the antibodies, several in vitro tumor cell lines experiments and in vivo mouse experiments have been performed for both targets.</p><p>For FOLR1 (Hi) TCB, we compared the EC50 obtained with standard in vitro killing experiments (as presented in Figure 1- supplement figure 1F) to the EC50 obtained with chip experiments (such as the one presented in Figure 2- supplement figure 2). The EC50 in standard 2D HeLa assay was 2.2 pM whereas the EC50 in chips was estimated at 1.1 pM, overall in a similar dose range. To provide that information to the reader, we added a sentence (lines 197-198) stating “Of note, FOLR1(Hi) TCB EC50 was estimated at 1.1 pM which was close to the value obtained from standard 2D in vitro killing experiments (2.2 pM).” Despite a lower toxicity towards healthy alveolar epithelial cells, FOLR1(Lo) TCB could still efficiently kill HeLa cells due to the high amount of accessible FOLR1 molecules at their cell surface. Indeed the calculated EC50 in standard 2D HeLa killing assays was 1.3 pM, so very close to FOLR1(Hi) TCB EC50 values.</p><p>EC50 were not calculated from mouse experiments due to the fact that this wide range of doses is not commonly run for these bispecific molecules. We did however perform mouse efficacy studies comparing both FOLR1(Hi) and (Lo) TCBs in a HeLa transfer model in humanized PBMC engrafted NOG mice. We represented tumor weights at termination of animals for all treatment conditions. FOLR1(Lo) TCB was administered at two different doses, 0.5 mg/kg once a week and 2.5 mg/kg once a week. At both doses, the reduction in tumor weight was significantly lower than the vehicle control group and comparable to the one obtained with FOLR1(Hi) TCB, corroborating the hypothesis that the lower affinity variant retained efficacy against high FOLR1 expressing tumor cells despite a lower toxicity pulmonary risk. Thanks to our reviewer’s comment, we added the in vivo data mentioned above in the revised manuscript as an additional reference in Figure 1- supplement figure 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the in vitro killing of tumor cells, whether this platform can recapitulate the suppressive feature increased in response to the presence of Tregs or MDSCs? Is it possible to introduce this suppressive immune subsets for examining the action of bispecific antibodies?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the platform could be used for that purpose as it is technically possible to add either circulating Tregs in the bottom/top channel or resident myeloid-derived suppressor cells embedded in the matrix below the pulmonary or intestinal epithelium. Of note, Tregs present in the PBMC introduced in the apical channel of HeLa chips (Figure 2- supplement figure 2) did not prevent the killing of target cells by T cells in presence of FOLR1(Hi) TCB although it may have reduced or delayed it.</p><p>Given that the primary goal of our manuscript is to demonstrate the utility of the platform for safety assessment of on-target off-tumor crossreactivity of T cell engagers, we however feel that investigating these highly relevant questions lie more within the scope of a manuscript directed towards the tailoring of the platform for efficacy questions. Therefore we hope our reviewer respects that we did not run additional experiments but instead mention this possibility in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The comparison of average FOLR1 expression levels between alveolar chips and Hela cells might be misleading due to the difference in heterogeneity of the primary cells and cell line.

It was chosen on purpose, in order to allow the reader to identify the positive staining, which is not easily appreciated because of the very thin structure of alveolar epithelial cells. Other areas of the same sample and other human lung samples also showed areas with less abundant or less uniform staining (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>; two representative pictures obtained in a healthy human lung tissue where this variation of staining is clearer).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67106-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We also observed the difference in expression in the HeLa cells prepared for IHC. Indeed, as visible in Figure 1D, some regions are less positive than others for FOLR1 staining (right area of the selected picture). That difference may be due to upregulation of the <italic>FOLR1</italic> gene in response to cellular growth or in response to folate levels (Doucette and Stevens, 2001; Sabharanjak and Mayor, 2014).To complement the IHC approach, the molecular density of FOLR1 on the alveolus chip cells was evaluated with the QIFIKIT method which is intended for the quantitative determination of cell surface antigens by flow cytometry using indirect immunofluorescence assay. Given the mode of action of T cell bispecifics tested in the study, accessible surface FOLR1 is the fraction of the receptor expected to drive any toxicity or efficacy. QIFIKIT consists of a series of 6 bead populations coated with different, but well-defined quantities of a mouse monoclonal antibody. The beads mimic cells labeled with a specific primary mouse monoclonal antibody. The results we obtained are presented in Figure 1J for alveolar cells and in Figure 2-supplement figure 2 for HeLa cells comparison. The two sentences lines 132-137 state that finding “Flow cytometry-mediated quantification allowed us to estimate the cell surface expression of FOLR1 within the Alveolus Lung-Chip at an average of ~10,000 molecules expressed per cell (Figure 1J). For comparison, the high FOLR1 expressing ovarian carcinoma HeLa cell line displayed an average of ~450 000 molecules per cell when cultured on chip (Figure 2-supplement figure 2), confirming the difference observed in IHC between healthy and tumor cells.” The calculation shows the average amount of FOLR1 binding sites per cell in the analyzed population. Because it is a mean value, it does not illustrate the heterogeneity of the epithelium observed by immunofluorescence. Therefore we added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, a representative graph of the QIFIKIT flow cytometry panel which shows that the FOLR1 cell surface staining by FACS does not identify two populations (one FOLR1lo and one FOLR1hi) but rather a continuum of cells in a similar log detection scale (blue population). For comparison we added HeLa cells dot plots as positive controls (pink population). Indeed, we found that HeLa cells expressed a lot more surface FOLR1 than any highly expressing FOLR1+ primary alveolar epithelial cell measured across the different donors tested on chips.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67106-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Analysis for the immune cells needs to be refined for the current study.</p><p>1.

For that purpose we either used the fluorescent CellTracker signal for the alveolus lung chip or performed an anti-CD45 additional staining for the intestine chip. For both lung and intestine chips, we updated the methods section with a more detailed description of the image analysis workflow applied to precisely quantify apoptotic epithelial cells and attached PBMC (see line 687 and line 955).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Are the PBMC attached to the epithelium T cells? A co-staining with CD3 can be very helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer that question we performed an additional immunostaining of the chips with an anti-CD3 antibody as suggested. We then quantified the amount of T cells attached to the epithelium and percentage of T cells among CellTracker positive attached PBMC. Based on these results, we conclude that a higher amount of T cells attached to the epithelium in presence of FOLR1(Hi) TCB but that population was not representing a higher proportion of PBMC in comparison to the control conditions. This finding suggests that non CD3 positive immune cells (such as monocytes) also attach to the epithelium probably as a consequence of their own activation as reflected by the nature of cytokines released. These results have been added to figure 2F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors made a solid point that toxicity against FOLR1+ alveolar epithelial cells could be lowered by using a FOLR1(LO) TCB.

Interestingly, the lower affinity variant of FOLR1 TCB was similarly efficacious despite a reduced toxicity risk. We explained this finding by the high expression of FOLR1 by HeLa cells which is sufficient for FOLR1(Lo) TCB to be as efficient as the higher affinity variant (also seen in vitro with calculated EC50 of 1.3pM and 2.2pM respectively). On the other hand, a low expression of FOLR1 on alveolar epithelial cells was not sufficient for FOLR1(Lo) TCB to elicit killing at low doses like FOLR1(Hi) TCB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

While we believe that using naive PBMCs for safety evaluation is a reasonable approach in the case when the organ of concern is different from the cancer-affected organ, we fully agree that TME effects and anti-tumor efficacy effects should be taken into account when the target-expressing organ and the tumor co-localize. For example, treating colorectal cancer with CEA-targeting TCBs may lead to an increased risk of intestinal toxicities, bearing in mind that tumor cell lysis may lead to the release of inflammatory cytokines and tumor antigens, thus further potentiating immune cell activation and cytotoxicity.</p><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and performed an experiment wherein PBMCs were exposed to the CEA-expressing SNU1544 colon adenocarcinoma cell line, which leads to tumor cell lysis and cytokine release in the presence of CEA(Hi) TCB. Following 24 h exposure, the tumor cell-primed PBMC were introduced into the Colon Intestine-Chip along with CEA(Hi) TCB and the safety effects evaluated by monitoring cytokine release. Surprisingly, we observed no significant difference in the levels of cytokines released by naive PBMCs and those pre-exposed to tumor cells in the presence of TCB (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). We would refrain from drawing strong conclusions based on these data, however, owing to several important experimental caveats. First, the system comprised a cancer cell line in 2D culture, which is a far cry from the tumor microenvironment. Second, based on the TCB mode of action, the most extensively activated T cells would be those physically crosslinked to the tumor cells during the pre-incubation step, which in turn might prevent their efficient harvesting and transfer to the Intestine-Chip. In other words, the most potent T cells might be left behind. Owing to these limitations, we decided to not include these data in the revised manuscript, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, for the reviewers only.</p><p>We have now included a paragraph in the Discussion section addressing the reviewers points. Specifically, we have communicated that the presence of a tumor in the organ with safety liabilities adds complexity to the question. We believe that aspects of this situation could be captured in vitro by introducing a tumor-like compartment within the device, via, for example, tumor organoids.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67106-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The authors described that a 48h incubation time is sufficient to capture changes in the cytokine secretion profile. Indeed, their data do support this finding. Is this the optimal time point and would this time point be optional for all TCBs or conventional bivalent antibodies? Have the authors performed a time course experiment?

Interestingly the platform is fully compatible with sequential sampling of the outlet channels and further cytokines detection and we took advantage of that feature for the lung alveolus-chip experiment for instance. We would like to precise that although 48h was sufficient to detect toxicities with the lung alveolus-chip, we needed 72h for the colon-chip to detect the maximum overall cytokine release upon TCB treatment (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Also we observed that certain cytokines that are released earlier in the cascade, for instance TNFɑ, were better captured at 24h than 48h (see heatmap on Figure 3D).</p><p>Regarding the testing of a CD28 super-agonist in the described platform we have not tested it. Although the technology may be biologically relevant to CD28 biology, our manuscript focused on off-tumor on-target liabilities of T cell engagers that today cannot be easily recapitulated in simpler assays. Tegenero effects have been recapitulated (at least to some extent) in high density PBMC culture assays for instance (Hünig T. Nat Rev Immunol. 2012 Apr 10;12(5):317-8.) and may not require a Organ-on-chips platform for its biology. We however think the platform could be of interest to the field and therefore mention it in our discussion (line 420) as an additional class of molecules to be tested similarly to CAR-T cells and checkpoint inhibitors.</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67106-resp-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
