requisite plasma membrane curvature is thought to be solely driven by the retroviral Gag protein. Here, we reveal that the cellular I-BAR protein IRSp53 is required for the progression of HIV-1 membrane curvature to complete particle assembly. siRNA-mediated knockdown of IRSp53 gene expression induces a decrease in viral particle production and a viral bud arrest at half completion. Single-molecule localization microscopy at the cell plasma membrane shows a preferential localization of IRSp53 around HIV-1 Gag assembly sites. In addition, we observe the presence of IRSp53 in purified HIV-1 particles. Finally, HIV-1 Gag protein preferentially localizes to curved membranes induced by IRSp53 I-BAR domain on giant unilamellar vesicles. Overall, our data reveal a strong interplay between IRSp53 I-BAR and Gag at membranes during virus assembly. This highlights IRSp53 as a crucial host factor in HIV-1 membrane curvature and its requirement for full HIV-1 particle assembly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>viruses</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd><kwd>single molecule localisation microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003323</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le Sida et les Hépatites Virales</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ECTZ88374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Muriaux</surname><given-names>Delphine M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR10-INBS-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bassereau</surname><given-names>Patricia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The formation of HIV-1 particles requires a bending of the membrane that cannot be achieved by the Gag protein alone and thus there is need for the I-BAR protein IRSp53 to aid in the formation of HIV-1 buds.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell plasma membrane is a dynamic structure, where crucial processes such as endocytosis and exocytosis take place through local membrane deformations. Several pathogens, such as bacteria and enveloped viruses, interplay with the plasma membrane in the course of their replication cycle. Pathogens often enter the cells by endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grove and Marsh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gruenberg and van der Goot, 2006</xref>) and exit by membrane vesiculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rheinemann and Sundquist, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Welsch et al., 2007</xref>), which are processes linked to the generation of plasma membrane curvature; either inward or outward. HIV-1 is an enveloped positive-strand RNA virus belonging to the family <italic>Retroviridae</italic>, and it is known to assemble and bud outward from the host cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coffin et al., 1997</xref>). The structural Gag polyprotein of HIV-1, by itself, is responsible for particle assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gheysen et al., 1989</xref>), and it can oligomerize at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane forming virus-like particles (VLPs). The force required to bend the membrane to achieve VLP formation has been proposed to be provided by Gag self-assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hurley et al., 2010</xref>). The self-assembly of Gag has also been recently shown to segregate specific lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Favard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yandrapalli et al., 2016</xref>) and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sengupta et al., 2019</xref>), generating plasma membrane domains that could favor budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Foret, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lipowsky, 1993</xref>). However, only a small proportion of Gag-initiated clusters reach the fully assembled state leading to VLP release in living CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Floderer et al., 2018</xref>), while a majority of these clusters lead to aborted events. Therefore, the mechanism by which the virus overcomes the energy barrier associated with the formation of the full viral bud remains an open question. Recently, a coarse-grained model of HIV assembly has shown that the self-assembly of Gag might not be sufficient to overcome this energy barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pak et al., 2017</xref>), leaving the assembly in intermediate states. This supports the fact that other factors may be necessary to assist Gag self-assembly during the generation of new VLPs.</p><p>Plasma membrane curvature can also be generated by diverse host cell proteins. For example, I-BAR domain proteins sense and induce negative membrane curvature at the nanometer scale (a few tens to one hundred nanometers), that is, in the HIV-1 particle diameter size range, while generating outward micrometer-scale membrane protrusions such as membrane ruffles, lamellipodia, and filopodia. IRSp53 was first discovered as a substrate phosphorylated downstream of the insulin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yeh et al., 1996</xref>). It is also the founding member of the membrane curving I-BAR domain protein family, whose other mammalian members are MIM (missing-in-metastasis), ABBA (actin-bundling protein with BAIAP2 homology), PinkBAR (planar intestinal and kidney-specific BAR domain protein), and IRTKS (insulin receptor tyrosine kinase substrate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). The latter, IRTKS, displays functional redundancy with IRSp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Millard et al., 2007</xref>) in being able to curve membranes. In addition to interactions with the plasma membrane, IRSp53 binds both Rac1 through its N-terminal I-BAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miki et al., 2000</xref>) and Cdc42 directly through its unconventional CRIB domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krugmann et al., 2001</xref>), and also downstream effectors of these GTPases such as WAVE2, Mena, Eps8, and mDia can bind IRSp53 through the SH3 domain. Thus, IRSp53 functions as a scaffold protein for the Rac1/Cdc42 cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scita et al., 2008</xref>). IRSp53 was reported to exhibit a closed inactive conformation that opens synergistically upon binding to Rac1/Cdc42 and effector proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Disanza et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kast et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miki and Takenawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suetsugu et al., 2006</xref>). Regulation of IRSp53 activity was recently shown to occur through its phosphorylation and interaction with 14-3-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kast and Dominguez, 2019</xref>). Structurally, the I-BAR domain of IRSp53 is composed of a rigid six alpha-helix bundle dimer that is <italic>crescent</italic>-shaped. Due to its concave membrane-binding surface and lipid interactions, IRSp53 is able to generate negative membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). While capable of forming homo-dimers, IRSp53 is also able to recruit and form hetero-dimers with other proteins to form clusters for the initiation of membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Disanza et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Since the Rac1/IRSp53/Wave2/Arp2/3 signaling pathway is involved in the release of HIV-1 particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that IRSp53 may be a prime candidate for membrane remodeling required during viral bud formation. Hence, we investigated the possible role of IRSp53 and its membrane curvature generating activity in HIV-1 Gag assembly and particle budding. Importantly, we discovered that IRSp53 is present in an intracellular complex with HIV-1 Gag at the cell membrane, incorporated in Gag-VLPs and it is associated with purified HIV-1 particles, supporting IRSp53’s function in HIV-1 assembly as a facilitator of optimal HIV-1 particle formation through its membrane-bending activity. Thus, we identified IRSp53 as an essential non-redundant novel factor in HIV-1 replication, and demonstrated that it is critical for efficient HIV-1 membrane curvature and full assembly at the cell plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IRSp53 knockdown decreases HIV-1 Gag particle release by arresting its assembly at the cell plasma membrane</title><p>We report here that the partial knockdown of IRSp53 expression reduces HIV-1 particle release in host Jurkat T cells and in the model cell line HEK293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>), similar to our previously reported results in primary T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). Cells were treated with siRNA targeting IRSp53 or IRTKS (validated by extinction of the transfected ectopic IRSp53-GFP or IRTKS-GFP proteins – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>, respectively). In Jurkat T cells, we expressed the viral Gag proteins in the context of HIV-1(ΔEnv) in order to only monitor the late steps of the viral life cycle. Partial IRSp53 gene expression knockdown (resulting in a maximum of 50% protein depletion) reduced particle release threefold as compared to the control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, bottom), and a sixfold reduction was determined when taking into account the percentage of protein depletion. This reduction in HIV-1 particle release is highly significant (<italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.00265, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, and ANOVA statistical test for multiple comparisons indicate <italic>p</italic> value = 0.0089) since the gene editing of IRSp53 cannot be complete, nor edited by CRISPR/Cas9 knockout, without being toxic for the cells. To compare the role of different I-BAR domain proteins from the same family, we also measured the effect of siRNA targeting IRSp53 and IRTKS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) on HIV-1 Gag VLP production in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>, see graph <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, and immunoblots <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>). IRTKS shares similar protein domain organization and high sequence homology with IRSp53 (40% amino acid sequence identity and 59% sequence similarity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement2</xref>), and displays some functional redundancy with IRSp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 2017</xref>). IRTKS can also induce plasma membrane curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saarikangas et al., 2009</xref>). Partial knockdown of IRSp53 (~50% protein depletion) resulted in a two- to threefold decrease in HIV-1 Gag particle production (<italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.000487, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>). In contrast, knockdown of IRTKS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e</xref>) did not have any significant effect on HIV Gag particle release (<italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.0924, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test), thus precluding the possibility of redundant functions between IRSp53 and IRTKS in the context of HIV-1 Gag particle formation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Partial knockdown of IRSp53 decreases HIV-1 Gag particle release by arresting assembly at the cell plasma membrane.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) siRNA knockdown of IRSp53 expression in Jurkat T lymphocytes leads to a significant decrease in pNL4-3ΔEnv Gag particle release (see graph and immunoblots for IRSp53, <italic>p</italic> = 0.00265, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test, and loading controls beneath the graph).

While the control cells exhibited the normal phenotype of Gag-VLP budding from the cell plasma membrane, the IRSp53 knockdown cells displayed a series of viral buds arrested in assembly decorating the cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These results revealed an arrest in Gag assembly at the membrane and thus the involvement of IRSp53 in the assembly process. Since IRSp53 is an I-BAR protein involved in cell membrane curvature, we measured the curvature exhibited by HIV-1 buds in IRSp53 knockdown cells. While control cells displayed a range of HIV-1 Gag particles at different stages of assembly and budding, the cells knocked down for IRSp53 instead displayed arrested buds at an early assembly stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). By measuring the dimensions of these arrested buds, we found that buds from cells knocked down for IRSp53 displayed a narrower range of curvature height (48 ± 22 nm), as compared to the control (85 ± 53 nm) (<italic>n</italic> = 145 buds from 14 different cells, <italic>p</italic> value = 1.053 × 10<sup>−28</sup>, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), while the bud widths presented no difference between siIRSp53 (135 ± 64 nm) and the control (140 ± 87 nm) (<italic>n</italic> = 145 buds from 14 different cells, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.0609, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The control cells thus exhibited a range of heights and widths consistent with the range of buds seen at the membrane of these cells. The result indicates that in the absence of IRSp53, the viral buds were unable to progress beyond a certain curvature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HIV-1 Gag expression in cells increases IRSp53 membrane binding and allows their complexation</title><p>Since both Gag and IRSp53 target the cell plasma membrane upon interaction with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Favard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mattila et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prévost et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saarikangas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sengupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yandrapalli et al., 2016</xref>), we then tested if Gag and IRSp53 could associate directly or indirectly using immuno-precipitation (IP) assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Our results showed that IP of endogenous IRSp53 resulted in co-precipitation of Gag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, lane 1), as compared to the controls (lanes 2–4). Unfortunately, we could not assess the amount of IRSp53 pulled down by the antibody between conditions because the IgG signal masked the endogenous IRSp53 signal. To overcome this issue, we performed an IP/co-IP experiment of ectopic IRSp53-GFP/HIV-1 Gag proteins with an anti-GFP antibody, and confirmed the pull-down of IRSp53-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, lanes 2 and 3) and the co-precipitation of Gag (lane 3) while nothing was detected in the controls (lanes 1 and 4). Input and flowthrough were in accordance with the results, showing less IRSp53-GFP in the flowthrough (lane 3). We then concluded that HIV-1 Gag and endogenous IRSp53, or ectopic IRSp53-GFP, were components of the same intracellular complex, interacting directly or indirectly through other factors or membrane domains. IRSp53 is a cellular protein that switches from the cytosol to the cell plasma membrane for inducing membrane ruffles upon activation by Rac1 and its effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miki and Takenawa, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suetsugu et al., 2006</xref>). We have previously shown that Gag cellular expression triggers Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>), on which IRSp53 membrane localization and function are dependent. Thus, here, we compared the relative membrane binding of IRSp53 upon cellular expression of HIV-1 Gag using membrane flotation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). In the absence of Gag (‘HEK293T control' cells), one could observe the presence of IRSp53 both in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, fractions 6–8, labeled with the ribosomal S6 biomarker) and in the cell membranes fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, fractions 1–3, labeled with the membrane Lamp2 biomarker). The lysosomal membrane protein Lamp2 and the cytosolic ribosomal protein S6 were used as controls to validate the correct separation of the membrane and cytosolic fractions. Thus, at equilibrium, 19 ± 8% of IRSp53 was bound to the cell membranes (Graph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The same experiment was repeated with cells expressing HIV-1 Gag, where 66 ± 9% of Gag was bound to the cell membranes (Graph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Notably, we observed a twofold increase with 44 ± 5% of IRSp53 bound to the cell membranes upon HIV-1 Gag expression (Graph <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) (<italic>n</italic> = 5 independent experiments, <italic>p</italic> value = 0.000129, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test), while none with IRTKS. This effect was comparable with the one of Tsg101, a protein of the ESCRT-I complex known to interact mainly with the p6 domain of Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garrus et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pornillos et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">von Schwedler et al., 2003</xref>) and partially with the NC domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">El Meshri et al., 2018</xref>). The cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery has been involved in the mechanism of vesicular budding of intracellular multi-vesicular bodies and also hijacked by the HIV-1 Gag protein for viral particle budding.

These results are consistent with the siRNA data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>. In order to quantify these observations, we performed coordinate-based colocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malkusch et al., 2012</xref>) (CBC) analysis of HIV-1 Gag and IRSp53 (or IRTKS) in close proximity of HIV-1 assembly sites. We first isolated the assembly sites by segmentation and retrieved their center positions. We then kept all HIV-1 Gag located within a distance of 80 nm from this center (70–80% of all cluster sizes measured by DBSCAN are found within this distance) and all the IRSp53 (or IRTKS) found in a distance of 150 nm from this center (~twofold the assembly site size, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref> for details on the process workflow). We chose this IRSp53 (or IRTKS) cutoff distance to minimize the contribution of cross-colocalization between different HIV-1 Gag clusters. In contrast to classical colocalization analysis, CBC takes into account the spatial distribution of biomolecules to avoid excessive colocalization due to local densities of single molecules and provides a colocalization value for each single-molecule localization. This CBC value ranges from −1 to +1, where −1 corresponds to anti-correlation, 0 indicating non-correlation, and +1 corresponds to perfect correlation between the two molecules. Since CBC values are calculated for each localization, we plotted the CBC values as frequency distributions for all localizations of IRSp53/Gag and IRTKS/Gag. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> (for <italic>n</italic> = 4 HEK293T cells) or in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref> (for <italic>n</italic> = 5 Jurkat T cells), the CBC distribution for IRSp53/Gag has a higher proportion of values exhibiting high colocalization (27% in HEK293T cells or 26% in Jurkat T cells of CBC &gt; 0.5) in comparison to IRTKS/Gag values (14% for both cell types, <italic>n</italic> = 5 for HEK293T and Jurkat T cells of CBC &gt; 0.5) which instead show a very high proportion (close to 75%) of anti-correlation (CBC &lt; 0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,h</xref>). This comparison directly shows that IRSp53 displays stronger single-molecule colocalization with Gag in assembling clusters than IRTKS does.</p><p>Although CBC values give a quantitative value of the colocalization, it does not provide direct information on the average positions of IRTKS or IRSp53 molecules with respect to Gag molecules within the assembling clusters. Moreover, as for all the colocalization methods used to analyze molecule proximities, the CBC method is a strongly parameterize method, the results of which can depend on the parameter values (total distance of search for colocalization, number of searching circles…). Thus, to gain more insight into these colocalization quantification, we performed simulations to generate different patterns of PALM/STORM localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and analyzed them with the same set of parameters (total distance and distance steps) that the one we used for the experimental data. Since IRSp53 and IRTKS are membrane curvature sensors and since we observed that a lack of IRSp53 stops the assembling bud at half completion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), we hypothesis that they will be located around the ongoing assembly site. We therefore simulated an annulus of IRSp53 or IRTKS STORM localizations with different waists located at increasing distances from the center of Gag clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Numerically generated images were then analyzed identically to our experimental images (see 'Materials and methods' for details) and CBC distributions were generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Experimental and simulated cumulative distribution functions of the CBC values were compared by performing a root mean square error (RMSE) quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1, g,h,i,j</xref>). The lowest RMSE value was considered as the best similarity between the two distributions. This comparison indicated that IRSp53 localization, on average, displays a restricted pattern around and in the assembly sites. This corresponds to a circular ring surrounding the assembly site at 80 nm from the center of the Gag budding sites with a width of 80 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,e</xref>). On the other hand, IRTKS was present as a large diffuse pattern located at 140 nm from the Gag assembly site center with a width of 200 nm, explaining why fewer IRTKS molecules were detected in the assembly sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d,f</xref>). Interestingly, the maps of the RMSE values show that, on average, the surrounding belt center (independently of its waist) is located nearer to the HIV-1 Gag assembly center in the case of IRSp53 as compared to that of IRTKS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1g,h,i,j</xref>). Our results thus show that IRSp53 indeed specifically localizes at HIV-1 Gag assembly sites at the cell plasma membrane, whereas IRTKS poorly does.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Numerical simulations confirm preferential IRSp53 localization around HIV-1 Gag budding sites.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the different configurations used in the numerical simulation mimicking belts of given waists (w) of IRSp53 or IRTKS localizations (red) surrounding an HIV-1Gag(i)mEos2 assembly site (green) at a given distance ( d).

The STORM belt size ranged from a waist of 20 nm (width 40 nm) to a waist of 100 nm (width 200 nm), with distances from center of the simulated viral bud (PALM disk) to the center of the surrounding belt ranging from 0 nm to 160 nm for each waist size.

The number of photons emitted by each simulated position was randomly distributed according to a Gaussian distribution centered to a value equivalent to the maxima of the distribution of the one experimentally observed, this in order to obtain a localization precision equivalent to the experimental ones (see Fig S5 for the experimental localization precision). Each set of simulated images was then analyzed using the ThunderSTORM plugin of Fiji with the same parameter as the one used for experimental data.

The IRSp53-I-BAR-GFP construct only contains the membrane curving I-BAR domain of IRSp53. PH-PLCδ-GFP, a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding protein, was used as a control, because it binds PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> but does not generate membrane curvature. Fluorescent VLPs were purified from these transfected cells, then visualized for two colors (green: GFP and red: mCherry), and then a Mander’s coefficient was calculated as an indicator of incorporation of the ectopic (green) GFP-tagged proteins within the (red) Gag-mCherry VLPs and vice-versa (see Materials and Methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>). We found a high correlation (Mander’s coefficient = 0.95–1) between IRSp53-GFP and Gag-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, left graph, red column), indicating that almost all Gag-mCherry VLPs contained IRSp53-GFP, while the reverse (green column) was not true, indicating that all the IRSp53-GFP-labelled vesicles produced by the cells were not all positive for Gag. When using the IRSp53-I-BAR domain alone, we also obtained a high Mander’s coefficient, that is, ~0.8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In contrast, for IRTKS-GFP, the Mander’s coefficient was 0.4–0.5, indicating no significant correlation between IRTKS-GFP and Gag-mCherry. This indicates that even if a domain (PH-PLCδ) or another I-BAR protein (IRTKS) can recognize PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the cell membrane, it is not sufficient for incorporation into Gag-VLPs.

In vitro, on GUVs, we showed that the IRSp53 I-BAR domain enhances Gag membrane binding locally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>), in agreement with cell membrane flotation assays also showing an increase of IRSp53 membrane retention upon Gag expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, IRSp53 was found at, or in close vicinity to Gag assembly platforms at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), and is incorporated into Gag-VLPs and in HIV-1 virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Importantly, we revealed that the partial knockdown of IRSp53 gene expression arrested Gag assembly at the mid-bud formation stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and that Gag preferentially localizes at the tube tips induced by IRSp53 I-BAR domain, interfering with its long tubule formation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Altogether, IRSp53 appears instrumental in membrane curvature upon HIV-1 budding and is locally subverted as an essential factor needed for full HIV-1 Gag particle assembly.</p><p>Using GUVs, we observed that Gag not only colocalizes with IRSp53 I-BAR domain on vesicles, but that the IRSp53-I-BAR domain increases Gag binding to these model membranes, mimicking the possible local Gag/IRSp53 interplay at the assembly site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Indeed, BAR domain proteins, in general, and IRSp53 in particular, are known to induce strong PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saarikangas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>), PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was shown to play a role in Gag binding to the cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ono et al., 2004</xref>), as well as PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is strongly clustered during virus assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Favard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ono et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yandrapalli et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that the membrane binding of Gag on IRSp53-enriched membrane domains could promote the plasma membrane binding of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is in agreement with super-resolution imaging in cells, where Gag/IRSp53 interactions may take place at the Gag assembly sites as IRSp53 was localized in close proximity to Gag assembly sites in both HEK293T cells and CD4 Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our experiments suggest that Gag and IRSp53 are associated in a common complex at the cell plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Given that upon Gag expression, IRSp53 increases its binding to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), this suggests that Gag could activate IRSp53 through Rac1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>) or perhaps by releasing its auto-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kast et al., 2014</xref>). However, these explanations remain to be tested.</p><p>HIV-1 particles are known to incorporate a large number of cellular proteins, many of which are directly involved in virus budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammarstedt and Garoff, 2004</xref>). Here, we showed that IRSp53 is incorporated in Gag-VLPs, as well as in purified HIV-1 virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which most likely depends on the I-BAR domain of IRSp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Using the IRSp53-I-BAR domain on GUVs, we induced membrane protrusions that have a negative mean curvature similar to a viral bud; Gag was found particularly at the tube tips that have a half-sphere geometry similar to a viral bud (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). This indicates that Gag binds preferentially to IRSp53 I-BAR-curved membranes in vitro in contrast to other almost-flat areas of the GUVs. Similarly, in cells, single-molecule localisation images reveal some Gag clusters enriched at IRSp53 labeled protrusions at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). IRSp53 clusters have already been reported prior to filopodia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Disanza et al., 2013</xref>) and in negatively curved area at the onset of endocytic buds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sathe et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, it was shown that inducing local membrane curvature helps to initiate Gag lattice formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pak et al., 2017</xref>). We thus propose that IRSp53 induces local membrane curvature, most likely upon activation through Rac1/Cdc42 and effectors, which in turn can promote local Gag recruitment and initiation of the viral assembly (knowing that expression of Gag can activate Rac1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). This appears to be independent of the cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Although the presence of RNA can facilitate the growth of the Gag network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Floderer et al., 2018</xref>), favoring membrane bending due to the intrinsic curvature of assembling Gag hexamers, coarse-grained simulations of HIV-1 Gag assembly showed that, above a certain threshold, this Gag self-assembly is unable to overcome the free energy penalty required to curve the membrane. Here, we observed that siRNA knockdown of IRSp53 gene expression induces a decrease in viral particle production and arrests the assembly at half completion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Since IRSp53 stabilizes curvature by scaffolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prévost et al., 2015</xref>), another role of IRSp53 could be to lower this free energy barrier involved in the progression of the budding process beyond the half-sphere geometry by stabilizing long enough the bud curvature. This stabilization could be achieved either directly by organizing linearly around the assembly site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jarin et al., 2019</xref>) and mechanically constricting the nascent bud, or indirectly with the help of actin polymerization. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ku et al., 2013</xref> also observed that 60% of assembling particles exhibit a pause around the midway mark of the assembly process. This pause can provide a temporal window for IRSp53 to intervene in the progression of HIV-1 particle assembly as we propose here.</p><p>Finally, ESCRT recruitment occurs at the end of virus assembly, after the membrane has been curved, forming a vesicle ready to bud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bleck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). Overexpression of a mutant of the ESCRT protein Tsg101 was previously shown to block HIV-1 budding at a late stage, arresting the budding with a characteristic bulb-shaped phenotype indicative of a defect in the late stage of the bud scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goila-Gaur et al., 2003</xref>), in contrast with our observations with the IRSp53 siRNA phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Consequently, this suggests that Gag-IRSp53 association is ESCRT independent (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and occurs at an earlier stage of virus assembly.</p><p>Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mercenne et al., 2015</xref>) showed that angiomotin, which acts as an adaptor protein for HIV-1 Gag and the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4L, functions in HIV-1 assembly prior to ESCRT-I recruitment. Interestingly, angiomotin also contains a BAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moleirinho et al., 2014</xref>), but it is canonically involved in inducing <italic>positive</italic> curvature, as opposed to the <italic>negative</italic> curvature induced by I-BAR IRSp53. Thus, it is possible that angiomotin functions in another way, for example, at the viral bud neck which has both positive and negative curvatures by facilitating ESCRT recruitment.</p><p>IRSp53 itself is a scaffold protein for cofactors of cortical actin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>) and we have previously shown that a Rac1 signaling pathway, including IRSp53, is involved in HIV-1 particle production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it is possible that IRSp53 could also play a role in generating local cortical actin density in the vicinity of the viral bud in formation. The role of cortical actin associated with IRSp53 scaffolding in that context remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Our work illustrates a novel role for the host cellular I-BAR factor IRSp53, which is subverted by the retroviral Gag protein, in HIV-1-induced membrane curvature and in favoring the formation of the fully assembled viral particle.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>A rabbit polyclonal anti-IRSp53 antibody (Merck Millipore), a rabbit polyclonal anti-IRTKS (Bethyl), a mouse monoclonal anti-CA (NIH AIDS Reagent Program), a rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (Invitrogen), a mouse monoclonal anti-human CD63 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a mouse monoclonal anti-human CD81 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a rabbit monoclonal anti-human TSG101 (Abcam), and a rabbit polyclonal anti-human ALIX (Covalab) and secondary anti-rabbit Atto647N antibody (Sigma) were used in this study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The plasmid expressing HIV-1 codon-optimized Gag (pGag(myc), named pGag), the plasmid expressing Pol and Env-deleted HIV-1 (named pNL4.3ΔPolΔEnv was a gift of E.Freed, HIVDRP, NIH, USA) encoding Gag alone with its packageable viral RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>) and the plasmid expressing full wild-type HIV-1 (named pNL4.3) were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Favard et al., 2019</xref>).

During post-processing, a density filter was applied first to eliminate the background noise by identifying and discarding ‘isolated’ localizations, with a threshold of a minimum of five neighbors in a 50 nm radius for a molecule to be considered ‘not isolated.’ In the next step, molecules that converged to the same position were identified as duplicates and removed, keeping the localization with the smallest uncertainty as the valid coordinate. Furthermore, molecules reappearing with one ‘off-frame’ within 20 nm were merged into one single localization, with the first one appearing considered as the valid localization. Following these steps of post-processing, the sample drift was corrected by the drift correction module using fiducial markers described above. Each acquisition had at least two fiducial markers in the field of illumination. The resulting list of localizations was then used to reconstructing the respective PALM and STORM images and for the CBC analyses using the ThunderSTORM module. The module DBSCAN of the super-resolution quantification software SR Tesseler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levet et al., 2015</xref>) was used to analyse the PALM localizations for quantification of Gag cluster sizes. In order to monitor the localization of I-BAR proteins in the vicinity of Gag assembling particles, the Gag particles were segmented by thresholding using Fiji, to generate a binary mask of the PALM images. The centers of each Gag assembling cluster were then determined and a custom MATLAB (Mathworks) code was used to extract localizations in a radius of 80 nm around each Gag cluster center and to extract I-BAR proteins localizations belonging to a disk of 150 nm radius around the center of each Gag clusters (see Results section). These subsets of coordinates were then used to calculate the experimental CBC, with the algorithm developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malkusch et al., 2012</xref> and implemented in the ThunderSTORM plugin of Fiji (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The CBC values are calculated from single-molecule localization data of two species (Gag and IBAR proteins [IRSp53 or IRTKS]). A CBC value is assigned to each single localization of each species. We analyzed the distributions of these CBC values by plotting and comparing the distribution histograms of the CBCs obtained in the two conditions (IRSp53 vs. IRTKS).</p><p>We also performed a set of numerical simulations of super resolution images in Fiji. For this, we generated images by randomly choosing a molecule position within a radius of 60 nm from the cluster center for Gag [a compromise between the values found in the EM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) and those obtained by DBSCAN analysis in the SMLM experimental images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>)].

Each localization was then randomly assigned a brightness such that the final pointing precision obtained at the end of the process for the Gag localization was equivalent to the experimental one. We then convolved each of these positions by a Gaussian 2D PSF, to generate a diffraction-limited image in which random noise was introduced using the ‘add noise’ function of Fiji. Super-resolution images of these simulated localizations were then reconstructed using the ThunderSTORM plugin of Fiji with the same parameters as the one used in the experimental data reconstruction. Finally, once the data set of localizations for both numerically simulated Gag clusters and associated surrounding I-BAR proteins were obtained, they were analyzed with the CBC function of ThunderSTORM with the same parameters as in the experimental analysis (analyzing all the neighbor positions within 10 successive radii of 20 nm each to estimate the CBC). Each localization was attributed CBC values and we compared the experimental cumulative distribution functions of CBC values to the simulated cumulative distribution functions using RMSE measurements, in order to establish the most probable configuration of I-BAR belts around the ongoing Gag assembly site.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Preparation and imaging of fluorescent VLPs</title><p>After 24 hr seeding, 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> HEK293T cells were transfected with 8 µg of I-BAR-GFP expressing plasmid with or without 8 µg of pGag/pGag(i)mCherry plasmids (2/3 and 1/3, respectively).

The background intensity of the AX488 channel was obtained by manually drawing a line with a width of 10 pixels perpendicularly across the membrane of a GUV. We then obtained the background intensity profile of the line where the <italic>x</italic>-axis of the profile is the length of the line and the <italic>y</italic>-axis is the averaged pixel intensity along the width of the line. The background intensity was obtained by calculating the mean value of the sum of the first 10 intensity values and the last 10 intensity values of the background intensity profile. To obtain Gag fluorescence intensity on the membrane of the GUV, we used membrane fluorescence signals to find the contour of the GUV (using the ‘Fit Circle’ function in Fiji). Then, a 10 pixel wide band centered on the contour of the GUV was used to obtain the Gag intensity profile of the band where the <italic>x</italic>-axis of the profile is the length of the band and the <italic>y</italic>-axis is the averaged pixel intensity along the width of the band.

Along these lines, is this Ig G band the band seen in Figure S4a between the 55 and 70 kDa marker bands? What is the mature MW of IRSp53? Is it 53 kDa or higher? If 53 kDa, then IRSp53-GFP should be around 80 kDa (53+27) and not &gt;100 kDa as in the IP in S4A. Could the authors discuss about this?</p><p>– Overexpression of IRSp53-GFP does not lead to more Gag being pulled down (lanes 3 and 4 in S4a). Is the GFP-tagged form of IRSp53 functional (at least in respect to Gag binding)? Could the authors elaborate a bit more on this?</p><p>– Figure 2c: To asses if the increased binding of IRSp53 to membranes in the presence of Gag is specific for this IBAR protein, a control where the membrane bound pool of another IBAR protein (e.g. IRTKS) should be included.</p><p>– This is possible obvious for people in the field, but I missed at understanding why relatively low concentration (0.05 uM) of IRSp53 IBAR induces invagination into GUVs but 10x larger concentration does not seem to deform those GUVs (Figure 5). Could the authors clarify this please?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Gag and IRSp53 complexing is shown in an immunoprecipitation assay (Figure 2a). However, the quantification of membrane fraction enrichment of IRSp53 upon Gag expression in the membrane floatation assay the presented data is not convincing. Inamdar and colleagues claim a 2-fold increase of IRSp53 in the membrane fraction. Still, based on the dataset shown in Figure 2c, the findings don't seem to match the minor differences observed in the respective bands in the gel image. In the presented data set, the membrane fractions of Gag and IRSp53 do not appear in the same lane (Lane 1). I, therefore, suggest that the authors provide a more detailed description of their analysis method and the full data set to convincingly confirm the difference in membrane-bound IRSp53 upon Gag-expression compared to control cells, and the amount of membrane-bound Gag relative to its cytosolic counterpart. If the previously reported results hold, cross-validate them using a different methodology, for instance, by measuring the colocalisation of IRSp53 and Gag with the plasma membrane using microscopy. If the new calculations do not match the results previously reported, the authors should adjust their conclusions accordingly.</p><p>2. Dual-color SMLM is used to elucidate the IPSp53/IRTKS organisation patterns at Gag clusters sites by PALM/dSTORM imaging. Inamdar and colleagues quantify the Gag cluster size distribution and show that IPSp53 shows a considerable colocalized fraction, while IRTKS tends toward an anticorrelated distribution. In the next step, the authors try to deduce the spatial organisation of IPSp53 and IRTKS around Gag clusters based on simulated datasets of Gag and IPSp53/IRTKS CBC distribution geometries.</p><p>While dual-color SMLM is the right approach, the study presented here will benefit from a consistent and comprehensive description of the experimental details (see also Mn7) and the simulation. I propose adding a schematic of the geometric simulation parameters shown in Figure S8a in Figure 3. Also, it should be highlighted in Figure 3e and 3f that the simulated distributions presented are based on different waist diameters.</p><p>A second point that should be addressed is the lack of a quantitative measure of how well the experimental results are described by the simulated data. Also, the authors should comment on the effects of the choice of the radius in the data filtering (as shown in Figure S7) and over parameterization.</p><p>3. In the controlled in-vitro environment of GUVs, the authors show that Gag membrane recruitment is enhanced in the presence of the IRSp53 I-Bar domain and preferentially locates to the areas of high curvature in I-Bar domain induced membrane tubes. While I fully support the conclusions drawn from this elegant experiment, a complete description of the GUV preparation and imaging methods is missing. Also, from the methods section and the captions in Figure 5 and S11, it is unclear which membrane label was used in the experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It would have been better to incorporate Jurkat CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell data into the main figures to highlight the biological relevance of the findings.</p><p>Additional recommendations to strengthen the manuscript:</p><p>1) The role and expression levels of IRSp53 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells should be described and/or shown, as these are the relevant target cells for HIV-1 infection.</p><p>2) It is recommended that &quot;gene extinction&quot; in lines 105 and 107 be revised to &quot;protein depletion&quot; or &quot;reduced gene expression&quot; or something similar, as siRNA do not affect the gene but rather gene expression.</p><p>3) Figure 1e (both schematic and graph data points) is nearly impossible to see as it is small and very faint. It is recommended that darker colors and thicker lines and symbols be used, similar to other figures in the manuscript.</p><p>4) The order of the supplemental figures should be in chronological order from when they are referenced in the text, which is not the case in this manuscript. And all parts of each figure should be described in the text (e.g. Figure S1a).</p><p>5) It is suggested that the reference of GUVs on page 7 be removed. Otherwise, a description of what they are and the significance of the finding described here should be included.</p><p>6) Likewise, description of Gag(i)mEos2 is referred on page 8 but it is not clear why this construct was used. Presumably this was to show that the Gag used in the imaging studies behaved similarly to wild-type Gag, but this is not clear.</p><p>7) On lines 192-4, it is stated, &quot;We evidenced that cellular Gag expression, most probably by triggering Rac1 activation (Thomas et al., 2015), favors cell membrane binding of IRSp53.&quot; As Rac1 was not evaluated here, it is suggested that the sentence be modified to, &quot;We observed that cellular Gag expression, possibly by triggering Rac1 activation (Thomas et al., 2015), favors cell membrane binding of IRSp53.&quot;</p><p>8) The manuscript overall would benefit from strong editing for grammar, punctuation, and better word usage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67321.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>We all agreed that this paper provides novel and important new data that will merit, after revision, publication in eLife.

One can see that indeed only 2 siRNA were effective in extinguishing IRSp53 gene: one from Invitrogen on endogenous IRSp53 and ectopic IRSp53-GFP and one from Dharmacon that was only effective on ectopic IRSp53-GFP, as revealed by Western Blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Furthermore, the specificity of the siRNA was challenge by testing siRNA IRSp53 on human IRSp53-GFP and on mouse I-BAR-GFP in HEK293T transfected cells and visualized by fluorescence microscopy. Results show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref> that only siIRSp53 is able to extinguished human IRSp53-GFP and not mouse I-BAR-GFP. SiIRTKS and siCtrl are not extinguishing any of these genes. Overall these results confirm the specificity of IRSp53 siRNA-mediated knockdowns.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Specificity of siRNA-mediated knockdowns.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blots of HEK293T cells lysates probed with anti-IRSp53 antibody (and house-keeping gene GAPDH) showing a series of different siRNA IRSp53 (and siRNA Control, CTRL from Invitrogen, Dharmacon or Σ) on endogenous and ectopic IRp53 genes in human HEK293T cells and their efficacy in specifically down regulating IRSp53.

We observed that, upon co-transfection of pGag+pIRSp53-GFP+siRNA IRSp53 (lane 2), about 50% of the ectopic IRSp53-GFP was extinguished (since this construct is not siRNA resistant), leaving 50% of this ectopic protein expressed in the cells. In this context, one can observe that Gag-VLP release is ~50% (lane 2), similar to the condition pGag+siCTRL (lane 3). When we compare this to pGag+siIRSp53 (lane 4) which is reduced by 2-3 fold (data from Figure 1b of the manuscript), we can say that the remaining IRSp53-GFP in the Lane 2 seems to rescue the defect caused by extinction of the endogenous IRSp53. In the condition pGag+pIRSp53-GFP +siCTRL, VLP-Gag release was slightly reduced. This is an atypical rescue experiment since we do not have an IRSp53-GFP that is resistant to the siRNA IRSp53 used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>), but it suggests that if IRSp53-GFP is overexpressed in the presence of Gag and the siRNA IRSp53, VLP-Gag release is at a normal 50% level in contrast to the absence of IRSp53-GFP (compare lane 2 with lane 4). Unfortunately, due to limited time and by the siRNA IRSp53 out of stock, and the delay in supply, we could only provide one experiment. We thus decided to show it for answering the reviewers but not as part of a figure in the final manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Rescue of siRNA IRSp53 knock-down with overexpression of IRSp53-GFP.</title><p>293T cell were transfected with pGag, pIRSp53 and siRNA control (siCTRL, lane 1) or siRNA IRSp53 (lane 2); cell lysat and VLP wre loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblots were revealed with anti-GFP (for IRSp53-GFP) and anti-CAp24 (for HIV-1 Gag).

But we have not done the extensive super-resolution microscopy on infected primary T cells because this would require time overconsuming study. We are currently proceeding in setting up condition with an infectious HIV-1 virus carrying mEOS2 photoactivable protein for being able to infect primary T cells and go on for further research using infectious relevant system and super-resolution microscopy, but it is not ready for this current manuscript as it would require months of extra work and experiments.</p><p>Although, we agree with the reviewer #3 that the localization of Gag in Jurkat T cells and in primary CD4 T cells is different at the cellular level, but at the nanoscopic level of the budding sites, chances are that it would be similar (to be checked in further studies).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Better description and quantitative comparison of simulated and experimental SMLM data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point in the manuscript by</p><p>i) describing in detail the method used to record, extract and analyse the experimental data, for this we have added extended description of methods used in quantifying SMLM data, we have introduced a section in the methods explaining how we performed the simulations. We have also described more in details the analysis of SMLM data in the Results section.</p><p>ii) performing root mean square error quantification in order to compare the experimental to the simulated cumulative distribution functions. We have added maps of values of the RMSE to show similarities between the different numerical schemes (waists and distance from the center of the surrounding belt) and the experimental data in the supplemental figure 9 (FigS9). We have changed the text of the manuscript in the Results section accordingly. We want to point out here that the idea of these simulations is not to find a perfect similarity between experiments and simulation distribution of the CBC value. This numerical simulation has been performed more in a view of discriminating among different possible scenarii of I-BAR proteins (IRSp53 or IRTKS) localisation around a Gag on going bud. We show here the scenario that fits the best to the experimental CBC distribution in order to illustrate that there are clear differences in between IRSp53 and IRTKS in terms of organisation around the on-going bud.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Make sure that method descriptions are complete.</p></disp-quote><p>We improved the method descriptions, by extending it and going more into details, in particular for the SMLM and simulation analysis but also for the transfection methods and the GUV data analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Discuss the very high similarity between histograms in Figure 3c,d (HEK293T) and Figure S10c,d (Jurkats).</p></disp-quote><p>The very high similarity between histograms of cbc values in the case of HEK 293T and Jurkats T cells suggest that the organisation of these two I-Bar proteins around the budding site is independent of the cell type.</p><p>We did not discuss it in the previous version of the manuscript as we found this result to be not so surprising. In fact, we and others have previously shown that, on average, the bud assembly kinetics was independent of the cell type (Floderer et al., Sci Reports 2018; Ivachenko et al., Plos Pathogens 2009). Interestingly, we also observe (as others) that the final diameters of the released particles are equivalent independently of the cell type where they are produced, Jurkat T cells (Floderer et al., Sci Reports 2018); HEK 293T (this study), HeLa cells (Manley et al., 2009). These two mechanics and kinetics features are therefore very similar independently of the cell type, suggesting that the time evolution of the curvatures generated during the assembly of the virus is certainly equivalent in both cell type. Supposing that these processes rely on the same molecular interplay with the same kinetics, with Gag as an orchestrator and knowing that IRSp53 as well as IRTKS proteins are express in both cell types (Jurkat and HEK 293T) where they recognise equivalent curvatures and have the same functions at the plasma membrane, we think that these observations can explain why this colocalization based CBC histograms are very similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the reviews are quite detailed and include very valuable comments that will for sure improve the quality of the manuscript, we include them in detail in this decision letter.

The other band above MW 55KDa is indeed IRSp58 another isoform of IRSp53/58 that has been reported [for example, see DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.19-17-07300. 1999], and that can be seen in the IRSp53 immunoblot in figure S1d.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2c: To asses if the increased binding of IRSp53 to membranes in the presence of Gag is specific for this IBAR protein, a control where the membrane bound pool of another IBAR protein (e.g. IRTKS) should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, IRTKS has been included in the new figure 2d.

However, to clarify the point mentioned by the reviewer, we have added the following sentences in the manuscript:</p><p>“Previous in vitro studies showed that when placing IRSp53 I-BAR domain outside PIP2-containing GUVs, I-BAR domain can deform GUV membranes, generating tubes towards the interior of the vesicles (Jarin et al., 2019; Prévost et al., 2015; Saarikangas et al., 2009). […] Future work is required to investigate on this seemingly puzzled observation.”</p><p>If the reviewer thinks that these results would be useful for the readers, we could include the abovementioned quantification in SI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Gag and IRSp53 complexing is shown in an immunoprecipitation assay (Figure 2a). However, the quantification of membrane fraction enrichment of IRSp53 upon Gag expression in the membrane floatation assay the presented data is not convincing. Inamdar and colleagues claim a 2-fold increase of IRSp53 in the membrane fraction. Still, based on the dataset shown in Figure 2c, the findings don't seem to match the minor differences observed in the respective bands in the gel image. In the presented data set, the membrane fractions of Gag and IRSp53 do not appear in the same lane (Lane 1). I, therefore, suggest that the authors provide a more detailed description of their analysis method and the full data set to convincingly confirm the difference in membrane-bound IRSp53 upon Gag-expression compared to control cells, and the amount of membrane-bound Gag relative to its cytosolic counterpart. If the previously reported results hold, cross-validate them using a different methodology, for instance, by measuring the colocalisation of IRSp53 and Gag with the plasma membrane using microscopy. If the new calculations do not match the results previously reported, the authors should adjust their conclusions accordingly.</p><p>2. Dual-color SMLM is used to elucidate the IPSp53/IRTKS organisation patterns at Gag clusters sites by PALM/dSTORM imaging. Inamdar and colleagues quantify the Gag cluster size distribution and show that IPSp53 shows a considerable colocalized fraction, while IRTKS tends toward an anticorrelated distribution. In the next step, the authors try to deduce the spatial organisation of IPSp53 and IRTKS around Gag clusters based on simulated datasets of Gag and IPSp53/IRTKS CBC distribution geometries.</p><p>While dual-color SMLM is the right approach, the study presented here will benefit from a consistent and comprehensive description of the experimental details (see also Mn7) and the simulation. I propose adding a schematic of the geometric simulation parameters shown in Figure S8a in Figure 3. Also, it should be highlighted in Figure 3e and 3f that the simulated distributions presented are based on different waist diameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his suggested improvements leading to a better comprehension of our work by the future reader. We now have changed the figures and split the experimental part and the simulated part of the dual-colour SMLM into 2 different figures, namely figure 3 and figure 4. We have added the geometric simulation parameters in figure 4 and highlighted that the simulated distributions are based on different waist of the assembly surrounding belt.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second point that should be addressed is the lack of a quantitative measure of how well the experimental results are described by the simulated data.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to quantify the similarity between experimental and simulated CBC, we performed a RMSE quantification of the difference between experimental and simulated CBC cumulative distribution functions as these functions are the one represented in figure 4. A map of the different RMSE values obtained for all the different parameters used in the simulation is depicted in the supplementary figure (Figure 4 – supplemental 1). The minimal RMSE in the maps is found for a distance of 80nm and a belt waist of 40 nm in the case of IRSp53, whereas this minimum is displaced towards higher distance (140 nm) and larger waist (100 nm) in the case of IRTKS. However, the idea of performing simulation with this simple configurations (belts of IRSp53/IRTKS surrounding Gag assembly) was not to retrieve the experimental configuration observed here but to (i) show that differences observed here in CBC can be interpreted as different geometries of I-BAR proteins (Irsp53/IRTKS) surrounding HIV-Gag on going assemblies and (ii) relate that on average, surrounding IRSp53 belt is smaller and located closer to the centre of the assembly than IRTKS is.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the authors should comment on the effects of the choice of the radius in the data filtering (as shown in Figure S7) and over parameterization.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added different sentences to precise these choices (data filtering and parametrization) in the main manuscript, as well as in the supplementary figures.</p><p>Regarding the choice of the radius for the data filtering, we have justified it in the results (line 215-221):</p><p>“We then kept all HIV-1 Gag located within a distance of 80 nm from this center (70 to 80% of the all clusters size described above are found within this distance) and all the IRSp53 (or IRTKS) found in a distance of 150 nm from this center (~2x the assembly site size, see Figure 3 – supplemental 4 for details on the process workflow). We choose this IRSp53 (or IRTKS) cut-off distance to avoid cross-colocalization between different HIV-1 Gag clusters in dense areas.”</p><p>Regarding the parameterization, we have introduced the following text in the Results section (line 240-248):</p><p>“Although CBC values gives a quantitative value of the colocalization, it does not provide direct information on the average positions of IRTKS or IRSp53 molecules with respect to Gag molecules within the assembling clusters were unclear. […] Thus, to gain more insight into these colocalisation quantification, we performed simulations to generate different patterns of PALM/STORM localizations (Figure 4), and analyzed them with the same set of parameter (total distance and number of circles) that the one we used for the experimental data.”</p><p>We hope these comments and justification answer to the referee’s suggestion and somehow maybe make our final statements more precisely related to the method we used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the controlled in-vitro environment of GUVs, the authors show that Gag membrane recruitment is enhanced in the presence of the IRSp53 I-Bar domain and preferentially locates to the areas of high curvature in I-Bar domain induced membrane tubes. While I fully support the conclusions drawn from this elegant experiment, a complete description of the GUV preparation and imaging methods is missing. Also, from the methods section and the captions in Figure 5 and S11, it is unclear which membrane label was used in the experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In Figure 5 (now Figure 6) and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 (now Figure 6—figure supplement 1), 0.5mole% of BODIPY-TR-C5-ceramide is incorporated in GUV membranes for visualizing the membranes.
