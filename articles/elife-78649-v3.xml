and suppress AMPA-receptors, respectively, without affecting synapse formation. Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> act by binding to secreted cerebellin-2 (Cbln2) that in turn activates postsynaptic GluD1 receptors. Whether neurexin-Cbln2-GluD1 signaling has additional functions besides regulating NMDA- and AMPA-receptors, and whether such signaling performs similar roles at other synapses, however, remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate using constitutive Cbln2 deletions in mice that at CA1→subiculum synapses, Cbln2 performs no additional developmental roles besides regulating AMPA- and NMDA-receptors. Moreover, low-level expression of functionally redundant Cbln1 did not compensate for a possible synapse-formation function of Cbln2 at CA1→subiculum synapses. In exploring the generality of these findings, we examined the prefrontal cortex where Cbln2 was recently implicated in spinogenesis, and the cerebellum where Cbln1 is known to regulate parallel-fiber synapses. In the prefrontal cortex, Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2 signaling selectively controlled NMDA-receptors without affecting spine or synapse numbers, whereas Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2 signaling had no apparent role. In the cerebellum, conversely, Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1 signaling regulated AMPA-receptors, whereas now Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1 signaling had no manifest effect. Thus, Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>- and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 signaling complexes differentially control NMDA- and AMPA-receptors in different synapses in diverse neural circuits without regulating synapse or spine formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic transmission</kwd><kwd>cerebellins</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>neurexin signaling specificity</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH052804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Südhof</surname><given-names>Thomas C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 803-2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liakath-Ali</surname><given-names>Kif</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001167</institution-id><institution>Larry L.

Multiple candidate synaptic organizers were described, among which neurexins and their multifarious ligands are arguably the best studied (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noborn and Sterky, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Südhof, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kasem et al., 2018</xref>). Neurexins are presynaptic adhesion molecules encoded in mice by the <italic>Nrxn1</italic>, <italic>Nrxn2</italic>, and <italic>Nrxn3</italic> genes. Each neurexin gene directs synthesis of longer α-neurexins and shorter β-neurexins from separate promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tabuchi and Südhof, 2002</xref>). In addition, the <italic>Nrxn1</italic> gene (but not the <italic>Nrxn2</italic> and <italic>Nrxn3</italic> genes) contains a third promoter for the even shorter Nrxn1γ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sterky et al., 2017</xref>). Neurexin transcripts are extensively alternatively spliced at multiple sites, resulting in thousands of neurexin isoforms whose expression is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lukacsovich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ullrich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuccillo et al., 2015</xref>). Among the sites of alternative splicing of neurexins, splice site 4 (SS4) is possibly the most important because it regulates the interaction of neurexins with many ligands, including cerebellins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Südhof, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Cerebellins are secreted multimeric C1q-domain proteins that in mice are encoded by four genes (<italic>Cbln1-4</italic>), and that function as trans-synaptic adaptors by connecting presynaptic neurexins to postsynaptic receptors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yuzaki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matsuda, 2017</xref>). Cbln1, Cbln2, and Cbln4 are broadly expressed in brain where they are synthesized in restricted distinct subsets of neurons, whereas Cbln3 is specific for cerebellar granule cells and requires Cbln1 for secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seigneur and Südhof, 2017</xref>). For example, cerebellar granule cells express high levels of Cbln1 but only modest levels of Cbln2, excitatory entorhinal cortex (EC) neurons express predominantly Cbln4, and medial habenula (mHb) neurons express either Cbln2 or Cbln4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seigneur and Südhof, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liakath-Ali et al., 2022</xref>). Although all cerebellins bind to presynaptic neurexins, they interact with different postsynaptic receptors: Cbln1 and Cbln2 bind to GluD1 and GluD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuda et al., 2010</xref>), whereas Cbln4 binds to neogenin-1 (Neo1) and DCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haddick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>). Deletion of Cbln4 in the EC or of Neo1 in the dentate gyrus (DG) blocks long-term potentiation at EC→DG synapses, but does not change the number or basal synaptic transmission at these synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liakath-Ali et al., 2022</xref>). By connecting presynaptic neurexins to postsynaptic GluDs (Cbln1 and Cbln2) or to Neo1/DCC (Cbln4), cerebellins are thought to mediate trans-synaptic signaling and to organize synapses, but their precise functions are incompletely understood.</p><p>In the cerebellum (which is where cerebellins were first studied – hence the name!), deletion of Cbln1 or of its receptor GluD2 (gene symbol <italic>Grid2</italic>) throughout development causes a partial loss of parallel-fiber synapses and a complete loss of long-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Uemura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rong et al., 2012</xref>). In GluD2 KO mice, parallel-fiber synapses develop initially at least in part, but subsequently decline, with a 40–50% decrease in adult GluD2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashiwabuchi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurihara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takeuchi et al., 2005</xref>). These observations gave rise to the notion that cerebellins may be involved in synapse formation, even though only a fraction of synapses are lost, whereas synaptic plasticity is completely ablated.</p><p>Analyses of genetic deletions of <italic>Cbln1</italic>, <italic>Cbln2</italic>, and <italic>Cbln4</italic> outside of the cerebellum revealed behavioral changes and abnormal synaptic transmission, but generally caused little or no synapse loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kusnoor et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Otsuka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seigneur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seigneur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seigneur et al., 2021</xref>), consistent with a role for cerebellins in shaping synapse properties. For example, constitutive Cbln1/2 double and Cbln1/2/4 triple KO mice displayed major behavioral impairments but no synapse loss at 2 months of age, although synapse numbers declined in the striatum and prefrontal cortex (PFC) over the next 4–6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seigneur and Südhof, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, constitutive deletion of Cbln2 produced obsessive-compulsive behaviors in mice that resulted from insufficient activation of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe and could be reversed by administration of serotonergic agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seigneur et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, conditional deletion of Cbln2 in the mHb led to major behavioral alterations and a rapid decline in mHb→interpeduncular nucleus synaptic transmission, but produced synapse loss only after 3 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seigneur et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Viewed together, these studies suggested that in multiple brain regions, cerebellins are essential for regulating synaptic properties, are not involved in the initial formation of synapses, but are required for long-term stability of synapses. However, several studies challenged these conclusions. Specifically, RNAi-induced suppression of GluD1 expression was found to suppress excitatory synapse formation in the hippocampal CA1 region, as revealed by analyses of AMPAR/NMDAR EPSCs and of the spine density in biolistic-transfected hippocampal slice cultures, or in acute slices of the adolescent hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tao et al., 2018</xref>). These effects required the GluD1 ligand Cbln2, which is puzzling since Cbln2 expression appears to be absent from CA1 or CA3 region neurons and the constitutive Cbln2 KO did not produce an apparent synapse loss in the CA1 region at 1–2 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seigneur et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seigneur and Südhof, 2017</xref>). In addition, deletion of neurexins or of GluD1 in the hippocampal formation also did not decrease synapse numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Missler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoto et al., 2015</xref>). In another study, an RNAi-induced knockdown of <italic>Cbln4</italic> in cortical pyramidal neurons of the somato-sensory cortex caused an inhibitory synapse loss via a GluD1-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fossati et al., 2019</xref>), which is also puzzling since Cbln4 is known to bind to Neogenin-1 and DCC, while biophysical studies showed that it does not bind to GluD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhong et al., 2017</xref>), which is homologous to and has the same function as GluD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). In a third study, slightly elevated expression of human Cbln2 in mouse PFC was reported to increase the spine density, implying an increase in synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shibata et al., 2021</xref>). However, this observation also raised questions because in <italic>Cbln2</italic> KO mice of the same age, little synapse loss is detected in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seigneur et al., 2018</xref>). Even in the cerebellum of <italic>Cbln1</italic> KO mice, the observed synapse loss is not accompanied by an equivalent decrease in spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirai et al., 2005</xref>), and it is unknown whether ‘naked’ spines form by itself or represent the remnants of synapses that have been lost. Moreover, the increase in spine density in the PFC in the (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shibata et al., 2021</xref>) paper was larger than the increase in Cbln2 expression. Finally, a synthetic synaptic organizer protein composed of Cbln1 fused to neuronal pentraxin 1 was shown to induce synapse formation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suzuki et al., 2020</xref>), but in this experiment the binding partners of the synthetic protein were unclear, especially since little is known about the function of neuronal pentraxin 1, and the nature of the synaptogenic activity remained unexplored. Thus, presently available data raise multiple questions that need to be addressed for further progress.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that at CA1→subiculum synapses, presynaptic neurexin-1 containing an insert in SS4 (Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>) dominantly enhanced NMDA-receptor (NMDAR) EPSCs, whereas presynaptic neurexin-3 containing an insert in SS4 (Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>) potently suppressed AMPA-receptor (AMPAR) EPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2019</xref>). More recently, we showed that Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> both act by binding to Cbln2, which in turn binds to GluD1 and GluD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). Thus at CA1→subiculum synapses, Nrxn1/3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2-GluD1 complexes mediate trans-synaptic signaling that controls NMDARs and AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). No changes in synapse density were detected as a function of any of these manipulations – in fact, the massive increase in AMPAR EPSCs induced by the Cbln2 deletion suggested that if a change in synapses had occurred, it should have been an increase, not a decrease, in synapse numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>These results characterized a trans-synaptic signaling pathway that organized a specific synaptic circuit (CA1→subiculum synapses). However, only CA1→subiculum synapses were studied, and only after they had fully developed, raising multiple questions. Does <italic>Cbln2</italic> have essential roles at CA1→subiculum synapses in addition to its AMPAR/NMDAR-regulatory function in adult brain? Since low levels of Cbln1 are also present at these synapses, is it possible that Cbln1 compensates for such additional functions in mature synapses? Furthermore, does Cbln2 perform identical functions at different subtypes of CA1→subiculum synapses, where the properties of synapses formed on regular- and burst-firing neurons are quite different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wójtowicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wozny et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wozny et al., 2008b</xref> )? More broadly and possibly more importantly, does a signaling pathway similar to the Nrxn1/3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2-GluD1 pathway at CA1→subiculum synapses operate at other synapses in brain, or is this pathway specific to CA1→subiculum synapses? To address these questions, we here first compared the contributions of Cbln1 and Cbln2 in different CA1→subiculum synapses and probed their function in relation to upstream Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> signals. We then studied the potential role of Nrxn1/3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 signaling in two other paradigmatic synapses, namely Layer 2/3→Layer 5/6 excitatory synapses in the mPFC and parallel-fiber synapses in the cerebellum, which we investigated because previous work demonstrated a role for cerebellins in these brain regions. Our data suggest that (1) the Nrxn1/3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 signaling pathway has no role in synapse or spine formation but functions to shape the NMDAR- and AMPAR-content at multiple types of synapses in diverse circuits, and (2) that different types of synapses exhibit distinct facets of this overall signaling pathway, such that in the mPFC, only the Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2 signaling mechanism is present, whereas in the cerebellum, only the Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1 signaling pathway operates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Constitutive deletion of Cbln2 suppresses NMDARs and enhances AMPARs both at regular- and at burst-firing subiculum neuron synapses</title><p>Previous conclusions that presynaptic Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> regulate postsynaptic NMDARs and AMPARs, respectively, via binding to Cbln2, but that Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>, Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>, and Cbln2 are not required for synapse formation relied on conditional manipulations at mature CA1→subiculum synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast to these results, studies in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ito-Ishida et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yuzaki, 2011</xref>) and the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shibata et al., 2021</xref>) suggested a function for Cbln1 and Cbln2, respectively, in synapse formation, raising the question whether conditional deletions might have overlooked a developmental synapse formation role of Cbln2 at CA1→subiculum synapses. Moreover, previous experiments did not differentiate between CA1→subiculum synapses on regular- and on burst-firing neurons that exhibit distinct forms of long-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wozny et al., 2008b</xref>).

These phenotypes were validated using input/output measurements to control for variabilities in the position of the stimulating electrode, and were due to a postsynaptic mechanism, as described before, since PPRs did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and E</xref>). We also measured spontaneous mEPSCs as an indirect measure of synaptic activity and synapse numbers, and monitored mEPSCs at two holding potentials (–70 mV and +60 mV) to capture the contributions of both AMPARs and NMDARs to mEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–I</xref>). mEPSCs monitored at –70 mV are exclusively mediated by AMPARs, whereas mEPSCs monitored at +60 mV contain contributions of both AMPAR and NMDAR activation. At both holding potentials, the mEPSC frequency was massively enhanced (~100–130% increase) by the Cbln1/2 double KO, presumably because of the increased AMPAR-responses leads to increased detection of mEPSCs at both holding potentials. Importantly, the average mEPSC amplitude was increased at the –70 mV holding potential but the average mEPSC total charge transfer decreased at the +60 mV, consistent with the observation that the double Cbln1/2 KO increases AMPAR- but decreases NMDAR-responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we asked whether the phenotype of the double Cbln1/2 KO might be more sensitive to manipulations of neurexins than that of the Cbln2 single KO.

Strikingly, we show that these signaling pathways do not equally operate at all synapses, but are selectively present in subsets of synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The evidence supporting these conclusions can be summarized as follows.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of how Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 signaling complexes control postsynaptic AMPARs and NMDARs in subicular, prefrontal, and cerebellar circuits.</title><p>The schematic is based on data shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2021</xref>) and described here. Alternative splicing of presynaptic Nrxn1 and Nrxn3 at SS4 that controls their interactions with Cbln1/2 and thereby with postsynaptic GluD1/2 differentially regulates the postsynaptic content of AMPARs and NMDARs in different brain region. In the hippocampus, Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 complexes enhance NMDAR-EPSCs, whereas Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 complexes suppress AMPAR-EPSCs, with both types of complexes acting via GluD1/2. In the PFC, Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 complexes also enhance NMDAR-EPSCs, but Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 complexes have no effect. In the cerebellum, conversely, Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 complexes suppress AMPAR-EPSCs, whereas now Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 complexes have no effect. These results indicate that Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1/2 complexes perform universal functions in regulating AMPARs and NMDARs, respectively, but that these regulatory signaling pathways are differentially expressed in different types of synapses.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78649-fig9-v3.tif"/></fig><p>First, we showed that a constitutive deletion of Cbln2 operating throughout development has the same effect as the conditional post-developmental deletion of Cbln2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Both produced a similar enhancement of AMPAR-EPSCs (up to 100% increase) and suppression of NMDAR-EPSCs (up to 40% decrease), without a change in synapse numbers. Consistent with a broad effect on synapses, the Cbln2 deletion also severely impaired contextual learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, the constitutive deletion of Cbln2 occluded the dominant effects of Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> signaling on NMDARs and AMPARs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), confirming that Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> operate upstream of Cbln2.</p><p>Second, we examined whether the function of Cbln2 is the same in the two types of CA1→subiculum synapses that are formed on burst- and regular-spiking neurons and that exhibit quite distinct properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wójtowicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wozny et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wozny et al., 2008b</xref>). In both synapse types, the constitutive and conditional Cbln2 deletion caused the same increase in AMPAR-EPSCs and the same decrease in NMDAR-EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The two types of subiculum synapses differ in their forms of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wójtowicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wozny et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wozny et al., 2008b</xref>). Notably, the Cbln2 deletion blocked the NMDAR-dependent LTP of synapses on regular-spiking neurons without affecting the cAMP-dependent LTP in burst-spiking neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Since the former type of LTP is postsynaptic and latter presynaptic, these findings agree with the conclusion of a postsynaptic regulatory effect of Cbln2 signaling. This deficit in NMDAR-dependent LTP could be due to impaired LTP induction, given the reduced NMDAR-response in Cbln2 KO mice. Alternatively, the deficit in NMDAR-dependent LTP in Cbln2 KO mice could be caused by a a saturation of ‘slots’ for AMPARs in the postsynaptic specializations, since AMPAR-EPSCs are massively enhanced. However, we previously found that constitutive expression of Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> suppresses AMPARs without affecting NMDARs, but also blocks NMDAR-dependent LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoto et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that neither an impairment of NMDAR-dependent LTP induction nor a saturation of AMPAR slots is a likely explanation for the loss of LTP in Cbln2-deficient synapses. Alternatively, it is possible that the neurexin→Cbln2-signaling pathway renders postsynaptic specializations competent of responding to NMDAR-dependent LTP induction, although the nature of the signaling mechanism remains unclear.</p><p>Third, we investigated the possibility that low-level expression of Cbln1 in the subiculum might redundantly compensate for Cbln2 in additional functions besides regulation of AMPARs and NMDARs, such as synapse formation. Such redundancy may cause an additional function of Cbln2 to become selectively occluded in the Cbln2 KO mice. To explore this possibility, we analyzed Cbln1/2 double KO mice, but identified substantially the same phenotype as in Cbln2 single KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, it seems unlikely that low-level expression of Cbln1 prevents manifestation of an additional Cbln2 function.</p><p>Fourth, we tested the possible function of the Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2 and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2 signaling pathways at L2/3→L5/6 synapses in the mPFC, focusing on Cbln2 because it is expressed at higher levels than Cbln1 in the mPFC similar to the subiculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). We observed that the Cbln2 deletion caused a suppression of NMDAR-EPSCs, but did not enhance AMPAR-EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This observation suggests that only the Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2 but not the Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2 signaling pathway operates in the mPFC synapses. Consistent with this conclusion, we found that the Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> switch to Nrxn1<sup>SS4-</sup> selectively downregulated NMDARs in the PFC because only Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> but not Nrxn1<sup>SS4-</sup> can bind to Cbln2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast and different from CA1→subiculum synapses, the Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> switch to Nrxn3<sup>SS4-</sup> had no effect on AMPARs in the PFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Our findings in the PFC are at odds with a recent study reporting that a hominin-specific increase in Cbln2 expression in the PFC induces an elevation of spine numbers, and by implication synapse numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shibata et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shibata et al., 2021</xref> showed that a modest increase in Cbln2 expression (~25%) in the mouse PFC leads to a robust increase in spine density (~40%). Although this conclusion is difficult to reconcile with our data, it is possible that overexpression of a protein could have functional effects that are different from those of a loss-of-function. Note, however, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shibata et al., 2021</xref> did not explore the effects of a direct genetic manipulation, but instead used a ‘humanization’ of a putative enhancer for the Cbln2 gene that increases Cbln2 expression. Thus, a plausible alternative explanation for the discrepancy between our results and the conclusions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shibata et al., 2021</xref> is that the enhancer manipulation may have affected other genes besides Cbln2, and that these other genes are responsible for the observed change in spine density.</p><p>Fifth and finally, we examined parallel-fiber synapses in the cerebellum, the synapses at which Cbln1 was discovered and which do not express functional NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llano et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perkel et al., 1990</xref>). Cbln1 has a well-characterized function at these synapses in maintaining synapse stability and enabling long-term synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kashiwabuchi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurihara et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Takeuchi et al., 2005</xref>). Strikingly, we found that the post-developmental conditional deletion of Cbln1 at these synapses also significantly increased AMPAR-EPSCs similar to the Cbln2 deletion in the subiculum, and that the induced switch from Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> to Nrxn3<sup>SS4-</sup> had the same effect on AMPAR-EPSCs as the Cbln1 deletion, whereas the switch from Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> to Nrxn1<sup>SS4-</sup> had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These experiments suggest that at parallel-fiber synapses of the cerebellum, Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln1 signaling controls AMPARs similar to the action of Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>-Cbln2 signaling at CA1→subiculum synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2019</xref>). At first glance, these results seem to contradict previous studies showing that deletions of Cbln1 or of its GluD2 receptor in cerebellum cause a partial loss of parallel-fiber synapses (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yuzaki, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yuzaki and Aricescu, 2017</xref>). However, this loss affects less than half of all synapses, while all of the remaining synapses are dysfunction and unable to undergo LTD. More importantly, this loss only occurs after an initial formation of at least some synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurihara et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the GluD2 deletion was also shown to induce an increase in AMPARs at parallel-fiber synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yamasaki et al., 2011</xref>), replicating our observations with the Cbln1 deletion since Cbln1 is the major binding partner to GluD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Viewed together, these results are consistent with the notion that Cbln1 also regulates AMPARs at parallel-fiber synapses, and that the ablation of such regulation causes secondary synapse elimination.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> illustrates the richness of regulatory mechanisms that control the postsynaptic levels of AMPARs and NMDARs via presynaptic expression of neurexins and cerebellins. In our studies, the changes in synaptic transmission induced by disrupting neurexin-cerebellin signaling are large, resulting in major alterations in the information processing of any circuit containing affected synapses. Since both cerebellin expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hrvatin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ibata et al., 2019</xref>) and neurexin alternative splicing at SS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Iijima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flaherty et al., 2019</xref>) may be activity-dependent, the unexpected signaling mechanism we describe likely also mediates activity-dependent plasticity. Thus, activity-dependent gene expression changes in a pre- or postsynaptic neuron may regulate the AMPAR- and NMDAR-composition via Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup>/Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>→Cbln signaling. This type of AMPAR and NMDAR plasticity suggests a novel mechanism of circuit plasticity that may contribute to fundamental brain functions such as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Silver, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Josselyn and Tonegawa, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Needless to say, our findings raise major new questions. The current data at best are the beginning of an understanding of how neurexin-cerebellin signaling shapes synapses. Among major questions, it is puzzling why Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> has no effect on mPFC synapses. Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> is expressed in the mPFC but doesn’t regulate AMPARs, suggesting it has a different function that is independent of Cbln2. In contrast, it is easier to understand why Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> doesn’t regulate NMDARs at parallel-fiber synapses since these synapses lack functional NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Llano et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perkel et al., 1990</xref>), but this finding also raises the question whether Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> has another currently unknown function at these synapses. Neurexins can likely operate at the same synapses via binding to different ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seigneur et al., 2021</xref>), a fascinating amplification of their functions that may also apply to parallel-fiber synapses. A further question is how the function of Cbln1 and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup> in regulating AMPARs relates to the well-described parallel-fiber synapse loss in constitutive Cbln1 KO mice. It is possible that the prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload driven by long-lasting synaptic activity which is caused by overactivation of AMPARs leads to synaptotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finch et al., 2012</xref>), thereby harming parallel-fiber synapses. Another plausible explanation could be that at cerebellar parallel-fiber synapses, Cbln1 has additional functions that are not operative for cerebellins in subiculum synapses. Finally, how exactly neurexin-cerebellin signals are transduced postsynaptically via GluD’s, and how synapse specificity is achieved here, constitutes another challenging but important question. Future studies will have to explore these intriguing questions.</p><p>In summary, our data spanning diverse genetic manipulations in multiple brain regions establish a general function for Cbln1 and Cbln2 in the trans-synaptic regulation of NMDARs and AMPARs that is regulated by presynaptic Nrxn1<sup>SS4+</sup> and Nrxn3<sup>SS4+</sup>, respectively. Remarkably, this signaling pathway differentially operates in different neural circuits, creating a panoply of synaptic regulatory mechanisms that are inherently plastic and enhance the activity-dependent capacity for information processing by neural circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-vGluT1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat.

Whole brains were dissected out and kept in PFA for 6 hours, then post-fixed in 30% sucrose (in 1×PBS) for 24 h-48 h at 4 °C. Horizontal brain sections (30 μm) were collected at –20 °C with a cryostat (Leica CM1050). Sections were washed with PBS and incubated in blocking buffer (0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% goat serum in PBS) for 1 hr at RT, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer (anti-vGluT1, 1:1000, guinea pig, Millipore and anti-MAP2, 1:1000, rabbit, Millipore).

Serial confocal z-stack images (1 μm step for 10 μm at 1024x1,024 pixel resolution) were acquired using a Nikon confocal microscope (A1Rsi) with a 60 x oil objective (PlanApo, NA1.4). All acquisition parameters were kept constant among different conditions within experiments. For data analysis (n≥3 animals per condition), maximum intensity projections were generated for each image, and average vGlut1 intensity (mean ± S.E.M) calculated from the entire area of subiculum (object size range 0.05–0.21 mm<sup>2</sup>). An example cerebellum slice was stained with vGluT1 (anti-vGluT1, 1:1000, guinea pig, Millipore) and Calbindin (anti-calbindin, 1:2000, mouse, Sigma).

Briefly, two chambers (left and right) were designed with different visual cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) under dim light with a gate between them (Shuttle box, Med Associates Inc). The right chamber has a foot shock with electric current (intensity: 0.15 mA, duration: 2 s). Mice can explore both chambers freely. At the training day, mice will be put in left chamber. Once they go to the right chamber, they will get a foot shock after a 2 s delay. In this case, they will return back immediately to the left chamber. This is one trial of learning which is counted as one entry. It may come as another trial, once they visit right chamber again. This training process will be completed until mice are able to stay in left “safe” chamber more than 2 min. After 1 day and 7 days, they will be tested by putting back into left chamber to record latency to enter the right chamber and the number of entries in 2 min.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study is a follow-up to a series of elegant work by the authors (Aoto et al., 2013; Dai et al., Neuron 2019; Dai et al., Nature 2021) in establishing a surprising role for the presynaptic adhesion molecules, neurexin (Nrxn) containing the SS4+ splice site, in differentially controlling postsynaptic NMDA and AMPA receptors by forming links through a shared system of extracellular cerebellins (Cbln) and postsynaptic GluD. Here the two major findings are reported: (1) the previously described function of Nrxn-Cbln-GluD complexes at mature CA1 to subiculum synapses extend to different synapse types in the subiculum and also to some synapses in the cortex and the cerebellum and (2) the Nrxn-Cbln-GluD complexes do not appear to play a role in synapse formation as proposed by others. The experiments have been expertly executed. However, the scope of the present findings is limited over the previous work. Moreover, one of the key conclusions – of the lack of involvement of Nrxn-Cbln-GluD in synapse formation – could be further strengthened with additional data. To address these concerns, the following essential revisions are requested. The full reviews are appended below, which will help clarify the concerns of the individual reviewers. The authors should address also all the points raised in the individual reviews, particularly those involving re-analysis of data and text edits for clarifications/explanations.</p><p>1) To clarify the role of the Nrx-Cbln-GluD complex in controlling synapse formation/development, either a detailed and quantitative synaptic analysis of both pre and postsynaptic markers and/or quantification of dendritic spine density from individual cells should be performed in control WT neurons and neurons deficient for the trans-synaptic adhesion complex.</p><p>2) To investigate whether AMPAR and NMDAR changes result from changes in the number of active synapses and/or quantal size, the authors must perform a detailed quantal analysis of electrophysiological recordings.</p><p>3) To validate the specificity of their approach, the authors must investigate through immunoblotting and/or RT-qPCR whether the deletion of Cbln1 and/or Cbln2 affect the expression of other Cblns isoforms (Cbln2 and/or Cbln4) as well as Nrxns1/3 and GluD1/2 to ensure that there is no compensatory effect arising from the genetic deletion of Cbln1/2.</p><p>4) L272- 'Cbln1 is also expressed in the subiculum, albeit at lower levels'. The images from figure S3 show no Cbln1 mRNA signal (in agreement with Otsuka et al., 2016). The authors should change the image and/or provide some quantitative analysis to support this conclusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1. Could the authors rule out the possibility that in regular spiking cells, the block of LTP in Clbn2 KO cells is due to occlusion/saturation by the already high synaptic levels of AMPAR? Is LTD unaffected? If so, could one rescue LTP after inducing LTD? Alternatively, if LTP deficit represents a general defect in AMPAR trafficking as suggested, then LTD might be also compromised. It would be informative to clarify these points.</p><p>Figure 3. Since the role for Clbns in synapse formation is a contentious issue, the authors should compare synapse density in an input-specific manner. An overall lack of change in VGluT1 staining intensity in hippocampus is certainly one measure of synapse density, although it may mask changes at the level of different synapse types. Filling the identified neurons and assessing spine density along with posthoc labelling with a presynaptic marker is expected to give a more definitive measure.</p><p>Figure 5. It would be much more compelling if the Cbln1/2 DKO could be directly compared also to Cbln1 KO or Cbln2 KO to demonstrate that the extent changes observed are comparable between single and double KOs. Moreover, the quantification of NMDAR mEPSCs as shown, is not convincing given the high levels of baseline noise, which exceed the amplitude of the tail responses as seen in the raw traces. Although indirect, perhaps measurements of NMDAR-dependent calcium signals could provide a clearer dataset.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) To address further the role of the Nrx-Cbln-GluD pathway in the control of synaptic formation/development, the authors must perform a detailed and quantitative synaptic analysis of both pre and postsynaptic markers and quantify the density, intensity and apposition of corresponding clusters in the three models (pyramidal neurons from subiculum and mPFC and cerebellar Purkinje cells). To compare with other studies (e.g., Tao et al., 2018; Shibata et al., 2021), they should also quantify dendritic spine density from individual cells.</p><p>(2) To investigate whether AMPAR and NMDAR changes result from changes in the number of active synapses and/or quantal size, the authors must perform a detailed quantal analysis of electrophysiological recordings and/or provide quantitative measurements of AMPARs and NMDARs at the synaptic level (e.g., through immunostainings or biochemical analysis of synaptosomal fractions).</p><p>(3) To validate the specificity of their approach, the authors must investigate through immunoblotting and/or RT-qPCR whether the deletion of Cbln1 and/or Cbln2 affect the expression of other Cblns isoforms (Cbln2 and/or Cbln4) as well as Nrxns1/3 and GluD1/2 to ensure that there is no compensatory effect arising from the genetic deletion of Cbln1/2.</p><p>(4) The authors should discuss further their biological model and propose a molecular mechanism by which the Nrxn-Cbln-GluD pathway could directly up-regulate AMPARs or down-regulate NMDARs (depending on the Nrxn and Cblns engaged at each of the connection), without altering synapse formation.</p><p>(5) L94 – 95- 'Parallel-fiber synapses develop initially normally, but are subsequently lost (Kashiwabuchi et al., 1995; Kurihara et al., 1997; Hirai et al., 2005; Takeuchi et al., 2005)'. This statement is incorrect. The authors are right when saying that the initial parallel fiber synapses develop initially normally, i.e., during the first 10 postnatal days (Kurihara et al., 1997). However, this phase generates only a small fraction of the total number of PF-&gt;PC synapses. Actually, most PF-PCs synapses assemble in the following 2 weeks (e.g., Altman et al., J Comp Neurol 1972; Takacs and Hamori, J Neurosci Research, 1994), i.e, when the GluD2 KO mice start displaying abnormal PF synapse number (Kurihara et al., 1997). The statement that PF synapses develop initially normally but are subsequently lost is therefore incorrect.</p><p>(6) L114 – 'an RNAi-induced suppression of Cbln2 expression was found to suppress formation of excitatory synapse numbers in the CA1 region of the hippocampus'. This citation is not correct as Tao et al., performed RNAi-mediated GluD1 knock-down +/- Cbln2 overexpression.</p><p>(7) L114-L118 – The authors compare studies that used different readouts to monitor synapse number. While Tao et al., quantified spine number and AMPAR / NMDAR-EPSCs in 6d organotypic slices or acute slices from 1 month-old mice, Seigneur and Südhof, as in the present study, quantified average vGluT1 staining intensity from histological sections. The comparison is thus limited and the different methods to quantify synapses should be mentioned.</p><p>(8) L121-L122 – 'which is also puzzling since Cbln4 does not bind to GluD1 (Zhong et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2016)'. Both studies tested the binding of Cblns to GluD2, not GluD1. Moreover, Cheng et al., only looked at Cbln1, not Cbln4. Therefore, the citations are not accurate.</p><p>(9) L272 – 'Cbln1 is also expressed in the subiculum, albeit at lower levels'. The images from figure S3 show no Cbln1 mRNA signal (in agreement with Otsuka et al., 2016). The authors should change the image and/or provide some quantitative analysis to support this conclusion.</p><p>(10) Figure 6C – It is not clear how AMPAR-EPSCs and NMDAR-EPSCs were normalized across recordings for experiments performed in the mPFC since no input-output curve was performed.</p><p>(11) L492 – the argument that 'overactivation of AMPARs may lead to synaptotoxicity thereby explaining synapse loss' is interesting but not supported by any data in the paper nor by relevant citations. It should therefore be discussed further. Actually, the decrease in NMDARs is not in favor of the synaptotoxicity hypothesis.</p><p>(12) The discrepancy between the current study and previous reports needs to be further discussed. In particular, Tao et al., reported that Cbln2 overexpression enhances AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs amplitudes while the present study shows that Cbln2 KO enhances AMPAR EPSCs while decreasing NMDAR-current. The surprising similar effect of Cbln2 overexpression and KO on AMPARs-EPSCs needs to be addressed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Distinct Neurexin-Cerebellin Complexes Control AMPA- and NMDA-Receptor Responses in a Circuit-Dependent Manner&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor. The manuscript has been improved but please fully address the concerns raised by Reviewer #3 by editing the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have made several improvements and addressed many of my criticisms. However, I still have some concerns about the statements made in the introduction regarding the cerebellum.</p><p>L96-99: &quot;parallel fiber synapses develop initially, but subsequently decline, with a 40-50% decrease in parallel-fiber synapses in adult Cbln1 or GluD2 KO mice&quot;. This sentence is misleading as it suggests that PF synapses form normally and that the decreased number entirely results from abnormal elimination. Actually, as acknowledged by the authors, the current data do not allow to exclude the possibility that the GluD2 KO impairs the critical phase of PF synapse formation which occurs during the 2nd and 3rd weeks. Therefore, this claim should be toned down.</p><p>L137: &quot;Even in the cerebellum of Cbln1 KO mice, the observed synapse loss is not accompanied by an equivalent decrease in spine density (Hirai et al., 2005)&quot;. In contrast to other circuits like PFC, it is well established that PC spines spontaneously form and can remain 'free' even in the absence of PF inputs. In this regard, PC spines cannot be used as a proxy for synapse number and a direct comparison with PFC is not appropriate.</p><p>Overall, while data from the authors do support that Nrx-Cbln-GluD signaling is not required for synapse formation in PFC and subiculum (which does not mean that they do not play any role), I think that the idea that the impact of Cbln / GluD2 deletion on PF synapse number in PCs primarily results from increased elimination rather than defect in synapse formation is only weakly supported by published data and appears overstated through the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78649.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This study is a follow-up to a series of elegant work by the authors (Aoto et al., 2013; Dai et al., Neuron 2019; Dai et al., Nature 2021) in establishing a surprising role for the presynaptic adhesion molecules, neurexin (Nrxn) containing the SS4+ splice site, in differentially controlling postsynaptic NMDA and AMPA receptors by forming links through a shared system of extracellular cerebellins (Cbln) and postsynaptic GluD.

We concur that although we reported immunocytochemistry experiments for the presynaptic maker vGlut1 in the subiculum to quantify synaptic density in the original paper, this approach alone might be considered inconclusive. To address this concern and, at the same time, to generate more value for the field, we decided to expand the scope of our project and to perform further experiments along the lines suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>Instead of the hippocampus, however, we opted to perform these experiments in the prefrontal cortex for two reasons. First, we already previously presented extensive data in the subiculum showing that various neurexin, cerebellin, and GluD deletions have no effect on synapses numbers. Doing more of the same seemed a bit superfluous, but showing this for a different brain regions is very informative. Second, a recent well-noted <italic>Nature</italic> paper claimed that <italic>Cbln2</italic> controlled spine numbers in the prefrontal cortex, and thus regulated synapse numbers (Shibata et al., “Hominini-specific regulation of <italic>CBLN2</italic> increases prefrontal spinogenesis”). Notably, this paper’s conclusion that <italic>Cbln2</italic> controls spinogenesis has large implications not only for human evolution, but also for our understanding of the role of <italic>Cbln2</italic>-associated synaptic adhesion in constructing neural circuits. In addition, the <italic>Nature</italic> paper suggested that <italic>Cbln2</italic> controls spinogenesis in mouse prefrontal cortex, and thus are incongruent with our data. Because of this situation, we decided to test this question directly in prefrontal cortex.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ and editors’ suggestions, we measured spine numbers as well as synapse density using co-labeling of synapses for pre- and postsynaptic markers as an approach. The experiments were carried out in littermate constitutive <italic>Cbln2</italic> KO and control mice in order to ensure that we did not miss a possible developmental phenotype, since in the constitutive <italic>Cbln2</italic> KO mice, <italic>Cbln2</italic> is absent throughout the life of a mouse. The new results show unequivocally that the <italic>Cbln2</italic> KO causes no change in synapse density or in spine numbers (new Figure 7). This is consistent with our current and previous results in the hippocampus.</p><p>Why are our results different from those of Shibata et al.? Their <italic>Nature</italic> paper did not explore the effects of a direct genetic manipulation – it used a ‘humanization’ of a putative enhancer for the <italic>Cbln2</italic> gene that causes a small increase in <italic>Cbln2</italic> expression (~25%), but a robust increase (40-50%) in dendritic spines. No actual test of the role of <italic>Cbln2</italic> in regulating spine numbers was performed, and the effect of the genetic manipulation on spine numbers was disproportionately high compared to the effect on <italic>Cbln2</italic> expression. Thus, a plausible explanation for the discrepancy between our results and the conclusions of Shibata et al., (2021) may be that the enhancer manipulation could have also affected other genes that might drive spine formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To investigate whether AMPAR and NMDAR changes result from changes in the number of active synapses and/or quantal size, the authors must perform a detailed quantal analysis of electrophysiological recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully beg to differ from this recommendation for two reasons.</p><p>First, a true quantal analysis of a synapse is a major project on its own, traditionally published as a stand-alone paper. Rigorous quantal analyses are difficult to perform on synapses that cannot be readily monitored by paired recordings or stimulation of single nerve terminals. To the best of our knowledge, no detailed quantal analysis has ever been done for CA1→subiculum synapses, and may not even be possible given the convergent/divergent synaptic input/output relations. Adding this to the current paper, if feasible, would mean at least 6-12 months of extra work.</p><p>Second, a detailed quantal analysis is unnecessary in our study, and is “overkill”. We show that synapse numbers don’t change, as now extensively documented in additional experiments. Our data also demonstrate that AMPAR and NMDAR changes are in the opposite directions, which cannot possibly be explained by a change in the number of active synapses. Moreover, the mEPSC frequency increases, which is incompatible with the decrease in synapse numbers that would have been expected by alternative explanations. Furthermore, we performed in the current paper a detailed analysis of miniature quantal size of AMPA mEPSCs or NMDA mEPSCs, showing that there is no change. In addition, we previously demonstrated that the opposing changes in NMDAR and AMPAR responses are caused by changes in surface receptor responses (Dai et al., 2019). Finally, we have now added data demonstrating further that the release probability doesn’t change by calculating the coefficient of variation. Based on the entirety of these findings, our data conclusively rule out the possibility of a decrease in synapse numbers or in the percentage of active synapses – neither is consistent with the data. A detailed quantal analysis would simply confirm this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To validate the specificity of their approach, the authors must investigate through immunoblotting and/or RT-qPCR whether the deletion of Cbln1 and/or Cbln2 affect the expression of other Cblns isoforms (Cbln2 and/or Cbln4) as well as Nrxns1/3 and GluD1/2 to ensure that there is no compensatory effect arising from the genetic deletion of Cbln1/2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have performed the suggested experiments. The new results are now shown in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 2, fully confirming the reviewers’ predictions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) L272- 'Cbln1 is also expressed in the subiculum, albeit at lower levels'. The images from figure S3 show no Cbln1 mRNA signal (in agreement with Otsuka et al., 2016). The authors should change the image and/or provide some quantitative analysis to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this issue needed to be presented better, and we have changed the image. The extremely high expression level of <italic>Cbln1</italic> in the cerebellum causes the <italic>Cbln1</italic> signal to become dim in other brain regions if all images are analyzed with the same settings. We have now increased the gain of the <italic>Cbln1</italic> in situ hybridization signal strength for other brain regions to demonstrate that <italic>Cbln1</italic> is actually expressed in these regions, albeit at much lower levels. This is noted in the revised legends. Additionally, to provide an overall quantitative analysis, we performed qRT-PCR measurements in both <italic>Cbln2</italic> WT and KO mice to determine the mRNA levels of <italic>Cbln1</italic> and <italic>Cbln2</italic> in the prefrontal cortex and subiculum. The results confirm that <italic>Cbln2</italic> has much higher expression level than <italic>Cbln1</italic> in the prefrontal cortex or subiculum, although <italic>Cbln1</italic> is clearly detectable (new Figure 5 figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 1.

Another possibility is that the loss of LTP is due to an induction impairment caused by the reduction in NMDARs, although we used a very strong LTP induction protocol (4 x 100 Hz for 1 s). We now note these possibilities in the paper, and did not mean to imply that an AMPAR trafficking impairment is the direct cause of the loss LTP, although for all alternative explanations AMPAR and NMDAR trafficking impairments would be at least indirect causes for the loss of LTP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3.

Moreover, the results from <italic>Cbln2</italic> conditional KO mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and <italic>Cbln1</italic>/2 double conditional KO mice (Figure 5) are nearly identical, suggesting that there is no major genetic background effect.</p><p>We also agree that quantifications of NMDAR mEPSCs are questionable, and believe that we have presented these data in the paper with the appropriate caution. Our point here is that, different from AMPAR mEPSCs, NMDAR mEPSCs exhibit no increase. We used a holding potential of +60 mV even though the baseline noise is much higher because the higher holding potential increases the driving force and thereby enhances the NMDAR mEPSC amplitude. This enabled us to estimate NMDAR mEPSCs. After averaging many events, which reduced the baseline noise dramatically, we quantified the total charge using averaged mEPSC traces from different cells, not individual events. We concur that these data only allow relative conclusions between different genetic conditions, and are not useful as absolute measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1) To address further the role of the Nrx-Cbln-GluD pathway in the control of synaptic formation/development, the authors must perform a detailed and quantitative synaptic analysis of both pre and postsynaptic markers and quantify the density, intensity and apposition of corresponding clusters in the three models (pyramidal neurons from subiculum and mPFC and cerebellar Purkinje cells).

The statement that PF synapses develop initially normally but are subsequently lost is therefore incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified this statement to say that at least some PF synapses develop initially normally and are subsequently eliminated. Obviously the existing data do not allow conclusions about whether PF synapses emerging during the first 10 postnatal days develop normally and are eliminated, or simply do not develop – there is no information on this point – the only available information is that at least some PF synapses initially develop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) L114 – 'an RNAi-induced suppression of Cbln2 expression was found to suppress formation of excitatory synapse numbers in the CA1 region of the hippocampus'. This citation is not correct as Tao et al., performed RNAi-mediated GluD1 knock-down +/- Cbln2 overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, and we have amended the statement. Please note that the CA1 region neurons manipulated by Tao et al., do not express endogenous <italic>Cbln1</italic> or <italic>Cbln2</italic>, nor do the presynaptic CA3 inputs onto these neurons express these genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) L114-L118 – The authors compare studies that used different readouts to monitor synapse number. While Tao et al., quantified spine number and AMPAR / NMDAR-EPSCs in 6d organotypic slices or acute slices from 1 month-old mice, Seigneur and Südhof, as in the present study, quantified average vGluT1 staining intensity from histological sections. The comparison is thus limited and the different methods to quantify synapses should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>Again this is correct, except that the Seigneur and Südhof paper also measured protein levels, and that additional Seigneur et al., papers measured the synapse density immunocytochemically.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) L121-L122 – 'which is also puzzling since Cbln4 does not bind to GluD1 (Zhong et al., 2017; Cheng et al., 2016)'. Both studies tested the binding of Cblns to GluD2, not GluD1. Moreover, Cheng et al., only looked at Cbln1, not Cbln4. Therefore, the citations are not accurate.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the statement and the citations. However, given the fact that GluD1 and GluD2 are highly homologous, that they equally bind to <italic>Cbln1</italic> and <italic>Cbln2</italic>, that they can substitute each other functionally, and that GluD2 doesn’t bind <italic>Cbln4</italic> , it seems highly likely to us that GluD1 will also not bind to Cbln4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) L272 – 'Cbln1 is also expressed in the subiculum, albeit at lower levels'. The images from figure S3 show no Cbln1 mRNA signal (in agreement with Otsuka et al., 2016). The authors should change the image and/or provide some quantitative analysis to support this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed this suggestion. Please see our response to introductory point 4 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figure 6C – It is not clear how AMPAR-EPSCs and NMDAR-EPSCs were normalized across recordings for experiments performed in the mPFC since no input-output curve was performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added more details of this measurement in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) L492 – the argument that 'overactivation of AMPARs may lead to synaptotoxicity thereby explaining synapse loss' is interesting but not supported by any data in the paper nor by relevant citations. It should therefore be discussed further. Actually, the decrease in NMDARs is not in favor of the synaptotoxicity hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. It was offered only as a possible explanation, not as a conclusion. However, NMDARs are not essential for synaptotoxicity since AMPAR-induced depolarization induces calcium-influx via voltage-gated channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) The discrepancy between the current study and previous reports needs to be further discussed. In particular, Tao et al., reported that Cbln2 overexpression enhances AMPAR and NMDAR EPSCs amplitudes while the present study shows that Cbln2 KO enhances AMPAR EPSCs while decreasing NMDAR-current. The surprising similar effect of Cbln2 overexpression and KO on AMPARs-EPSCs needs to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. We were also surprised by our totally different observations, but please note that the CA1 neurons studied by Tao et al., do not detectably express either <italic>Cbln1</italic> or <italic>Cbln2</italic>, nor do the CA3 input neurons. It is possible that overexpression of <italic>Cbln2</italic> in neurons that don’t normally express it triggers unpredictable signaling pathways.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have made several improvements and addressed many of my criticisms.

This sentence is misleading as it suggests that PF synapses form normally and that the decreased number entirely results from abnormal elimination. Actually, as acknowledged by the authors, the current data do not allow to exclude the possibility that the GluD2 KO impairs the critical phase of PF synapse formation which occurs during the 2nd and 3rd weeks. Therefore, this claim should be toned down.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. It is correct that we cannot exclude the possibility that the GluD2 KO impairs the critical phase of PF synapse formation which occurs during the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> weeks. However, they are developing normally at the very beginning as shown in the paper of Kurihara et al., 1997.

In this regard, PC spines cannot be used as a proxy for synapse number and a direct comparison with PFC is not appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. This is an important point. We don’t quite agree with the reviewer’s strong statement “that it is well established that PC spines spontaneously form and can remain ‘free’ even in the absence of PF inputs”. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been shown. To take the reviewer’s opinion into account, however, we have now rephased the incriminated sentence in our manuscript to say</p><p>“Even in the cerebellum of <italic>Cbln1</italic> KO mice, the observed synapse loss is not accompanied by an equivalent decrease in spine density (Hirai et al., 2005), and it is unknown whether ‘naked’ spines form by itself or represent the remnants of synapses that have been lost.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, while data from the authors do support that Nrx-Cbln-GluD signaling is not required for synapse formation in PFC and subiculum (which does not mean that they do not play any role), I think that the idea that the impact of Cbln / GluD2 deletion on PF synapse number in PCs primarily results from increased elimination rather than defect in synapse formation is only weakly supported by published data and appears overstated through the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point of discussion since the opinions on this point clearly differ among scientists. In our manuscript, we emphasized that cerebellins are essential for regulating synaptic properties but not for synapse number in PFC and subiculum. Indeed, deletions of Cbln1 and GluD2 cause a significant, albeit partial, loss of synapses in cerebellum. This loss may be due to a lack of synapse formation, but the literature shows that at least some of the loss is due to an elimination of synapses that have been formed.</p><p>Since the cerebellum is not a focus of our study, we have left this question open.</p></body></sub-article></article>
