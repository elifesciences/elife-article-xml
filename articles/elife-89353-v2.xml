Silenced genomic regions can be classified as either euchromatic or heterochromatic, and are targeted by genetically separable epigenetic pathways. In plants, the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway targets mostly euchromatic regions, while CMT DNA methyltransferases are mainly associated with heterochromatin. However, many epigenetic features - including DNA methylation patterning - are largely indistinguishable between these regions, so how the functional separation is maintained is unclear. The linker histone H1 is preferentially localized to heterochromatin and has been proposed to restrict RdDM from encroachment. To test this hypothesis, we followed RdDM genomic localization in an <italic>h1</italic> mutant by performing ChIP-seq on the largest subunit, NRPE1, of the central RdDM polymerase, Pol V. Loss of H1 resulted in NRPE1 enrichment predominantly in heterochromatic TEs. Increased NRPE1 binding was associated with increased chromatin accessibility in <italic>h1</italic>, suggesting that H1 restricts NRPE1 occupancy by compacting chromatin. However, RdDM occupancy did not impact H1 localization, demonstrating that H1 hierarchically restricts RdDM positioning. H1 mutants experience major symmetric (CG and CHG) DNA methylation gains, and by generating an <italic>h1/nrpe1</italic> double mutant, we demonstrate these gains are largely independent of RdDM. However, loss of NRPE1 occupancy from a subset of euchromatic regions in <italic>h1</italic> corresponded to the loss of methylation in all sequence contexts, while at ectopically bound heterochromatic loci, NRPE1 deposition correlated with increased methylation specifically in the CHH context. Additionally, we found that H1 similarly restricts the occupancy of the methylation reader, SUVH1, and polycomb-mediated H3K27me3. Together, the results support a model whereby H1 helps maintain the exclusivity of heterochromatin by preventing encroachment from other competing pathways.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>RdDM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>URF\R1\201016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>C Jake</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM130272</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacobsen</surname><given-names>Steven E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacobsen</surname><given-names>Steven E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The efficient deployment of RdDM for transposon silencing is hierarchically controlled by the linker histone H1.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic genomes are compartmentalized into euchromatic and heterochromatin regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ruiz-Velasco and Zaugg, 2017</xref>). In euchromatin, nucleosomes are more accessible, while in heterochromatin nucleosomes are more compacted and restrictive to transcription. Protein coding genes are typically euchromatic, while non-coding and repetitive elements more often reside in heterochromatin. However, transposable elements, which are targeted for DNA methylation and silencing, are found in both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourque et al., 2018</xref>). The pathways responsible for deposition of methylation and silencing of TEs in these different regions are functionally and genetically distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Du et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In plants, euchromatic repetitive regions are targeted by the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway (RdDM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erdmann and Picard, 2020</xref>), in which the concerted action of non-coding RNA polymerases and small RNAs direct the DNA methyltransferase, DRM2, to specific sites of the genome. Newly invading genetic elements are targeted by the ‘non-canonical’ RdDM pathway, and involve the action of Pol II derived small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cuerda-Gil and Slotkin, 2016</xref>). Once established, the canonical RdDM pathway takes over, whereby small RNAs are generated by the plant-specific polymerase IV (Pol IV). In both cases, a second plant-specific polymerase, Pol V, is an essential downstream component. Pol V transcribes scaffold transcripts to which Argonaute-bound small RNAs can bind through base complementarity to recruit DRM2 to direct DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wierzbicki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wierzbicki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>). The recruitment of Pol V to chromatin is stabilized by interaction with the DNA methylation readers SUVH2 and SUVH9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). However, methylation alone is not sufficient to explain Pol V occupancy, as Pol V is restricted to the edges of long TEs and euchromatic methylated regions, despite methylation levels being high in the bodies of long TEs and in heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, additional mechanisms must exist to regulate Pol V occupancy.</p><p>Heterochromatin is targeted for DNA methylation and silencing by CMT methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>). CMT3 and CMT2 are responsible for CHG and CHH methylation maintenance, respectively, at these regions. The CMTs form an epigenetic feedback loop with the KYP family of H3K9me2 methyltransferases, thereby maintaining high levels of repression-associated non-CG methylation and H3K9me2 at heterochromatic regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2018</xref>). As both DNA methylation and H3K9me2 are known to recruit components of the RdDM pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Law et al., 2013</xref>), it is unclear how these regions remain functionally separated from RdDM.</p><p>The linker histone H1 associates with nucleosomes to modulate chromatin accessibility and higher order structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Saha and Dalal, 2021</xref>). H1 binds to linker DNA as it exits from the nucleosome dyad and reduces linker DNA flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bednar et al., 2017</xref>). In plants, H1 is preferentially associated with heterochromatin, where it contributes to chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rutowicz et al., 2019</xref>). Genetic evidence suggests that the chromatin remodeler DDM1 displaces H1 at heterochromatic TEs to facilitate access of CMT methyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>), while biochemical data suggests that this effect could be indirect, via DDM1s interaction with the heterochromatin associated histone variant, H2A.W (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osakabe et al., 2021</xref>). Why DDM1 grants CMTs but not RdDM access to H1-containing nucleosomes is not clear. Recent structural data shows that nucleosome-bound DDM1 promotes DNA sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2024</xref>), which may be sufficient for CMT to deposit methylation, but not for the RdDM machinery to become established. H1 also plays a key role in shaping nuclear architecture and preventing ectopic polycomb-mediated H3K27me3 deposition in telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teano et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Since H1 physically locks genomic DNA to the nucleosome and is preferentially associated with heterochromatin, it is a promising candidate for preventing RdDM encroachment into these regions. Recent evidence supports this hypothesis, with RdDM-associated small RNAs becoming more heterochromatically enriched in <italic>h1</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Papareddy et al., 2020</xref>). However, small RNAs are not a direct readout of functional RdDM activity and Pol IV-dependent small RNAs are abundant in regions of the genome that do not require RdDM for methylation maintenance and that do not contain Pol V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>). Here we directly tested whether RdDM occupancy is affected by loss of H1, by taking advantage of an endogenous Pol V antibody (which recognizes Pol V’s largest subunit, NRPE1). We found that <italic>h1</italic> antagonizes NRPE1 occupancy throughout the genome, particularly in heterochromatic regions. This effect was not limited to RdDM, similarly impacting both the methylation reader complex component, SUVH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 2018</xref>), and polycomb-mediated H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teano et al., 2023</xref>). These results suggest that H1 acts in part to restrict the function of other epigenetic pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To understand how H1 affects RdDM occupancy, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) with a native antibody against NRPE1 (the largest catalytic subunit of Pol V, previously validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2018</xref>]). Two biological replicates of ChIP-seq in wild-type control Col-0 and in <italic>h1.1–1/h1.2–1</italic> double mutant (hereafter referred to as WT and <italic>h1,</italic> respectively) were performed. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Böhmdorfer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>), NRPE1 was enriched over short TEs and at the edges of long TEs in WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). In the <italic>h1</italic> mutant, however, NRPE1 enrichment was markedly increased, with NRPE1 invading the heterochromatic bodies of long TEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The negative correlation between NRPE1 enrichment and TE length observed in WT was reverted in the <italic>h1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests that mutation of <italic>h1</italic> facilitates the invasion of NRPE1 to more heterochromatic regions, in which long TEs tend to reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with this, NRPE1 increased more over heterochromatin associated CMT2 dependent hypo-CHH differentially methylated regions (DMRs) than at the RdDM associated DRM2 dependent CHH sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The preferential enrichment of NRPE1 in <italic>h1</italic> was more pronounced at TEs that overlapped with heterochromatin associated mark, H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Comparing NRPE1 occupancy over TEs that had previously been classified by as either ‘euchromatic’ or ‘heterochromatic’ (based on a broad range of features and small RNA expression dynamics during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Papareddy et al., 2020</xref>), again, we found a striking increase in NRPE1 at heterochromatic over euchromatic TEs in <italic>h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). From a chromosomal viewpoint, NRPE1 was preferentially enriched over pericentromeric regions in <italic>h1</italic>, and showed corresponding depletion from the more euchromatic chromosomal arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we found no evidence for increased expression of NRPE1 or other methylation pathway components known to be involved in Pol V loading or stability in the <italic>h1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Together, the results indicate that H1 broadly restricts NRPE1 access to chromatin, and that this effect is more pronounced in heterochromatic regions of the genome. As H1 itself is preferentially localized to heterochromatin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2020</xref>), this suggests that H1 directly antagonizes RdDM occupancy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NRPE1 accumulates in heterochromatin in an <italic>h1</italic> mutant background.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome browser image showing increased NRPE1 enrichment in <italic>h1</italic> over heterochromatic (long, H3K9me2 enriched) and not euchromatic (short, not H3K9me2 enriched) transposable elements (TEs).

Loss of H1-mediated compaction in heterochromatin may be the indirect result of loss of heterochromatin-associated marks such as H3K9me2.

For this, we took advantage of the ZF-DMS3 transgenic lines that we previously characterized, in which zinc finger (ZF) fused DMS3 can recruit endogenous NRPE1 to &gt;10,000 ectopic sites throughout the genome, corresponding to ZF ‘off-target’ binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallego-Bartolomé et al., 2019</xref>). With these lines, we performed NRPE1 and H1 ChIP-seq in parallel. Compared to the non-transgenic control, we confirmed that NRPE1 was highly enriched at these ‘off-target’ regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, with the same material, we observed no depletion of H1 at the ectopically bound NRPE1 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We validated the quality of our H1 ChIPs, demonstrating antibody specificity, showing that they follow the previously described profiling patterns over H2A.W associated TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>), H3K27me3 marked/unmarked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teano et al., 2023</xref>), and that H1.2 occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Teano et al., 2023</xref>) is similarly enriched over our H1 peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To exclude the possibility that NRPE1 alone may be insufficient to evict H1, but that the fully functioning RdDM pathway may be required (which constitutes at least 32 described proteins acting in concert [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>]), we focused on the subset of ZF-DMS3 off-target sites that experience hyper-CHH methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gallego-Bartolomé et al., 2019</xref>). The gain of ectopic methylation at these regions indicates that the full RdDM pathway is recruited and functions to deposit de novo methylation. However, even at these regions where H1 is mildly enriched in WT, we saw no evidence for H1 depletion in the ZF-DMS3 transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Together, these results indicate that H1 hierarchically and non-reciprocally restricts RdDM from overaccumulation in heterochromatin.</p><p>Given our observation that NRPE1 is redistributed in <italic>h1</italic>, we wondered whether this could help to explain some of the unusual methylation defects observed in the <italic>h1</italic> mutant. For instance, <italic>h1</italic> mutants experience contrasting loss and gain of DNA methylation at euchromatic and heterochromatic TEs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>). Previous explanations to account for this suggested that the <italic>h1</italic> afforded increased accessibility of euchromatic TEs may promote increased access by activation-associated chromatin modifying enzymes, which in turn antagonize DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>). Another non-mutually exclusive scenario is that euchromatic loss and heterochromatic gain of methylation are caused by the relative shift of RdDM from euchromatin to heterochromatin. To directly test this possibility, we generated two independent NRPE1 CRISPR knockouts in the <italic>h1</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>), and performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) analysis, alongside <italic>nrpe1</italic>, <italic>h1,</italic> and WT controls. We confirmed <italic>nrpe1</italic> loss of function in the independent CRISPR KO lines by plotting CHH methylation over NRPE1 associated high confidence DMRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), finding that CHH methylation is entirely abolished over these regions in both <italic>nrpe1/h1</italic> lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Heterochromatic TEs experienced major increases in CG and CHG methylation in <italic>h1</italic> as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>), and these were independent of NRPE1 function, as the same increases were observed in <italic>nrpe1/h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). CHH levels were largely unchanged at heterochromatic TEs in all mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). At euchromatic TEs, CG and CHG methylation levels were largely unchanged in <italic>h1</italic>, while CHH levels were markedly reduced as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). CHH methylation levels were further reduced in <italic>nrpe1</italic>, consistent with the well-established role of RdDM in maintaining CHH at euchromatic TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stroud et al., 2013</xref>), with the additional mutation of <italic>h1</italic> in <italic>nrpe1/h1</italic> having a minimal effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, we noticed that the loss of CHG methylation in <italic>nrpe1</italic> was largely rescued in the <italic>nrpe1/h1</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This striking effect was specific to euchromatic TEs. NRPE1 is therefore required for CHG methylation maintenance at euchromatic TEs and in the absence of H1, loss of RdDM can be functionally compensated for by other methylation pathways. This compensation is likely due to the action of CMT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>).

Consistent with the average methylation chromosomal and TE plots, these hyper CHG DMRs were highly enriched over pericentromeric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To gain insight into the functional context of methylation in these regions, we performed an overlap analysis between <italic>h1</italic> hyper CHG DMRs and DMRs from 96 other <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene silencing mutants that were published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stroud et al., 2013</xref>).

To explicitly investigate these ectopically bound loci, we compared NRPE1 enrichment in WT versus <italic>h1</italic> and identified 15,075 peaks that have significantly higher NRPE1 signal in the <italic>h1</italic> mutant. At these regions, CG and CHG methylation changes broadly mirrored that of heterochromatic TEs, again supporting the notion that NRPE1 primarily redistributes to heterochromatic regions of the genome in <italic>h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This indicates that NRPE1 facilitates active deposition of CHH methylation at these newly bound locations.

As H1 likely restricts access by reducing chromatin accessibility at these regions, we reasoned that this effect would not be RdDM specific and could affect other machinery in a similar manner. The SUVH1 methyl binding protein directly binds CHH methylation in vitro, yet shows strong preferential recruitment to RdDM over CMT dependent sites in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 2018</xref>). Along with SUVH3, SUVH1 functions to protect the expression of genes residing nearby to RdDM-targeted transposable elements by recruiting DNAJ1/2 transcriptional activators. We therefore wondered whether the SUVH1’s occupancy might also be affected by H1. To test this, we performed ChIP-seq on SUVH1-3xFLAG in an <italic>h1</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As with NRPE1, SUVH1 was generally enriched throughout the genome in <italic>h1</italic>, but the effect was strongest over heterochromatin (long TEs, <italic>cmt2</italic>-dependent hypo-CHH DMRs, and heterochromatic TEs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). At the transcript level, we saw no evidence that SUVH1 or related complex components are upregulated in the <italic>h1</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), however, we cannot rule out the possibility that the SUVH1-3xFLAG transgene is expressed more highly in <italic>h1</italic>. Teano et al recently showed that polycomb dependent H3K27me3 is redistributed in <italic>h1</italic>. We compared sites that gain NRPE1 to sites that gain H3K27me3 in <italic>h1</italic>, finding a statistically significant overlap (2.4 fold enrichment over expected, hypergeometric test p-value 2.1e<sup>–71</sup>). Reciprocally, sites that lose NRPE1 were significantly enriched for overlap with H3K27me3 loss regions (1.6 fold over expected, hypergeometric test p-value 1.4e<sup>–4</sup>). This indicates that RdDM and H3K27me3 patterning are similarly modulated by H1. To directly test this, we reanalyzed the H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data from Teano et al., finding coincident enrichment and depletion of H3K27me3 at sites that gain and lose NRPE1 in <italic>h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Therefore, H1 acts in a non-RdDM-specific manner, to prevent euchromatic machinery from heterochromatic encroachment, likely through promoting nucleosome compaction and restricting access to chromatin.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>SUVH1 and H3K27me3 encroaches heterochromatin in an <italic>h1</italic> mutant background.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome browser image showing SUVH1 re-localization in <italic>h1</italic> mirrors that of NRPE1.

This ectopic accumulation results in modest but detectable NRPE1-dependent methylation, and it would be interesting to determine whether Pol V transcript production and DRM2 methyltransferase recruitment occur in a similar manner to euchromatin in these regions. It is important to note that NRPE1 binding was generally increased in the <italic>h1</italic> mutant (both euchromatin and heterochromatin), consistent with H1’s widespread occupancy through the genome, but that the effect was strongest in heterochromatin where H1 shows maximal enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rutowicz et al., 2019</xref>). The antagonism of RdDM by H1 is non-reciprocal, as H1 levels were not affected by RdDM loss, or artificial gain at ectopic regions of the genome. H1-mediated restriction could be in part due to its structural capacity to reduce linker DNA flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bednar et al., 2017</xref>), thereby reducing polymerase access to unwind and interact with genomic DNA. Pol V requires the DDR complex for efficient association with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wongpalee et al., 2019</xref>), so the presence of H1 could present an additional barrier to this complex. Mammalian H1 has been shown to compact chromatin in part through the phase-separating property of its highly charged intrinsically disordered domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gibson et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this, very recent work in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed that H1 induced phase separation and that this capacity was essential for the stability of heterochromatic nuclear foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, another possibility is that high H1 occupancy creates a biophysical environment that excludes Pol V and related complexes. Our data together with the observed heterochromatic encroachment of Pol IV-dependent small RNAs in <italic>h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Papareddy et al., 2020</xref>)<italic>,</italic> along with H1’s recently described role in preventing spurious antisense transcription at protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi et al., 2020</xref>), support a polymerase indiscriminate model for H1’s antagonism.</p><p>Small RNAs are relatively abundant in heterochromatin, despite Pol lV and RdDM being dispensable for methylation in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that Pol IV occupies heterochromatin, but that RdDM is either impotent for methylation deposition or acts redundantly with the CMT/KYP pathway. Here we detect NRPE1-dependent methylation at heterochromatic loci in <italic>h1,</italic> and combined with the finding that Pol V does not appreciably enter these regions in WT, suggests that H1 prevents RdDM from fully mobilizing in these regions by blocking Pol V. Recent evidence suggests that Pol V can be directly recruited by small RNAs to establish methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sigman et al., 2021</xref>), and therefore mechanisms that preclude Pol V recruitment to heterochromatin would be particularly crucial in preventing redundant RdDM activity at regions where methylation has already been established.</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, RdDM targets evolutionarily young transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhong et al., 2012</xref>). H1 therefore helps to improve the efficiency of RdDM by focusing it on TEs with the greatest potential to mobilize. As transposons age, they eventually become targeted by CMTs. How this transition occurs is unclear, but our results indicate a potential role for the progressive accumulation of H1 in this process. Interestingly in tomato, CMTs rather than RdDM target the evolutionarily younger elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang and Baulcombe, 2020</xref>), therefore it will be important to determine whether H1 plays a similar role in maintaining the barrier between methylation pathways in this context. Recent work has shown that H1 co-operates with H2A.W to promote compaction at heterochromatic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bourguet et al., 2021</xref>).

Most of the authors' claims concerning H1 and RNA polymerase V (Pol V) are backed by convincing and independent lines of evidence. However, Pol V produces noncoding transcripts that act as scaffold RNAs, which AGO4-bound siRNAs recognize in plant chromatin to mediate RNA-directed DNA methylation.

Harris and colleagues have extended this work and shown that histone H1 function also antagonizes Pol V occupancy in the context of constitutive heterochromatin. The authors thus provide important evidence to show that H1 limits the encroachment of both polymerases Pol IV and Pol V into plant heterochromatin.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89353.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The main conclusion of the manuscript is that the presence of linker Histone H1 protects Arabidopsis pericentromeric heterochromatic regions and longer transposable elements from encroachment by other repressive pathways. The manuscript focuses on the RNA-dependent DNA-methylation (RdDM) pathway but indirectly finds that other pathways must also be ectopically enriched.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors present diverse sets of genomic data comparing Arabidopsis wild-type and h1 mutant background allowing an analysis of differential recruitment of RdDM component NPRE1, which is related to changes in DNA methylation and H1 coverage. The manuscript also contains recruitment data for SUVH1 in wild-type and h1 mutant backgrounds.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors make use of a line that recruits NRPE1 ectopically to show that H1 occupancy is not altered because of this recruitment. These data clearly show that there is a hierarchy in which DNA-methylation is impacted by presence of H1 while H1 distribution is independent of DNA-methylation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript is driven by a strong and reasonable hypothesis that absence of H1 results increased access of chromatin binding factors and that this explains how the RdDM machinery is restricted from encroaching heterochromatic regions, which are particularly enriched in H1. Indeed, increased binding of NPRE1 at pericentromeric sites is observed; however, the major DNA-methylation changes at these sites are symmetric and not related to the RdDM pathway. Thus, the authors propose that many factors redistribute, which is again reasonable. The authors show redistribution of SUVH1 and relate their data to a previous report showing redistribution of the PcG machinery in H1 depletion mutants (Teano et al. in Cell reports Volume 42, Issue 8, 29 August 2023), but the manuscript provides limited mechanistic insight as to why there is a strong increase in heterochromatin symmetric DNA-methylation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89353.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>C Jake</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Cambridge</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhong</surname><given-names>Zhenhui</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Los Angeles</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ichino</surname><given-names>Lucia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Los Angeles</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Suhua</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Los Angeles</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jacobsen</surname><given-names>Steven E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Los Angeles</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Pg. 3 - lines 51-53: &quot;Once established, the canonical RdDM pathway takes over, whereby small RNAs are generated by the plant-specific polymerase IV (Pol IV). In both cases, a second plant-specific polymerase, Pol V, is an essential downstream component.&quot; The authors' intro omits an important aspect of Pol V's function in RdDM, which is quite relevant to their study. Pol V transcribes DNA to synthesize noncoding RNA scaffolds, to which AGO4-bound 24 nt siRNAs are thought to base pair, leading to DRM2 recruitment for cytosine methylation near to these nascent Pol V transcripts (Wierzbicki et al 2008 Cell; Wierzbicki et al. 2009 Nat Genet). I recommend that the authors cite these key studies.</p></disp-quote><p>These citations have now been added (see line 57).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors provide compelling evidence that Pol V redistributes to ectopic heterochromatin regions in h1 mutants (e.g., Fig1a browser shot). Presumably, this would allow Pol V to transcribe these regions in h1 mutants, whereas it could not transcribe them in WT plants. Have the authors detected and/or quantified Pol V transcripts in the h1 mutant compared to WT plants at the sites of Pol V redistribution (detected via NRPE1 ChIP)?</p></disp-quote><p>Robust detection of Pol V transcripts can be experimentally challenging, and instead we quantify and detect NRPE1 dependent methylation at these regions (Fig 5), which occurs downstream of Pol V transcript production. However, we note detecting Pol V transcripts as a potential future direction in the discussion (see line 263).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pg. 5 - lines 101-102: Figure 1e - &quot;The preferential enrichment of NRPE1 in h1 was more pronounced at TEs that overlapped with heterochromatin associated mark, H3K9me2 (Fig. 1e). Was a statistical test performed to determine that the overall differences are significant only at TE sites with H3K9me2? Can the sites without H3K9me2 also be differentiated statistically?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there is a statistically significant difference between WT and h1 at both the H3K9me2 marked and unmarked TEs (Wilcoxon rank sum tests, see updated Fig 1e). The size of the effect is larger for the H3K9me2 marked TEs (median difference of 0.41 vs 0.16). Median values have now been added to the boxplots so that this is directly viewable to the reader (Fig 1e). This reflects the general increase in NRPE1 occupancy in <italic>h1</italic> mutants through the genome, with the effect consistently stronger in heterochromatin. In our initial version of the manuscript, we summarise the effect as follows “We found that h1 antagonizes NRPE1 occupancy throughout the genome, particularly at heterochromatic regions” (previous version line 83, current version line 95). Although important exceptions exist (see Fig 5, NRPE1 and DNA methylation loss in h1), we now make this point even more explicit, and have updated the manuscript at several locations (abstract line 26, results line 245, discussion line 265).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pg. 5 - lines 108-110: The authors state, &quot;Importantly, we found no evidence for increased NRPE1 expression at the mRNA or protein level in the h1 mutant (Suppl. Fig. 2).&quot; But the authors did observe reduced NRPE1 transcript levels in h1 mutants, in their re-analysis of RNA-seq data and reduced NRPE1 protein signals via western blot in (Suppl. Fig. 2), which should be reported here in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>As described further below, we reanalysed <italic>h1</italic> RNA-seq from scratch, and see no evidence for significant differential gene expression of NRPE1. This table and analysis are now provided in Supplementary Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, the above logic about NRPE1 expression in h1 mutants assumes that NRPE1 is the stoichiometrically limiting subunit for Pol V assembly and function in vivo, but this is not known to be the case:</p><p>(1) While NRPE1's expression is somewhat reduced (and not increased) in h1 mutant plants, we cannot be certain that other genes influencing Pol V stability or recruitment are unaffected by h1 mutants. I thus recommend that the authors perform RT-qPCR directly on the WT and h1 mutant materials used in their current study, quantifying NRPE1, NRPE2, NRPE5, DRD1, DMS3, RDM1, SUVH2 and SUVH9 transcript levels.</p><p>(2) Normalizations used to compare samples should be included with RT-qPCR and western assays. An appropriate house-keeping gene like Actin2 or Ubiquitin could be used to normalize the RT-qPCR. Protein sample loading in Suppl. Fig. 2 could be checked by Coomassie staining and/or an antibody detection of a house-keeping protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a full re-analysis of <italic>h1</italic> RNA-seq (data from Choi et al 2020) focusing on transcriptional changes of DNA methylation machinery genes in the <italic>h1</italic> mutant. Of the 61 genes analysed, only AGO6 and AGO9 were found to be differentially expressed (2-3 fold upregulation). This analysis is now included as a table</p><p>(Supplementary Table 1). The western blot has been moved to Supplementary Fig 3 to now illustrate antibody specificity and H1 loss in the <italic>h1</italic> mutant lines, so NRPE1 itself serves as a loading control (Supplementary Fig 3a).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pg. 6 - lines 129-131: The authors state that &quot;over NRPE1 defined peaks (where NRPE1 occupancy is strongest in WT) we observed no change in H1 occupancy in nrpe1 (Fig 2b). The results indicate that H1 does not invade RdDM regions in the nrpe1 mutant background.&quot; This conclusion assumes that the author's H1 ChIP is successfully detecting H1 occupancy. However, in Fig 2d there does not appear to be H1 enrichment or peaks as visualized across the 10766 ZF-DMS3 off-target loci, or even at the selected 451 ZFDMS3 off-target hyper DMRs, where the putative signal for H1 enrichment on the metaplot center is extremely weak/non-existent.</p><p>As a reference for H1 enrichment in chromatin (e.g., looking where H2A.W antagonizes H1 occupancy) one can compare analyses in Bourguet et al (2021) Nat Commun, involving co-authors of the current study. Bourguet et al (2021) Fig 5b show a metaplot of H1 levels centered on H2A.W peaks with H1 ChIP signal clearly tapering away from the metaplot center point peak. To my eye, the H1 ChIP metaplots for ZF-DMS3 offtarget loci in the current manuscript (Fig 2d) resemble &quot;shuffled peaks&quot; controls like those in Fig 5b of Bourguet et al (2021).</p><p>Can one definitively interpret Fig 2d as showing RdDM &quot;not reciprocally affecting H1 localization&quot; without first showing the specificity of the ChIP-seq results in a genotype where H1 occupancy changes? Alternatively, could this dataset be displayed with Deeptools heatmaps to strengthen the evidence that the authors are detecting H1 occupancy/enrichment genome-wide, before diving into WT/nrpe1 mutant analysis at ZF-DMS3 off-target loci?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion from the reviewer. We have now included several analyses that assess and demonstrate the quality of our H1 ChIP-seq profiles. First, as suggested by the reviewer, we show that our H1 profiles peak over H2A.W enriched euchromatic TEs as defined by Bourguet et al, mirroring these published findings. Next, we investigated whether our H1 profiles match Teano’s recently described pattern over genes, confirming a similar pattern with 3’ enrichment of H1 over H3K27me3 unmarked genes. Furthermore, we show that the H1 peaks defined here are similarly enriched with GFP tagged H1.2 from the Teano et al. 2023 study. These analyses that validate the quality of our H1 ChIP-seq datasets and bolster the conclusion that NRPE1 redistribution does not affect H1 occupancy. These new analysis are now presented in Supplementary Figure 3 and see line 153.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pg. 8 - lines 228-230: The authors state that, &quot;As with NRPE1, SUVH1 increased in the h1 background significantly more in heterochromatin, with preferential enrichment over long TEs, cmt2 dependent hypo CHH DMRs, and heterochromatic TEs (Fig. 6b).&quot;</p><p>Contrary to the above statement, the violin plots in Fig. 6c show SUVH1 occupancy increasing at euchromatic TEs in the h1 mutant. What statistical test allowed the authors to determine that the increase in h1 occurs &quot;significantly more in heterochromatin&quot;? The authors should critically interpret Fig. 6c and 6d, which are not currently referenced in the results section. More support is needed for the claim that SUVH1 specifically encroaches into heterochromatin in the h1 mutant, rather than just TEs generally (euchromatic and heterochromatic alike).</p></disp-quote><p>Similar to what we see for NRPE1, statistical tests that we have now performed show that SUVH1 is significantly enriched in h1 in all classes. Importantly however, the effect size is larger in all of the heterochromatin associated classes. We display these statistical tests and the median values on the plots so that effects are immediately viewable (see updated Fig 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the authors should verify that SUVH1-3xFLAG transgenes (in the WT and h1 mutant backgrounds, respectively) and endogenous Arabidopsis genes encoding the transcriptional activator complex (SUVH1-SUVH3-DNAJ1-DNAJ2) are not overexpressed in the h1 mutant vs. WT. Higher expression of SUVH1 or limiting factors in the larger complex could explain the observation of increased SUVH1 occupancy in the h1 background.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not see a difference in SUVH1/3/DNAJ1/2 complex gene expression in the <italic>h1</italic> background (see Supplementary Table 1). However, we cannot rule out that that our SUVH1-FLAG line in <italic>h1</italic> is more highly expressed than the corresponding SUVH1-FLAG line in WT. We now note this point in line 248.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pg. 8 - lines 231-232: Here the authors make a sweeping conclusion about H1 demarcating, &quot;the boundary between euchromatic and heterochromatic methylation pathways, likely through promoting nucleosome compaction and restricting heterochromatin access.&quot; I do not see how a H1 boundary between euchromatic and heterochromatic methylation pathways is revealed based on the SUVH1-3xFLAG occupancy data, which shows increased enrichment at every category interrogated in the h1 mutant (Fig 6b,c,d) and all along the baseline too in the h1 mutant browser tracks (Fig 6a). Can the authors provide more examples of this phenomenon (similar to Fig 6a) and better explain why their SUVH1-3xFLAG ChIP supports this demarcation model?</p></disp-quote><p>The general conclusion from SUVH1 about H1’s agnostic role in preventing heterochromatin access is now further supported from our findings with H3K27me3 (see Figure 6e and description from line 250). However, we agree that the demarcation model as initially presented was overly simplistic. This point was also raised by reviewer 2. We have removed the line highlighted by the reviewer in the revised version of the manuscript. In the revised version we clarify that H1 impedes RdDM and associated machinery throughout the genome (consistent with H1’s established broad occupancy across the genome) but this effect is most pronounced in heterochromatin, corresponding to maximal H1 occupancy (abstract line 26, results line 245, discussion line 265).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Corrections:</p><p>Pg. 8 - lines 226-227: &quot;We therefore wondered whether complex's occupancy might also be affected by H1.&quot; The sentence contains a typo, where I assume the authors mean to refer to occupancy by the SUVH1-SUVH3-DNAJ1-DNAJ2 transcriptional activator complex.

There is likely to be some degree of overlap between the categories, but numbers are very different (short TEs (n=820), long TEs (n=155), drm2 DMRs (n=5534), CMT (n=21784)) indicating that the different categories are informative.

Median values have now been added to the boxplots so that this is directly viewable to the reader (Fig 1e). Although important exceptions exist (see Fig 5 – regions that lose NRPE1 and DNA methylation), this reflects the general increase in NRPE1 occupancy in <italic>h1</italic> mutants throughput the genome, with a consistently stronger effect in heterochromatin.

It is also important to note that the reduction is not only observed at the chromosomal level, but also at specific sites. We called differential peaks between WT and <italic>h1</italic> mutant. The &quot;Regions that gain NRPE1 in h1&quot; peaks are more enriched in heterochromatic regions, while &quot; Regions that lose NRPE1 in h1&quot; peaks are more enriched outside heterochromatic regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g.

Are these sites related to the sites taken over by PcG-mediated repression in h1 mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>As described in line 222 (previous version of the manuscript line 206), there are 15,075 sites that gain and 1,859 sites that lose NRPE1 in <italic>h1</italic>. Comparing these sites to</p><p>H3K27me3 in the Teano et al. study was an excellent suggestion. We compared sites that gain NRPE1 to sites that gain H3K27me3 in <italic>h1</italic>, finding a statistically significant overlap (2.4 fold enrichment over expected, hypergeometric test p-value 2.1e-71). Reciprocally, sites that lose NRPE1 were significantly enriched for overlap with H3K27me3 loss regions (1.6 fold over expected, hypergeometric test p-value 1.4e-4). This indicates that RdDM and H3K27me3 patterning are similarly modulated by H1. To directly test this, we reanalysed the H3K27me3 ChIP-seq data from Teano et al., finding coincident gain and loss of H3K27me3 at sites that gain and lose NRPE1 in <italic>h1</italic>. These results are described from line 250 and in Fig 6e, which supports a general role for H1 in preventing heterochromatin encroachment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Lines 166ff and Figure 3: The data walk towards the scenario of pathway redistribution but actually find that RdDM plays a minor role overall as a substantial increase in heterochromatin regions occurs in all contexts and is largely independent of RdDM.</p><p>a. How exactly are DNA-methylation data converted across regions to reach a fraction score from 0 to 1? There is no explanation in the legend for the methods that allow to recapitulate.</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain our methods in full in the Materials and Methods and all the code for generating these has now been deposited on GitHub (https://github.com/Zhenhuiz/H1restricts-euchromatin-associated-methylation-pathways-from-heterochromaticencroachment). Briefly, BSMAP is used to calculate the number of reads that are methylated vs unmethylated on a per-cytosine basis across the genome. Next, the DNA methylation fraction in each region is calculated by adding all the methylation fractions per cytosine in a given window, and divided by the total number of cytosines in that same window (ie mC/(unmC+mC)) i.e. this is expressed as a fraction ranging from 0 to 1.</p><p>“0” indicates this region is not methylated, and “1” indicates this region is fully methylated (every cytosine is 100% methylated).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Kernel plots? These are slang for experts and should be better described. In addition, nothing is really concluded from these plots in the text, although they may be quite informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Kernel density plots show the proportion of TEs that gain or lose methylation in a particular mutant, rather than the overall average as depicted in the methylation metaplots above. We now describe the kernel density plots in more detail in the Figure 3 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 4: This could be a very interesting analysis if the reader could actually understand it.</p><p>a. The legend is minimal. What is the meaning of hypo and hyper regions indicated to the right of Figure 4c?</p><p>b. The color scale represents observed/expected values. What exactly does this mean? Mutant vs WT?</p><p>c. Some comparisons in 4a are cryptic, e.g. h1 nrpe1 nrpe1 vs CHH?</p><p>d. Figure 4d focuses on a correlation square of relevance, but why? Interestingly the square does not correspond to any &quot;hypo&quot; or &quot;hyper&quot; label?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have revised Figure 4 and legend based on these suggestions to clarify all of the above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Lines 226 and Figure 6B. De novo (or increased) targeting of SUVH1 to heterochromatic sites in h1 mutants, similar to NRPE1, is used to support the argument that more access allows other chromatin modifiers to encroach. SUVH1 strongly depends on RdDM for its in vivo binding and may be the least conclusive factor to argue for a &quot;general&quot; encroachment mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers point here. Something that is entirely independent of RdDM following the same pattern would be stronger evidence in favour of general encroachment. Excitingly, this is exactly what we provide evidence for when investigating the interrelationship with H3K27me3 and we appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to check this! This data is now described in Figure 6e and line 250.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>(1) Line 23: &quot;Loss of H1 resulted in heterochromatic TE enrichment by NRPE1.&quot; This does not seem right. NRPE enrichment as TEs</p></disp-quote><p>Modified, (line 26) thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Lines 73-74: The idea that DDM1 displaces H1 in heterochromatic TEs is somewhat counterintuitive to model that heterochromatic TEs are unavailable for RdDM because of the presence of H1. Is this displacement non-permanent and directly linked to interaction with CMT2/3 Met1?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good question and we agree with the reviewer that the effect of DDM1 may only be transient or insufficient to allow for full RdDM assembly, or indeed there may be a direct interaction between DDM1 and CMTs/MET1. During preparation of these revisions, a structure of Arabidopsis nucleosome bound DDM1 was published, which provides some insight by showing that DDM1 promotes DNA sliding. This is at least consistent with the idea of DDM1 causing transient / non-permanent displacement of H1 that would be insufficient for RdDM establishment. We incorporate discussion of these ideas at line 80.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 85: A bit more background on the Reader activator complex should be given. In fact, the reader may not really care that it was more recently discovered (not really recent btw) but what does it actually do?</p></disp-quote><p>We have quite extensively reconfigured this paragraph to take into account our new finding with H3K27me3, such that there is less emphasis on the reader activator complex. The sentence now reads as follows:</p><p>“We found that h1 antagonizes NRPE1 occupancy throughout the genome, particularly at heterochromatic regions. This effect was not limited to RdDM, similarly impacting both the methylation reader complex component, SUVH1 (Harris et al., 2018) and polycomb-mediated H3K27me3 (Teano et al., 2023).” (line 95).</p><p>Also, when describing the experiment the results section (line 241), we now provide more background on SUVH1’s function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Lines 80-81: Since it is already shown that RdDM associated small RNAs are more enriched in h1 at heterochromatin, help us to know what is precisely the added value of studying the enrichment of NRPE1 at these sites.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point. We have the following line: ‘...small RNAs are not a direct readout of functional RdDM activity and Pol IV dependent small RNAs are abundant in regions of the genome that do not require RdDM for methylation maintenance and that do not contain Pol V (Stroud et al., 2014).’ (line 90)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 99: This seems to be the only time where the connection between long TEs and heterochromatic regions is mentioned but no source is cited.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following appropriate citations: (Bourguet et al., 2021; Zemach et al., 2013). (line 110).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Line 100: DMRs is used for the first time here without explanation and full text. The abbreviation is introduced later in the text (Line 187).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we now describe DMRs upon first use, line 112.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 2: Panels 2 c and d should show metaplots for WT and transgenes in one panel. There is something seriously wrong with the normalization in d or the scale for left and right panel is not the same. Neither legend nor methods describe how normalization was performed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, the figure has been corrected. We have updated the Materials and Methods (line 365) and have added codes and pipelines to GitHub to explain the normalisation procedure in more detail (https://github.com/Zhenhuiz/H1restricts-euchromatin-associated-methylation-pathways-from-heterochromaticencroachment).</p></body></sub-article></article>
