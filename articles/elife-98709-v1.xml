Prediabetes affected approximately 720 million individuals worldwide in 2021, with a project to 1 billion people by 2045 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2022</xref>). Approximately 5–10% of people with prediabetes progress to having diabetes each year and the lifetime conversion rate to diabetes could be as high as 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tabák et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ligthart et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, preventing or delaying diabetes development among people with prediabetes will have substantial clinical and public health benefits.</p><p>Although lifestyle modification and medical therapy have been proven to be effective in preventing or delaying the diabetes onset among people with prediabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeFronzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herman, 2023</xref>), the substantial cost of modification programs and medications as well as drug-related side effects limit the widespread delivery of such interventions in this large high-risk population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roberts et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Piller, 2019</xref>). Notably, the progression from prediabetes to diabetes is highly heterogeneous, and a fraction of individuals with prediabetes may regress to normoglycemia without treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shang et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, identifying targeted population who are at high risk of developing diabetes is the key step to tailor precise and efficient interventions. Glycemic indicators alone for risk stratification are deficient, with fasting glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) being convenient but less sensitive, while post-load glucose tolerance being sensitive but unfeasible in practice on a large scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Phillips et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferrannini, 2014</xref>). In addition, several risk assessment models based on conventional clinical variables have been developed, but most of which had comparatively low performance and failed to take follow-up time into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yokota et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Plasma metabolomics using high-throughput techniques could provide a comprehensive profiling of small-molecule metabolites in a specific physiological period, which might yield valuable information for risk prediction. Previous studies have implied that incorporating circulating metabolites into basic models with conventional risk factors could improve prediction of diabetes risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Merino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Peddinti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rebholz et al., 2018</xref>). However, we are aware of only one study that has assessed the relationship between metabolomic profiling and the progression to diabetes among individuals with prediabetes and investigated the predictive values of metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ren et al., 2021</xref>). Nevertheless, it was limited by a nested case–control study design with a relatively short follow-up (median 5 years) and small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = ~300). Whether addition of metabolic biomarkers improves the ability in predicting the progression from prediabetes to diabetes in prospective settings remains largely unknown.</p><p>To address these knowledge gaps, in the current study, we aimed to examine the longitudinal associations of circulating metabolic biomarkers, quantified using high-throughput nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), with the risk of incident diabetes among individuals with prediabetes from the UK Biobank. Moreover, we evaluated whether metabolic signature adds anything to prediction models for diabetes development and risk stratification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The UK Biobank is a large population-based prospective cohort study enrolling more than 500,000 community-dwelling adults from 22 assessment centers across the UK between 2006 and 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sudlow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2012</xref>). Participants completed touchscreen questionnaires and physical measurements and provided blood samples at baseline. The study was approved by the Northwest Multicenter Research Ethics Committee (REC reference for UK Biobank 11/NW/0382), and all participants provided informed consent.</p><p>For the identification of metabolomic biomarkers associated with the progression from prediabetes to diabetes, the current study focused on participants with prediabetes at baseline with available circulating metabolite data. The diagnosis of prediabetes was defined by an HbA1c level of 5.7–6.4% (39–47 mmol/mol) in participants without diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">ElSayed et al., 2023</xref>). After excluding individuals who developed diabetes or died within 1 month from the baseline, 13,489 participants with prediabetes were included in the final analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Metabolite quantification</title><p>The metabolomics analysis of approximately 118,000 non-fasting ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma samples at baseline was performed using the high-throughput NMR platform in Nightingale Health’s laboratories of Finland. Details of the metabolic profiling platform and experimentation have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Würtz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Soininen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, the EDTA samples were collected and stored at −80°C. Before preparation, frozen samples were slowly thawed at +4°C overnight and were centrifuged (3400 × <italic>g</italic>) for 3 min. Each sample was analyzed with a spectrometer and the metabolic biomarkers were quantified using Nightingale Health’s proprietary software. The quality control procedures were implemented during the whole process and only samples and biomarkers that underwent the quality control process were stored in the UK Biobank dataset.</p><p>The metabolic biomarker profiling by Nightingale Health’s NMR platform provides consistent results over time and across spectrometers. Furthermore, the sample preparation is minimal in the Nightingale Health’s metabolic biomarker platform, circumventing all extraction steps. These aspects result in highly repeatable biomarker measurements. Pre-specified quality metrics were agreed between UK Biobank and Nightingale Health to ensure consistent results across the samples, and pilot measurements were conducted. Nightingale Health performed real-time monitoring of the measurement consistency within and between spectrometers throughout the UK Biobank samples. Two control samples provided by Nightingale Health were included in each 96-well plate for tracking the consistency across multiple spectrometers. Furthermore, two blind duplicate samples provided by the UK Biobank were included in each well plate, with the position information unlocked only after results delivery. Coefficient of variation (CV) targets across the metabolic biomarker profile were pre-specified for both Nightingale Health’s internal control samples and UK Biobank’s blind duplicates. The targets were met for each consecutively measured batch of ~25,000 samples. For the majority of the metabolic biomarkers, the CVs were below 5% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/refer.cgi?id=3000">https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/refer.cgi?id=3000</ext-link>).

In the present study, we analyzed 168 metabolic biomarkers that were directly measured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The Townsend Deprivation Index is a composite measure of area-level socioeconomic deprivation, with a higher score indicating higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation. Physical activity was measured by the metabolic equivalent task (MET) (sum of days performing walking, moderate activity, and vigorous activity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liang et al., 2023</xref>).

One point was given for each favorable diet factor and the total diet score ranges from 0 to 5.

Each favorable sleep factor was given a score of 1, with the total sleep score ranging from 0 to 5. The history of dyslipidemia incorporated information on both the medical history of dyslipidemia and the use of lipid-lowering medications.</p><p>Physical measurements including blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference (WC), and hip circumference (HC) were measured using calibrated instruments with standard protocols by trained nurses. Blood pressure was measured using the Omron automatic digital monitor and two measurements were obtained at a few minutes’ intervals. We calculated the mean systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from two measurements. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m²). The HbA1c level was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography with the VARIANT II Turbo analyzer (Bio-Rad Laboratories).

The potential confounders were selected based on prior knowledge of the risk factors for diabetes. Metabolites that were significantly associated with incident diabetes (p &lt; 0.05/168) were retained.</p><p>Second, we performed priority-Lasso to deal with multicollinearity in high dimensional data and to retain variables with nonzero coefficients. Priority-Lasso is a Lasso-based intuitive analysis strategy, which uses prior knowledge regarding the outcome by defining the blocks of different types of predictor variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klau et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we defined the 24 covariates as block 1, while all metabolites significantly associated with diabetes risk in the CPH model were defined as block 2.

Models were built by 10-fold cross-validation through the ‘caret’ package. Common signals detected across diverse approaches are more likely to represent the strongest and true patterns in the data.

RSF, as a machine-learning method, is designed to be used specifically for survival outcome prediction and has shown promising results in various settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rahman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kwak et al., 2021</xref>). It builds many decision trees using split points based on the log-rank test to identify different survival statuses and produces the predicted probability for an individual derived from the average prediction across all trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ishwaran et al., 2008</xref>). The RSF model was fitted using the ‘randomForestSRC’ package and the grid search method was used for hyperparameter tuning (number of trees, number of variables to possibly split at each node, and minimum size of terminal node). Specifically, the grid search method was used to tune hyperparameters among the RSF model, through minimizing out-of-sample or out-of-bag error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Janitza and Hornung, 2018</xref>). Each tree in the RSF is constructed from a random sample of the data, typically a bootstrap sample or 63.2% of the sample size (as in the present study). Consequently, not all observations are used to construct each tree. The observations that are not used in the construction of a tree are referred to as out-of-bag observations. In an RSF model, each tree is built from a different sample of the original data, so each observation is ‘out-of-bag’ for some of the trees. The prediction for an observation can then be obtained using only those trees for which the observation was not used for the construction. A classification for each observation is obtained in this way and the error rate can be estimated from these predictions. The resulting error rate is referred to as the out-of-bag error. Through calculating the out-of-bag error in each iteration, the best hyperparameters were finally determined. The hyperparameters to be tuned and range of grid search in the present study were below: number of trees (50–1000, by 50), number of variables to possibly split at each node (3–6, by 1), and minimum size of terminal node (1–20, by 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tian et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Model evaluation</title><p>The model performance was assessed in the test set. The time-dependent area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to evaluate the model’s discrimination ability. Continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI) and absolute integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were used to assess whether adding the selected metabolites could improve risk discrimination and reclassification for the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes over the basic model that was built on 10 conventional clinical variables (age, sex, Townsend Deprivation Index, family history of diabetes mellitus, BMI, WC, HC, SBP, DBP, and HbA1c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). The calibration ability of the model was estimated using calibration curve. Furthermore, we used decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess the clinical usefulness of prediction model-based guidance for prediabetes management, which calculates a clinical ‘net benefit’ for one or more prediction models in comparison to default strategies of treating all or no patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vickers et al., 2019</xref>). To facilitate risk stratification, we classified participants into two risk groups according to the predictive value using ‘surv_cutpoint’ function in the ‘survminer’ R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan et al., 2023</xref>). We also divided participants into three categories according to the tertiles of probability. In addition, we included 90,688 participants with normal glucose from the UK Biobank and divided them into the training and test sets using an 8:2 ratio to further investigate the additive value of the selected metabolites in diabetes prediction among participants with normoglycemia. All analyses were conducted in R software (version 4.2.2). A two-sided p value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. To control for the false discovery rate in the association between multiple metabolic biomarkers and incident diabetes, Bonferroni correction for p value (p &lt; 0.05/168) was used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Among the 13,489 participants with baseline prediabetes, the mean age was 59.6 (SD, 7.1) years, and 6166 (45.7%) were males.

We found that lipoprotein particles, lipoprotein particle size and composition, fatty acids, and amino acids were associated with the risk of incident diabetes. More importantly, our findings suggested that adding the selected metabolites (i.e., cholesteryl esters in large HDL, cholesteryl esters in medium VLDL, triglycerides in very large VLDL, average diameter for LDL particles, triglycerides in IDL, glycine, tyrosine, glucose, and docosahexaenoic acid) could significantly improve the risk prediction of progression from prediabetes to diabetes beyond the conventional clinical variables.</p><p>In the present study, the association between diabetes risk and lipid and lipoprotein profile, including VLDL particles and composition with larger VLDL, HDL particles and composition within larger HDL, triglyceride, smaller HDL and LDL particle sizes, and larger VLDL particle sizes, were broadly consistent with previous studies in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bragg et al., 2022c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mackey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bragg et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bragg et al., 2022a</xref>). BCAAs have been widely reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes, which might impair insulin signaling and lead to increased insulin secretion and pancreatic β-cell exhaustion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Morze et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, genetic association studies have shown higher BCAAs resulting from insulin resistance, which may in turn cause diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lotta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mahendran et al., 2017</xref>). Our study confirmed the vital role of these metabolites in the progression to diabetes among individuals with prediabetes.</p><p>Several risk assessment models for predicting the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yokota et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cahn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yokota et al., 2017</xref> developed a logistic regression model to predict the risk for conversion from prediabetes to diabetes based on family history of diabetes, sex, SBP, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HbA1c, and alanine aminotransferase. The model derived from a retrospective longitudinal study design achieved an AUROC of 0.80 (0.70–0.87) but did not take follow-up time into account. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang et al., 2021</xref> developed a predictive model using three glycemic indicators (FPG, 2 hr postprandial blood glucose [2-hPG], and HbA1c) alone and obtained a relatively low AUROC of 0.732 (95% CI 0.688–0.776). In a cohort study of 852,454 individuals with prediabetes, a machine-learning model predicting the progression to diabetes within 1 year was established using data from electronic medical records (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cahn et al., 2020</xref>). The model built on age, gender, BMI, medication usage, and laboratory results achieved a high AUROC of 0.865 (0.860–0.869). However, the model’s performance over a longer follow-up period was unclear and conventional parameters such as lifestyle, family history of diabetes, or comorbidities were not taken into account.</p><p>Changes in circulating small-molecule metabolites may occur long before the disease onset. Although rapid development in the technology of metabolomics provides a powerful tool for precise disease prediction, few studies have investigated the role of metabolomics-derived metabolic biomarkers in predicting progression from prediabetes to diabetes. To our best knowledge, only one case–control study among 153 individuals with prediabetes and 160 matched controls reported that adding 13 metabolites to conventional clinical variables including BMI, waist–hip ratio, WC, SBP, DBP, triglyceride, LDL, and triglyceride-glucose index improved the risk prediction of diabetes progression within 5 years, with the AUROC increasing from 0.72 to 0.98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ren et al., 2021</xref>). However, the predictive ability of metabolites in prospective settings with large sample size remains uncertain. In this longitudinal study among 13,489 participants with prediabetes, we comprehensively used multiple machine-learning algorithms to identify a panel of nine circulating metabolites that were associated with diabetes incidence during a median follow-up of 13.6 years. The CPH model integrating conventional clinical variables and the selected metabolic signature achieved a comparatively high AUROC of 0.823, 0.830, and 0.801 for 1-, 5-, and 10-year diabetes risk, respectively. Importantly, the addition of the metabolites resulted in a significant improvement in the discrimination ability and risk reclassification of diabetes beyond conventional risk factors. Furthermore, we categorized participants according to the optimal threshold points of the predicted value and found that the high-risk group had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of diabetes than the low-risk group. Most importantly, a model with good discrimination does not necessarily have high clinical value. Hence, DCA was used to compare the clinical utility of the model before and after adding the metabolites, and this showed a higher net benefit for the latter than the basic model, suggesting the addition of the metabolites increased the clinical value of prediction, that is, the potential benefit of guiding management in individuals with prediabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vickers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2023</xref>). These results provided novel evidence supporting the value of metabolic biomarkers in risk prediction and stratification for the progression from prediabetes to diabetes. Considering the epidemic proportion of prediabetes worldwide, even a modest improvement in diabetes risk prediction among individuals with prediabetes will have substantial clinical and public health implications. Early detection of individuals with prediabetes who are at high risk of developing diabetes would not only advance targeted screening initiatives, health management, and interventions but also facilitate a rational allocation of medical resources while avoiding disproportionate healthcare expenditure, which could finally translate into precise and efficient prevention of diabetes. The value of the selected metabolic biomarkers in diabetes prediction was also confirmed in individuals with normal glucose.</p><p>Our study presents several strengths. Circulating metabolites were quantified via NMR-based metabolome profiling within the UK Biobank, which offers metabolite qualification with relatively lower costs and better reproducibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geng et al., 2024</xref>). Additional strengths of our study included large sample size, prospective study design with long-term follow-up, and comprehensive control of covariates. Moreover, we used multiple machine-learning algorithms to identify the consistently important metabolic biomarkers based on which we developed the predictive models. The final model exhibited relatively high performance for 1-, 5-, and 10-year diabetes risk prediction. However, several limitations of our study should be noted. First, since FPG and 2-hPG were not available in the UK Biobank, we defined prediabetes using HbA1c alone and to what extent our results could be extrapolated to other people with prediabetes determined by multiple glycemic indicators requires further investigation. Second, circulating metabolites were measured at baseline, thus their dynamic change over time could not be captured. However, our models showed stable performance in predicting short- and long-term progression to diabetes (1–10 years), indicating the validity of single measurements of metabolic biomarkers for risk prediction. Third, the Nightingale metabolomics platform primarily focused on lipids and lipoprotein sub-fractions, and thus the predictive value of other metabolites in the progression from prediabetes to diabetes warranted further research using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Additionally, the use of non-fasting blood samples might increase inter-individual variation in metabolic biomarker concentrations, however, fasting duration has been reported to account for only a small proportion of variation in plasma metabolic biomarker concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li Gao et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we believe the impact of non-fasting samples on our findings would be minor. Fourth, although incident diabetes cases were ascertained through different data sources, including hospital inpatient records, death registers, and primary care records, some undiagnosed diabetes might have been missed. This misclassification would underestimate the effect of the observed associations between metabolites and diabetes risk. Fifth, we could not draw any conclusion about the causality between the identified metabolites and the risk for progression to diabetes due to the observational nature, which remained to be validated in further experimental studies. Sixth, in this study, the prediction models were established and tested using the UK Biobank dataset, external validation in an independent cohort is warranted to confirm the predictive values of the metabolic biomarkers. Finally, the participants from the UK Biobank were mostly White, which might limit the generalizability of the findings to other populations.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this large prospective study among individuals with prediabetes, we detected a panel of circulating metabolites that were associated with an increased risk of progressing to diabetes.

We set the top 20 variables in the metabolite selection balancing the performance of the final diabetes risk prediction model and the clinical applicability due to measurement costs. We have added this explanation in the “Methods” section.</p><p>“We chose the intersection set of the top 20 most important variables selected by the three machine learning models, after balancing the performance of the final diabetes risk prediction model and the clinical applicability associated with measurement costs of metabolites.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The methods section would benefit from a more detailed exposition of how parameter tuning was conducted and the range of parameters explored during the training of the RSF model.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added a more detailed description of parameters tunning and the range of parameters explored during the training of the RSF model in the “Method S3” section in the Supplementary material.</p><p>“The RSF model was fitted using the “randomForestSRC” package and the grid search method was used for hyperparameter tuning. Specifically, the grid search method was used to tune hyperparameters among the RSF model, through minimizing out-of-sample or out-of-bag error1. Each tree in the RSF is constructed from a random sample of the data, typically a bootstrap sample or 63.2% of the sample size (as in the present study). Consequently, not all observations are used to construct each tree. The observations that are not used in the construction of a tree are referred to as out-of-bag observations. In an RSF model, each tree is built from a different sample of the original data, so each observation is “out-of-bag” for some of the trees. The prediction for an observation can then be obtained using only those trees for which the observation was not used for the construction. A classification for each observation is obtained in this way and the error rate can be estimated from these predictions. The resulting error rate is referred to as the out-of-bag error. Through calculating the out-of-bag error in each iteration, the best hyperparameters were finally determined.</p><p>The hyperparameters to be tuned and range of grid search in the present study were below: number of trees (50-1000, by 50), number of variables to possibly split at each node (3-6, by 1), and minimum size of terminal node (1-20, by 1)2.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is hard to understand the meaning of the decision curve analysis and the clinical implications behind the net benefit, which are required to clarify the application values of models.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We have added more description and discussion about the decision curve analysis in the “Methods” and “Discussion” sections.</p><p>“Furthermore, we used decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess the clinical usefulness of prediction model-based guidance for prediabetes management, which calculates a clinical “net benefit” for one or more prediction models in comparison to default strategies of treating all or no patients3.”</p><p>“Most importantly, a model with good discrimination does not necessarily have high clinical value. Hence, DCA was used to compare the clinical utility of the model before and after adding the metabolites, and this showed a higher net benefit for the latter than the basic model, suggesting the addition of the metabolites increased the clinical value of prediction, i.e., the potential benefit of guiding management in individuals with prediabetes3,4. These results provided novel evidence supporting the value of metabolic biomarkers in risk prediction and stratification for the progression from prediabetes to diabetes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Notably, the NMR platform utilized within the UK Biobank primarily focused on lipid species. This limitation should be discussed in the manuscript to provide context for interpreting the results and acknowledge the potential bias from the measuring platform.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We acknowledged this limitation that NMR platform within the UK Biobank primarily focused on lipid species and the potential bias from the measuring platform and have added this in “Discussion” section.</p><p>“Third, the Nightingale metabolomics platform primarily focused on lipids and lipoprotein sub-fractions, and thus the predictive value of other metabolites in the progression from prediabetes to diabetes warranted further research using an untargeted metabolomics approach.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The manuscript should explain the potential influence of non-fasting status on the findings, particularly concerning lipoprotein particles and composition. There should be a detailed discussion of how non-fasting status may impact the measurement and the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added more details to explain the potential influence of non-fasting status on our findings in the “Discussion” section.</p><p>“Additionally, the use of non-fasting blood samples might increase inter-individual variation in metabolic biomarker concentrations, however, fasting duration has been reported to account for only a small proportion of variation in plasma metabolic biomarker concentrations5. Therefore, we believe the impact of non-fasting samples on our findings would be minor.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Cross-platform standardization is an issue in metabolism, and further descriptions of quality control are recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We have added more description of quality control in the “Method S1” section in the Supplementary material.</p><p>“Metabolic biomarker profiling by Nightingale Health’s NMR platform provides consistent results over time and across spectrometers. Furthermore, the sample preparation is minimal in the Nightingale Health’s metabolic biomarker platform, circumventing all extraction steps. These aspects result in highly repeatable biomarker measurements. Pre-specified quality metrics were agreed between UK Biobank and Nightingale Health to ensure consistent results across the samples, and pilot measurements were conducted. Nightingale Health performed real-time monitoring of the measurement consistency within and between spectrometers throughout the UK Biobank samples. Two control samples provided by Nightingale Health were included in each 96-well plate for tracking the consistency across multiple spectrometers. Furthermore, two blind duplicate samples provided by the UK Biobank were included in each well plate, with the position information unlocked only after results delivery. Coefficient of variation (CV) targets across the metabolic biomarker profile were pre-specified for both Nightingale Health’s internal control samples and UK Biobank’s blind duplicates. The targets were met for each consecutively measured batch of ~25,000 samples. For the majority of the metabolic biomarkers, the CVs were below 5% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/refer.cgi?id=3000">https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/refer.cgi?id=3000</ext-link>). Further, the distributions of measured biomarkers from 5 sample batches indicated absence of batch effects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/ukb/ukb/docs/nmrm_app1">https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/ukb/ukb/docs/nmrm_app1</ext-link>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Deciphering the metabolic alterations characterizing the prediabetes-diabetes spectrum could provide early time windows for targeted preventive measures to extend precision medicine while avoiding disproportionate healthcare costs.

We agree with you that the panel of metabolites in this study might not be the causal factor for progression from prediabetes to diabetes, which needs further validation in experimental studies. We have added this limitation in the “Discussion” section.</p><p>“Fifth, we could not draw any conclusion about the causality between the identified metabolites and the risk for progression to diabetes due to the observational nature, which remained to be validated in further experimental studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The blood samples were taken at random (not all in a non-fasting state) and so the findings were subjected to greater variability. This should be discussed in the limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added more details to explain the potential influence of non-fasting status on our findings in the “Discussion” section.</p><p>“Additionally, the use of non-fasting blood samples might increase inter-individual variation in metabolic biomarker concentrations, however, fasting duration has been reported to account for only a small proportion of variation in plasma metabolic biomarker concentrations5. Therefore, we believe the impact of non-fasting samples on our findings would be minor.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The strength of NMR in metabolic profiling compared to other techniques (i.e., mass spectrometry [MS], another commonly used metabolic profiling method) could be added in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added the strength of NMR in metabolic profiling compared to other techniques in the “Discussion” section.</p><p>“Circulating metabolites were quantified via NMR-based metabolome profiling within the UK Biobank, which offers metabolite qualification with relatively lower costs and better reproducibility6.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Fourth, the applied platform focuses mostly on lipid species which may be a limitation as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We acknowledged this limitation that NMR platform within the UK Biobank primarily focused on lipid species and the potential bias from the measuring platform and have added this in the “Discussion” section.</p><p>“Third, the Nightingale metabolomics platform primarily focused on lipids and lipoprotein sub-fractions, and thus the predictive value of other metabolites in the progression from prediabetes to diabetes warranted further research using an untargeted metabolomics approach.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is a very large group with pre-diabetes, but the results only apply to prediabetes and not to the general population. This should be clear, although the authors have also validated the predictive value of these metabolites in the general population.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We agree with you that the results only apply to prediabetes and not to the general population, though they also showed potential predictive value among participants with normoglycemia. We have accordingly modified the relevant expressions in the “Conclusion” section to restrict these findings to participants with prediabetes.</p><p>“In this large prospective study among individuals with prediabetes, we detected a panel of circulating metabolites that were associated with an increased risk of progressing to diabetes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the Authors:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for providing the valuable feedback and the time you have dedicated to our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) In the first paragraph of the Discussion section, please include the specific names of the metabolites selected from machine learning methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment and we have added accordingly in the first paragraph of the “Discussion” section.</p><p>“More importantly, our findings suggested that adding the selected metabolites (i.e., cholesteryl esters in large HDL, cholesteryl esters in medium VLDL, triglycerides in very large VLDL, average diameter for LDL particles, triglycerides in IDL, glycine, tyrosine, glucose, and docosahexaenoic acid) could significantly improve the risk prediction of progression from prediabetes to diabetes beyond the conventional clinical variables.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) To enhance the readability and simplicity of the paper, the description of covariate collection in the methods section should be streamlined, with detailed information provided in the supplementary materials.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion and we have moved details about covariates collection to the “Supplementary method S2” to enhance the readability and simplicity of the paper.</p><p>“Information on covariates was collected through a self-completed touchscreen questionnaire or verbal interview at baseline, including age, sex, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, household income, education, employment status, smoking status, moderate alcohol, physical activity, healthy diet score, healthy sleep score, family history of diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), history of hypertension, history of dyslipidemia, history of chronic lung diseases (CLD), and history of cancer.</p><p>Physical measurements included systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), height, weight, waist circumference (WC), and hip circumference (HC). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters (kg/m²). Missing covariates were imputed by the median value for continuous variables and a missing indicator for categorical variables. More details about covariates collection can be found in Method S2.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.
