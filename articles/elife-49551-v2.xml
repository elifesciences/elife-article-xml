Although presumed required for protein synthesis, how ribosome biogenesis impacts virus reproduction and cell-intrinsic immune responses remains untested. Surprisingly, we find that restricting ribosome biogenesis stimulated human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication without suppressing translation. Interfering with ribosomal RNA (rRNA) accumulation triggered nucleolar stress and repressed expression of 1392 genes, including High Mobility Group Box 2 (HMGB2), a chromatin-associated protein that facilitates cytoplasmic double-stranded (ds) DNA-sensing by cGAS. Furthermore, it reduced cytoplasmic HMGB2 abundance and impaired induction of interferon beta (IFNB1) mRNA, which encodes a critical anti-proliferative, proinflammatory cytokine, in response to HCMV or dsDNA in uninfected cells. This establishes that rRNA accumulation regulates innate immune responses to dsDNA by controlling HMGB2 abundance. Moreover, it reveals that rRNA accumulation and/or nucleolar activity unexpectedly regulate dsDNA-sensing to restrict virus reproduction and regulate inflammation.

It is among the most energetically demanding processes in the cell and requires all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases. While the 47S precursor-rRNA (pre-rRNA) is transcribed by RNA Polymerase I (RNAPI) within the nucleolus, 5S rRNA is generated by RNA Polymerase III (RNAPIII) and mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins are produced by RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) in the nucleoplasm. Following processing of 47S pre-rRNA into mature 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNA, assembly of large 60S and small 40S ribosomal subunits from rRNA and ribosomal protein components commences in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mayer and Grummt, 2006</xref>). While ribosome biogenesis is fundamental for normal cell growth, development and differentiation, its dysregulation contributes to diverse diseases including cancer, where it is stimulated, and genetic disorders collectively termed ribosomopathies where it is often impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aspesi and Ellis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mills and Green, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Narla and Ebert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pelletier et al., 2018</xref>). Interfering with ribosome biogenesis triggers a nucleolar stress response whereby p53 is stabilized and the cell cycle is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boulon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chakraborty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deisenroth et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golomb et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, ribosomes play critical roles in infection biology where polypeptide synthesis by obligate intracellular parasites such as viruses is absolutely reliant upon cellular ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohr and Sonenberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stern-Ginossar et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, several viruses reportedly stimulated rRNA synthesis upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">May et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pöckl and Wintersberger, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soprano et al., 1983</xref>). However, whether the ribosome itself or the process of ribosome biogenesis might be subverted by viruses or incorporated into the cellular repertoire of innate immune responses remains largely unexplored. Moreover, while virus-induced ribosome biogenesis is presumed to benefit infection by ensuring ribosome sufficiency for protein synthesis, this hypothesis remains untested. In this investigation we not only challenge this widely held conviction, but reveal how ribosome production is unexpectedly integrated into innate responses that regulate inflammatory cytokine induction.</p><p>Infection with Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) provides a powerful model system to evaluate the impact of ribosome biogenesis on inflammatory responses and virus infection biology. HCMV is a large DNA virus that replicates in the nucleus and although wide-spread and commonly asymptomatic, infection results in life-threatening disease among the immunocompromised and remains a major source of congenital morbidity and mortality among newborns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boeckh and Geballe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Britt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cannon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ljungman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manicklal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Razonable et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to viruses that shut off host mRNA translation, host protein synthesis proceeds in cells infected with Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walsh et al., 2005</xref>). This potentially permits protein products encoded by antiviral mRNAs to accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianco and Mohr, 2017</xref>) while viral and host mRNAs must compete for a limited supply of ribosomes. To mitigate cellular antiviral immune responses without globally impairing translation of host mRNAs, HCMV relies upon multiple independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biolatti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paulus and Nevels, 2009</xref>). One of these involves a virus-directed increase in the abundance of host translation factors, suggesting a viral mechanism to facilitate simultaneous synthesis of host and viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tirosh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKinney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walsh et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, HCMV-induced increases in host translational machinery have been shown to be required for efficient viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKinney et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, HCMV upregulates the translation of mRNAs encoding functions involved in ribosome biogenesis and increases the steady state levels of ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKinney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tirosh et al., 2015</xref>). Although untested, it was believed that this increase in ribosome abundance is enforced by the virus and required to foster efficient translation of both host and viral mRNAs to facilitate viral replication.</p><p>Here, we test this hypothesis by blocking ribosome biogenesis in HCMV-infected cells. Surprisingly, while limiting ribosome biogenesis impairs global protein synthesis in uninfected cells, it has no detectable impact in HCMV-infected cells, suggesting that ribosomes are not rate limiting components and that their increase in HCMV infected cells is not required for efficient protein synthesis. Furthermore, not only was HCMV productive growth insensitive to restricting ribosome biogenesis, it was unexpectedly substantially enhanced. In ribosome biogenesis impaired cells, RNA-seq identified a selective decrease in the abundances of genes whose transcription is augmented by Nuclear Factor-Y (NF-Y) and repressed by the DREAM complex. One of these genes, High Mobility Group Box 2 (HMGB2), is repressed by p53 and its product reportedly plays a role enhancing cell intrinsic immune responses by augmenting dsDNA detection to produce an antiviral cellular state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yanai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yanai et al., 2012</xref>). When ribosome biogenesis is impaired, IFNB1 mRNA accumulation in response to HCMV is compromised and ISG mRNAs and proteins accumulate to lower levels. Furthermore, while introduction of synthetic dsDNA, the major pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) delivered by HCMV, into cells induces a robust innate immune response, this response is hampered when ribosome biogenesis is inhibited, suggesting a central role for ongoing ribosome production in the cellular immune response to a viral PAMP. This, for the first time, establishes a connection between nucleolar activity, ribosome abundance, and cell intrinsic immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RNAPI transcription factor abundances and RNAPI activity are stimulated by HCMV</title><p>Due to the ability of RNAPI to coordinate accumulation of all ribosome components and drive ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laferté et al., 2006</xref>), its properties in HCMV-infected cells were investigated. Earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tanaka et al., 1975</xref>) indicated that 45S pre-rRNA synthesis was stimulated in response to HCMV infection at 30 hr post-infection (hpi). To substantiate this finding and investigate the kinetics of rRNA accumulation, the overall abundance of cellular 45S rRNA precursor was monitored in response to HCMV infection over time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that increased 45S rRNA levels were detected in HCMV-infected compared to mock-infected cells as early as three hpi. This continued to increase, reaching its zenith at 24 hpi where 45S rRNA levels were approximately 6-fold greater in HCMV-infected cells than mock-infected cells. By 48 hr, 45S rRNA abundance declined slightly but remained elevated relative to levels in mock-infected cells through 72 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with increased 45S rRNA accumulation, immunostaining for fibrillarin, a component marking fibrillar centers of nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Németh and Grummt, 2018</xref>) revealed that nucleolar size increased in HCMV-infected cells and that nucleolar integrity appeared intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since rRNA is highly transcribed, analysis of newly synthesized RNA by 5-Fluoruridine (FU) labeling followed by immunofluorescence to detect metabolically labeled RNA can be used to examine nascent rRNA accumulation and subcellular distribution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> demonstrates that FU incorporation was stimulated and areas of FU staining were enlarged in response to HCMV infection. Under these conditions, the majority of FU staining was confined within discrete sub-nuclear foci in uninfected or HCMV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These sub-nuclear sites of FU incorporation resembled nucleoli, which suggested that HCMV infection might stimulate the cellular RNA polymerase I (RNAPI). To determine if the increase in 45S pre-rRNA reflected increased RNAPI activity or a decrease in 45S pre-rRNA processing into mature rRNA, transcript accumulation from a reporter plasmid containing an RNAPI-specific promoter was measured in mock-infected and HCMV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayer et al., 2005</xref>). In response to HCMV infection, a significant increase in RNAPI reporter activity was detected at 24 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), demonstrating that HCMV stimulates transcription from cellular RNAPI-specific promoters. It further indicates that HCMV infection stimulates RNAPI.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Regulation of RNA polymerase I activity by HCMV in human fibroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Growth arrested NHDFs were mock- or HCMV-infected (MOI = 3 PFU/cell).

Following transfection of NHDFs with control non-silencing siRNA or one of two different siRNAs targeting TIF-IA, cells were infected with HCMV. Compared to non-silencing siRNA, both TIF-IA siRNAs effectively reduced 45S pre-rRNA steady-state levels in HCMV infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Sucrose gradient fractionation of cytoplasmic lysates from HCMV-infected cells revealed a substantial decrease in 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits and 80S monoribosomes in cells treated with TIF-IA specific siRNA compared to control siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, a more modest impact on actively translating polyribosomes was observed, indicating that polysome assembly proceeds in HCMV-infected cells even when ribosome biogenesis is restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It further suggested that the large reduction in ribosome subunits and monosomes in response to TIF-IA depletion may not impact ongoing protein synthesis in HCMV-infected cells. To address this possibility, control non-silencing and TIF-IA siRNA-treated cells were mock- or HCMV-infected and incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-containing amino acids to label newly synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).

This indicated that the HCMV-induced increase in ribosome abundance, which was presumed important for the infected cell protein synthesis program, is dispensable for efficient protein synthesis during infection and that ribosome abundance per se was not limiting infected cell protein synthesis. While the precise molecular mechanism underlying this finding remains unknown, it clearly reveals unexpected differences in how ongoing protein synthesis responds to interfering with ribosome biogenesis in uninfected compared to HCMV-infected primary human fibroblasts.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis are uncoupled in HCMV infected cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) NHDFs were transfected with non-silencing (ns) control or TIF-IA siRNAs and infected with HCMV (MOI = 3 PFU/cell).

This demonstrates that interfering with 5S RNA transcription by depleting the RNAPIII specific transcription factor TIFIIIA or preventing processing of rRNA precursors by depleting BOP1 stimulates HCMV replication. It further shows that similar increases in HCMV productive growth are achieved by interfering with transcription factors selective for RNAPI or RNAPIII, or rRNA processing factors. Given that these very different factors target discrete processes essential for ribosome biogenesis, these results indicate that rRNA accumulation and ribosome biogenesis surprisingly restrict HCMV replication. Moreover, it suggests that ribosome biogenesis comprises part of a cell intrinsic immune response that limits virus reproduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Suppressing ribosome biogenesis stimulates HCMV reproduction by restricting type I interferon production</title><p>A major mechanism through which innate, cell-intrinsic responses limit virus replication is through the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). The possibility that ribosome biogenesis might impact innate immune responses in HCMV-infected primary fibroblasts and interfering with ribosome biogenesis might impair ISG expression was therefore considered. Compared to HCMV-infected cultures treated with non-silencing siRNA, reduced levels of representative ISG-encoded mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) accumulated in cultures depleted for either of the RNAPI transcription factors TIF-IA or UBF, the 5S RNA RNAPIII transcription factor TFIIIA, or the rRNA processing factor BOP1. Accordingly, representative immediate early (IE), early (E) and Late (L) viral proteins accumulated to greater levels in cultures where ribosome biogenesis was suppressed by either TIF-IA, UBF, TFIIIA, or BOP1 siRNA as opposed to non-silencing siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To determine whether reduced HCMV IE, E and L protein accumulation in infected cells exposed to non-silencing siRNA compared to TIF-IA, UBF, TFIIIA, or BOP1 siRNA was dependent upon type I IFN action, cells were treated with a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi). By inhibiting JAK and preventing IFN signaling through its cell surface receptor, JAKi suppresses ISG expression. In contrast to DMSO-treated cells where viral protein abundance was far less in cells exposed to non-silencing siRNA compared to siRNAs that inhibited ribosome biogenesis, viral protein levels in JAKi-treated cells exposed to non-silencing siRNA were approximately equivalent to those detected in TIF-IA, UBF, TFIIIA, or BOP1 siRNA-treated NHDFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This demonstrates that IFN signaling via JAK, which normally triggers ISG expression and subsequently limits viral protein accumulation, can be overcome by interfering with ribosome biogenesis. In addition, it is consistent with the notion that ribosome biogenesis in HCMV-infected cells is required to establish an anti-viral state dependent upon ISG expression that limits virus replication. Finally, it further suggests that inhibiting ribosome biogenesis by interfering with TIF-IA, UBF, TFIIIA or BOP1 limited JAK-dependent signaling perhaps by modulating type I interferon production.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ribosome biogenesis impairs HCMV protein accumulation by augmenting the innate immune reponse.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) NHDFs were treated with non-silencing (ns) control, TIF-IA, UBF, TFIIIA, or BOP1 siRNAs and infected with HCMV (MOI = 3 PFU/cell) two dpi total RNA was isolated and RT-qPCR analysis was performed for DDX58, IFIT2, ISG15, IFIT3, RSAD2, OAS3, UBA7, and IFIH1 mRNA (n = 3).

Compared to NHDFs treated with non-silencing siRNA, HMGB2 abundance was reduced in TIF-IA siRNA-treated cells whereas actin levels remained relatively constant.

A similar reduction in HMGB2 mRNA and protein levels was observed in NHDFs treated with the RNA pol I selective inhibitor CX-5461 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the reduction in HMGB2 mRNA abundance in response to CX-5461 was dependent upon p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In NHDFs treated with non-silencing siRNA, HMGB2 was detected throughout the cell in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. However, although nuclear HMGB2 was readily detected in TIF-IA depleted NHDFs, cytoplasmic HMGB2 staining was unexpectedly lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Taken together, this demonstrates that interfering with ribosome biogenesis via TIF-IA depletion reduced HMGB2 mRNA levels and selectively reduced HMGB2 protein abundance in the cytoplasm.

Compared to ns siRNA-treated cultures, IFNB1 mRNA accumulation in response to cGAMP was not detectably reduced by HMGB2-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). That HMGB2-depletion did not detectably impair IFNB1 induction by the RNA virus VSV or cGAMP suggests that HMGB2 is selectively required for sensing dsDNA, as opposed to RNA, upstream of STING in human cells. Taken together, these results establish a critical role for HMGB2, whose levels decrease in response to TIF-IA-depletion, in the induction of IFNB1 by HCMV.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Ribosome biogenesis is critical for normal cell proliferation and highly responsive to metabolic, physiological and environmental challenges. However, the impact of ribosome biogenesis on virus infection biology and whether it might be linked to innate immune responses is poorly understood. Given the universal dependence of virus protein synthesis upon cellular ribosomes, it is assumed that ribosome biogenesis would support ongoing protein synthesis and virus reproduction. Here, we show that while interfering with ribosome biogenesis suppressed ongoing protein synthesis in uninfected primary fibroblasts, it did not detectably impact protein synthesis in HCMV-infected cells. By contrast, reducing ribosome biogenesis unexpectedly stimulated HCMV reproduction. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that interfering with rRNA accumulation decreased expression of genes involved in cell division, many of which were regulated by NF-Y or the DREAM complex. Among these was High Mobility Group Box 2 (HMGB2), a p53-repressed gene whose product is found both bound to chromatin and in the cytoplasm where it is likely critical for innate immune responses to dsDNA. Significantly, depleting the RNAPI specific transcription factor TIF-IA impaired IFNB1 mRNA accumulation in response to HCMV or dsDNA. Thus, preventing rRNA accumulation dampens cellular responses to dsDNA in part by regulating levels of the DNA sensor HMGB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Moreover, it suggests that rRNA biogenesis triggers an HMGB2-dsDNA sensing pathway and reveals a surprising role for rRNA accumulation and/or nucleolar activity in cell intrinsic innate immunity.</p><p>Our results show that rRNA accumulation, ribosome biogenesis and DNA sensing can be integrated to coordinate IFNB1 production. Inhibiting ribosome biogenesis triggers nucleolar stress, which is known to stabilize p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boulon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chakraborty et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Golomb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deisenroth et al., 2016</xref>) and likely accounts for our observed p53-dependent repression of HMGB2 expression. This allows HMGB2 levels to be directly tuned to nucleolar stress and dampened accordingly to limit IFNB1 transcription in response to dsDNA sensing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Further investigation might reveal that additional genes whose expression is regulated upon TIF-IA-depletion might also contribute to proper control of cell intrinsic innate immune responses. While RNAP III, which transcribes nuclear genes encoding 5S rRNA and tRNAs, reportedly transcribes cytoplasmic dsDNA into a RIG-I RNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chiu et al., 2009</xref>), nucleolar or ribosome biogenesis functions of the enzymes were not implicated previously. Additional indirect evidence consistent with a role for ribosomes in controlling innate immunity, however, is mounting. Formation of a multipartite complex including STING and S6K is needed to activate IRF3 in response to DNA sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) A ribosomal protein deficiency resulting in Diamond-Blackfan Anemia (DBA) impairs rRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis, resulting in activation of innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Danilova et al., 2018</xref>). The enigmatic cleavage of UBF by poliovirus protease 3C(pro), which inhibits pol I transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2005</xref>), can now be considered a strategy to limit IFNB1 production. In addition, antagonizing RNAPI ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in animal models and is associated with a benign course of multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achiron et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Deregulated ribosome biogenesis is associated with human diseases that may be differentially impacted by IFNB1 production. For example, proliferative diseases like cancer are associated with hyperactivated rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis. In normal cells, IFNB1 produced in response to ribosome biogenesis may limit proliferation and serve to restrict tumor development. This could in part account for why many tumors have impaired nucleic acid sensing and/or IFN pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Critchley-Thorne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vanpouille-Box et al., 2018</xref>). Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a premature aging disease characterized by expression of a truncated form of Lamin A called progerin, nucleolar expansion, enhanced ribosome biogenesis, and elevated interferon production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buchwalter and Hetzer, 2017</xref>). The correlation between ribosome biogenesis and ISG product accumulation raises the possibility that HGPS may be considered an interferonopathy precipitated by pathogenic enhancement of ribosome production. In contrast, ribosomopathies result from decreased ribosome biogenesis. Patients with Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond Syndrome (SBDS), an inherited ribosomopathy characterized by pancreatic, bone marrow, and immune dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giri et al., 2015</xref>), experience elevated rates of infectious complications, such as those involving <italic>Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus</italic>, and Parvovirus B19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grinspan and Pikora, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miniero et al., 1996</xref>). Poor innate immune responses, including reduced IFN production, resulting from decreased ribosome biogenesis may be a contributing factor.</p><p>While an HMGB2-dependent DNA-sensing pathway links ribosome biogenesis and IFN production, the identity of the non-microbial DNA detected remains enigmatic. Increases in rDNA instability caused by nucleolar dysfunction could trigger a DDR, which reportedly can activate cGAS to stimulate increased interferon production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kobayashi, 2008</xref>). HMGB2 facilitates sensing of long dsDNA by cGAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreeva et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, decreased RNAPI-induced DNA damage could in part explain why inhibiting ribosome biogenesis limits innate immune responses. However, impairing rRNA accumulation by dampening rRNA synthesis also reportedly can activate DDR pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Calo et al., 2018</xref>). Further investigation is needed to resolve this paradox. Nevertheless, failsafe pathways likely detect cytoplasmic dsDNA resulting from rDNA transcription activation, much like cGAS detects cytoplasmic dsDNA during senescence.</p><p>In addition to IFNB1 production, both cGAS and HMGB2 regulate senescence and HMGB2 plays a role controlling the senescence-associated secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aird et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guerrero and Gil, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zirkel et al., 2018</xref>). Activation of dsDNA sensing pathways by ribosome biogenesis might contribute to the reported associations between ribosome biogenesis, lifespan and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharifi and Bierhoff, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tiku and Antebi, 2018</xref>).For example, by activating cytoplasmic dsDNA-sensing, rDNA instability resulting from elevated ribosome biogenesis observed in HGPS could accelerate senescence and thereby drive the progression and severity of premature aging.</p><p>Our findings challenge notions that ribosome biogenesis is universally required to support sustained mRNA translation. While corroborating evidence was found in uninfected primary human fibroblasts, it was not the case in HCMV-infected cells. Although polysome levels and protein synthesis were not detectably altered by TIF-IA-depletion in HCMV-infected fibroblasts, precisely why infected compared to uninfected cell protein synthesis was insensitive to interfering with ribosome biogenesis remains unknown. The underlying mechanism(s) are potentially multifaceted and complex perhaps involving virus-induced increases in cellular translation factors that allow more efficient use of existing ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McKinney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McKinney et al., 2014</xref>), differences among ribosome populations, cis-acting elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mizrahi et al., 2018</xref>) in host and viral mRNAs being translated, specific virus-encoded polypeptides, and/or the differential complexity of mRNA populations in uninfected compared to HCMV-infected cells. Changes in rRNA transcription also reportedly influence proliferation and stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, sustained protein synthesis despite reduced nucleolar volume and rRNA synthesis has been observed in germline stem cell differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Neumüller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, rRNA synthesis is not required for growth factor-mediated hypertrophy of human primary myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Crossland et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, rRNA and ribosome biogenesis can be uncoupled from protein synthesis in invertebrates and in primary human cells. Further study is required to understand how rRNA and ribosome biogenesis impinges on these different downstream effectors, including HMGB2 protein and mRNA levels. Given the large energy costs associated with ribosome building, it is perhaps no wonder that it is integrated into vital cellular responses that govern survival, including proliferation, lifespan and now cell intrinsic immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (NHDFs) and HCMV AD169GFP propagation and quantifiaction have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianco and Mohr, 2017</xref>).

The experiments were expertly done and the conclusions are generally justified. The authors documented a dramatic increase in 45S rRNA abundance, which correlated with increased rRNA transcription factors during HCMV infection. Blocking ribosome biogenesis impaired the cell innate response. They identified a dsDNA binding factor, HMGB2, a chromatin-associated protein, which promotes cytoplasmic double-stranded dsDNA-sensing by cGAS. This constitutes the link between ribosomal biogenesis and the innate response. The critical connection is the correlation between the control of HMGB2 production by TIF-IA and the induction of IFNB1 by HCMV, inasmuch as HMGB2-depletion prevents IFNB1 induction by dsDNA. Thus, HCMV infection engenders an increase in TIF-IA and thus an increase in HMGB2, which in turn facilitates sensing viral dsDNA, upstream of STING in human cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The results regarding HMGB2 as the primary factor linking the ribosome biogenesis, HCMV infection and IFN, are not entirely clear. Overall, the paper seems unfocused, with many (albeit well-done) experiments that do not seem to support the central hypothesis of the paper, that HMGB2 'integrates ribosome biogenesis and innate immunity'. HMGB2 only appears at the end of Figure 6 and in Figure 7, and is not the focus of 75% of the paper, making the title somewhat misleading. It seems that there are two distinct stories wrapped together in this paper: 1 – the unexpected role of ribosome biogenesis in HCMV, which is interesting, convincing and important; and 2 – HMGB2 as a sensor implicated in p53 and IFN signaling. Could other genes, which are disrupted by ribosome biogenesis tampering also be relevant to this link? It is not entirely clear why HMGB2 is the focus, nor whether its biochemical properties contribute to the phenotypes observed. Any further experiments (see point #4 below) should be focused on HMGB2 and why it is the relevant factor.</p><p>2) The authors show that knockdown of the transcription factor TIF-IA does not affect protein synthesis in infected cells, while in mock-infected protein synthesis is significantly reduced. Why? How is the virus compensating for the reduction in ribosome biogenesis? The polysome profile shows that while the 80S peak is reduced by TIF-IA depletion the polysome levels are not. This needs to be explained.</p><p>3) The majority of the experiments are based on depletion (siRNA treatment) of different transcription factors. Would overexpression of TIF-IA result in a more effective innate immune response and suppression of virus replication?</p><p>4) Importantly, would overexpression of HMGB2 alleviate the need for TIF-IA activation in response to infection?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49551.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The results regarding HMGB2 as the primary factor linking the ribosome biogenesis, HCMV infection and IFN, are not entirely clear.

Why? How is the virus compensating for the reduction in ribosome biogenesis? The polysome profile shows that while the 80S peak is reduced by TIF-IA depletion the polysome levels are not. This needs to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>While these are excellent points, we are unable at present to rigorously and unambiguously explain the underlying molecular mechanism(s) at work (which are beyond the scope of the present study). Nevertheless, we now point this out directly in the text (subsection “Ribosome abundance and protein synthesis can be uncoupled in HCMV infected cells”) and offer possible explanations in the Discussion (last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The majority of the experiments are based on depletion (siRNA treatment) of different transcription factors.

Transduced cells were enriched by Blasticidin selection Ectopic expression was validated by immunoblotting. We did <italic>not</italic> reproducibly detect reduced expression of HCMV representative immediate early (IE1/IE2) or late (pp28) proteins in NHDFs stably transduced with a TIF-IA expression vector compared to NHDFs expressing GFP, nor did we detect a significant reduction in virus growth in TIF-IA overexpressing cells compared to GFP-expressing NHDFs. In addition, TIF-IA overexpression did not detectably alter p53 or HMGB2 protein levels, which is consistent with our inability to detect a difference in HCMV growth under these conditions. In hindsight, this is not particularly surprising given the greater extent to which HCMV infection <italic>already</italic> stimulates accumulation of RNA pol I transcription factors including TIF-IA. Thus, further overexpression of TIF-IA did not detectably result in a more effective innate immune response capable of suppressing virus reproduction).</p><p>Overexpression of HMGB2 did not detectably reverse the reduction in IFNB1 mRNA levels in response to TIF-IA depletion in HCMV infected cells. Importantly, while HMGB2 overexpression was readily observed both by immunoblotting and by indirect immunofluorescence, HMGB2 overexpression only increased <italic>nuclear</italic> HMGB2, but did not detectably raise cytoplasmic HMGB2 levels. It is this cytoplasmic HMGB2 subpopulation that has been implicated in DNA sensing.</p><p>We agree had these experiments produced interpretable results, they would have been worth including in the study. Unfortunately, both experiments involved ectopic overexpression of target proteins in primary NHDFs and yielded negative results consistent with a “failure to find”. Given these findings, a meaningful interpretation of the results is not forthcoming. Numerous factors could potentially account for this, not the least of which are the inherent difficulties in achieving proper dose expression levels and the unknown consequences of creating a stably-transduced population of primary cells expressing the target gene needed for experimental analysis. For these reasons, we believe the <italic>positive r</italic>esults we present in our manuscript where we transiently create hypomorphic alleles using multiple, independent siRNAs represents a more tractable, powerful approach to dissecting gene function.</p></body></sub-article></article>
