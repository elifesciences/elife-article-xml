Thirst motivates a coordinated series of water seeking and intake behaviors across diverse animal phyla. Terrestrial animals with unpredictable access to patchily distributed sources of water, such as the fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, have evolved robust brain circuitry to rapidly detect water loss to drive goal-directed seeking and ingestion behaviors.</p><p>In flies, water ingestion and humidity preference studies led to the discovery of sensory and central brain circuit elements that control behavioral and hormonal aspects of thirst. Flies rapidly detect humidity gradients via humid-sensing (Ir68a receptor) and dry-sensing (Ir40a receptor) hygrosensory neurons that are housed in the sacculus on the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enjin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ji and Zhu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knecht et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knecht et al., 2017</xref>). The hygrosensory neurons project to dedicated glomeruli in the antennal lobe, where they synapse onto second order projection neurons to send information to the mushroom bodies, lateral horn, and broadly to other areas of the protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Frank et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marin et al., 2020</xref>). Water taste is facilitated by water-sensing (PPK28 mechanoreceptor) gustatory neurons; taste is critical for water consumption in thirsty flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cameron et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lau et al., 2017</xref>). A pair of interoceptive SEZ neurons (ISN) that detect osmolarity are located in the suboesophageal ganglion zone (SEZ); they promote water consumption and reciprocally inhibit food intake when inhibited by high interstitial fluid osmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jourjine et al., 2016</xref>). The ISNs are regulated by the mechanoreceptor Nanchung that responds to changes in hemolymph osmolarity to signal water balance status, and by adipokinetic hormone that signals aspects of energy store status to the brain.</p><p>These sensory and interoceptive inputs regulate central brain circuitry to facilitate ingestive behavior and initiate the state of thirst. How the thirsty state is represented in the brain remains to be characterized. Functional mapping of water reward memories led to the discovery of leucokinin peptidergic neurons, whose activity is regulated by thirst, and that regulate memories of thirst through dopaminergic connections into the mushroom body learning and memory circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ji and Zhu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Senapati et al., 2019</xref>). Thirsty attraction to humidity may also route through some of the same dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). Hunger, which drives a pattern of ingestive behaviors similar to that of thirst, is also conveyed through dopamine neurons and the mushroom body circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of hunger circuitry in water seeking is not yet known. Finally, the pars intercerebralis, a neuroendocrine brain region, contains ion transport peptide (ITP) hormone expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gáliková et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nässel and Vanden Broeck, 2016</xref>). Ion transport peptide bidirectionally controls thirst and hunger behaviors, and it regulates water balance in the body as a hormone.</p><p>Understanding how fundamental motivational states are related at the circuit level will help uncover the hierarchy of behavioral choice and its underlying neural mechanisms. Thirst in mammals has complex hierarchical interactions with other behavioral states, including hunger and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sutton and Krashes, 2020</xref>). Thirst and hunger are particularly tightly interconnected. For example, thirst can override hunger drive (dehydration-anorexia), and feeding induces thirst (prandial thirst) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watts and Boyle, 2010</xref>). Manipulation of either cortical or hindbrain neurons in mice can simultaneously impact both hunger and thirst driven ingestive behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eiselt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gong et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, thirst-driven water anticipation and subsequent intake changes the activity of a remarkably broad set of neurons throughout the mouse brain, in a manner that is time-locked to specific behavioral steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2019</xref>). This reveals the complexity of even an apparently simple motivational state, and it predicts interactions with other brain functions. Flies, exhibiting hunger:thirst and hunger:sleep interdependencies with apparently equivalent ethological relationships, will be useful for elaborating circuit motifs for behavioral state interactions, particularly at the level of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Melnattur and Shaw, 2019</xref>).</p><p>To identify central brain neurons critical for thirst, we used an open-field behavioral assay that allows neural manipulation of freely moving animals as they evaluate the presentation of a point source of water or food. An unbiased neuroanatomical activation screen identified two bilateral pairs of neurons, Janu-GABA and Janu-AstA, whose activity is necessary and sufficient for promoting thirsty water seeking, but that have limited effect on fluid consumption. Flies choose to continuously activate the Janu neurons, suggesting that water seeking up a humidity gradient is rewarding. The Janu-GABA local interneurons are specific to thirsty water seeking. In contrast, the Janu-AstA neurons, that release the neuropeptide Allatostatin A (AstA), also inhibit feeding behavior. Neuropeptide F (NPF) neurons are a postsynaptic target of Janu-AstA neurons through the AstA-R2 receptor in the superior medial protocerebrum. NPF reciprocally regulates water seeking and feeding behavior. Thus, we uncovered central brain interneurons that encode water seeking and that simultaneously suppress food seeking, indicating that thirst and hunger are coordinated homeostatic states while animals are actively seeking.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anatomical activation screen identifies water-seeking neurons</title><p>Thirsty flies are motivated to seek a palatable source of water and to drink until they reach repletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We developed an open-field assay to assess appetitive behaviors, including thirst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Flies are placed into an open arena, allowed to acclimate, and then presented with a small receptacle containing a source of water or food. A water source rapidly sets up a stable 3–6% humidity gradient from the edge to the source at the center of the chamber. Flies may perform a complete series of steps of thirst-driven behavior with an accessible water source, from seeking to achieving repletion, or they can be limited to water seeking by placing a mesh grid over the source. The longer flies are water deprived, the more quickly they find and occupy the water source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Water deprivation also increases locomotor speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Given a choice, thirsty flies seek water over food, and hungry flies seek food over water, indicating that deprivation state-specific seeking can be readily measured in the open field assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). A combination of hygrosensory and taste cues guide thirsty flies to water. Blocking access to the water source with the mesh grid had no effect on seeking, whereas removal of the third antennal segment that harbors hygrosensory neurons in the sacculus (antennectomy) reduced seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Combining antennectomy with the mesh grid completely blocked seeking. Antennectomy also removes the aristae that sense temperature; ablation of the aristae alone had no effect on seeking to the inaccessible water source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Budelli et al., 2019</xref>). Water deprivation increased water intake: removing the third antennal segment had no effect, whereas, as expected, blocking access with the mesh grid fully blocked intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thirsty flies were not attracted to an empty receptacle (not shown). Thus, thirsty flies use hygrosensory and taste environmental cues to locate and drink water, and we can isolate the hygrotactic water seeking step from other thirst-related behaviors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Thirst behavior in an open field; a forward screen uncovers Durstig thirst neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Thirst-induced sequence of behavior.

We initially screened for feeding behavior by presenting flies with a discrete source of standard fly food. The screen revealed patterns of neurons that, when activated by the heat-sensitive TrpA1 cation channel, promote or inhibit foraging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). One activation pattern, <italic>Durstig-Gal4</italic> (the German for ‘thirst’), resulted in markedly high attraction to food. We asked what component of the food source the <italic>Durstig&gt;TrpA1</italic> flies were seeking. Well fed, water replete <italic>Durstig&gt;TrpA1</italic> flies avidly occupied standard fly food, wet sucrose or yeast alone in 1% agar, dry sucrose, 1% agar alone, or water alone, but they were not attracted to empty receptacles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Hygrotaxis toward inaccessible water was strongly potentiated by Durstig activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Thus, Durstig contains neurons that promote water seeking. We chose to focus on water seeking behavior because it is a specific step in the thirst behavioral sequence that is strongly motivated.</p><p>We asked if neurons previously implicated in intake (food and water), water reward memory, and water sensing increase water seeking when activated. Activation of dopamine neurons for reward and aversion had either no effect or suppressed water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, dopaminergic neurons previously implicated in humidity preference and water reward, in the R48B04 pattern, are different from the Durstig water seeking neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Of neurons implicated in feeding, activation of only two patterns increased water seeking: the NP883 pattern containing the Fdg neurons that promote proboscis extension and liquid food intake, and the R65D05 pattern that contains AstA neurons that inhibit food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hentze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hergarden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pool et al., 2014</xref>). Activation of internal osmosensory ISNs (R34G02), hygrosensory neurons (Ir40a, Ir68a), and water taste neurons (ppk28) did not increase water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Enjin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jourjine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knecht et al., 2016</xref>). These findings reveal segregation of water seeking from many of the previously identified neurons involved in steps of feeding and intake. <italic>Durstig-Gal4</italic>-driven GFP revealed that a complex pattern of neurons is labeled in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Because of this, we sought to isolate the individual neurons responsible for water seeking.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pattern refinement reveals a small group of neurons that promote thirsty water seeking</title><p>We used genetic intersectional techniques to isolate the water seeking neurons embedded in the Durstig pattern. First, subtracting R65D05 neurons from Durstig reduced activation-dependent water seeking, indicating that the water seeking neurons in Durstig and R65D05 are the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Activation of central brain R65D05 neurons promoted water seeking, whereas their inactivation decreased seeking, indicating that central brain neurons in the R65D05 pattern (and not ventral nervous system neurons or other non-neuronal cells) are both necessary and sufficient for water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). Feeding behavior toward dry sucrose was increased with R65D05 inactivation, as expected from previous reports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hentze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hergarden et al., 2012</xref>). Second, we expressed the GAL4 inhibitor GAL80 in various neurotransmitter classes of neurons and assessed Durstig activation-driven water seeking. Subtracting out neurons with <italic>VGlut-Gal80</italic> (vesicular glutamate transporter enhancer) specifically suppressed Durstig water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Next, we activated neurons captured by <italic>enhancer-Gal4</italic> transgenes created with enhancer fragments taken from the VGlut locus, and we identified <italic>R52A01-Gal4</italic> neurons as being able to promote water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Subtracting R52A01 neurons from the Durstig pattern blocked Durstig activation from increasing water seeking, indicating that Durstig water seeking neurons were also found in R52A01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Like R65D05, R52A01 activation increased and R52A01 inhibition decreased water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Subtracting out neurons with <italic>VGlut-Gal80</italic> decreased thirsty water seeking in both TrpA1-activated R52A01 and R65D05, suggesting that the water seeking neurons were shared between these two Gal4 driver transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E,F</xref>). To test if R65D05 and R52A01 labeled the same water-seeking neurons, we assembled a <italic>split-Gal4</italic> (<italic>spGal4</italic>) derived from these two enhancer fragments that we named Janu (the Estonian for thirst) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). <italic>Janu-spGal4</italic> is <italic>R52A01-Gal4.AD;R65D05-Gal4.DBD. Janu-spGal4</italic> is expressed in four bilaterally symmetric neurons in the central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Janu neuron postsynaptic inputs are confined to the subesophageal zone (SEZ), and their presynaptic outputs are distributed between the SEZ, the crepine region (CRE), and the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). TrpA1 activation of Janu neurons increased water seeking, albeit to a lesser extent than either parental Gal4 driver alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Conversely, acute inactivation of Janu neurons decreased thirsty water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). The behavioral effects of both Janu activation and inactivation on water seeking mapped to the central brain, similar to the parental <italic>enhancer-Gal4s</italic> for <italic>Janu-spGal4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Interestingly, feeding behavior was increased when Janu neurons were acutely inactivated, the opposite effect as compared to water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>). Thus, the Janu neurons promote water seeking and inhibit feeding behavior.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Isolation of Janu thirst neurons from the Durstig pattern.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Subtraction of R65D05 neurons (<italic>R65D05</italic>&gt;<italic>Gal80</italic>) from the Durstig pattern decreases Durstig activation water seeking.

First, we used a stochastic labeling technique to determine the anatomy of each Janu neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Two of the four central brain Janu neurons project locally in the SEZ, and the other two neurons project from the SEZ to the CRE and/or the SMP. Second, we determined Janu neurotransmitter/neuromodulator identity using immunohistochemistry with antibodies for specific neurotransmitter classes of neurons and for neuropeptides. We found that the two local SEZ neurons were GABAergic, expressing the VGAT vesicular transporter for GABA; we named them Janu-GABA1 and Janu-GABA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–H</xref>). VGAT precisely localized with nearly all Janu-GABA axonal varicosities, and did not localize with other Janu neurons. Knockdown of VGAT with either of two distinct RNAi transgenes in the Janu neurons decreased water seeking in thirsty animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>Gad1</italic>, encoding the GABA biosynthetic enzyme Glutamic acid decarboxylase 1, in Janu neurons also decreased thirsty water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). To ask if Janu-GABA neurons were responsible for promoting water seeking when Janu neurons were activated in water replete flies, we knocked down Gad1 while simultaneously activating the Janu neurons with TrpA1. This manipulation blocked activation-dependent water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Thus, the Janu-GABA neurons promote thirsty water seeking and are capable of driving water seeking in water replete animals. To ask if Janu-GABA neurons are specific to the seeking phase of thirst or if they drive a sequence of thirst behaviors, we tested water intake. We presented thirsty flies with a drop of water and measured total water consumption time, the length of the first intake bout, and pharyngeal pumping rate. Gad1 knockdown in Janu neurons had no effect on total water consumption time, but it reduced the length of the first intake bout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L,M</xref>). Pharyngeal pumping rate was unchanged in thirsty Janu neuron <italic>Gad1</italic> knockdown flies, indicating that total intake and motor behaviors were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Finally, feeding behavior was unaltered in the Janu Gad1 knockdown flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N</xref>).

To ask if Janu-AstA neurons were responsible for promoting water seeking when Janu neurons were activated in water replete flies, we knocked down AstA while simultaneously activating the Janu neurons with TrpA1. This manipulation blocked activation-dependent water seeking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, like Janu-GABA neurons, the Janu-AstA neurons promote thirsty water seeking and are capable of driving seeking in water replete flies. This finding suggests that there may exist a functional relationship between the Janu-GABA and the Janu-AstA neurons. However, there are key functional differences between the Janu-GABA and Janu-AstA neurons. AstA knockdown in Janu neurons did not affect total water consumption time, the length of the first intake bout, pharyngeal pumping rate, or intake measured in the open-field assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M,N</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). Thus, Janu-AstA neurons are required for thirsty water seeking, and they promote seeking when activated in water replete flies, but they have no role in water intake. Interestingly, AstA in the Janu neurons inhibits feeding behavior in both well-fed and hungry flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>).

GABA in Janu-GABA is sufficient for driving water seeking in the water replete state, and it is necessary for thirsty seeking. The role of the Janu-GABA neurons appears to be limited to the seeking step of thirst behavior, since thirsty water consumption is largely unaffected by their inhibition. The specific role for Janu-GABA in promoting persistence during the first thirsty intake bout may reflect the end of the seeking component of the sequence of thirst behaviors that may overlap with the beginning of the intake phase. Moreover, the Janu-GABA neurons did not affect feeding behavior and are not activated by hunger. Thus, the Janu-GABA neurons increase thirsty seeking to sources of water. The Janu-GABA neurons are functionally distinct from the Fdg local interneurons that are also located in the SEZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pool et al., 2014</xref>). The Fdg neurons increase intake of liquid food and promote proboscis extension, behavioral functions we did not observe for the Janu-GABA neurons. We showed that the Fdg neurons may also promote water seeking. However, we did not identify the specific neurons in the <italic>NP883-Gal4</italic> pattern that are responsible for water seeking. Defining the source of the signal to drive Janu-GABA dependent thirsty seeking and the mechanism of thirsty seeking require further elaboration of the circuitry for thirst and other behaviors in the SEZ region of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain. We speculate that the Janu-GABA neurons may function upstream or downstream of the osmosensory ISN neurons that, when inhibited, promote water intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jourjine et al., 2016</xref>). Janu-GABA neuron activation in the SEZ is predicted to lead to inhibition of SEZ neurons, perhaps to repress competing behavioral states represented in the SEZ. Alternatively, the Janu-GABA neurons may repress repressor neurons of thirsty seeking, that remain to be identified.</p><p>Janu-AstA is a bilaterally symmetric AstAergic projection interneuron with inputs in the SEZ and outputs in the medial SMP. AstA in the Janu-AstA neuron promotes thirsty water seeking, and it inhibits feeding behavior in a hunger-independent manner. For thirst, AstA in the Janu-AstA neuron was specific to thirsty seeking with no impact on water intake, indicating a functional role similar to Janu-GABA for thirst. However, we did not detect changes in Janu-AstA neuronal activity with either thirst or hunger. This lack of response may indicate a tonic role for AstA in feeding and thirst. Tonic release of neuropeptides can tune neural circuit function, including the peptidergic modulation of hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tu et al., 2005</xref>). Peptidergic signaling can also be tuned by changing the amount of the receptor in the receiving neuron, as was demonstrated for sensory tuning by the short-NPF (sNPF) neuropeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, knockdown of either AstA or GABA in the Janu neurons blocked water seeking evoked by Janu activation. Janu-GABA and Janu-AstA may work in series in the same circuit, or in parallel in separate circuits that converge, to control thirsty-seeking behaviors.</p><p>Whereas Janu-GABA and Janu-AstA may work together for thirsty seeking, Janu-AstA also regulates feeding behavior, indicating branched functionality in water seeking circuitry. Janu-AstA transmits thirst and hunger information to NPF neurons through the AstA-R2 receptor on NPF neurons, where NPF coordinately regulates thirsty seeking and feeding behavior. NPF is well studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in vertebrates as a promoter of feeding behavior – our work indicates a reciprocal role for NPF in thirst behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pool and Scott, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen and Cai, 2001</xref>). Coordinated regulation of thirst and hunger is most clearly manifested behaviorally as prandial thirst (thirst induced by feeding) and as dehydration anorexia (thirst suppression of feeding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fitzsimons, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zimmerman et al., 2017</xref>). Janu-AstA and AstA-R2-positive NPF neurons join a small list of neurons that oppositely regulate thirst and hunger behaviors: the osmosensory ISN neurons oppositely regulate food and water intake, and Ion Transport Peptide (ITP) neurons promote thirst and inhibit food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gáliková et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pool et al., 2014</xref>). It remains unclear if all these neurons support water seeking, or if they function specifically during ingestion.</p><p>Interestingly, two NPF neurons, the P1 and L1-l neurons, showed increased activity in thirsty flies. Hunger also selectively increases the activity of these two NPF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beshel and Zhong, 2013</xref>). This might indicate that the P1 and L1-l represent an internal state imbalance rather than a specific internal state like hunger or thirst. Additionally, the direction of their regulation – increased activity when thirsty – is opposite of what is expected for NPF in these neurons to inhibit thirsty seeking. Thus, we suggest that Janu-AstA may synapse onto different NPF neurons that, like Janu-AstA, do not exhibit state-dependent changes in neuronal activity, but that promote thirst and inhibits feeding behavior. A potential mechanism may be through NPF-NPF neuronal synapses: both the P1 and the L1-l neurons express the NPF receptor NPFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shao et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, it is likely that one or more of the water-seeking circuit elements we discovered feeds into navigational decision making circuitry to direct hygrotaxis toward a water source and to suppress other goal directed behavior in a dynamic fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hulse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Optogenetic activation of the Janu or the R65D05 neurons induces place preference, indicating that animals ‘like’ activation of these neurons. Thirst and hunger are deprivation states that have a negative valence, therefore the Janu neurons likely do not encode the state of deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burnett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sutton and Krashes, 2020</xref>). We propose that, instead, they encode the anticipation of terminating a thirsty state. To a thirsty fly, the presence of a humidity gradient likely predicts impending water intake and repletion, which may have rewarding value.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and culturing</title><p>All strains were outcrossed for five generations to the Berlin genetic background.

Groups of approximately 20 adult males were collected 1–2 days prior to the experiment. One group is an n = 1. Matched experimental and control groups were tested within day, and experiments were performed across days, to account for between-day variability. For water deprivation, flies were placed in empty culture vials containing 1 mL 5% sucrose that was dried onto a 2.5 × 15 cm strip of Whatman 3 MM filter paper. For food deprivation, flies were placed into empty culture vials containing water saturated 3 MM filter paper. Dry, rough cut cane sugar (La Perruche Pure Cane Rough Cut Cubes) was used in all food seeking experiments, except for the original screen that used standard fly food. Sources of food or water were presented to flies either on a small square of Parafilm or in the cap of a 0.65 mL microcentrifuge tube. Water was made inaccessible by gluing a 210–300 μm mesh grid onto a cap. Flies were deprived of food or water for the times indicated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. Thin-walled Plexiglas behavioral chambers were designed with two side-by-side arenas, each arena measuring 45 × 75×10 mm. Chambers were designed and built by IO Rodeo (Pasadena, CA); design files are available from the company. The chambers and sources were acclimated to the testing temperature in a Peltier incubator, and flies were acclimated into the chambers for 10 min prior to introducing the source (IN45, Torrey Pines Scientific). For TrpA1 and Shibire thermogenetics, flies were temperature acclimated for 20 min before being introduced into the chamber. Humidity was measured using an EK-H4 multiplexer with SHT71 sensors (Sensirion). The incubator maintained 30–40% relative humidity. For thermogenetic activation experiments with UAS-STOP-TrpA1-mCherry, flies were pre-acclimated for 20 min in food or deprivation vials, then 10 min in the behavioral arena, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asahina et al., 2014</xref>). Flies were filmed from above with Logitech C510 web cameras at 10 fps with the arena placed on white light LED panel (Edmund Optics). The number of flies on the source was divided by total number of flies to determine the fraction of flies on the source. In binary choice experiments, dry sucrose and water were placed in closely apposed receptacles just prior to performing the experiment.</p><p>Locomotor speed was calculated per group as the total distance traveled divided by the total time each individual was tracked for 10 s intervals every 5 min, and then averaged across the 10 min and 15 min time points, allowing for acclimation to the arena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wolf et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>To measure intake in the open-field arena, water was made to 0.2% w/v erioglaucine and presented to flies for 20 min in the behavioral chamber. Consumption was determined spectrophotometrically in cleared fly extracts at 628 nm by a BioTek Epoch two microplate reader, background subtracted with flies fed undyed water, and was normalized to the <italic>enhancer-Gal4</italic>&gt;+ control strain.</p><p>Intake time and pumping rate were measured essentially as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>). Flies were glued to slides with clear nail polish while cold anesthetized and allowed to recover at 60% humidity and 25°C for 1–2 hr. Consumption time was measured by repeatedly presenting the proboscis with a water drop extruded from the end of a 5 μL calibrated micropipet (Avantor), until flies failed to extend the proboscis to four sequential presentations. The first bout length was the time from first engagement to first complete disengagement with the water drop. Pumping rate was determined with manual counts of video recordings of pharyngeal contractions during the initial 10 s of engagement, or shorter if the flies disengaged earlier.</p><p>We used a custom-built device for determining the positional preference of optogenetically stimulated flies (Flidea). Groups of about 10 flies were kept in the dark on standard food containing 35 mM all-trans retinal for 2–4 days (Sigma). They were placed in an 80 × 40 × 3 mm arena with a clear roof and white acrylic floor. Optogenetic LEDs (617 nm) were arrayed 1 cm below the arena and were switched to allow illumination of either 40 × 40 mm side of the arena. Optogenetic stimulation was at 40 Hz for 200 ms every second. Flies were allowed to acclimate to the arena, and then were given a 5 min off, 5 min on, 5 min off pattern of stimulation, with the ON side randomly assigned. Filming was done at 2 fps in dim ambient light. Object recognition and position in the arena was determined using custom developed DTrack software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ro et al., 2014</xref>). Fly positional preference was calculated as the number of flies on a side divided by the total number of flies. Experiments where flies showed a strong side bias prior to optogenetic stimulation were excluded from further analysis. The resulting positional information was averaged into 20 s bins. The activation effect is the positional preference averaged across minute nine minus across minute 4, such that a positive value indicates increased occupancy of the LED-on side when the LEDs are on. The experiment was repeated with flies from 5 to 8 separate crosses across different days.</p><p>Statistical measurements were made with Prism 8.0 (GraphPad). One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc comparisons (or Bonferroni post-hoc planned comparison) were used when data did not show unequal variance by the Brown-Forsythe test, otherwise the Kruskal-Wallis test followed with Dunn’s post-hoc was used. t-tests were two-tailed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Error bars are the SEM. Dots overlaid on the bar graphs are the value measured for individual groups. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample sizes. Sample sizes are similar to those used in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> behavioral experimental paradigms, and they were held constant with rare exceptions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor and K. VIjayRaghavan as Senior Editor.</p><p>All three reviewers expressed strong interest and enthusiasm for the work. However, as you will read, there was also a consensus that the considerable amount of extra work on presentation and content necessary before potential acceptance would require more than the two months allowed for revisions to a paper in <italic>eLife</italic>. For this and other reasons listed below, after extensive discussion and consultation among the reviewers, we regret to inform you that this paper will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers however, are supportive enough to suggest that, should you choose to do so, then <italic>eLife</italic> will remain willing to examine a carefully revised and resubmitted manuscript as a new submission to the journal.</p><p>A single consensus review is provide below, in addition to the individual reviews, and we hope you will find these to be useful.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Landayan, Zhou, and Wolf present a new behavioral assay to test different aspects of water/food seeking behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. From an initial activation screen of 154 Gal4 enhancer trap flies, the work identifies several that mediate food seeking, in particular Durstig-Gal4, where activation of marked neurons causes shows the highest attraction and occupancy level toward food. Significantly, Durstig-Gal4 marked neurons are involved in modulating both food and humidity seeking behaviors. From this starting point, using a vast array of neural activation/inhibition experiments, neuromodulator RNAi, and some neuroanatomy and Split Gal4s, they identify a line called Janu, which labels 4 neurons in the central brain, 3 interneurons in the ventral nervous system and 2 ascending neurons projecting from the ventral nervous system to the central brain. These Janu neurons are either GABAergic or produce allatostatin and may function as a multi-modal integrator required for water seeking (but not water intake). Thus, this subset of inhibitory and Allatostatin A-positive neurons promote thirst-driven behavior. Using synaptic GRASP, they show that Janu-Ast neurons connect to NPF expressing neurons.</p><p>Previous work on the interplay between hunger and thirst has focused on sensory circuits, so identifying central neurons mediating thirst would represent a significant contribution to understanding this process. Going from an unbiased behavior screen to a subset of neurons docked into a circuit is admirable. The work is careful, thorough, and on an important topic.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A major rewrite is required. While the authors may be commended for wrestling with a complex story and for being open about all of the data even when it is hard to reconcile with a simple model, in the end the insights need to be distilled more for public consumption. In current form, the paper is extraordinarily difficult to read and difficult to follow, in part due to the complexity of the methods. There is a large number of different types of behavioral assays (with flies in different internal states), and many different driver lines are presented as the authors home in on those that form the central novel findings (i.e., Janu neurons). The huge amount of data masks the main messages of the paper. There is a lot of chronological and extraneous data included that could be moved to supplementary figures to streamline and we'd strongly suggest the authors prune irrelevant experiments. For example, it jumps from characterization of the new hygrotactic assay (though not the first of this type of assay – – see minor comment below) to a screen using a completely different assay, which gives the impression the authors wanted to show the results of the screen rather than present a logical flow of experiments for the reader. In addition, inconsistent use of nomenclature in text/figures/legends renders it difficult to follow, e.g., Janu neurons are sometimes to referred by name, but often in the behavior data panels only the codes for the split-Gal4s are shown. In general, the data on thirst is stronger than that on NPF and feeding, so the thirst conclusions should be emphasized. One suggestion is to describe the original identification of Durstig neurons as thirst-promoting, then how a subset within that was identified as critical and Allatostatin-A-positive, and then demonstrate that this subset promotes thirst as a drive, suppressing the hunger drive. With a serious organizational revision and streamlining of extra data into supplementary figures, the findings should be clearer and much easier to convey. Some summary schematics could help significantly, particular accompanying the Discussion sectionDiscussion section. For example: one showing the proposed circuit, and a another showing the nested/Venn diagram of Durstig, Janu, AllatostatinA+, and GABA+ neurons, (maybe including their respective GAL4 targeting reagents).</p><p>2. One problem than runs through the manuscript is that it remains formally unclear whether the phenotypic differences observed upon activation/inhibition of populations of neurons is due to the difference in their individual roles or to the difference in the magnitude of activation/inhibition. (One might be activating a lot of neurons that have the same role in water seeking and thus the phenotype is stronger than activating only a subpopulation of those neurons). Similarly, many RNAi experiments are presented but, while several do point towards a consistent conclusion, there is no evidence that particular knock-downs work or do not work, and single mutant alleles are shown without rescue or obvious control of genetic background (for both Npf and AstA mutants, a w strain is used as the control). Some of these issues need to be addressed experimentally and certainly in the text.</p><p>3. Many of the issues above could be addressed by physiological experiments (calcium imaging or electrophysiology), which would potentially make it easier to appreciate the function of individual neurons. For example, a simple question is whether Janu-AstA and Janu-GABA neurons respond to water vapor and/or water contact? We appreciate such experiments are probably beyond the scope of a reasonable revision. But in the absence of this, extra care should be paid to both establishing the specificity of the genetic perturbations, the resulting phenotypes and in interpretation of the results. As the quantity and complexity of the work makes extraction of a compelling central discovery of broad general interest difficult to appreciate, major revisions should concentrate on marshalling and presenting all the best evidence to arguing for and documenting the identification of thirst-promoting central neurons.</p><p>4. The title and the summary are misleading, as the Janu neurons described here are not only allatostatin producing but also GABAergic. Perturbations specific to Allostatin/Janu neurons form only a relatively small part of the entire analysis, which ignores that other Janu neurons are GABAergic. This should be explicitly clarified. Similarly, in the abstract the phrase: &quot;allowed us to uncover the neural basis.……&quot; is a bit of an over-statement (perhaps &quot;a neural basis&quot;).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Landayan et al. et al. combine a simple behavioral test with an extensive use of genetic tools to identify neurons which promote water seeking and limit feeding behavior in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Starting from an initial screen of &quot;a&quot; library of 154 Gal4 enhancer trap flies, they select one strain, Durstig, which shows the highest attraction and occupancy level toward food. Starting with this strain, they show that Durstig is involved in modulating both food and humidity seeking behaviors. From this starting point, they analyze which population of neurons are involved in activating Durstig neurons and which neurons are downstream. This demonstration makes an extensive use of various genetic constructions, following a logic that looks solid and supported by behavioral observations, however lacking functional or pharmacological observations. The reasoning is explicitly outlined in the manuscript but the number of constructions used make it difficult to follow to someone which is exterior to this research field.</p><p>The authors first verify that the activation of Durstig neurons involves humidity and antennae. Other stimuli related to food seeking or from other receptors are not checked. Then, they proceed to find neurons upstream and downstream of Durstig neurons. They first look at different populations of neurons known to be involved in humidity preference or in the control of liquid or food intake, to see if activating them with TrpA1 (and heat) would induce similar water seeking behaviors.</p><p>Since Durstig-gal4 neurons are numerous, the authors tried then to narrow down their analysis using intersectional approaches to find which of these neurons are involved in water-seeking, looking at cholinergic and glutaminergic neurotransmission. This analysis led them to find an enhancer, R52A01, which marks neurons using glutaminergic transmission within the Durstig population of neurons, as well as R65D05 neurons which are involved in inhibiting food intake.</p><p>Using a split-Gal4 approach, they could tag neurons (called Janu), namely 4 neurons in the central brain, 3 interneurons in the ventral nervous system and 2 ascending neurons projecting from the ventral nervous system to the central brain.</p><p>Using antibodies directed against neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, they show that Janu neurons are either GABAergic or produce allatostatin and that these neurons promote water seeking (but does not change water consumption).</p><p>Lastly, using synaptic GRASP, they shown that Janu-Ast neurons connect to NPF neurons.</p><p>All in all, this paper sums out an impressive amount of work which leads to the identification and description of neurons involved in water-seeking behavior. To this respect, it constitutes a beautiful analysis. It is a paper difficult to read for me because of the complexity of the methods. I find the title and the summary a bit misleading, as the Janu neurons described here (unless I am mistaken) are not only allatostatin producing but also GABAergic. From the summary and the title, I was also expecting functional studies related to allatostatin.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This work presents a new behavioral assay to test different aspects of water/food seeking behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and presents a vast array of neural activation/inhibition experiments, neuromodulator RNAi, and some neuroanatomy to characterize several classes of central interneurons that have different roles in state-dependent water-seeking behavior; these include the Janu-AstA neurons, which seem to function as a multi-modal integrator required for water seeking (but not water intake). The topic is certainly interesting and there are several novel findings. However, the paper lacks any accompanying neurophysiological analyses or careful control that the neuronal/molecular manipulations have the intended/expected effects, which limits the strength of the conclusions. Moreover, the sheer quantity and complexity of the work makes extraction of a compelling central discovery of broad general interest difficult to appreciate at this stage.</p><p>1. The manuscript is very difficult to follow: there is a large number of different types of behavioral assays (with flies in different internal states), and many different driver lines are presented as the authors home in on those that form the central novel findings (i.e., Janu neurons). The huge amount of data masks the main messages of the paper, and we'd strongly suggest the authors prune irrelevant experiments. For example, it jumps from characterization of the new hygrotactic assay (though not the first of this type of assay – – see minor comment below) to a screen using a completely different assay, which gives the impression the authors wanted to show the results of the screen rather than present a logical flow of experiments for the reader. In addition, inconsistent use of nomenclature in text/figures/legends renders it difficult to follow, e.g., Janu neurons are sometimes to referred by name, but often in the behavior data panels only the codes for the split-Gal4s are shown. Some summary schematics could help significantly, particular accompanying the Discussion sectionDiscussion section.</p><p>2. The authors infer roles for specific neurons and neural signaling molecules using a variety of genetic tools, but there is no molecular, cellular or physiological level validation that links these manipulations to changes in neuronal function. This is important, because it remains unclear whether the phenotypic differences observed upon activation/inhibition of a population of neurons is due to the difference in their individual roles or to the difference in the magnitude of activation/inhibition. (One might be activating a lot of neurons that have the same role in water seeking and thus the phenotype is stronger than activating only a subpopulation of those neurons). Many RNAi experiments are presented but, while several do point towards a consistent conclusion, there is no evidence that particular knock-downs work or do not work, and single mutant alleles are shown without rescue or obvious control of genetic background (for both Npf and AstA mutants, a w strain is used as the control).</p><p>3. No physiological experiments are presented (calcium imaging or electrophysiology), making it difficult to appreciate the function of individual neurons. For example, a simple question is whether Janu-AstA and Janu-GABA neurons respond to water vapor and/or water contact? We appreciate such experiments are probably beyond the scope of a reasonable revision but are part of the expected standard in the field now to make claims that the &quot;neural basis&quot; of a particular process is understood.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Landayan, Zhou, and Wolf have identified a population of neurons that affect the relative drive strengths of thirst and hunger, and thus the choice between consummatory behaviors.

On the one hand, the authors have responded to most of our requests on the original version with additional experiments and reformatting. On the other, it is still a complex story to navigate, and is still not very conclusive. I sense the authors have gone as far as is practically possible in this project with the resources available. While they have identified a potentially very interesting set of neurons, thirst seeking is clearly an intricate behavior to dissect using neurogenetics. The work opens a number of interesting questions, but I feel the level of evidence here is lower than similar types of papers in this field here. In addition, because I don't think they can make extremely strong claims about the biological role of these neurons and the circuit in which they are embedded, the breadth of interest beyond the immediate field is still relatively limited.</p><p>The authors have identified multiple types of &quot;Janu&quot; neurons with specific anatomical and neurochemical properties (e.g., GABA, AstA). These neurons all control thirst seeking, and also other unique (but related) behaviors. The Janu-AstA neuron is argued to synapse with and signal to NPF neurons. Focusing in on the key data in support of these main claims, I am only mildly convinced. The strongest phenotypes they observe are always with the broad drivers (e.g. Durstig-Gal4, which has widespread expression through the brain), but once they home in on a split-Gal4 combination with very selective labeling, the phenotype effects of activation or suppression are very small (e.g. Figure 2J-K or the new optogenetic activation experiments in Figure 5E). For some experiments, they revert to using the broader driver, such as the GRASP with NPF neurons using R65D05-Gal4. Unfortunately, this Gal4 line is expressed in a mass of neurons in this region of the brain (Figure 2S1A), so it's not clear to me that a positive GRASP signal really reflects synaptic contact between Janu-AstA neurons (somewhere within the R65D05 pattern) and NPF neurons. As mentioned in the previous round of reviews, the baseline phenotypes of controls is variable (e.g. in Figure 3I and Figure 3S1A VGAT RNAi experiments, there are many fewer flies on H2O compared to those with Gad1 RNAi in Figure 3J). The authors somewhat dismissed this concern by arguing that this may reflect variable environmental conditions and water deprivation treatments of flies of experiments on different days (and they only compared assays run in parallel), but this remains a concern for me. The n of several assays seems rather low (6-7), so it's not clear if they did all experiments of one type on a single day. In any case, questions linger as to how robust some of their results are.</p><p>In response to the original request to examine the physiological response of Janu neurons to water deprivation, the authors have used the TRIC sensor, a measure of long-term changes in neuronal calcium. This is not yet an extremely widely-used reporter, and I suspect requires careful controls to be able to interpret properly. They observe that one of the Janu-GABA neurons, but not any of the other three Janu neurons, displays increased TRIC signal upon water deprivation. This is interesting, but I find it puzzling that it should so selective, given that all of these neurons are behaviorally implicated in thirst seeking. I'd be interested to know what TRIC signal would be observed with a broad driver (e.g. Durstig-Gal4); is the single Janu-GABA neuron the only one that would have a significant increase in TRIC fluorescence? Water deprivation presumably induces widespread physiological changes in the brain, some of which may be direct sensors, and others show indirect activity. Ultimately, I don't find the new data so compelling in revealing this neuron to be a special sensor of thirst. (I appreciate more acute measurements of physiological activity are beyond the scope of the current work).</p><p>Although the authors have streamlined the figures, the reader is still directed to the many ancillary experiments in supplementary figures, now often with little explanation (e.g. Figure 1S1A-B, are only obliquely referred to in the text as &quot;Neuronal activation and inactivation experiments uncovered additional behavioral roles for neurons in the Durstig pattern&quot;, and I don't fully understand the results in these panels). There is still an awkward transition at line 99 from the behavioral characterization of thirst-seeking to the screening for neuron populations promoting &quot;seeking behavior&quot;; ultimately, I find the Durstig-Gal4 neuron data almost impossible to interpret given its widespread expression pattern. On line 127 they say that &quot;subtracting R65D05 neurons from Durstig reduced activation-dependent water-seeking, indicating that the water seeking neurons in Durstig and R65D05 are the same&quot;; this is true, but there is still substantial water-seeking behavior implying there are other seeking-promoting neurons in the Durstig pattern. Are these Janu-GABA neurons or others not characterized here?</p><p>As this is a review of a revised manuscript, and as I believe the authors have gone as far as they can in the current revision, I do not propose further experimentation, as I believe a decision should be made based solely on the data now available.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, Landayan et al. characterize two pairs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons (called Janu) involved in orientation behaviors toward water following water deprivation (called thirst here). One pair of these neurons is GABAergic (Janu-GABA), while the other is producing allatostatin A (Janu-AstA). The anatomy, projections and role in the behavior of these neurons is dissected in detail using a host of approaches and genetic intersectional approaches. By manipulating the activity of either of these neurons, the authors show that Janu neurons motivate flies to seek humidity but that they are not promoting drinking. They also confirm earlier studies showing that motivation to search for humidity are antagonist to food searching. These results are new, interesting, and also puzzling because they indicate that the activation of only a few interneurons has a profound influence on complex behaviors, the authors suggesting that these neurons are linked to motivational states (like thirst).</p><p>While the experiments and the results reported here seem sound, the paper is difficult to read for those unfamiliar to the field. The starting point of this study is the use of a simple behavioral test to evaluate the aggregation of flies next to food or water to screen a library of Gal enhancer trap flies (InSite), while activating the corresponding cells (using TrpA1 and heat). They find one enhancer-GAL4 mutant called Durstig (thirst in German), which is particularly attracted by food and by humidity when the corresponding cells are activated. From the description of this behavior (ms lines 99-110), it is not clear if Durstig neurons are only involved in the attraction toward humidity or also toward food odors.</p><p>In a first step of their research, the authors further used this behavioral test to evaluate if other genetic constructions could reproduce the behavioral pattern observed in Durstig&gt; TrpA1 flies. Only two of these constructions reproduced the water-seeking pattern of Durstig flies. One is described as the &quot;NP883 pattern&quot;, but this pattern has not been further compared to Durstig neurons. The second is called &quot;R65D05 pattern&quot; which was shown here as including Durstig neurons responsible for humidity searching.</p><p>In order to narrow down the Durstig neurons responsible for thirst-related attraction behavior, they used Gal80 constructions to subtract out neurons with various neurotransmitters. Finally, the authors were able to narrow down the neurons responsible to the attraction to 2 pairs of neurons characterized / defined by a split-Gal4 construction called Janu (again meaning thirst but this time in Estonian). According to figure 2G, this construction combines R52A01-AD and D65D05-DBD. It is thus not directly related to Durstig, except that activating the Janu cells induces the same behavioral phenotype related to humidity attraction and thirst.</p><p>What is next described in the paper is a thorough analysis of the Janu neurons, ie their anatomical location (in the adults), and the finding that two are GABAergic, while the two others are expressing allatostatin A. They also characterize their function and role in the behaviors studied here.</p><p>As compared to the first version, the ms is much improved and easier to understand. Besides the factual results shown here, it represents a very interesting work illustrating top-notch genetic strategies to identify neurons responsible for specific behaviors.</p><p>A general sketch of the Janu neurons, summarizing their role in thirst, and their relation to feeding, etc, might be useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors use an unbiased screen for neurons that contribute to feeding behavior to identify new circuits that affect thirst. Some of these neurons are GABAergic, while others release the neuropeptide Allatostatin, and they connect to the NPF-positive neurons previously implicated in hunger sensation. The interplay between thirst and hunger is complex and a better understanding of how these neurons interact with sensory and motor components will help illuminate how flies balance these conflicting motivational drives.</p><p>The authors have clearly made a good faith effort to address the issues raised in the initial review of this manuscript.</p><p>There is an enormous amount of work presented, and there is the potential that it reveals neurons that contribute to appropriate behavioral responses to hunger and thirst. Understanding how neural circuits function to regulate choices between essential and competing drives is a really important area of research.</p><p>But I remain very confused. There is still no summary diagram for either the (known and new) neuronal circuitry or the interaction between the motivational drives. The brief flow diagram of the response to thirst helps a bit but does not really clarify. Some neurons seem to be able to induce a motivational state (or the behavioral response associated with it) while others are partially but not completely required for an appropriate choice between eating and drinking? I think the Janu-GABA and Janu-allatostatin neurons are different populations, but I am actually not sure.</p><p>The figures are very dense and intermix feeding and drinking behaviors, activation and inactivation experiments, and different sets of neurons. The combination thirst response and place preference in figure 5, for example, makes no sense at all.</p><p>The anti-VGAT staining seems to label the entire neuropil, which makes the co-localization with some of the Janu neurons very difficult to interpret. The allatostatin colocalization is similarly confusing.</p><p>This manuscript still needs a major overhaul to make its contributions to thirst circuitry interpretable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66286.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

While the authors may be commended for wrestling with a complex story and for being open about all of the data even when it is hard to reconcile with a simple model, in the end the insights need to be distilled more for public consumption. In current form, the paper is extraordinarily difficult to read and difficult to follow, in part due to the complexity of the methods. There is a large number of different types of behavioral assays (with flies in different internal states), and many different driver lines are presented as the authors home in on those that form the central novel findings (i.e., Janu neurons). (B) The huge amount of data masks the main messages of the paper.

(C) In general, the data on thirst is stronger than that on NPF and feeding, so the thirst conclusions should be emphasized. One suggestion is to describe the original identification of Durstig neurons as thirst-promoting, then how a subset within that was identified as critical and Allatostatin-A-positive, and then demonstrate that this subset promotes thirst as a drive, suppressing the hunger drive. With a serious organizational revision and streamlining of extra data into supplementary figures, the findings should be clearer and much easier to convey. Some summary schematics could help significantly, particular accompanying the Discussion section. For example: one showing the proposed circuit, and a another showing the nested/Venn diagram of Durstig, Janu, AllatostatinA+, and GABA+ neurons, (maybe including their respective GAL4 targeting reagents).</p></disp-quote><p>A. The manuscript is completely rewritten and completely reorganized. In addition, extraneous data is removed and new data is added as detailed below. Briefly, we de-emphasize the process of isolating the individual thirst water seeking neurons to a single figure, and we now focus on their characterization. Moreover, we completed additional experiments to make each thirst neuron characterization follow the same logical path and to be more complete. The main story presented in the original manuscript remains valid, however new data allows us to make stronger and clearer conclusions about the role of each interneuron in thirst and hunger.</p><p>B. We removed extraneous experiments, moved many others into supplemental figures, and added explanatory diagrams to help guide the reader. We think that the main figures focus clearly on thirsty water seeking. Moreover, the emphasis is not on finding the neurons but instead their characterization.</p><p>C. We emphasize the conclusions on Janu-GABA, Janu-AstA, and the relation of NPF to Janu-AstA. Our findings for NPF are now clearer with the addition of new data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. (A) One problem than runs through the manuscript is that it remains formally unclear whether the phenotypic differences observed upon activation/inhibition of populations of neurons is due to the difference in their individual roles or to the difference in the magnitude of activation/inhibition. (One might be activating a lot of neurons that have the same role in water seeking and thus the phenotype is stronger than activating only a subpopulation of those neurons).

Some of these issues need to be addressed experimentally and certainly in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>A. This issue is largely resolved by focusing our characterization on individual neurons (Janu-GABA, Janu-AstA, and AstA receptor expressing NPF neurons). It is also resolved by focusing on water seeking almost exclusively, and only testing for feeding behavior at strategic points.</p><p>B. RNAi experiments were done with previously characterized RNAi transgenes (for example, AstA receptor, but true for almost every RNAi transgene used in this study, as documented in the Results and in Table S2), with distinct RNAi transgenes targeting the same gene (for example AstA), and targeting different genes that are expected to affect the process in the same way (for example Gad1 and VGAT to decrease GABA synthesis).</p><p>C. In new data, we placed the mutants (all previously characterized in the literature) in trans to small deficiencies and validated the loss-of-function behavioral effects. The mutant alleles were outcrossed to the genetic background strain prior to behavioral testing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Many of the issues above could be addressed by physiological experiments (calcium imaging or electrophysiology), which would potentially make it easier to appreciate the function of individual neurons. For example, a simple question is whether Janu-AstA and Janu-GABA neurons respond to water vapor and/or water contact? We appreciate such experiments are probably beyond the scope of a reasonable revision. But in the absence of this, extra care should be paid to both establishing the specificity of the genetic perturbations, the resulting phenotypes and in interpretation of the results. As the quantity and complexity of the work makes extraction of a compelling central discovery of broad general interest difficult to appreciate, major revisions should concentrate on marshalling and presenting all the best evidence to arguing for and documenting the identification of thirst-promoting central neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We used TRIC to demonstrate that both the Janu-GABA neuron and NPF neurons are activated by thirst. Neither Janu-GABA nor Janu-AstA are activated by hunger. NPF neurons are previously shown to be activated by hunger. Nor did TRIC identify any effect of water vapor or water intake on Janu neuron activity in thirsty flies. However, it is possible that TRIC may not have the appropriate sensitivity to detect these responses, and therefore we excluded this negative data. We also collaborated with the lab of Tom Clandinin at Stanford to test for GCaMP6 responses in Janu neurons with optogenetic activation of Ir68a humidity sensing neurons, but we were unable to detect any signal in either water replete or thirsty flies.</p><p>We wish to emphasize the current complexity of measuring thirst-related neuronal activity in flies, due to the effects of hemolymph osmolarity on thirst circuitry, as shown by Kristin Scott’s lab at UC Berkeley: The dissections needed for imaging impact interstitial fluid composition and so thirst neuron activity. The level of expertise needed to perform these experiments is quite high, and it is beyond the means of my lab (at an R2 university that is only 15 years old, three neurobiology labs total at the university, a graduate student-driven lab, and this project is a new direction for my lab that was funded off of my start-up funds). Through collaboration we will be able to conclusively address neuronal activity using in vivoin vivo real time activity sensors with 3-photon microscopy or similar technology, where imaging can be done with intact animals. However, at the moment this is out of our reach.</p><p>Finally, we had an optogenetic device built expressly to address if flies prefer activation of Janu neurons, and we now report that they do. This adds a new functional dimension to our findings and provides a more accurate description of Janu neuron function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The title and the summary are misleading, as the Janu neurons described here are not only allatostatin producing but also GABAergic. Perturbations specific to Allostatin/Janu neurons form only a relatively small part of the entire analysis, which ignores that other Janu neurons are GABAergic. This should be explicitly clarified. Similarly, in the abstract the phrase: &quot;allowed us to uncover the neural basis.……&quot; is a bit of an over-statement (perhaps &quot;a neural basis&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>The title is updated to reflect our main findings.

Perhaps the best example is characterization of ITP as an endocrine regulator of water homeostasis from the Nässel lab in PLoS Genetics (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1007618). Here, the authors characterized the role of ITP in a variety of behaviors related to thirst and hunger. How they differ from us is they started with a peptide previously implicated in ionic balance, and the majority of the manuscript uses a pan-organismal driver to knock down ITP and assess phenotypes. Thus, we do not yet know if ITP functions in the same or different cells (or which cells, neuronal or otherwise) for water vs. food ingestion. By contrast, we de novo identified individual neurons that regulate specific steps of thirst representation through specific transmitters and modulators. We show functional connectivity between the Janu-AstA and NPF neurons for reciprocal regulation of water seeking and feeding behavior.</p><p>2. A second example is the regulation of thirst and hunger through the ISN neurons from the Scott lab in Cell (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.06.046). Here the authors performed a neuroanatomical screen to identify the ISN neurons that they show promote food intake and inhibit water intake in an osmosensitive manner. This paper is an exceptionally well-done characterization of a single set of neurons, yet they describe no circuit connectivity, no neurotransmitter/neuromodulator for the ISNs, and test a very narrow range of behavioral characterization (food and water intake).

This is in contrast to providing new characterization of previously described neurons that is more common in the literature of the circuitry of behavior (for example, the mushroom body circuitry or the P1 neurons in courtship and aggression). Indeed, even those well-characterized circuits still give up new information for their function, so completeness is relative (see also limits of ITP and ISN characterization in the previous comment). Our work provides a clear basis for new studies on thirst and its relationships to other internal states, and the specific behavioral steps that compose it.</p><p>Most surprisingly, the Janu neurons we characterize can simultaneously antagonize competing states like hunger through interactions with NPF neurons. In the mammalian literature, thirst can suppress feeding behaviors. The neural mechanism is executed by glutamatergic neurons in the subfornical organ and are critical for this thirst-dependent hunger suppression (Zimmerman et al., Nature. 2017, Figure S7 CD), however the hierarchical wiring between thirst and hunger neurons is only beginning to be constructed and is an active area of research (Gong et al., Cell. 2020). We hope that our work will shed light on the fundamental characteristics of one type of thirst neuron (Janu neurons) and provide an entry point into the discovery of even more thirst neurons that may work in a parallel or redundant fashion, in concordance with homeostatic neuron functionality (Betley et al., Cell. 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have identified multiple types of &quot;Janu&quot; neurons with specific anatomical and neurochemical properties (e.g., GABA, AstA). These neurons all control thirst seeking, and also other unique (but related) behaviors. The Janu-AstA neuron is argued to synapse with and signal to NPF neurons. Focusing in on the key data in support of these main claims, I am only mildly convinced. The strongest phenotypes they observe are always with the broad drivers (e.g. Durstig-Gal4, which has widespread expression through the brain), but once they home in on a split-Gal4 combination with very selective labeling, the phenotype effects of activation or suppression are very small (e.g. Figure 2J-K or the new optogenetic activation experiments in Figure 5E).</p></disp-quote><p>Specific reduction of either GABA in Janu-GABA (Figure 3J) or AstA in Janu-AstA (Figure 4H) strongly inhibits thirsty seeking, indicating their critical role in the behavior. Thus the critique of “strongest behavior in the broadest driver” is limited to the activation experiments. Why the reduced activation (TrpA1) and inactivation (Shi) effects in 2J-K may be due to weaker driving of these dose dependent heat activated tools), however we note that the results are significant. The Janu-GABA and JanuAstA neurons are clearly critical for thirsty seeking.</p><p>Milder behavioral phenotypes are commonly observed with split-Gal4s. For example, activation of single glutamatergic mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that tile the horizontal lobe will induce avoidance. However, manipulation of multiple groups of glutamatergic MBONs results in a stronger and synergistic avoidance phenotype (Aso et al., <italic>eLife</italic>. 2014. Figure 4). It is possible that JanuAstA is one type of AstA neuron (or non-AstA neurons in R65D05) that can promote water seeking. We also note that Janu is a weaker Gal4 driver for the Janu-AstAs than R65D05, assessed by myristoylated-GFP expression levels, so it may simply be Gal4 driver strength.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For some experiments, they revert to using the broader driver, such as the GRASP with NPF neurons using R65D05-Gal4. Unfortunately, this Gal4 line is expressed in a mass of neurons in this region of the brain (Figure 2S1A), so it's not clear to me that a positive GRASP signal really reflects synaptic contact between Janu-AstA neurons (somewhere within the R65D05 pattern) and NPF neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>GRASP between Janu and NPF was technically impossible because NPF-LexA and R52A01-AD reside in the same attP40 landing site, and the GRASP halves are located nearby in the genome on the second chromosome. We tried and failed in making triple transgenic recombinants with GRASP to make Janu/NPF GRASP possible.</p><p>We agree that positive GRASP signals between Janu-AstA and NPF neurons would be explicitly clear, however we have provided orthogonal lines of evidence that argue Janu-AstA is pre-synaptic to NPF neurons:</p><p>A. These are AstA-positive directional GRASP signals between R65D05 (presynaptic) and NPF (postsynaptic) neurons. While R65D05 does contain other AstA-positive neurons in the SMP, the location at the extreme medial aspect of the SMP is Janu-AstA exclusively. We can provide immunohistochemical evidence.</p><p>B. AstA in Janu-AstA neurons promotes thirsty seeking (Figure 4H).</p><p>C. AstA-R2 is required in NPF neurons for thirsty seeking (Figure 6D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As mentioned in the previous round of reviews, the baseline phenotypes of controls is variable (e.g. in Figure 3I and Figure 3S1A VGAT RNAi experiments, there are many fewer flies on H2O compared to those with Gad1 RNAi in Figure 3J). The authors somewhat dismissed this concern by arguing that this may reflect variable environmental conditions and water deprivation treatments of flies of experiments on different days (and they only compared assays run in parallel), but this remains a concern for me.</p></disp-quote><p>We argue that our approach may be better, albeit more variable, than those in prior publications studying thirst in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Thirst is a linearly graded state that is read out by the intensity of seeking (Figure 1D, see also Pool et al. for intake; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.05.006">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.05.006</ext-link>), so the absolute amount of water deprivation can vary in a range without compromising the results. Other labs that studied thirst typically take the flies to a fraction of lethality to ensure similar deprivation between experiments. We chose a more naturalistic and intermediate deprivation because it is likely that flies invoke emergency pathways when nearing death, and we specifically wanted to study thirst.</p><p>Moreover, we provide genetic controls for all experiments to distinguish differences in water seeking within an experiment.</p><p>Finally, biological variability between experimental controls is not uncommon in these types of behavioral assays. For example, in a similar ‘seeking assay’ using 24 hour food deprived flies, ‘control food seeking’ can ranges from 40-80% (Tsao et al., <italic>eLife</italic>. 2018. Figure 2,3,4,6, 7, 8, 10, 11)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The n of several assays seems rather low (6-7), so it's not clear if they did all experiments of one type on a single day.</p></disp-quote><p>We will amend the Methods to reflect that all experiments were done across multiple days. This approach to animal behavior was instilled into the senior author (Wolf) through training in the behavioral mechanisms of alcohol inebriation in flies, where day-to-day variability is much greater and is routinely factored into the experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In any case, questions linger as to how robust some of their results are.</p><p>In response to the original request to examine the physiological response of Janu neurons to water deprivation, the authors have used the TRIC sensor, a measure of long-term changes in neuronal calcium. This is not yet an extremely widely-used reporter, and I suspect requires careful controls to be able to interpret properly.</p></disp-quote><p>It is well-used and well-vetted in the literature, including but not limited to:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1706608114">www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1706608114</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-019-0515-z">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-019-0515-z</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.07.001">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2018.07.001</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54229">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54229</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.04.009">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2019.04.009</ext-link></p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22441">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22441</ext-link></p><p>Our use to measure internal state-dependent neural activity (longer time frame neuromodulatory events) is consistent with its prior uses.</p><p>We showed that the Janu-GABAs respond to thirst but not hunger, indicating that the reporter is not responding in some non-specific manner.

We propose in the discussion that the Janu-AstA may be regulated by thirst below the detection limit of the tool. Alternatively, the regulation may be at the AstA-R2 receptors, with Janu-AstA providing a tonic signal. The latter mechanism is mechanistically analogous to sNPFR regulation by starvation to tune sensory input (https://doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.08298).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'd be interested to know what TRIC signal would be observed with a broad driver (e.g. Durstig-Gal4); is the single Janu-GABA neuron the only one that would have a significant increase in TRIC fluorescence? Water deprivation presumably induces widespread physiological changes in the brain, some of which may be direct sensors, and others show indirect activity. Ultimately, I don't find the new data so compelling in revealing this neuron to be a special sensor of thirst. (I appreciate more acute measurements of physiological activity are beyond the scope of the current work).</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that Janu-AstA promotes thirsty seeking of water and suppresses feeding behavior, and therefore is a critical neuron in the representation of thirst in the brain. That we can subtract nearly all water seeking from Durstig with R52A01 and R65D05, that we can subtract nearly all thirsty seeking from Janu with either Gad1 RNAi (Figure 3J) or AstA RNAi (Figure 4I) speaks to the importance of these neurons for thirst representation. AstA RNAi also strongly suppresses thirsty seeking from Durstig and R65D05 (Figure 4S1 DandE). The specificity for the seeking aspect of thirst strengthens the argument that it is not due to the creation of a competing drive (i.e. it is a thirst neuron).</p><p>The question of how many neurons change activity in thirst is fascinating: we predict widespread circuit activity, due to the multiphasic nature of thirst behavioral responses, and the interactions of thirst circuitry with other brain systems, as was recently demonstrated in mice (http://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6437/eaav3932). Building tools to functionally capture and then manipulate these patterns will be crucial to future complete understanding of the parsing of internal and external sensory cues to select and carry out the appropriate behavior.</p><p>Our narrower scope approach is typical for behavioral assignment advances, while the scientific field designs functional approaches to determine the causal role of all the neurons (and glia) regulated by a state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the authors have streamlined the figures, the reader is still directed to the many ancillary experiments in supplementary figures, now often with little explanation (e.g. Figure 1S1A-B, are only obliquely referred to in the text as &quot;Neuronal activation and inactivation experiments uncovered additional behavioral roles for neurons in the Durstig pattern&quot;, and I don't fully understand the results in these panels).</p></disp-quote><p>This was an apparently bad decision by the senior author (Wolf) to leave in some of the earlier but confounding data from Durstig (1S1A-B).

Subtracting either R52A01 or R65D05 from Durstig decreases Durstig water seeking (Figure 2A, 2D), and thirsty seeking is readily blocked with inactivating the Janu split (Figures3J and 4H). We can add statements to ensure clarity. We included the subtraction experiments (and others) because they demonstrate that we isolated the Janu neurons from the Durstig pattern, and therefore are drivers of the original water seeking phenotype. There may be additional thirst neurons in the Durstig pattern.

One pair of these neurons is GABAergic (Janu-GABA), while the other is producing allatostatin A (Janu-AstA). The anatomy, projections and role in the behavior of these neurons is dissected in detail using a host of approaches and genetic intersectional approaches. By manipulating the activity of either of these neurons, the authors show that Janu neurons motivate flies to seek humidity but that they are not promoting drinking. They also confirm earlier studies showing that motivation to search for humidity are antagonist to food searching. These results are new, interesting, and also puzzling because they indicate that the activation of only a few interneurons has a profound influence on complex behaviors, the authors suggesting that these neurons are linked to motivational states (like thirst).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the experiments and the results reported here seem sound, the paper is difficult to read for those unfamiliar to the field. The starting point of this study is the use of a simple behavioral test to evaluate the aggregation of flies next to food or water to screen a library of Gal enhancer trap flies (InSite), while activating the corresponding cells (using TrpA1 and heat). They find one enhancer-GAL4 mutant called Durstig (thirst in German), which is particularly attracted by food and by humidity when the corresponding cells are activated. From the description of this behavior (ms lines 99-110), it is not clear if Durstig neurons are only involved in the attraction toward humidity or also toward food odors.</p></disp-quote><p>We will clarify by focusing on Durstig as a starting point to find the thirst interneurons, dropping our additional characterization of the pattern. The Durstig pattern likely contains multiple neurons that influence a variety of behaviors, including but not limited to thirst and feeding behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a first step of their research, the authors further used this behavioral test to evaluate if other genetic constructions could reproduce the behavioral pattern observed in Durstig&gt; TrpA1 flies. Only two of these constructions reproduced the water-seeking pattern of Durstig flies. One is described as the &quot;NP883 pattern&quot;, but this pattern has not been further compared to Durstig neurons. The second is called &quot;R65D05 pattern&quot; which was shown here as including Durstig neurons responsible for humidity searching.</p><p>In order to narrow down the Durstig neurons responsible for thirst-related attraction behavior, they used Gal80 constructions to subtract out neurons with various neurotransmitters. Finally, the authors were able to narrow down the neurons responsible to the attraction to 2 pairs of neurons characterized / defined by a split-Gal4 construction called Janu (again meaning thirst but this time in Estonian). According to figure 2G, this construction combines R52A01-AD and D65D05-DBD. It is thus not directly related to Durstig, except that activating the Janu cells induces the same behavioral phenotype related to humidity attraction and thirst.</p></disp-quote><p>Subtracting either R52A01 or R65D05 from Durstig blocks Durstig water seeking (Figure 2A, 2D), thus the Janu neurons are in the Durstig pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is next described in the paper is a thorough analysis of the Janu neurons, ie their anatomical location (in the adults), and the finding that two are GABAergic, while the two others are expressing allatostatin A.
